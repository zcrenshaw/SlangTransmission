"I would go with ""my body, my rules"". "
"Do whatever you can to keep your son from being circumcised. It's not your fiance's call to alter (some would say mutilate, and I don't necessarily disagree) his son's genitals for no good reason. 

Once your son has grown up he'll be able to make up his own mind about it. Don't let your fiance take that choice away from your son."
Yes he's playing with you and the reason he's probably keeping it secret is that he's too old to even be with a 17 year old. You should get away from him. Being legal doesn't make it right.
It's not like tragedy occurs at a time that's convenient for everyone involved and it's not like OP really has to do that much for her dad beyond giving him patience and love. The idea that he's asking too much by showing grief is kind of a terrible way to look at a family member who is going through one of the hardest things they'll ever experience in life.
"People have the right to withdraw consent at any time. She was no longer consenting, and he continued. She SCRATCHED HIM and said no in a loud voice.

There is no ambiguity here. None at all. "
I think this may be it
"If you really cared about Kim, you would've never let Sarah back into your life. Learn from this experience for the future."
"Listen man, you may feel like it’s your fault because you didn’t say no, but you were not in the right mind to consent to anything this chick was doing. Male rape is a very real thing and she used your inebriation to her advantage. I want you to know that you’re not alone and a lot of other men have gone through this. It’s not ok and wrong in every aspect. The way you told your girl the morning after and how you couldn’t go through with it is very telling about how it was really played out. 

The only bad decision you made was trusting your friends and that girl to make it home ok. If your girlfriend doesn’t forgive you, that’s ok, she doesn’t have to because there are so many reasons for her to doubt you now. I just want you to know that none of what that girl did was right in any form and there are still people who support you. "
It's stupid because he clearly doesn't want to be in a relationship with you (otherwise he's have presumably have that conversation) and you want to play house with him. Don't keep sleeping with him. Both of you need to get it together - figure out your financials and a child support/visitation/coparenting plan. 
"&gt; This is why I'm worried about an abortion for her sake... If she gets the procedure will she resent herself? How will she change? I've read some articles online claiming that pregnancy abortion can cause serious mental issues in both woman and fathers. I don't want her to hate herself.

Yeah, well, my biological mother took her own life because of post-partum depression before my first birthday. Pregnancy is much more dangerous.

I'm sorry that you are upset, but it sounds like she is not ready for this child. You have already voiced your opinion to her. She needs to make her own decision.
. But trying to figure out how to get her to postpone the abortion? You need to *BACK OFF.*

Least accurate username of all time?
No. I think saying “Sorry I flaked on you the other day. But lately I’ve been feeling like you have been flaking in me and it hurts.” Is a better start. 
You have an eating disorder. You are starving to the point where you can't do things you love. Please look for help.
"&gt;  it's not even close to looking at pornography

This is one of those sentences that is correct, but in completely the wrong way."
"You are NOT crazy. Not at all. You've figured out what he's doing way earlier than a lot of women do. You're trusting your gut now, which is always the best action to take. Well done!! Check your phone and computer for tracking software, change your passwords, and chuck this dude in the bin. "

"Child of a doctor here: in order to become a doctor, a person essentially sacrifices their 20s and often part of their 30s. It’s a grueling path; for many people, it’s just not worth it. My mom’s specialty allows for more home time than others. Even then, she is on call 2-3 weekends a month and works 60+ hours per week. Growing up, she was unable to do certain things with us as she needed to be accessible. It also meant numerous nights of lost sleep for her. To be in a relationship with a doctor means you need to be flexible and understand that they will prioritize their careers over their own health and happiness. That’s just how they’re wired. "
"I will admit, I really don't get this notion of adding an extra adult to the relationship to solve  problems. To me, that's not that far off the ""Maybe a baby will fix things,"" mentality. "
"If your wedding was scheduled on the bear's birthday, would his family make you change the date?

Generally, it doesn't seem to be the kind of thing that would cause issues, but you'll want to explore issues like above. Does the family acknowledge that it's strange but go along with it, or do they insist its normal? Will they be upset when you don't buy the bear a Christmas gift? Or does reality eventually trump the bear?"

"I agree with all this. OP could also add that when he suggests sleeping with other women, it seems like he's trivializing that aspect of her sexuality, like maybe it's not ""really cheating"" if it's other women. OP doesn't see it that way at all."
"&gt; He promised me he didn't angry jack it to her either 

I mean, surely this ought to be the least of your concerns. The guy kept open a revenge porn account for 3 years. During your wedding, that account existed. While you were giving birth to your child, that account existed. For your entire life with this man, he's been sitting on that account, seething about his ex-wife, and idly deciding whether or not to post the porn. Which, incidentally, he's been hanging onto for 3 years. Whether or not he jerked off to it is so far down the list of problems here."
"But even if he's attracted to you, he's allowed to choose his values--whatever they happen to be--over sex. There are loads of people in the world who I find attractive but wouldn't fuck if they asked me."
"Well, or if she'd said, ""hey, I really don't love the beard, would you mind shaving it before I came down?"". Like, I feel like that's fine and reasonable, but why start out at ""I'm driving myself home if you don't shave it"" - like, why go in guns blazing?!"
"So much this, op!! I was in a similar situation when my ex cheated on me with his (and my former) coworker and ended up getting her pregnant. I was already battling depression associated with bipolar disorder. Thank god I had a lot going on at the time (summer classes &amp; full time job) or else I really don’t know how I would’ve done it. I hung out with my cousin a lot and she didn’t ever even talk about him with me except for at first and that honestly was extremely helpful, if you have any close family or friends surround yourself with them. It takes a long time but as this person said just focus on keeping yourself moving and eventually you will know when you’re finally ready to move on. Don’t push your recovery too fast. "
"You arent being honest with yourself here. What, exactly, did you intend by inviting your ex, who ""wasnt feeling good"", to come to your empty house? To comfort her? To help her feel better? To be a shoulder for her? None of those things are appropriate to do with a fresh ex when you are in a new relationship."
"In the moment people tried to make it a tragedy...the people that had cut him out because he'd been an ass. People were tripping all over themselves saying they should have reached out more blah blah blah. 

As I've gotten older I've really embraced the idea that he created all of this himself. It's a natural and healthy consequence. And I have no regrets. Also, as I became a parent myself, I see his actions in a worse light than I did at 18. Parents should never damage their kids for their own egos. That's some seriously evil shit.

"
"\&gt;  This is why I'm worried about an abortion for her sake... If she gets the procedure will she resent herself? 

Right, for HER sake, and totally not because you're selfish and entitled \&lt;/sarc\&gt;

\&gt;  Right now, I am trying to figure out how to postpone her getting an abortion immediately 

If you actually cared about her AT ALL, then you wouldn't dare try to take control of her like this.

You came to this advice forum seeking advice, and that's exactly what you got: ADVICE. If it wasn't what you wanted to hear, then that's your fucking problem. "
he's ruined it himself 
"&gt; From there he took upon himself to coach me how to act in order to be less cringy and therefore enjoy life to its full potential. 

Dump this condescending asshole and date someone who actually likes who for who you are. You're only going to be miserable trying to put on an act so he ""approves"" of you. Fuck that. Life is too short. You shouldn't have to change your personality to please this guy. Frankly, he sounds like a vapid idiot. 

&gt; he told me that if someone says something that I disagree with that I should just keep quiet and not ruin fun for everyone else. 

You called him stupid? Well, this idea is fucking stupid. Not as stupid as the emoji thing, of course (is he for real? Because that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard). But as a woman, I take offense to the idea that girls should sit there and smile and not rock the boat. Also, it's pretty funny that he's allowed to criticize you and call you ""cringy"" but when you criticize he gets his little feelings hurt.

Giving you a list of ways to behave is what's cringy here. Like, full-body cringe. This guy sucks. Find someone better. "
I already know the answer to this one. Lol. So many promises from him in the beginning and nothing has happened since. 
"Pregnancy is very taxing on the body, it literally affects every aspect of your life. My friend just learned that her pregnancy might have brought back a disease that could shorten her lifespan and she was under constant care of great doctors for the whole process. I think you need to be honest with her. You need to tell her, that pregnancy might be something that's just not possible for her. Is she going to stop treatment to give birth and die shortly afterward? Is she going to risk the child's life taking chemo while pregnant? You need to share your worries not necessarily in terms how long she is going to live, but try talking about various scenarios that could happen. 

And try to discuss different options with her. What do you think about surrogacy, for example? Adoption? It's very hard, but she can't live in dream world forever. If you find a different solution to having kids, she will also have a chance to fulfill her dream of being a mother. Maybe it won't be like she wanted and imagined, but it's better than lying to oneself."
It seems like the same mental wiring that makes abuse victims return to their abusers. Some people just can't be alone.
"It's okay to need and want to sleep in the same bed. It's also okay not to. 

Plenty of couples actually do sleep apart for various reasons. Someone needs a firmer mattress. Someone needs more space. Someone's a very light sleeper and the other partner snores. Someone needs the room to be at a very particular temperature with a very specific amount of white noise. Etc. 

My parents usually only sleep in the same bed when they travel. My mom's more comfortable in a recliner due to some back problems she has.

I have nights where I want separate bedrooms because my husband's an aggressive sleep cuddler. (Meaning, he'll chase me across the bed in his sleep and I wind up on the edge and have to elbow him to get him to move back to his side. I wake up sore from being in such a cramped position.)  

I'm hoping getting a King bed eventually will help this issue. :P 

If sleeping apart doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. You should be up front about it and that you're considering ending the relationship because it's such an incompatibility. 

I do think it's odd that she refuses to even try it. One night, even. Does she know this is verging on deal breaking territory? If she did, she might attempt to try it and see how she feels.

That said - is there a compromise in this situation? Examine your reasons for wanting to share a bed. What else might satisfy that desire. "
"&gt; Go out to eat, bday parties, camping etc and be able to talk to them and just be there for each other.

These are all things you can do with friends that you make your family. I would suggest finding close friends instead of authority figures.

&gt; I just wish I had parents to be around and talk to. 

Of course you wish that. I wish my mom didn't have BPD and beat me constantly. But we don't always get dealt the best hand and it's important to accept, grieve and cope -- not to try to pretend like it's different."
"OK, but the point still stands. If he knew he hadn't had sex with anyone else, regardless of your stance on infidelity, it would still behoove him to ask because he would know he wasn't the source of the clap and that would leave...you. So the fact that he hasn't asked is kind of a red flag."
Agree wholeheartedly!
"He said she wasn't bigoted or racist at all. So I'm pretty sure she'd be absolutely appalled at the behavior of her parents. 

And regardless of a ""she would have done..."" scenario, she is not here for us to spend any more time wondering about it. They are *his* kids and he is doing the right thing by giving them a choice to drop the racism and have a relationship or to remain bigoted jerks and have no contact. They have all the power here and chose to let the kids go by the wayside."
Also they can so easily fix that problem. Change the air conditioner filter!
Considering her mentor and the reputation of engineers... he’s not wrong to voice that concern.
"One quibble: I would suggest a unqualified (""damn you look hot"") rather than a compliment with a mitigating factor like ""for a mom of two,"" otherwise it can come off as a backhanded compliment or a neg. (And I think wife will be especially sensitive to this since she seems to be struggling with her looks and confidence right now.)"
Try pipl.com to search if his email is tied to any public accounts. 
For a relationship that is not even 4 months....I would not take that risk to be honest. 
"The best is when they start the ""Oh, you think that chick is hot?"" game on some broad who is so not your type, but because he thinks she is, you should automatically be into her. Like, yeah, those IG models are objectively pretty, but I just want the number to her nail salon, not those claws anywhere near my snatch."
Guess her username checks out then
"Honestly it doesnt sound like he really respects you. You've made it clear you're not interested in being shared yet he keeps at it cause he's sexually interested in it. The issue has little to do with your bisexuality - no matter what your sexuality is the second your partner starts consistently and constantly pushing for something you've made clear you're not interested in, it's a huge red flag that shouldn't be ignored. He is constantly trying to cross an established sexual boundary.  Please take this seriously as it's reflective of his character and value system."
"Are you sure you aren't doing something that is turning your coworkers against you? It sure sounds like that's the case... If it's something ongoing you'll have to change what you're doing to get along. If it's a one time incident then you'll just have to make amends in some fashion, bringing in yummy baked goods can help."
You were lucky that woman came to you. Your boyfriend does not deserve your forgiveness.
The cynical part of me thinks they want you to have her cat for now only to have you somehow involved in her life.
You deserve someone who's all in with you. I'd end it. 
THIS! I wish I could upvote twice. 
"That’s because it’s an excuse. He doesn’t want to say “no I don’t want to have sex”, so he makes up a reason why he “can’t” - because you haven’t shaven. It’s completely unfair and puts the blame on you- but it’s easy for him. "
"Sounds to me like they don't like you and your brother pushing back against their authority. The new adopted kid is less likely due to things being better than before. Also treating him will be an ago massage for them. They can justify it to themselves as having spoiled you two. For practical advice I'd try to be as independent of them as you can, which you aught to be doing at this age anyway. Though it may be hard work. The less you need them the less control they have over you. Try to keep relationships civil, especially with your adopted brother. If you have a decent bond with him it will be harder for them to start a clean slate with him and it turning into team you&amp;bro vs team momdad&amp;adoptbro."
"OP please read this, it's a super overlooked yet crucial subject."
"I know divorce is often cast as a bad thing, especially for kids in the situation. But it is SO MUCH BETTER than staying in an unhealthy/unhappy relationship. Yes, you are selfish for keeping your wife around when you don't love her really, and it's gonna hurt both her and your kids (and you!) long term if you don't divorce now. Your kids will use your relationship as an example for theirs- do you want that example to be a loveless, unhappy marriage fraught with cheating?"
"Of *course* it hurts!  You did nothing wrong, you took the man at his word and you got fucked over.  **There was nothing you could have done.**  People are perfectly capable of being assholes all on their own:  you don't have any super powers that somehow compel this.

So, yeah.  Send him a brief text telling him that you're breaking up with him and then go no contact.  Block him everywhere.  He wants you to be Teh Bad Guy and take on all the guilt of a break-up, so he probably won't fuss with you about your decision...although you can never know.  He may very well pop up in the future swearing up and down that it was all a horrible mistake and he wants a second chance, which...no one has time for that."
"&gt; I know it partially my fault

No, it's **entirely** your fault. It seems to be a habit among some posters to barely mention crucial details like this, in order not to draw attention to them. A bit like when someone briefly says they snooped into their partner's private life, then spends the rest of the post complaining about what they found.

You can't just hide this stuff, and pretend it didn't happen. You brought the subject up, he didn't.

He's entitled to strong feelings about his 'ex'. She's his ex, with whom he had a close relationship once and about whom he probably cared a great deal. This was someone important in his life. The end of a relationship doesn't necessarily mean that one partner stops loving the other. No\-one should have to tell a 31\-year old woman that.

But the fact is, she's still his ex. You're his 'now'. You asked who he'd be with if he wasn't with you. But he **is** with you.

Just accept that he's allowed to have a personal history, and whatever feelings go with that. And if you can't deal with it, then don't ask such bloody obvious can\-of\-worms questions."
"Oh your story makes me feel better, though I'm sorry you had to feel this way too. So I'm not crazy! He comes home and immediately kneels by the puppy going ""Yes i missed you! I love you too! Yes i do!"" And eventually he realizes I'm in the same room watching the two of them, and he reluctantly walks over to kiss me hello before turning back to the puppy. I remember how he used to be with me, like if I came home later than him, he would wait for me by the window and then prank me by deadbolting the door or something as I tried to get in. He barely notices whether I'm home anymore "
"It's truly not. When you were a little girl didn't you dream of getting married to a man? Didn't you have crushes on handsome actors? It's the same with gay people we just like the same sex. I had dreams of marrying a woman. I would have crushes on female actors. And because my parents were loving and supporting I didn't have any issue in saying that I'm gay. 

Why won't you get your daughter therapy?"
"oh god, get out now before it gets worse."
"I thought that my STBXH and I had made a joint decision awhile back, as a couple, to move to a large city that we agreed was acceptable. I had been offered a fantastic job with great benefits. He had zero intention of ever moving, which I discovered after moving there first (secured an apartment, which he refused to be named on--I stupidly ignored that red flag). 

Long story, short, this pending divorce can't move along enough. Fuck him in the face...with a folding chair. You need to make your own future, carve your own path, and ask him how important your career path is. 

Good luck!"
"This. Unless op is willing to really put her foot down and show her husband that there are serious consequences to his all round shitty behavior, it's never going to change. People like him have to be allowed to hit the rockest of bottoms before they realize they're shitty behavior IS effecting them and they have to change.

And if he shrugs it all of and doesn't change, well, then she can really see her priority in his life. It's up to her at that point if she just rolls over and takes his screaming and stomping all over her or ups her ass and leaves. "
"This is definitely sexual harassment. You should contact an attorney to discuss your options. If anything you want to protect yourself in case he gets whiff that you aren’t happy with his behavior and decides to retaliate against you. His behavior is not appropriate at all and you need to be firm about putting an end to it. Next time he says something sexual, tell him “that is an inappropriate and unprofessional comment. You are making me uncomfortable.” "
I doubt it. She seems to know a lot about her own body and the female reproductive system as a whole. 
"You need to go. Call hospice for additional support and go. Your gf sounds understanding and she should be for this. A major, incredibly traumatic event is occurring and you need to be there for your kids and for her. "
"She’s awful for doing this because I have no one else. No dad, she controls my grandparents, she’s so violent they’re 100% afraid of her. it’s sad "
"I mean, some people want snacks outside of 9-5, I don't think that's that crazy."
"She's made up her mind, and a vacation with a friend is not an unreasonable thing to do, even if it's a friend you don't like. 

You need to let this go. Doing any more will make it seem to her like you are trying to control her. That's not a good place to be."
"I’m commenting again because I’m very concerned with how many posters are trying to invalidate your feelings.

Spouses cheat, why is it so far fetched that this is what could be happening? I have personally witnessed someone do exactly what your wife is doing and she cheated on her husband. It was a new job, new coworkers, and a new night life that she thoroughly enjoyed but never thoroughly involved her husband in. 

She went out for “just another night out with her friends” and ended up cheating with one of her guy friends. 
Her husband had literally the same concerns that you have right now OP. 

I’m on your side dude, you aren’t uptight, you love your wife and you’re concerned because you’re noticing inappropriate changes in her and she’s not being transparent.  I side with you. "
I had an ex who did this. I ended up breaking it off. 
I dont think OP said that they accepted the gift. If anything i think it was implied that be didnt based on the reprimanding that he did.
"OP, he at the very least got a blowjob from that woman. I think deep down you know that he cheated on you but you'd rather focus on what the cousin did so you don't have to face facts."
"I agree her future shouldn't be compromised, but she is being unprofessional as well."
"Dude, the student made one overt pass at OP and then backed off. She hasn't done anything but ""make eye"" at him since then. I don't know why you and everyone else are so convinced this is going to escalate. OP shouldn't be stupid, but neither should he run out and buy a crank's evopsych book so he can make himself paranoid about a student who has a few months left as his RA. There's no indication that OP is interested in the student, or interested in cheating on his wife. Unless he is, there's not going to be any poaching."
"Exactly and since he is leaving for university in a few months and is 17, it is real hard to start enforcing boundaries at this late of a date. This is why they say you are never friends with your children. 

For the record when I went off to uni and came home for the summer my parents still had rules and expectations they enforced while i lived at home. Even if i had all that freedom at school when i was home i had a curfew. "
Can you get a second computer? 
"Then he needs to take the unreliability of the subway system into account. 

Also, he doesn't get to drink, much less get drunk, anymore. 

Yeah, I know, the U.S. is Puritanical blah blah Europe blah blah. The fact remains that this is the law of the land. He can get into legal and other kinds of trouble for being drunk. As a 17-year-old, his impulse control is not great and his gonads are doing a lot of the thinking for him. In case you were wondering what was thinking when he brought home a larcenous drug addict, he was thinking about someplace to deposit his sperm, like most 17-year-old boys. Furthermore, as a minor, the shit he gets into is going to be yours to pay for. If he conceived a child with Ms. Cracky, that would be your problem too. 

I am all for a certain amount of free range parenting and in fact that is how I raised my son. But whenever he did something with real health or legal implications, I lowered the boom and explained why. He learned that if he wanted to have his sweet, sweet freedom, he better not come home after a certain hour, he better tell me what he was up to, he better not get himself impaired, and I better not be getting any phone calls from the police or the angry parents of a pregnant girl. 

He is probably a smart, resourceful kid to a large extent, but you still need to do some of the thinking for him. He won't die if he doesn't get drunk or get his sexytimes in. A little frustration does wonders for a kid with some growing up to do, as does a course correction administered at the right moment. "
"Well, it shows your GF's lack of judgement when it comes to parenting decisions. After a year or so, you should have just been MEETING her daughter, not moved in and disciplining her. "
"&gt;my parents are absolute saints

And your parents, or at least mom, already knows. She's probably just waiting for him to come out on his own, but she likely already knows. It may be better, if everyone is accepting, to just let him know they know. He's better off growing up knowing he can rely on his family to back him up, than remain scared/doubtful that they won't once he confirms his sexuality with them.

You don't have to dilly dally and wait for him to say it, just rip off the bandaid and let him know.

You can also post to r/askgaybros and they will tell you the same, if the family is accepting."
"&gt; My friends are just saying ""oh no, that's awful"" but they don't seem that phased because they all really like him and think he's really cool. I mean, everybody loves him because he's very talented and sensitive and kind, but he cheated, right?

So now you're learning who your friends are and who your Friends are. People will brush off a lot of poor behaviour when people are charismatic. I mean, that's how he got you to carry his arse for years here. 

He'll come back when he has a bill to pay OP. Be strong then and tell him to f right back off."
"This girl is an absolute piece of trash. You can do much better, let the two homeless lovebirds have each other "
"Omg no. Don’t give them another chance. They are lucky if you let them see your daughter with you there. 
I’m no professional and don’t know your parents but to me it rubs the wrong way. Could it be that they are addicted? I mean they drink during the day. The moment they get cash (from you) they go out and spend it on alcohol. It sounds like they need help. "
"In isolation, it wouldn't be alarming. In context, it sounds like textbook ""I've convinced myself this bad behaviour is just the price of admission""."
"Fat chance, if he can't quit today - he won't quit when you have kids.

He's simply moving the milestone down the road so he doesn't have to deal with it now - that's how addiction works.

"How come your mom is the one that needs to order your new Social Security card? What IDs do you have on hand? Do you have a passport? If you have a passport you can get the new SS card on your own. If you don't have that, then can't you just do whatever your mom did to get those documents reissued when you had that done to get your licence. 

Also, you can just do a credit report and see if there any accounts open under your name to see if she's committing financial fraud with your information.

"This post is reminding me of that ""What's a dick move that you haven't gotten over?"" AskReddit post a few days ago.

&gt; At this points I want absolutely nothing to do with her or her wedding, I do not plan on attending. And I’m tempted to go no contact with her entirely. This is not the first time she has been rude and inconsiderate about finances and other things. Any advice would be appreciated, am I overreacting? 

Nope, not overreacting at all. Definitely agree that you should nope out of anything to do with the wedding. And definitely use it to test the waters of noping out of the entire relationship, as you will definitely be steering the relationship in that direction by skipping outon her wedding."
Wow you wouldn’t answer a question your husband asked? Immature af

Stop giving them money. Spend it on a nicer day care. 
"Sorry longgggg update: 

So I wrote this post as I was going to bed and I’d like to say thank you to all the responses. I read them all. 

For clarification: 
-We’ve been together over a year
-when I said rough around the edges I more so meant this is pretty much his first serious relationship where someone is actually telling him you have to plan for your/our future and not just date me. Almost like he really didn’t understand what wanting to marry someone meant(read doesn’t) 

So I’ll do my best not to sound like I’m defending him, because ultimately I’m trying to be objective as possible. I love him yes, but I don’t want that to distract me from real issues when deciding on marriage.

1. Yes I agree absolutely marriage and especially a baby is so off the table for now.

2. The reason why I’m asking for help solving this is because yeah we’re not married and I could bounce but there are many indicators he doesn’t understand what he’s doing. The biggest thing I’ve noticed is before we got together, his family used him big time for the military advantage I guess aka asked him to put things in his name like furniture credit, small loans from the credit union for lord knows what, etc. it was so bad that when we moved into our home his family tried to argue I was taking him away from them and that he’s ‘different’ all in my opinion because I encouraged him to make them respect his money and stop letting them mooch and ruin his credit. 

He’s made hellaaaaa bad financial decisions, however they allllll have his mother behind them. Not that it makes it better - in fact I’m like how do you allow someone to use your money/credit who never pays you or it back - but it does indicate that perhaps he just wasn’t taught, was taken advantage of by family, and now here he is with me and struggling to realize all the problems. 

3. Don’t marry a project - I agree on some level. Never thought I’d be considering being with someone who is so unaware by their financial issues that when I tell them what I read on a statement they are legit confused about what’s factually there. However, I’m not here to force anyone to do anything. If he hears my concerns and does something about it, I’m down. If not, yeah I’m gone. 

4. So we talked. I told him, before saying what I actually knew, that I knew he’s been lying. And I said straight up, if you lie to me again it is a deal breaker and I’m gone no hesitation. 

I asked why he’s been lying, and he admitted he felt like he could fix it before I would even know there’s an issue. I told him how on planet earth are you going to fix it when we have a budget that shows the money flow? And better yet, why would you think you wouldn’t use the best  resource you have right now, me? And most importantly, how would you even expect a marriage to work when you’re over here operating on your own but also trying to be my partner? 

I said these two ideas don’t come together. I told him I want him to figure out what marriage meant to him, and what having kids meant for a marriage. I said you may think you love me but the second you decided to hide something and try to deal with it on your own, you had no regard for me or our partnership. Basically I said you’re not ready for marriage doing anything like that. 

I also shared (again more thoroughly) that I didn’t get what I know about finances and planning from sitting around, that I researched and I asked questions and I used my resources, which is much easier to do in the military because there are literally free resources for you to learn whatever you need to.  

He apologized, but talk is cheap right now for me. I challenged him to sit down, write out his short term and long term goals, write what goes into them, and I also told him to come back to me with a full and accurate list of his debts via credit report.

I didn’t say he had to do this, I said the choice is yours, however I won’t be with someone who wants to operate like they are single. It’s either open and honest or nothing. 

So. Did I do good for the moment? I realize some might want me to to just flee. But just in case I wasn’t addressing it all directly, I feel like now I addressed it all very matter of factly and have given him a final chance to show me that the behavior was out of ignorance and embarrassment, and not intentional malicious disregard for our financial  well-being.

"Here’s the thing. Here’s the thing that will make your life much much easier to continue living this lie AND make a little cashola or just satisfaction in general.

Soap.

Flavorings (scents), Vegetable Glycerin, and Propelyne Glycol are ALL major components in producing meltable soap bases. In addition to soybean oil (cheap) coconut oil (cheap in bulk) and all of the other super interesting oils you can experiment making soap with. Take up the hobby and be transparent about THAT. Anything else you can shimmy a lil somethin somethin’ off to the side and make some nice vape juice. Your parents will love your sudden interest in a very old person hobby, and you will probably love soapmaking if you’re into scents and DIY whatnot.

Additionally you can find all this crap on a website like Bulk Apothecary (I’m not plugging it, it’s just what ive found to be cheapest when buying my own junk for glycerine soap.)"

"This 3-4 years mark works on the surface for people who started dating once they were adults. The fact that they have been dating for 6 years, half of that time they were teenagers, ends up changing things, as there is so much growing up and changing that happens between 17-23.

I agree that OP is probably very comfortable in his relationship, because it's all he really knows, but that is in no way a good enough reason to be married to someone."

"I probably should have added an ""/s"" at  the end of my post because I totally agree with you.

It's honestly pretty absurd. They aren't really different. And it's totally understandable that his unwillingness to have sex with her \(except when wasted\) despite a promiscuous past is causing her to feel like she's not good enough/sexy enough/whatever. 

Rather than feeling protective \(which would be, honestly, gross enough as it is\) I would imagine this feels  almost judgy.. like ""You haven't had enough sex and haven't been \~wild\~ enough for me to have 'regular' sex with you.."""
"Oh god. He sounds like my half-brother.  When he starts, just tell that you know. You know everything he’s saying and that you don’t need to be explained to. Be forceful. My brother legit tried to explain to me how I can write a scene in a own book, the scene being one that introduces a main character, and that I’ve already had planned meticulously since **forever**. I calmly explained this to him. Several times. My other half-brother had to step in and tell him to back off, or else he would have kept going. What I trying to say is that you can’t be gentle about this. You have to tell him, in no uncertain terms, that he needs to *back off*. If he doesn’t knock it off, dump him. You don’t need a boy who thinks you’re a complete dumbass."
"Yeah you’re missing the point OP. An introduction to an SO should be slow and paced. The first time I met my boyfriend’s kids we did it in a group. So I was one new adult among people they knew. We showed no affection and didn’t even plan on saying I was his girlfriend but their mom ruined that one for us. It lasted maybe an hour. The next time I saw them was for five minutes. The next time after that was for a quick afternoon trip up a local mountain to get lunch.

I did a lot of research before meeting my boyfriend’s kids and they were 4 &amp;amp; 7 when I met them. Most professionals recommend a short meeting in a neutral location for the first few meetings. No affection for quite a while. And even starting as the new adult among many people they know can be a preferred method. I never found one thing that said to meet the kids and spend one on one time with them the first time you met them.

It was months before I spent any time alone with them. And even when I have it’s been, at most, for maybe 5-6 hours. But that’s rare. And I’ve known them for a year. He and I don’t live together yet. A year in i could probably spend a weekend alone with them now if he had to be out of town but that hasn’t come up.

I think any reasonable parent would be upset their ex let their new SO spend time alone with the kid the FIRST time they met. It’s not unheard of for your SO to seem awesome even for a long time, and yet become a nightmare to your kids. That may not be the norm but it’s not unheard of either. We’ve seen plenty of posts on here to that effect. SO was so great. But now that they’ve met the kids they’re just not nice to the kids.

It doesn’t matter you didn’t mind. It doesn’t even matter the kid was ok with it. For that, I don’t blame the ex for being upset. 

That said, she should be talking about that with your boyfriend. Not you. I think she should have spoken with your boyfriend about how it upset her. Not you. But I do think it not was fair of her to be upset about that. "
"Yeah. It's crueler to string her along honestly. I had a boyfriend like this in college. I was head over heels for him. He did not feel the same but stayed because of guilt or because I was nice or whatever. Finally broke up and it devastated me. BUT, a few years later I met my husband, who thinks I'm the most beautiful, wonderful, sexy, witty and smartass woman he's ever met. Im as crazy about him as he is about me. It got better. I deserved something who loved me for me; you also deserve that too OP- to be hopelessly in love with someone and sure of it. 23 is so young. Just because you've spent a long time together doesn't mean you owe her marriage or anything else. "
"&gt;  If they say ""you don't know what it's like when you have kids blah blah""

My go-to answer to that is ""Thank God!"""
"I would be horrified with this gift if I were your wife, and horrified not just at getting them in an album for myself, but even more horrified that someone gave pictures I hated to other people to keep forever. And that you helped her do it behind my back.

It would take me a very very long time to get over that.  If you know that's a thing that eats away at your wife at the core of her self-esteem, and you are married to her, how could you help to make that happen?  It's such a huge betrayal of her trust. I don't see how she could get past it.

You need to talk to your wife about this, and you need to tell your daughter you are talking to your wife about it. "
"That's because your husband just doesn't have a good point. You just need to make the decision that it's good enough for you, and your husband doesn't get a say in your relationship with your brother. Sounds like it's reasonable to be tentative, but I mean, how could hanging out with your brother some cause you any harm? There's literally zero risk here, since it appears that the only harm he really did you was to borrow money and not pay it back until now, and you're not going to be loaning him anymore money."
Fix your nasty-ass attitude problem and women might be interested. They get one wiff of the resentment and the fact you seem like you think you deserve a relationship over others and run for the hills because that’s the safe and healthy option for them. 
"That’s exactly what is happening and what you are saying and doing. 

That is the sense that a Madonna/whore complex is."
That’s actually pretty funny because it kinda is how he raised us? He left my mom a long time ago and didn’t come back for a while until we all grew up and I think he had some mid life crisis. I am not that close with my dad but my siblings are so I try not to get involved.
"Even if it is true, there are somethings just best left unsaid. And your friend and his wife are terrible people.   Here’s what I would try: you need to do a metric ton of good deeds for your wife. Not suck up acts. Take her out and talk to her about your relationship. You have to renew the intimacy you destroyed somehow. 

I hope she can see around the damage your friend caused, because that’s a deep hurt."
"Your boyfriend would die around my husband and I. We met in rehab and will make off handed jokes about how glad we are that we’re both junkies so we could meet plus tell random (relevant) stories from our time in active addiction. We’re both multiple years clean and sober now, with a beautiful home, two amazing kids, and another on the way. We have nothing to be ashamed of - our past made us the people we are today. And that past included stripping and smoking crack, whattayagonna do? "
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? That is literally kidnapping. Your boyfriend is a total psycho.
There are literally millions of women who you are not in a position of power over at work. Date one of them.
"What the fuck? Youre just looking for excuses to slag this guy off, he apologised and it sounds like he had a stupid moment. Its possible to be a good person and fuck up and say mean things, so long as you apologise for it like he has."
"He is your brother not your husband's. He screwed up and managed to pull his life together. He didn't buy anything back, he probably just did what seemed right to him. He did pay you back. And probably he's very sorry for his past.

It's your decision to make and not your husband's.

Also you don't have to spend all the time with your brother. But not having your brother in your life because he made a mistake, apologized and did all he could to make it better is..well..

I'd give him a chance. Talk to your husband.

Edit: typing"
"She broke up with you. This is not ""a break"". Cut contact and move on. 

One month anniversary, oh dear...."
"I am so sorry for what you've been through. I cannot imagine.  

I am a trans man (born/assigned female, transitioned to male) and I know first hand that there are straight women who are fine being with a man with no penis.  It will be a deal breaker for some women, but being a Leo or wearing camo or not playing guitar can be too.  

I think a bigger concern than having a penis or not is how you are dealing with it emotionally.  If you're (completely understandably) very hung up on the issue, frequently lamenting your loss, expressing anger or jealousy toward those who haven't had to go through what you've been through, etc that is going to deter most women.  

When you're ready it may take a little bit of work, but you'll find a woman who loves you and wants you as you are.  

Ps: you didn't lose your manhood when you lost your penis. I know you know that being a man is about much more than having a penis."
"Have your husband make a list, in writing, of what he wants your brother to do.   If he cannot make that list because he has no clear ideas, then I think there is something more going on in your husband’s mind than “atoning.”   If he cannot make the list and he cannot express what else is going on his mind about your brother, then bring your brother back into your life.  You can meet him separately from you husband.  Your husband had his chances to express what would make things right.  

Your young brother has paid back a lot of money to several people.  It  is a lot of cash for such a young person to save.  Are you concerned about where the money is coming from? "

"I was raised in a religion that values women settling down and having kids right away, so I think I can somewhat understand. 

Don't have a child because of it's what people expect of you. That is completely your choice
 And 17 is very young. You have many many years ahead of you to decide what you want to do (or not do) in regards to children. "
"Well then you're misunderstanding me. 

SAHMs are always at work. Think about that. Even though the husband is going to work, it's something to break up the time. If you're a SAHM, you live in your office. Wake up in the office, get the kids up at the office, feed breakfast at the office...

That alone takes a huge mental toll. "
"I am crying just reading this and I don't know you. I am so sorry that your husband betrayed you like this and that there's so much grief surrounding the births. I'm pretty sure you are suffering from post partum depression. Please do not feel guilty or awful for your feelings, but please get help with the ppd so that you can see the joy in having these babies you wanted, bc I do think you will want them again and the tragic birth is clouding your view atm. 

I don't blame you for reevaluating your marriage. A marriage counselor might be able to help, but I personally could never look at my husband the same if he did this to me.... Bc I can't stand to suffer and I can't to see anyone letting anyone else suffer unneccesarily. Perhaps your husband just thought it was the pain talking and not really what you wanted... But pleading over and over seems awful of him to ignore. 

I do hope you find a resolution soon. I'm thinking of you and sending good vibes your way. Please take care of yourself."

"&gt; I just don't want to spend an evening with him right now

Maybe suggest coffee instead? You'll never get any sort of decent apology if you don't actually talk to him but coffee would be a heck of a lot less time consuming than dinner."
I agree with this. She seems jealous and petty and they likely had/have something going on that extends past typical family relations. 
"At some point, you need to take ownership of your life and start making the changes you want to get to where you need. Do you own your property? If so, maybe it's time to downsize and move into someplace that's more affordable for you or if you have the space, take on a roommate. Continue therapy and find someone more effective if you feel like you're stuck with your current one. At this point, your ex's actions really have no more meaning on your life and what happens now is on you. I'm sorry that you got the short end of the stick in the fall\-out of your marriage ending, but now is the time to move past that onto something different and hopefully better."

He married a second-cousin of our family and both his mother (my aunt) and our grandmother were very against the relationship due to family drama and money issues.

"Support your wife, let her brother know she was a immense amount of groveling to do tp a lot of people. Especially to you. She created drama at your wedding, aren't you insulted by what she did to your wedding and your life?"
"I really appreciate this reply. I think there’s reasons he’s defensive and he’s usually really open about communicating, so I should give it a fair shake and ask him to open up. I know he cares about me and loves me and we have actually spoken about commitment in the long term without the m-word. Dogs, house, etc. there’s gotta be a reason it bothers him and maybe when I bring it up idly he just panics because it’s a sore spot. "
"&gt; Should I take back my question and just give him the money?

Yeah that's gonna be a no for me, dawg."
"Agreed. Sounds like this Sarah has a history of shitty behaviour, enabled by OP."

"Your brother is conning all of you. His little scam is meant to trick you guys into paying a significant amount of money to add a feature to his house that will absolutely increase its value.

 A custom-built deck and carport will bump up his apprasial values. This isn't a gift to your mother; it's an investment. By having your mother live there I believe this allows him to get around capital gains taxes when he goes to sell it. 

Be aware that this is only the first demand. Expect future requests for similar renovations. By the end of it I expect his house will be worth significantly more than what he paid for it, and he will have all the improvements financed by family members he has no intention of reimbursing. 

He's manipulating everyone by presenting this situation as an ""all hands on deck"" quality-of-life improvement for your mother. 

It's absolutely not. Don't do it."
"Context, my friend.

If the friend propositions your married FIL and causes a scene at your wedding and doesn't apologise to your partner and the FIL they sexually harassed and the MIL they tried to cheat on, then yeah, your partner has a right to ask you to cut them out, and a right to leave you if you don't."

Where is your husband in all this?  Does he respect and understand that you need a little distance from his parents?  Is he helpful in coming up with solutions, or has he put this all on you?  IMO, they're his family, he knows them better than you do, so he should be helping you out."
"&gt; Clearly I said I will do everything in my power to not have sex

No you do not. You knew you were horny, and rather than put some distance between you, you asked him to cuddle *knowing you were horny the whole time.* Then you started wrapping yourself around him and taking it further and further. That's literally all your choice, that isn't ""trying your best."" No one forced you to do those things, you wouldn't die if you didn't. You *chose* to exercise poor self control then got mad at your boyfriend because he didn't make your decisions for you, a 20 year old woman.

"...so you think it is reasonable for you to live with your parents rent free, while neither of you are employed, and not do chores? Everyone in the household does chores.  It's part of pitching in.  Why do you feel this doesn't apply to you?

"Look, when you become involved with someone, you have the right to set boundaries. Your boundaries are personal - not everyone would impose the same ones, but that's irrelevant. You've set the boundary that you won't tolerate the silent treatment.

You've told her this, and she clearly understands, and yet has deliberately broken it. It's not a matter of opinion on whether you should go no-contact, it's a matter of your self-respect. Because you can't set boundaries that you've no intention of enforcing, else you're just going to show you're a pushover.

You drew a line, she stepped over it. What are you going to do, draw another line?

The important thing is what you do after you've cut her off. Would you just capitulate if she came back to you, without changing her behaviour, or would you stick by your decision?

That's how you become ""happy with yourself"" - by being true to your core values and not selling yourself out. That way, you don't need others. Be the person you want to be, and you'll attract people who feel similarly."

"It's pretty common to be able to see this kind of situation clearly from the outside but to freeze and second-guess ourselves when it happens to us, especially given how many of us are socialized to feel we shouldn't ""make a scene"" and to take blame onto ourselves.

"Therapy would be good but in the interim, you really need for him to see how destructive what he is doing is.  No relationship can survive without trust.  Every time he starts taking steps towards a future that discounts, devalues and generally ignores your needs is a chip away from that foundation of trust.

You can also remind him that even if he doesn't intend to accept an offer it's a bad idea to be doing this.  What happens if he does get an offer?  Employers gossip and if he's sending out resumes left, right and center but knocks back offers, his reputation will tank.  Word might also get around to his current employer and if there are problems this may exacerbate it.  

Now, if he *doesn't* refuse it, then that's trouble of a different sort.  I hate to say it but given his mindset, he might use the above as leverage to gain your compliance.

OP, just be very aware that you're perhaps being too kind in explaining away his behavior.  It's natural- you love him.  It can, however, cause a certain kind of blindness.  You convince yourself it's not so bad, you're a smart lady and can judge whether you're compromising too much, you can work around it etc. etc.  Be aware of where his mental processes are at but keep a firm eye on the mental gymnastics and compromises *you're* making.  Take the advice from u/Celany to heart.  Perhaps it might seem we're being very harsh but we can only judge by his actions.

Bottom line:  What he is doing is not fair *at all*.

If he can't come to see that very rapidly and then make lasting changes, then there are greater issues that just jobs and possible relocation.  You have to be absolutely certain he sees you as an equal.  That means that he's willing to sacrifice too.  If he can't or won't, then you have some heavy decisions to make."
She’s a coward who cheated on you instead of breaking up beforehand. Don’t let her take up space in your head anymore. She’s not sitting around trying to figure out how you feel and what you’re thinking. Never forget it. 
"Same here. We bought a condo together after we'd been together for a year but weren't even engaged. We looked for places together and made the decision together. If my husband had gone and bought a condo with his mother, I would have felt shut out and excluded, secondary to him and his mother, not like someone he considered his life partner.  OP is engaged to his man and he's shut her out within months of their marriage. He's not thinking of her as his partner. Big red flag."
"He's not building a future with you, he is building a future for him and expecting you to fall in line. Do not marry this person. "
"I really dont understand how engagements like this happen. How does a couple get engaged to marry while having zero agreement on where you are going to *live*?

If even this cant be figured out, how can you trust that you have any sort of agreement on how finances will be handled in your marriage? on if you'll have kids, and if so how many and when?

This is a ridiculous red flag. You need to call off the wedding. I'm not saying you need to break up, but you two are *not* ready to get married yet."
"I live in culturally conservative region and it's not just bros. Both genders seem to take to their roles here. I've seen more than one new wife start being a ""nag"" because she thinks that's what she is supposed to do, and the husband goes along with it because that's what he's supposed to do. Then they tell half-hearted jokes about how miserable they are. The number of fundamentally flawed relationships I see down here is nuts"
"Dude fuck off, this type of trolling isn't funny. It's sad and sick."
"See if they need food delivered to the hospital while they sit with nephew.

See if they need someone to check on pets or mow the lawn, etc.  

You can’t do these things yourself, but you could set them and pay for them.

Make up travel bags for the parents that have a book or two, snacks, etc that they can take to the hospital with them.

It’s hard to help from long distance, but with a little creativity there are definitely things you can do."
"Yeah this job will last her until she’s 30 absolute maximum. There are always hotter and younger women around and it’s not like taking your clothes off in front of a camera is difficult or has a high barrier to entry! After that if she has no professional skills or experience and no college degree, she’s going to have shit job prospects for the next 30 years. You meanwhile are working part time making what you can while you get a degree and skills that will give you a comfortable livelihood for the rest of your working life. Her thinking about this is immature and short-term. 

As long as you are contributing to shared household expenses, she has no right to be hassling you about your earnings. You clearly are hardworking and have a great work ethic yourself to be maintaining a 4.0 while working and student-teaching. You should tell her that if she keeps hassling you about your earning potential and career path, you might tell her some home truths about her own that she won’t like."
"I very nearly laughed out loud on a conference call just now when I read this. ""Oh haha I shit on your floor my bad, you know how mistakes happen"""
"This was my first thought as well.

Then I kept reading OP's post and the red flags continued to fly by.

Seriously, OP: dump him. He is never going to be satisfied. You get the boob job and he's going to find something else about you that's unattractive. You will never be able to please him... And even if you could, he does not sound like someone worth pleasing."
"I would think that ""not enough"" in response to a salary question would make her seem snootier (is that a word?) to them. OP would come off as not impressed by a 7k TV *or* her own salary. I'd suggest ""oh, you know, enough!"" instead. "
"This is messed up.

Why is he so adversarial with you? Thats just odd. Does he know how much day care and baby sitters cost? Cuz maybe you should go back to work full time and he can pay for those."
"You legit sound angry about this....when socializing with your SO's friends is standard practice in a relationship. She cares about you and her friends and wants to have you all around each other. But you sound like you hate that idea and don't want to do it regardless of the setting. I think your problem is beyond just being around drinking.

But if this is how you need to live then you should probably date someone who's social life doesn't involve hanging out at the pub with her friends. It's an incompatibility that is causing resentment, a lot of it, on both sides. Neither of you is getting what you want; I say call it."
"&gt;she can still put him on the birth certificate

Unless Op specifies a jurisdiction we can't definitively say, but many places require the father to sign papers acknowledging paternity or being taken to court to be put on the birth certificate if they are not married.

it is not a unilateral declaration."
"I agree. He doesn't realize and I'm actually scared it's because he doesn't care. I forgot to mention this but my big worry is his feelings about me have changed, or he doesn't want a future with me anymore, or something like that. Maybe I'm reading too much into it. I don't know because I've got so little explanation to go on.

I hadn't thought of couples counseling. I'd be open to it, him maybe. Definitely will ask. I guess his response will let me know how he feels about our relationship right?"
Couldn’t have said it better 
"I think what he wants is for OP to dump him. If this list of demands came shortly after OP expressing her marriage wishes and his first reaction was “I dunno if I want to marry you,” this smells like something he came up with to put her off so much that she won’t be interested anymore. This has “I’m too cowardly to dump you so I’m gonna make you do it” written all over it. "
"&gt; ""You're not wrong. You're just an a**hole.""

Oh, that's perfect.  I have a feeling that if we got her side of the story, you may well have been undermining her, and I don't think your advice is that great-- when I was applying to college, I had no idea what I was doing and just chose them based on what bands were from the area.

But she's completely out of line to talk to you that way and owes you an apology."
"&gt; Why do you want a future with someone so shitty?

Also, why does she want a future with someone she thinks so little of? Marrying someone she considers ""beneath"" her is suggestive of deeper psychological issues"
"Something is fishy here. 

If people are even reviewing it - it means it has some merit.

We all do what we do with our lives. If you're his friend, be his friend and don't be worried about his career success or lack of it. 

His ""crap"" games may inspire someone else in a sincere way. Art is subjective. And it's fucking hard. "
"&gt; about two months in that he admitted he really doesn't like animals at all.

Did he flat out say he doesn't like them at all or is that the conclusion you made from a more lengthy conversation?"
"I wonder if she has a drinking problem and doesn't clearly remember her behavior.  It's not a good sign that her behavior dramatically changes when she's had a few.

I think you have a few options:  You could sit her down privately, when you're both sober, and just kind of lay things out.  Provided you treat her civilly, you're under no other obligations, and it's really odd that she demands more from you.  

I would speak very plainly, and say something like ""You didn't treat me as a friend when you accused me of wanting to break you up with your boyfriend, of hating you, and of not making enough effort with you.  It really bothers me that you expect me to chase you and bend over backwards to make you feel accepted when you don't seem to  accept me or see me as a friend or even a trustworthy person.""

Another alternative is to just walk away when she tries to trap you. ""Susie, it seems like our conversations are never productive.  I'm going to go talk to Sam.""

I would talk it over with her BF first so you can preserve the friendship."
"This works if you’re applying to work at Burger King, not a major tech company or pretty much any other large organization where hiring is competitive."
"Look, I married a man just like this. Saddest part is he never actually loved me until I left him after 15 years of lies, cheating, drama and bs. He fought so hard to get me back, no thanks. Don’t do that to yourself. It is absolutely not worth it. 

Side note, when my ex-husband had a female “best friend” on Snapchat, it wasn’t long before she had a gold heart instead of me, and soon after that I figured out he was screwing her.  He justified chatting with her being acceptable with “she is married!!” Yep, that didn’t stop either of them. 

Find a man who will treat you right. This situation is so unhealthy. "
"&gt;'m at a loss here, for personal reasons this is something that I won't move a hair on 

that's absolutely ridiculous to me, but whatever. It's your dealbreaker. So if you won't compromise on it, and she isn't okay with it. Then I've got some news for you, you're not in a relationship. Or at least one that functions correctly. 

In the future - it may be wise to tell your partner ""hey, I'll never come meet you and your friends and family out for drinks, *ever*"" BEFORE you get into that relationship. 

"
"I felt bad for OP until she got to the parents favoring part and modeling part, like that meant her brother should like her and take her places over her sister. Then I understood why her brother (most likely) does it."
"Could be other illnesses too. Epilepsy or some kind of sleep disorder, for example. "
Considering she mentioned religion she's probably disgusted because it's premarital sex.
"Sounds about right. It's super cool when you're dreaming about it and studying it, then you get in there and realize exactly what you signed on for. 

Also you have a really good point about the networking side of the game"
"Yeah, agreed. It would be a slap in the face to the mother to give in to him after she specifically made her will. "
"Okay, I'm going to refer you to the website LoveIsRespect.org. The information there is from reputable sources, and they have quizzes you can take that might be helpful to you in identifying red flags. There's also a phone line and online chat there, and they won't be pushy or anything.       

You deserve so much better than this, OP. You really do. Take care of yourself. "
"If he doesn't need a suit, then renting a tux is actually the best and most convenient turn of events.

Also I wanted to add...if this is your invite and he's the plus one, then feel free to uninvited him.  But if the invite is from his side, then he can wear what he wants.

I would also tell him that there might be times in life that he is expected to dress appropriately for appearance's sake (funerals, your business networking events, etc.) and that his wardrobe choices taking top priority for comfort every single time signal disrespect for you and other people.  "
"I agree. Freshman year of college dating a high school senior or junior? Sure. By sophomore year, you pretty much have nothing in common with a senior in hs, so those are usually the long term relationships that came from hs. When one of my friends started dating a 16 yr old at 20, we all highly stressed not to. I know the comments say you are manipulative if you date younger, but it could also be you are still young maturity wise. That was his case. He was like 17 inside. They broke up because..just too much difference between 20 and 16 lol and also we were trying to get him to pick someone our age so he could grow in maturity. "
"&gt; Josh actually doesn't have much to do with his parents and doesn't talk to them all that often. Which may be why I don't have a whole lot of history of seeing how they interact with each other.

Then he really fucked up because he let you walk into this mess without any warning at all. "
"&gt; Although his ideas are always great and better than mine

It's not hard for a 20-year-old to seemingly have great and better ideas than a 14-year-old.

&gt; he was adamant that I move in with him which I didn't want to do but ended up doing

So the answer is ""yes,"" you did things you didn't want to do that he pushed you to do.

&gt; but it pushed me to purchase my own place that I didn't tell him about

Please listen to whatever inside of you told you to do that. That caution, or fear, or whatever it is, sounds like it's on the money.

&gt; I don't know. My friends never liked him that much but are corteous. My female best friend who is the same age as me hates him. My parents are neutral.

There's a chance your parents are neutral because they know if they express any disapproval it might just drive you to him even harder. I suspect people are being polite, which is nice, but they might be willing to open up more if you are honestly willing to listen to their perspectives with an open mind."
Yes..See my edit!
I’m glad it all worked out for you. (: It’s so rare to see a happy ending on r/relationships
"Contact your landlord, explain the situation and see if they support you finding a new roommate to add to the lease. If so, do everything you can to find a new roommate as soon as possible. Continue to pay your half of the rent. 

Your landlord has the right to come after both you and your original roommate for any missing rent. If you find a new roommate quickly, you probably just want to pay the missing amount. If not, you can choose to not pay out and let the landlord determine how they want to pursue getting their money, and if they want to go through eviction proceedings. Not the best situation, but simply paying her half may not be the best short-term solution if it leaves you no money for food etc. 

As a landlord, I would appreciate your explaining the situation to me, and I know the risks of renting property, so I would accept a temporary lowering of rent payments if you're clearly taking maximum action and have a plan for catching up on what's owed. But if the property is in demand and I think I can get a tenant quickly, I would probably ask you to move out within 30-60 days. The landlord's flexibility will depend a lot on whether they can keep the property occupied so there are no complete interruptions in rent.

Finally, keep trying to get the missing rent from the original roommate. Once it all plays out, send her weekly bills in writing."
"Um, I live in a REALLY NICE area (I'm stunned we were able to afford a house there, it's so nice) and we also get postcards about new neighbors and real estate values.  Assuming people hate you is going to follow you no matter where you go.  Some of your original post is definitely an issue, but it sounds like you have a lot of ""internal renovation"" to do on yourself as well."
"Guy's a jerk. He plays on your insecurities by saying things like ""we need to talk and if you ask about what I'll ignore you!"" knowing full well that you're going to ask and, whoops, now it's your fault that he's ignoring you.

Please leave this situation."
"this is more than a prank, I would be absolutely traumatized and disgusted and humiliated - she also completely ruined your time at the music festival (and tickets were expensive too I'm sure). If my partner ever did this to me I would dump them in a heartbeat. This is unforgivable IMO, whoever thinks doing this to another person is okay is not worthy of being in a relationship with you. "
"Nope.  It's a roof, with 4 poles or beams usually.   Sometimes they will have a wall or 2, maybe 3 if attached to the house.  Google it.  You can literally buy them on Amazon."

"Where does OP say she 'yelled'? She may not be able to remember word for word but her account seems pretty coherent to me.  All the kids had to do was ask before they took the tablet.  Or ask their mother if they could play with it, assuming they could find her...The situation is entirely on Alyssa and her shitty behaviour.  I do feel sorry for her kids, but OP didn't know she would be handling this kind of situation when she drank at her OWN party."
"I know my reaction was pretty mean, and I already apologized for snapping like that at her. I agree that I need to be less vague with her and I love your idea about responding with ""it's not important""

You gave me some really great advice, thanks so much for reading my rant and giving great feedback!
"
"His life has changed, yours hasn’t. It’s too bad that he can’t see that. You’re not doing anything wrong and he needs to get over it. "
"I think you're handling this well but I want to add that you should never give him access to the money. YOU write the check and send it straight to the admissions office to pay for school. You continue to pay for school if he maintains at least a 3.0 GPA (or whatever is reasonable for his field/school). YOU write the check to the therapist/insurance company to pay for therapy that YOU require him to go to. YOU send the check straight to any rehab facility he attends. All of this help is contingent on a desire to change and improve. Who cares if he sees this as a threat? That isn't how you mean it, you are setting these limits because of his past behavior. Past behavior is the best indication of future behavior, after all. He pissed away all the opportunities your mom gave him and honestly he doesn't deserve a dollar from you, considering what he has done. I think it's admirable to want to help your brother and if he improves and works on himself then you're doing the right thing. If he squanders these opportunities then I think you should tell him that if he decides to get his shit together you will be there to help him. "
Let’s just stick to not categorically shaming an entire subset of people when you don’t know them or their circumstances. Mmmkay? 
What sort of woman would that be?
Is she working from home while watching the kids? Or is there childcare?
"I’m not sure how I’m enforcing the double standard by asserting that it’s perfectly possible to be just platonic friends with the opposite sex, unless this wasn’t meant to be addressed to me. "
Not a legit reason. He can easily screenshot your pics and delete the app. Very sketchy to me. 
"You just broke your wife's heart.   I feel terrible for her.  Youve been having an emotional affair.

I do not see this ending well.  You kinda ruined your marriage by engaging in this emotional affair with a crush from junior high.

You *probably* should have sorted out your emotions and priorities before you said something that will be impossible for her to ever forget.

Just curious, what did you want to happen in an ideal world?  And what did you realistically expect to happen?"
"First of all: it seems very hard on you and your brother to have to endure this while you are both students and are in dire need of quiet time. I can't believe people are saying you are being 'babies' and you are adults and your feelings aren't valid. Being around children is mentally straining, especially if they aren't your own children (and they aren't yours to discipline) and if you are sensitive to noise.

It looks like you have already tried talking to your father and stepmom but they seem to be dismissive of your issues. Perhaps it would be wise to organise just one more sitdown with them, where you explain that although you love your new brother and you want him to feel welcome, it is taking a toll on the amount of time you can spend with the family for the reasons you have explained. Try to do this when everyone is calm and relaxed, so they are more open to what you are expressing and have time to really listen to you. 

Perhaps your stepmom takes it very personal that you and your brother have issues with little bro, and she might see it as an attack on her parenting style. Maybe she's already stressed about being merged with an existing family that she's constantly worrying things aren't going to work out with her and your father. It might be necessary to take away these negative thoughts from her first in order not to have her brush off your concerns. 

Since you are a sibling, you can have some influence on him but it is totally up to you if you want to partake in it. Perhaps when you get home, you can engage with him - maybe propose you do something active play with the family so that you can have some bonding time together and that he gets rid of all his energy before dinner. Or tell him you want to play hide-and-seek: if he doesn't want to be found, he needs to be *really* quiet... lol. That way, your father and stepmom will also be happy to see you spending some time with him and they can see it's not a matter of not liking him."
This is seriously some r/gatekeeping shit
"Well.. do you want to get engaged? If so, then be excited and wait for him to propose! If not, talk to him."
"I'd be concerned, big time. "
"I'm in my 30's now, so I'm not what I used to be, but at your age and into my mid 20's I was smoking, model-level hot. I don't think this is about your looks. I have never had problems interacting with other women; anecdotally, no other woman I've known has either. Do you live somewhere that might be a factor? "
"I think you're shooting yourself in the foot there. If your wife doesn't realize how serious this is, that may be why she's not particularly interested in counseling because things are generally content. Don't you think she deserves to be part of this decision-making process?"

"This is exactly what I thought.

If you enjoy sex, just go back to being FwB.

Its not even 6 months in and he wasnt honest.

But imo, and Im a guy, but would you trust him even to have sex, after he was hiding this? 

"
Yup. Huge fucking red flag. If everything was ok with him then why wouldn’t he be dating someone his own age? Why did he prey on a VERY teenage girl?
"I kinda question your grip on reality as well, so I guess we're even."
"Well I don't know if that means something or means nothing. He could have asked a friend with a Colorado number to send the message for him, so it's still really from him but that way he didn't use his own phone number. 

It could be somebody in Colorado that knows him or knew him in the past. It could be that your bf goes there to stalk this person or just to have sex. It could be a buddy of his. 

Or it might mean nothing that the number is from CO and your bf goes to Aspen sometimes. Ugh, frustrating. The Aspen connection could be a clue, or it could just be nothing. Keep digging, OP, and don't say anything to your bf.  

Edit:  so you never go to Aspen with him?"
"Thank you. :\) I agree\- I care about my relationship, but I truly believe I need to do some internal work for my own peace of mind. I didn't realize just how much I hindering myself by not taking chances, risks, etc. with my skin. It's just hard. :/ "
"Marriage will magnify any existing problems, not alleviate them."
There is no other story and anybody who thinks otherwise is pretty much victim blaming for abuse. This was gross predatory behavior and needs reported.
"You're not wrong to be concerned, but the cops checked. You have verification that this is her choice. That's all info you can be satisfied with, you're not getting any more without damage. Your sister took a very drastic and extreme step, she didn't inform anyone who was a relevant adult, this is deliberate. If you push now, she'll just move further, with fewer connections for you to find in the future. 

Give her some time. Maybe in 6 months, try some gentle pushing with a letter or e-mail. "
Why do you think the trip is for singles particularly?
"I'm in my 40's as well and I have to say that we're way too experienced to put up with this crap. I also live in Portland, and understand the housing market here, but she's being just unreasonable and childish. You tell her that you want a partner, not a parent, and will be doing what's best for you. If y'all got married, it would be what's best for the relationship as well so IDK wtf her problem is."
"If you weren't invited, don't go.  If you want to do something, send a gift from the registry with a nice note instead."
"""He has acknowledged the fact that he has problems with being social, but he doesn't seem very motivated to work on it."" If it is really a big deal to you, then this is the biggest issue. It's not a big deal to him.

It won't get better if he isn't willing and motivated to change it. You've already mentioned it to him, but maybe you should reiterate just how important it is to you. At least be sure you it's important to you as it seems to be though. Maybe he makes social situations embarrassing for you, but does he really even need to be there? He seems to be good enough with your parents, so he makes an effort for important people in your life.

Him meeting your colleagues and coming to your appointments might just not be something you'll ever want to bring him along to, but that might not be so bad. I haven't met my girlfriend's coworkers for example; we just don't care. Again though, if it's important to you then that's fair enough, but he may never be able to be that guy."
"Not full on relationship advice, BUT r/skincareaddiction has truly changed my life in terms of my skin. I struggled with piling on makeup and hiding my face until the sub taught me how to truly care for my skin. It's only been 2 months since I subscribed and took in all the advice and I am a lot more confident in my skin. This may help you a lot!"
"Rent a room somewhere, pack a bag, get everything important to you out of the house. You have to tell her *today*. Get a copy of the guest list, enlist a friend &amp; a family member to notify everyone on your side that the wedding is off. Have someone else contact the venue &amp; suppliers.
Today will be a really rough day, but it still will only last 24 hours. Don’t go through with the wedding, don’t ghost, put on your big boy pants &amp; take back control of your life. A year from now you could be in a miserable marriage or creating the life you want. Your choice.

"
"Well casual sex (e.g. one night stands) is fine, it's meaningless.

Relationships on the other hand involve a lot more and having such a significant age difference such as 2 people aged 18 and 40 creates a huge power imbalance. 

Additionally he 18 year old will have barely any life or proper relationship experience and can be manipulated by the 40 year old very very easily. 

Of course that isn't what happens in all cases but the fact remains that they more experience. I'm in my early 20s and couldn't imagine dating an 18 year old because they'd just be in such different stages in life and have almost 0 life experience in comparison, I just couldn't be emotionally attracted to one."

"My husband makes 4 times as me, yet I have a Master’s degree and he doesn’t.

I have NEVER cared because his salary is NOT a reflection of me, my education, or my abilities.

His salary is a reflection of him and the company he works for, that’s it.

Just because your SO makes a lot of money doesn’t mean he still doesn’t have financial issues.  Does he budget, does he save, does he live with in his means?

You can’t tell him he can’t talk about money if he’s living responsibly.  

I guess I really don’t have advice, sorry.

"
"Could you mention that you had a good career previously but that you always meant to save up money and quit to focus on your art fulltime and are so happy that you have gotten the chance to try it? Also that you help out your family with buisness related stuff too. Don’t tell them how much savings you have. Imply that your savings are from your career. Don’t give a timeline for how long you can try out focusing on your career before your savings run out.

It’s a good story becuse it’s true. It seems like what you wanted and planned for. You’re just not mentioning that the inheritance helped you out, which isn’t their buisness anyway.

Your life plan before and after the inheritance is the same, so focus on that. Perhaps you being uncomfortable with lying is making you a little blind to the ready excuze available to you, as telling the truth minus the inheriance part is a reasonable and believable explanation for your situation. Don’t overthink it too much. Tell the truth, don’t mention the inheritance, and let them make some assumptions and you’ll be fine."
I take naked selfies and don’t send them to anyone.  It’s pretty normal.
"He’s yours. You raised him this entire time and you are his dad. Biologically he may not be related, but he’s still your kid. 

Edit: The legal answer to this is probably different. "
"Im latin and i come from a family of 100+ 
And honestly anything more than 20 is alot. I dont blame you for being uncomfortable in that especially because it is so out of your relm. If you see a life with this guy and theres a promising future ahead. Get use to it. If not id move on. More than likely he will end up wanting a big family maybe not. Either way family gatherings like this are going to end up becoming your norm. When you marry him you marry the whole family."
"There is something else going on here above and beyond a crazy ex. 

If there is no custody arrangement, there is no custody arrangement. He’s the father. He has just as much right to his daughter. Now, if he is such a nice guy and he is well mannered and has no record or anything, any police officer called would surely notice the difference between a guy politely telling the police officer they had an agreement for him to drop his daughter off at 9 vs a crazy woman ranting and raving and screaming. 

I also dont know what makes him think she has all the power here. He could easily file for custody and if he has proof she’s unfit would have a good chance at even be granted sole temporary custody if he wanted it. The judge might think it would actually be really weird if he didn’t go for that if he thinks his daughter is in danger. I think it’s weird he doesn’t do that when he fears his daughter is in danger. Why doesn’t he care his daughter is in danger?

The makes me think she knows something substantial. Something that despite her level of crazy, he knows it would jeopardize a custody case. And that’s only best case scinerio right now, because the other option is he willfully enables an unfit parent and puts his daughter in jeopardy because he is lazy. You owe it to yourself and this kid on the way to find out what that is and what’s going on right now. Because something is seriously not right. "
This dynamic won’t change. You can’t undo what you did and he can’t forget it. You need to decide whether or not you can live with this.

"Five months is insanely early to be talking about marriage. He's still basically a stranger -- a stranger who is now throwing a week-long tantrum because you gave him a perfectly reasonable response.

Be careful."
I think you did not receive a courtesy invite (designed to make you feel comfortable) because you have a habit of making your colleague feel uncomfortable. Contrarians make for good television but your life is not a sitcom. 
Tell your parents and the school. These kind of secrets should never be kept.
"You've been with him 3 months. It seems like almost a month you didn't even see him. It honestly sounds like he has a mental illness, sort of like delusional disorder.

"&gt; Am I being unfair?

You are not kids, and your car is not sweets. Whether you're unfair or not is entirely meaningless in this scenario.

He's obviously a bad driver that you can't expect to take good care of your car. Being able to drive it is also not essential to him in any way, it's pure luxury. He doesn't need to be able to drive your car or he loses his job, for example.

I'm a bit worried about him scratching all those other cars all the time in the past. That is not ok at all. Those random people did not deserve this, did you make sure they had their damages repaid?"
Your brother may have anticipated something like this happening. Glad that despite his upbringing he turned out to be a decent person.
This sounds like minor manipulative gaslighting. You are not responsible for her decisions.
"&gt; He later didn't respond to a text in a timely manner, and I angrily texted that I wanted to end it

yikes.

-
i'd just let it go.  he's not engaged enough for you and youre just gonna get angry again later.

-
if he were posting asking for advice, i think most would tell him ""run away, quickly"".

"
"&gt;Apart from that one screw up, I was pretty chill about everything.   

Fair enough, but angrily texting him that you want to end it because he didn't respond to a text in a ""timely manner"" is one hell of a screw  up. Especially within the first three months of dating! It's like saying ""well, aside from burning the house down I was actually a pretty good baby sitter"".    


Just leave it. He's already told you he doesn't want to pursue a relationship with you and he hasn't responded to your last text. If he's interested he'll contact you, but I really don't think you should hold out for that. "
"Despite less sex and being less affeiconate, we’re pretty happy, we get on great and always have a laugh together, we’ve never had a big argument.

As far as scared of paying child support- he already practically pays for it. As he’s away most of the time he sends me enough money to cover our sons milk, nappies and supplies as such. We got together a couple of months before I turned 18, we lived together for a year then I got pregnant at 19.

I live with my grandparents but we’re considering renting a house because we want a place for ourselves, especially for when he comes back. I’m starting an online university course in October and am currently looking for a job. - I was out of school at 16 because of mental health issues so I was working while we were living together and have just recently finished maternity pay.

Lol, we both like butt sex, but I think he does more than I do- in the sense that I use a strap on on him."
"It sounds like you must know some seriously entitled people, then. "

"Considering the rest of your post history, I don't think you should be dating anyone. Figure yourself out. You are 29, and your post history reads like you're 20.

Figure out what you want and need as an adult, what your long term plans and goals are, and start dating someone who shares these goals and will work with you to achieve them.

If you're not willing to do this, just know that crushes fade. Be honest with your boyfriend and tell him what's going on, if you want to stay with him. By being upfront this is no longer your dirty little secret, and it will go away on its own.
"
That's pretty heavy to come to terms with. You are in an extremely tough situation. Just try and keep relaxed and make well thought out decisions. I reckon your brother doesnt want you to blow up your whole support network over this. It would be smart to keep things chill for the next 3 years and decide where to go from there. Still keep in contact with your bro (he sounds like a nice dude) but hide it from the others.
"Imagine you have a grown child. Now imagine (assuming she's well-adjusted and not irresponsible or burdened with other issues that affect her reasoning) that she tells you she got her dream job, and it is far away. What do you think your reaction is? I think most reasonable people would certainly feel sad about the distance, or even worried about their child's safety being so far away, but also so, so happy that their child has landed their DREAM job, and reassured by the fact that is only for a few years. What most reasonable people would NOT do is say, ""OMG you're killing me! You'll never make it without us!"" So your husband is right - they are being dramatic, and/or they need therapy. Reasonable people are supposed to WANT their children to become independent, happy, fulfilled adults. Reasonable people do not view their adult children leaving home as ""abandonment"" or ""betrayal.""

This is your DREAM, it is just for a few years. You can call and skype and even visit or have them visit you. They're acting like they'll never hear from you again. Maybe you could even benefit from therapy, to examine your family patterns and expectations and to learn what is ""normal"" and healthy, and how to put up proper boundaries and enforce them (it's sounds like you're trying to do that already, but you're starting to falter as their manipulation has got you re-thinking this job, so you could use some help with that, and how to best respond to their guilt-tripping tactics)."
"He's been getting a reaction out of you for some time now, so it'll take awhile to retrain him.

He's almost certainly going to escalate for a bit in his attempts to get the desired reaction.  The less you react, the better.  He'll get bored and move on to something else, eventually.


"
"34 years old going on 14. This is some angry little cousin level shit and he's supposed to be an adult in a relationship.

It's not even the ""boobytrap"" that's the big deal because on its own it was pretty harmless, it's the fact that he's going so far out of his way to handle his frustration in an unhealthy way. He doesn't communicate like he needs to, and because of that you guys are unable to address conflicts or sources of frustration and they're going to build up until they turn into incidents like this. He can be sheepish and apologetic all he wants, but he needs to know the real issue isn't his stupid little revenge scheme, it's that he's being immature when he refuses to talk to his partner about his grievances.

Tell him you need him to open up and voice his displeasure from now on. Assure him that not doing so will only lead to resentment on both ends and situations like the one you just experienced. Tell him that you *need* him to be honest about his feelings going forward, because otherwise you won't be able to trust him. Ask him straight-up ""is there a reason you're afraid to speak your mind?"" Ask the hard questions because they need to be asked.

Also I find it weird he starts the shower after getting into it. I always assumed people started it before then got in once the water was on."
"Yeah, OP sounds monogamous, just unsatisfied with his sex life. Opening the relationship is almost certainly going to end with him falling in love with someone else and breaking up with his GF.

From what I've seen, open relationships only work when both parties agree to them at the start of the relationship. Opening them later on is just one/both of the people involved putting a bandaid on a deeper issue, and that deeper issue never magically goes away just because it's been covered up. It festers and keeps growing larger until the bandaid solution can't contain it anymore."
He's still trying to justify his behavior though. We definitely don't have the whole story and I feel like he's upset that he didn't handle this right versus severe remorse for letting his partner down. Hard to tell either way. 
"The thing is it doesn't even sound like she likes him that much, just enjoys the attention. He's watering the grass on the other side of the fence, but he doesn't know it's just astroturf."
"From her perspective it’s hard to hear “you can’t cook” like everything she’s ever cooked is wrong, and that it’s impossible for her to cook well.

It’s a sweeping statement and they’re hard to handle (like if in an argument someone says “you *always* make me feel bad” or “why are you *always* like this”).

So I’d handle it on a case-by-case basis;

When the chicken is underdone “oops it looks a bit under, let’s put in back in for ten minutes”.

When mash is runny, or the chips mushy, I’d probably either not say anything, or when they’re coming out of the oven give them a poke and say “oh maybe they need five more minutes to crisp up”.

When it comes to seasoning, add your own table salt.

I’d also buy a couple of recipe books (or look some recipes up online) and cook some meals together. If she sees you testing and tasting as you go along, and learns what to look for to know something is done (eg veg will start to float in the water, chicken will be white-through and the texture will change etc.) she should start doing the same when she cooks alone,"
Plus it's not like 18 months is an easy age. Those little shits are just learning how to push your buttons
"If you don't remember breaking your bones, why would your parents? I distinctly remember breaking my wrist as a kid bc it hurt like a mother fucker, swelled to all hell, and I knew immediately that something was very, very, wrong.

It was most likely very minor fractures that neither you nor your parents really registered, which can happen, I wouldn't jump to thinking it was some injuries caused by or inhibited by abuse. Don't make that kind of heavy conclusion without good evidence, it will only bring you heartache."
"My friends baby was born naturally, her nose was broken. It was bruised and swollen. It was so sad to see on a new baby."
I agree. I think therapy will help. I understand though. I feel a little jealous of your sister too! Haha
"&gt; I think I just picked the worst possible time to try and assert myself in this situation. Seems like that’s the story of my life.

If this ""I picked a bad time to do [X]"" is a recurring thing, this is a problem with how observant you are (not) and how well you do (not) read context in situations. It would be worth talking to a counselor about how or why you can learn to be more observant about things _outside_ of your own head and feelings."
"You do realize that going to school provides more than teaching subjects, right? And even if it is just her that has social trouble, doesn't that mean you should adapt to her being different and get her some socialization? I don't see why she can't be in school just because her reading and math is above grade level, schools will find the right classes for her.

You also talk about her like she's a predator. You might be alienating her yourself."
You're going to have to tell her. Don't let her ruin your wedding day with her kids antics. Make sure she knows she's expected to remove them from if they start acting obnoxious. 
"It's not about the timing.  It's not about your concern for your sister.   It's about the fact that your girlfriend was completely insensitive and out of line.  Don't pretend that either one of you sat down with your sister and said ""hey, we love you and are worried about our family's history of heart disease, and want to know if there's anything we can do to help you"".  No - it was just a crack about her weight at a moment when she was already feeling frustrated and vulnerable.  Let me tell you, that's pretty much the best way to guarantee that you're going to send someone into a downward spiral.  Your girlfriend owes your sister a sincere apology."
"For me, a lack of ability to adult was exactly that: extreme depression, anxiety, and adhd. It wasn't until agoraphobia reared it's head that i got medicated. I still need therapy, but I'm trying. 

I am constantly ashamed at how bad I am at life. "
Your boyfriend deserves better then you. You're obviously attracted to the other guy more. Do the caring thing and give your boyfriend the chance to find someone that actually is attracted to him and cares for him instead of has secret feelings for someone else and seems to just be tagging the boyfriend along
/r/maliciouscompliance is calling :P
She will file a suit regardless. Talk to your lawyer about the visa and be prepared to explain it in the visa interview if the topic comes up. 
I did not say ops sister has the right to dictate who can and cannot visit the apartment. I only said that she has every right not want to be around ops gf in light of what happened. 
"I do personal styling, and it has a huge effect on how people perceive you, so I second all of this.

How is your hygiene? Is your hair visibly greasy? If you have a beard, is it cleanly shaven with little on your neck? Having a neck beard will not help. How frequently do you get a haircut? 

A crisp haircut (and shave) on a man can be useful in this situation - if it looks overgrown or is touching your ears, it may look as if you are waiting around for a caretaker to notice and cut it for you. It can be useful to have a reoccurring, scheduled haircut every six weeks.

If you wear flip flops to work (which I would not advise) are your toenails cut and clean? How about your fingernails? Do you have body odor? 

If you are depressed, it can be hard to pay attention to all these details. I suspect there may be other issues at play here. Could your mental health need some support? You’re worth taking care of. "
She’s actually come out and said she feels objectified.  Could you spend a bit more time connecting with her on a mental level?  Touching her casually for the pleasure of physical connection without the expectation of it elevating to sex?  
I felt that way at 19 but not at all by 21. 
"Sparklers are safe to be around any child who is old enough to understand ""don't grab the sparking bit"", which I would assume your daughter should know at 8 years old. 

Unless your daughter is planning to wear a feather boa or something, I think sparklers in the cake would be fine."
The fall out of this will be better than a marriage that will end in divorce and misery. 
Do you go out for one-on-one drinks with casual acquaintances of the opposite sex in order to get to know them better before they've met your boyfriend? Seems blunt but that's the literal question at hand.
"I’m 28 and I saw this happening a tonne when I was a kid. On cakes and also we’d just hold them in our hands. It never caused any problems at all? They just sparkle for a minute or so and then go out. 

Honestly I’m not sure what the issue is here. "
"Threads like this make me very sad as a father of two daughters. After my divorce, their bond became stronger. They are inseparable now and rely on each other. You can be that for each other. Being a sperm donor, doesn’t make you a good father. Being supportive and offering unconditional love is. It’s his loss!"
"Dude, those who stare and feel up guys arms ""In amazement"" are *not* insecure!

I'd ask her why she did that, and perhaps more importantly, what it means..not so much for her, but for your relationship.  Let her know it makes *you* feel insecure and see what she says."
"Quite easy break up with her in my opinion. She will leave you to first man with money that shows some interest to her.  
Honestly, I'd break up with her after this her saying that you're not a real man. It is so stereotypical and disrespectful that I can't even advocate it."
That's real. People going through internal self hatred are the absolute meanest and cruelest people ever. Be very careful OP. 
We had a guest write 'me and my girlfriend' above the 'will attend' box when he didnt get a plus one.
Burn that bridge to the ground.
That is not a small thing. It's an unfair and unreasonable request for him to dictate what you wear. He tries to make you feel bad about it and coerce you into changing how you are to make him feel better. Controlling and insecure - you should not be with someone who will not allow you to be yourself. 
"Thanks for your reply.

This is exactly my problem... she still is my mum after all this. But since she’s moved to Spain my life has been markedly easier. Your right my life is SO much better without her.

It’s hard to quantify what I’m feeling. But thank you for your frankness."
"The reason your daughter is physically acting out is that she has an adult role-model in the home who does the same thing. With her bad temper and physically abusive habits, your wife is teaching your child that violence is an acceptable coping skill. All your daughter is doing is applying the techniques that she has been taught by your wife. 

I think it would be better for your daughter to be in a stable, non-violent single parent household than a volatile and dangerous two parent household. You say you're already working with therapists and social workers: do they know about your wife's violence? If not, they need to be informed immediately. Your daughter is going through a LOT right now: being grabbed and shoved by a parent is terribly traumatic, as is witnessing one parent abuse another. If the therapists don't know about this, they can't help her find healthy ways to cope. "
I feel the same way. It's really hard to summon the words to express my shock and distaste.
"&gt; He knew me before we started dating...

It's amazing how people feel they can give advice without even paying attention to what OP says."
That was a very dramatic response. Your projecting your insecurities or whatever issues onto my comment. Watch all the porn you want! I really couldn’t care less. I just wouldn’t date you. Boohoo.
He remembers. End this now.
"How long have you been together? And how long have you lived with him? Why exactly are you living together? Was moving in with him your only option?

This relationship is dangerous and his abuse will likely escalate. Honestly, you need to get out, whether that's asking your classmate if you can temporarily stay with him or going to a shelter. Normal 28 year olds have no interest in a relationship with a teenager; your boyfriend is a predator who wants a girlfriend who is naive and will tolerate his abuse. "
"There’s no straight answer. The past should always be the past, but if you see a future with this guy then you have a right to know anything in the past. If you genuinely see a future with him, make that a point when bringing it up. Especially if it’s something leaving you uneasy and if you have a good relationship and communication it shouldn’t be an issue for him. "
"My grandma always said ""once you cross a bridge, it is easier to go over again,"" does cheating in the past mean 100&amp;#37; he will cheat again, no. But it does bring up a lot of moral questions for his current partner. It sounds like he completely knew that his business partner was married. "
"Based on what he described it wasn't cheating, he was raped. You should contact RAINN and look into getting resources for him. Cheating requires consent, if you are drunk and someone takes advantage of you and uses your intoxication to have sex with you that is rape. "
if someone ghosts you after 1 date that you didn't have sex with them. then they did you a favor.  You would not want anything to do with them long term
"&gt;Right now, I am trying to figure out how to postpone her getting an abortion immediately so she can have more time to think.


Translation; I'm trying to force my gf to stay pregnant, by telling her I want her to ""think long and hard about it"" and by the time she's done, it's too late for the abortion. "
Or he's monitoring her accounts
"Family medicine physician here. It is very difficult to be in a relationship with a physician. I am probably one of the more laid back ones you will find and I still find myself addicted to it at times. It is more than just a job and therefore the people who are drawn to it often times put it before everything else in their lives. Personally, I am lucky now to have reasonable hours and responsibility that allow me to be a mom and wife as well. You can debate how detrimental our attitudes are to our own mental health and probably come up with a good argument that the ways doctors are wired is not healthy. However, it is this same obsession that makes a lot of us good at our jobs. We have tried to balance it for years with work hour restrictions and wellness programs, but unfortunately most of us will put ourselves through almost anything to do this job. It is similar to a military culture and if you aren't happy in that type of relationship, that is completely fine. You deserve to have your needs met too and it just may be that your girlfriend will never be able to do that for you. Medicine might come first for her forever."
Is there any way you can contact her to ask her out to lunch and try to get more details? Maybe she didn’t want to go into detail with him being around. 
"&gt;a danger to you and it's on purpose.

That's the only thing I was thinking if she's changing his routine and environment. He can be seriously injured in his own home, and die on a hiking trail where he doesn't know the terrain.

The brother can't be reasoned with, otherwise HE would've reached out to OP regardless of his girlfriend's controlling nature. He's letting the OP get thrown under the bus. 

OP needs to block the girlfriend and his brother. All communication can go through their dad, like how Jed needs to apologize and not let his girlfriend around OP anymore. She's selfish as well as dangerous. "
"I don’t know what to say except I’m like this too. I’ll date a guy for a month and think they’re absolutely perfect until one day, I’m completely disgusted with everything about them. 

What I’ve realized is that I can’t think clearly when I’m infatuated with someone. I think they’re perfect and idealize them, and once the rose colored glasses come off, I’m horrified to see they’re a regular human being with flaws and not my knight in shining armor.

In some cases, my disgust is justified. Like with my last boyfriend, I initially thought he was this lost soul with so much potential who was just a little rough around the edges. When the infatuation faded, I realized he was a manipulative drug addict and I wish my disgust had snapped me out of it sooner.

Other times, I’ve deeply regretted walking away from relationships with good men for just being annoyed by the person. 

I’m probably going to need to seek professional help if I ever want to have a healthy relationship, but at this point, I’m so exhausted by dating that I don’t know if I’ll even bother."
"Yep, I'm a lawyer. Married to a teacher. We hang out with the teachers more because honestly most of the lawyers I know are faux intellectual dickheads."
"I don't think you'll be able to do much about the mother.  I think it's probably safe to assume that she's eccentric.  Eccentric people can't ""un-eccentric"" themselves.

But you can let your boyfriend know what your boundaries are.  If you don't want to travel with a teddy bear, you need to let him know this now."
"Yea, if my boyfriend didn’t mind sharing me it would hurt"
"This was almost the exact scenario that caused me to pick my stuff, my baby's stuff and leave my own house for good. 

It's been 2+ years and I've never regretted it for an instant. The only difference here is that my ex HAD brutalized me before in a scenario just like yours and swore to never do it again. Well... another outburst on the edge of another beating was too much. Don't wait for that, OP.  Just go. 

If you do stay and he hits you, yes, you will have the upper hand legally with your son. However, if you stay and he kills you, you son loses in the worst way possible. It's not worth the gamble. "
"People looking at porn is pretty standard and not considered cheating.

People going behind their partner’s back and emotionally connecting with others is not normal and typically considered cheating. 

You are in the wrong here. "
"Hey, I too fall into the trap of blaming myself when other people are actually the ones that need to change. Glad I could help

/r/ainbow is lovely and /r/actuallesbians are super welcoming towards bi/pan people. 

At the time i posted you were getting a lot of kind of irrelevant weird advice basically suggesting what you've been doing for the last 2 years. Now you've got some more queer answers to help you with the situation but do cross post if you feel like you want more LGBTQ+ responses."
"Dont you think you deserve better than this guy? By the sounds of it you know what you need to do. But dont let the emotional messages get to you. For all you know hes typing things he doesnt even know what they mean. 
I would cut him out. This guy will never be there for you when you need him to. "
"Okay well you need to let him know that you have been not-invited.  Did he seem to indicate he thinks you are going with the ""we""?  What's your long-term plan here?  Let him pack and arrive at the airport to find you're not on the plane?  

Your boyfriend's mom's a shrew.  So you need to grow a backbone and learn to stand up to her now regardless of how this vacation shakes out.   She will run over you every chance she gets so time to start practicing your impression of a brick wall she will run into instead of a speed bump she's going to run over in her plans to have her son live the life she wants him to."
"I think you should definitely leave if you've talked about boundaries and she's repeatedly crossing them. Not only is she violating your boundary of no sexual nudity with other people, she's also been a poor communicator, which is not good for a relationship. The worst to me, though, is that she sprang this on your friends, who have NOT consented to see her naked or be part of her sexual fantasy. That's really icky to me.

There are places to go for exhibitionists. And she might be able to find someone who's into that once you break up. But it's a dealbreaker for you, and she broke the deal."
"The grossest and most abnormal thing is that it's called ""Hoes"". That's super icky and misogynistic. "
Don’t ever go back to him. He’s a cheat and a liar. You deserve so much better.
"Precisely. If the roles were reversed, people would no doubt call it rape. "
So rape is only legitimate if the victim is willing to report it? 
What’s the deal with everyone talking shit about OP’s sister to make her feel better? That’s not how this works! Her sister hasn’t even done anything but live her best life. 
"Growing up my dad was always my best friend. Then he divorced my mom two years ago and after ending a relationship with a girl basically my age, he is in a 'phase' where he has sex with a bunch of young strippers. I realized he is misogynistic and disgusting, and I want nothing to do with him. "
"I just see her breaking the news and someone clutching their chest and screaming ""I'm coming Elizabeth!"""
"He doesn't really get a say about **her** *name*, it's not his name, their children's name, or their business name. It's *hers and hers alone.* 

He also doesn't get to choose her haircut, shoes, or friends. A name is *even more personal* than those things. 

You're suggesting something on a par with to ""Please think of your grandpa's perspective and feelings when you choose a tattoo."" "
Is there anything good about him? He sounds really unsupportive and immature. Why did you marry him and what do you love about him? My instinct is that you should divorce him and find someone as ambitious and driven as you. 
"That's still cheating ""bud"". Her boyfriend clearly told her it'd be a dealbreaker, he has a right to be with someone who doesn't kiss anyone else.

And what the fuck does the geographical location have to do with anything?"
"You don't want to end it, you don't want to make an effort to compromise... I don't know what to tell you. It seems like you're trying to get *her* to end the relationship so *you* can make her the bad guy.

Wanting you to hang out with her friends isn't ""being a part of every aspect of her life"", it's a common thing you do in a relationship.   
A person is not an island. They are their relationships with other people. "
"&gt; nonsexual physical affection


I think a lot of people don't understand how important this is. Small touches throughout the day go a long way.  This along with a few compliments on a regular basis can make a world of difference. "
"""I'm sorry you took it that way."" Is not actually an apology. It's exactly the opposite of an apology because the word usage does matter, and this is not sincere. At all. It's passive aggressive, and never well received. It basically says ""I'm right, you can't possibly be hurt, and I'm telling you this so you shut up."" It disregards her feelings.

""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way."" Is a more proper apology. It's sincere. It validates that she was hurt, and gives way to explain that you didn't mean to. 

Never invalidate your partner's feelings. Unless you really want to be single.

I understand that because you don't mean it the way she hears it, you don't think you have anything to apologise for. I'm going to take you at your word, and trust you that you're not *trying* to be condescending or sarcastic. Your intentions do matter.

But you see, you're not actually supposed to be apologising for being condescending and sarcastic in these moments. You're actually taking responsibility for your share of a miscommunication. Which is why, ""I'm sorry, I didn't mean it that way"" is way different and more sincere than, ""I'm sorry you took it that way.""

More importantly, something is happening here that you're glossing over. You say a thing and mean it one way, she hears it another. Why is that? Are you simply unaware of your tone? Is she going through a hard time? Are either of you survivors of abuse? Do you accidentally talk down to people? (It's more common than you think.) Do either of you have anxiety? Something's up here that's causing these communication misfires, and it needs to be addressed outside of the situation. 

In a neutral time when it hasn't happened, sit her down and try this: 

""Girlfriend, I feel like we're having a little trouble understanding each other. Sometimes I'll say something that I feel is fine, but it hurts you. I absolutely don't mean to hurt you. Let's talk about how we can better communicate, so we can avoid these mishaps."""
Clearly you have not seen my bicep.
"Park your emotions for a second, and just get re-tested. While it's *improbable* for a false positive, it happens.

It's *highly improbable* that he has symptoms, you test positive, and it's a false positive, but it's still possible.

Get re-tested. If it's positive then the only logical conclusion is that he cheated. There's no getting around it.

Don't have sex with him. Be neutral with him."
"OP this poster is right about your naïveté towards you mom changing. Just read this:

&gt;Even now my mom says she knows what she's done was wrong and she regrets it but she says she wouldn't change it

She is in no way sorry for what she's done. In fact, she really doesn't think she did anything wrong. She is never going to accept that what she did was awful. 

Frankly if I were you I'd start telling all of mom and step dads friends the truth. Those scumbags need to be exposed. 

&gt;Especially if the problem was my bio dad and his mental health problems because he's gone now

That only makes it worse. She abandoned her kid with that guy after she cheated on him. She never even told you he died or give you gifts from your bro. If step dad had wanted to not raise you, your mom would have abs index YOU too in a heartbeat."
"Not necessarily. Some guys are patient and don't mind playing you for sex. Being upfront, honest and communicative sounds good. 


There's no guarantee one way or the other, and being true to yourself is not a bad idea. 


I'd never want to be with someone who would disregard a woman for sleeping with him too early. I don't want to play games. Things can be natural and ok without protocoles and whatnot. It's ridiculous to me"
"the reason that the age rule (don't date younger than 1/2 your age plus seven) works reasonably well is that it keeps the age gap smaller when the participants are younger - so that they are more likely to be in similar life stages. My husband and I met when I was 29 and he was 40, and as noted, we were in similar life stages (both out of grad school, both relatively romantically and sexually experienced, both looking for the same things in a relationship). It's not that a large age-gap relationship like yours can *never* work, or that the older partner is *always* taking advantage of the younger partner, it's just that those things seem to crop up more often."
"for many people, it's not a matter of whether they want to work in these environments. it's just what work they can get. i'm a lesbian and have worked in positions where the people (managers and coworkers) are lovely and i remain friendly with them now that i've left-- but i will never, ever come out to them. and when i was working for them, enjoying the hours and perks and whatnot, i put up with the homophobic shit because i liked the job and couldn't find somewhere less bigoted to give me exactly the same benefits and experience."
"Sorry, but I had to laugh at not being wasteful and showers being limited to 15 minutes.. what is he doing in there?!"
"If you’re not married and young it’s best to keep your finances as separate as possible.  You both need to protect yourselves- ur bf should not be co-signing your loans- there are better ways to build credit.  I would use mint to better manage your personal finances, it’s ur responsibility to stick to it though but u can set up notifications for when u hit thresholds.  I would communicate with ur bf about dividing household expenses- maybe he pays a bit more.  But you both need to learn financial responsibility separately before considering compiling your finances together "
I didn't say to cut them off.  I said draw boundaries.
"Some people don’t understand the effect that they have until it’s put to them in their own language, so to speak. People who shout lewd shit at women are frequently the sort who are only cowed by a similarly aggressive response, one that includes raising your voice and using crude words to put the focus back in them. It’s the only response short of threats that will dissuade them from behaving that way in the future. "
"&gt; so it's very cliquey

I feel like you drastically underestimated the difference between New England and Southern California. As someone that went to school in SoCal and lived there for 6 years, there is no socializing **except** for cliques. You just have to find yours. 

Sports? Particular hobbies? Music scene? California is 100% about finding the group that you fit in with. It's like high school all over again. "
"What is your self esteem like? This thought pattern is often seen in people with self image/self worth issues. They lose attraction when someone shows interest because in their mind, they are so undesirable that anyone who would like them clearly has something deeply wrong with them that makes them worth avoiding."
Nah I think it's safe to assume we got the case closed here
"Yeah, you might be right... I'm gonna hang out with a cousin later today and I think he knows qomething"
"I have two. The first his whole family told me I should get out avd I was to good for him but I didn't listen. He ended up being a manipulative cheater who blamed me for everything. He has since cut off his family but I'm still in contact. 

The second happebed when I was seeing a guy who always introduced me as his girlfriend to guys but never to any other women. I was already on my wa t out of the relationship when he introduced me to his family as his girlfriend. Within three days I was having lunch with his mom as she was telling me that he well use me and suck all the joy from my life then drop me for the next victim. 

I wish my ex husbands mom was kind enough to warn me about her son. But she was to upset over my hispanic last name to be that kind. He had molested his own brother. She told me when I left him over cheating and abuse. Let me know I was better off after the damage had been done."

"&gt; I've read some articles online claiming that pregnancy abortion can cause serious mental issues in both woman and fathers.

This is propaganda disseminated by forced-birth organizations.  It's a neat trick, because it gives men a way to claim they have a say in an abortion because of their ""mental health.""

It is bullshit.  

It is interesting that you don't reference the very real, and extraordinarily well-documented bad outcomes from pregnancy.  Women still die from pregnancy, did you know that?  And of all the First World countries, you are most likely to die in the US.  Pregnancy can permanently compromise her health.  It can, oh the irony!, destroy her fertility.  Pregnancy quite often leads to  PPD, which at its most extreme can involve the mother harming herself and/or the baby.  Then there's, oh, having to have a c-section, which is always fun, and of course the permanent changes to her body.

An abortion?  Just about the safest medical procedure you can have.  Might she have regrets?  Sure.  But then she might regret having a child right now, too.  

See, it's easy for you.  You'll claim that you'll support her all the way, but you won't:  ""babysitting"" =/= helping.  Changing diapers once a day isn't helping.  Helping will mean doing a fuckton of cooking, cleaning and shopping for MONTHS.  Yes, even when you're tired.  Even when you're sure that you deserve an evening gaming.  Your life, if you intend to be a decent partner, is going to circle around the needs of this baby and you gf.  

That's it.  Your social life goes to shit.  No more gaming.  The moment the baby can take a bottle, you get to get up 2-3 times a night to feed it and then stagger into work...and then stagger home to help your exhausted wife handle life.  Your sex life will be shit.

Yes, a child can be incredibly rewarding, but you need to be aware of the insane amount of FUCKING WORK it takes.  Fatherhood isn't a Kodak moment of father and child smiling at each other.  Fatherhood is being smeared in poop and vomit and trying to change a diaper on the plane.  Fatherhood is pacing around with a shrieking colicky child into the wee hours of the night before you have to give a big presentation.

You say that you're not forcing her to do anything, but you are putting your thumb on the scale and hoping that she doesn't see it."

"Nobody has a right to tell you with what you should be comfortable with.


If you don't like PDA, you don't like PDA. Nothing to defend or argue about.


Taking picture of you while you sleep without your consent and posting it on social media is a violation of your privacy and also a huge breach of trust.


Being a romantic doesn't give you the right to be a creep.


I'd say good riddance. He should learn to respect boundaries and you should always only do something you feel comfortable about.


Nobody has the right to judge you because you are setting boundaries. When you say you don't want PDA, it's your body, your choice. Your ex overstepped a red line, IMHO. 


PS. I just saw he is 26. I thought he was 16! Definitely a creep and definitely good riddance! "
"Weight is a hard conversation to have. I gained 20-30lbs during a really rough spot in my life and it was due to emotional eating. I was working out 4-5 times a week and even went on crazy diets but would binge on healthy foods. Stemming from thinking I wasn't good enough or look good enough.  If she's concious of the weight maybe it's time to inquire past just the weight and see if there is something underlining going on . Stress , pressure to look a certain way, work , ect. For me actually knowing people could see how bad it got actually made it much worse and originally harder for me to lose the weight. Since your so open in communication maybe it's time to dig deep on what's going on. Maybe she could consider therapy ? It helped me tremendously. "
"It was purchased before they married so she has no partial ownership over it. Any homes/assets you acquire while married are considered ""joint"" in the eyes of the law."
"It sounds like your wife got too drunk and just did or said something embarrassing. 

As someone who doesn't drink(&lt;1/yr), when I do, I get drunk fast and furiously. 

She sounds uncomfortable to be anything other than your version of normal around you. She may be discovering fun things that includes alcohol. Considering how you feel that she should apologize just for drinking and being out until 3am when you were not home...I would say the issue here may be you.

Also you have not considered at all that she is being truthful that she lied to her friend and not you.

Sounds like the biggest concern is her feeling the need to walk on eggshells around you just to explore something new and different. "
"You're right that it might look shady to the rest of your department if you two do date. That maybe something started when she was still a student.

If you two do proceed you want to keep it a secret from your colleagues and department for quite some time. Even then you might not be scot free. If you're new to the department and new to the teaching world tread carefully here. The advice of ""just go for it"" is bullshit in the face of this ruining your professional career. Universities have fired professors for less. 

Just go for it isn't something you can really consider at this point in time. You really need to think about your career. If you think the department and the department head would misconstrue you dating her and accuse you of taking advantage of your position as a professor to date her then you might want to re-think this entirely. As the saying goes about fish in the ocean, there are plenty of other women out there who if you date them don't have the potential of ending up with your very early career ending for something inappropriate regardless of whether or not it was inappropriate. Unless you live in Montana you live in an at-will state and your employer can fire you for any reason they deem worthy. It doesn't matter if you guys never had an inappropriate relationship while she was a student. If they suspect it and want to fire you for it they can and will and you will have no recourse. Let that be on your record when you took your first job as a adjunct and you'll never find another job again.

Go for it is spectacularly careless advice. You need to really think about the repercussions here. Will you be able to prove with concrete evidence that nothing happened while she was still a student? "
She suffers from social anxiety and this *enrages* OP for some reason. I think he's just upset his friend is settling down.
There's no need to be this petty. Take the high road and tell her you won't be attending.
"&gt; It's not just about policy. It's about appearance and reputation as well; if people find out that OP is dating (or has dated) someone he had even a tangential student-teacher relationship with, they might make assumptions, and in some environments, assumptions leading to rumors can damage one's reputation and limit future advancement.
&gt; 
&gt; 

Yep. There's a big, gaping difference between the letter of the law and appearances. OP is super young for a professor and is new to his department. He should think carefully about whether he wants to set himself up as a person that dates former students, or whether he wants to create distance between himself and the students. At 26, I would pick the latter without much hesitation. You do not want to have anything even appear untoward at this stage in your career."
"If you are capable of doing it by yourself, then do it by yourself. You are in a different city. Instead of face-timing your mom with all your feelings, look into your school's counseling center to talk to someone, or local therapists. 


Make plans that, when you are done with school, you will be able to survive on your own. Have plans for a job, save as much money as you can.


You are in a different city and 22. Go out and do stuff for yourself. "
"No I mean it, I needed to hear that.
Honestly, thank you!"
"Don’t talk yourself out of your instinctive feeling that things are Not Right. You know there is a difference between your sisters coming in your room at night and your teenage brother who already has a pattern of being inappropriate.

You (and all of us) are the product of millions of years of evolution. We are the descendants of the humans who had good enough instincts and judgment to have survived to reproduce. When your instincts are throwing up red flags, pay attention and act on them."
"Not that I disagree that kids will sneak around and do stuff anyway, but I feel like they are more likely to be careful about it if there are consequences. For example we drank alcohol, but knew we couldn't drink much if we had to talk to our parents. 

We all had a curfew, and most parents didn't allow male/female sleepovers or any drugs/alcohol. Not that it all didn't happen, but it was certainly less frequent. The only person I know whose mother acted like she didn't give a shit was because she really didn't give a shit. He went straight from high school to prison.

Plus I feel like legal consequences are more harsh and more frequent now than they were in the days of the police saying ""pour it out and go home"""
"I work and study too and I manage to find time to see my girlfriend during the week. Most people do. Especially after five years.

"Sad situation, but absolutely do not help them, especially with these pathetic requests for money and rides and cigarettes (they are clearly parasitic and plan on living off of hand-outs forever).

"I guess it depends on where you are and culture etc, but the ceremony is just a 20 min thing, or in  church, a church service.

Generally where Im from, you might invite the B listers to the ceremony only, if they don't make the cut for the reception. "
"He's ""allowed"" to believe whatever he likes. But when that belief makes him hateful towards others, it is indeed unfortunate."
"I think it's normal to want to celebrate ""on your actual birthday,"" if it's possible, but it's not normal to expect someone to skip a major life milestone like a good friend's wedding, in order to do it. She is severely lacking in empathy and sounds emotionally stunted."

I am his age and if any of my friends was dating someone your age I would be appalled and probably stop hanging out with him. I would doubt his judgement and be concerned he is interested in younger women due to the power differential being in his favor.

"You shouldn't feel bad about rejecting D. You're not feeling any chemistry with him, and that's OK. More to the point, it seems like he's love-bombing you (look up that term) and you're right - it's fake and it's suspicious. Your instincts are good, listen to them."

"“Trashy” is what people call something when they’re being classist or not understanding what trauma looks like. It is a judgemental label. If someone in your life that you care about has some experience in the past that seems unhealthy/boundary crossing/self destructive, then the response should be “holy shit- are you ok? That must have been really difficult”. None of the examples OP listed seem that out of the ordinary for typical cycles of abuse. So to judge fucked up parenting or being told to essentially accept sexual assault as “trashy” rather than tragic is completely abusive. "
"It's a manifestation of insecurity which, if left unchecked, can develop into resentment.

My advice would be, since your example mentions going out with a reasonably sized group, enjoy hanging out with the others around you, old friends/new friends her friends or your friends, just because you two are dating doesn't mean you need to be attached at the hip and involved in eacothers conversations. Enjoy yourself have fun, hell flirt with other women if it gets your mind off her.

You can't control her actions but you can control your reactions."
He said in another comment that it’s been his decision to wait.  
"Tell them that none of the people they are intimidating (your male friends) are the people who harassed you and sent you dick picks. 

Tell them that if they want to help you avoid future harassment, to pick better friends who aren't creeps. You had your guard down b/c it was a family friend most likely. "
"I mean I wouldn't wait any longer, if I was your family member I would be upset that you waited not that you are pregnant. You are fully in adult territory and financially independent from your parents, just tell them."
"OK, so I'm on the other side, having had a kid, only now he's 24 and lives in another city. No grandkids. My personal nonworking life is still very important to me. In fact, I'd say I'm busier now than my kid was little. I have professional development/training in my off-time, plus a partner who still expects me to pay him attention now and then. There is no other family in my city so any visiting means travelling. And so on. If you have the life you want, grey rock those coworkers. Say your personal life is precious to you, if you'd like. You could have been relaxing on a beach instead of helping your parents clean up and it would still be wildly inappropriate for him to encroach on your personal time "
"The event you described was probably a wakeup call for your siblings; like ""oh heck my baby sis isn't 7 any more"". Your family members are terrified for you. Sure they're going about protecting you all wrong, but it's because they're scared for you. They've heard stories about girls who got kidnapped or drugged or raped or killed and they don't want that to happen to you. 

They know that the only person you can control is you, but they think that if you control yourself enough and behave properly, you won't get stalked or hurt or anything. Which isn't the case, of course; that's a lie perpetuated by culture, but it's probably all your family has right now to reassure them. 

Maybe talk to your family about taking some self-defense classes? I think it would be a relief for everyone if you had some means of protecting yourself. Them, for knowing you can defend yourself; you, because they may back off some once you do.  "
As children you were taught right from wrong. Your parental figures taught you. 
"It takes months to be foreclosed on. That means you got the puppy AFTER you knew you'd be needing another place to live, which doesn't make much sense? 

Would your friends be agreeable to you having just the older dog if you gave them a damage deposit? You've only had the puppy a short time, and puppies are much easier to find good homes for than older dogs.  Otherwise, just visit the dogs at your daughter's house. I think ""no dogs allowed"" is a very reasonable rule for landlords to have, especially for a newly purchased and renovated house. But if ""sickens"" you, maybe you need to resume your search for a new place to live? "
Given the issues the dog has it is probably best to contact a rescue agency or shelter.  They can properly vet any potential new owners more than you can. 
Here it is: OP is just as backwards as his girlfriend and doesn't understand how fucked up she's being
"You've been spanked enough for the ""fuck off"" so I'm gonna give you a round of applause.  That was a righteous ""fuck off"". He *earned* that. You might get a talking- to but seriously, he and the other one should both fuck right off. So obnoxious. The next time it comes up, I think you should tell them that you used to want to have kids, but now you're afraid they'll grow up to a couple of rude jag-offs like a couple patents you know, and just look at them pointedly. Or tell Mary you don't plan on having kids because youre not interested in leaking urine when you're her age. It doesn't have to be accurate, it just has to *burn*. 

Btw, I'm a parent and I hope I get a house dropped on me if I ever talk to anyone.the way those smug a holes talk to you. "
"You and your bf should both get a job and save up for a place to live.
Being a student is not a good excuse, literally everyone I know who’s a student also works at least one job. 

Your family sounds horrid. For your bfs sake I wouldn’t even tell them until I had some independence,..so you need to work on that. And when they start spewing racist shit SHUT THEM DOWN "
"Yep, I was going to say, focus on your mental health. 

It's 100% understandable that he's struggling with this, but I think sometimes men drastically overestimate the importance of their junk and drastically underestimate the importance of being mentally stable.
"
Ya man this is sketchy. I’d be on high alert too. Sorry about this he’s not being transparent. 
"I'm guessing by your ages that this is maybe your first serious relationship, maybe his first serious relationship too. I'm curious if this is something he's done basically the entire time or if this is a recent development. It troubles me that you said, ""maybe it's my fault for being bad"" this is the kind of language that people in abusive relationships use. I don't know your relationship as well as you do, so I can't say that you're in an abusive relationship. But what he's doing is at least a tactic that a lot of abusers use; which is undermining the self esteem of the person they're with. He is trying to convince you that he knows how to do things and you do not, so you will begin to doubt yourself. And inevitably you'll stop certain behaviors because you'll want to avoid the lecture. This is not healthy. It's not behavior that's present in a healthy relationship. He is not doing this because he cares and he wants you to be a better person, I can assure you of that. Do you know why I can assure you of that? Because you also care about him, but you're not doing it to him. Why is that exactly? Think about the reasons you don't do it to him and ask yourself why those reasons don't apply to you. 

This is absolutely not a personality thing you have to get used to. In fact I would actively encourage you to not get used to this. If you're set on staying with him the next time (and every subsequent time) he starts to ""correct"" your behavior (which again, gross, you correct a pets behavior, not an equal partners) tell him, ""The way I do it is fine. I don't correct the way you do it, so please don't correct the way I do it. I can play this game (or whatever) however I want to."" 

You've already told him you don't like this and it hurts your feelings. He continues to do it. Think about what that means. There is not some magic combination of words that will make it sink in. If I had to guess, it has already sunk in, he knows it hurts you, he just doesn't really care. I know you said he can be caring in many other ways, but this is also how people get trapped in abusive relationships. If the abuser was horrible all the time, no one would stay with them. They might be a perfect partner 80% of the time, but that 20% of the time they're abusive. Again, I don't want to point fingers and say that beyond a doubt your boyfriend is being abusive to you, but I just want you to please think about it and maybe look up some resources (apparently the book Why Does He Do That? is very good) and see if any of that applies to your life."
"Yeah, I read somewhere else that you said the dog may be from a ""backyard breeder"", which is going to be hit or miss when it comes to how their behavior is. 

I also noticed that you mentioned that giving up on this dog goes against your values as a couple.  I get that.  My wife and I are similar. We like to see things through. However, also acknowledge that this isn't YOUR fault or anything.  You, unfortunately, adopted a dog who the previous owners lied to you about.  Had you known of these issues, would you have adopted him or kept looking? 

What I'm trying to say is that don't see this as a failure for either you or fiance.  You guys *tried*, probably harder than most people would have.  Hell, I think you guys have provided more professional help regarding his behavior than some parents do for their actual children!

I'm going be a nerd and quote a line from Captain Jean-Luc Picard: ""It is possible to commit no mistakes and still lose. That is not a weakness. That is life"""

I would leave. He sounds terrible, like a negative, miserable asshole. Life is too short for this kind of shit. He's unwilling to work on this. This is just who he is. If you stay, be prepared for a lifetime of this."

The comment about you staying the week in that other city really jumps out at me... just that she offered it up so quickly? She likes HER routine and that seems to be more important than staying together as a family? Maybe I am making too big a deal out of her willingness to let you go, but it makes me wonder how other parts of your marriage are going? Sex life, intimate time, date nights, moments when it is just the two of you, etc.

Bottom line, you are 35 years old and there is PLENTY of time to find a more fulfilling job, especially because you most likely have 5\-10 years under your belt as an architect, you are highly employable, especially in a large booming city. Seriously, you are young! If it really is important, then start thinking about ways of selling her on a move or be willing to come home on the weekends. "
I think you need to be very clear with her. Not just “she’s on her own” but that you are planning to see other people and that you feel the marriage is over. And I mean... are they going to force her in to marriage? Why is she even setting foot there?
"But if you were to stay together, he will be a father figure - or potentially a step father. You and your children are a package deal. He can’t have you without them. If he’s in their life, he’s in their life in all aspects. If he wants to have a future with you then he needs to pay his fair share for the relationship. As of right now, you have a third child living with you. If he is living in their home, he needs to care for them. He isn’t your roommate, he’s your partner. If he can’t pay $6.50 for ear drops for a sick child that he’s living with, then there’s bigger issues. Stop making everything so easy for him. "
What about the bride’s self esteem? She should be equally mortified by this. Though I guess she’s accustomed to her family spending lavishly on her. 
This! You do not sound like a child. You sound very reflected and adult. I don’t think you’ll ever get a real apology because they don’t think they did anything wrong. You have to figure out if the apology they gave you will be good enough for you. 
"What if there were a way you could make him stay at a homeless shelter, volunteer with the homeless, get the entire homeless experience, to see if it hits a nerve?

If it doesn't, maybe it's more than sheer laziness."
"Ok ok ok ok ok. Ok.
So I cannot believe the blinders you have on here OP, when it comes to your bff Sarah.

In addition to the already observant comments you've received here, I just want to add- You seem to have a pattern of minimising and dismissing Sarahs' poor behaviour.

Now I know it's a pattern because you clearly admit that your wife doesn't like her and didn't  even want her at your wedding. I doubt she feels that way for nothing, despite what a ""sweetheart"" you think Sarah may be.

Real talk OP. Your wife right now is going to be feeling intense resentment towards Sarah and you right now. That kinda resentment turns into relationship poison over time. She may not dump your ass over this, but you can bet your marriage that its going on her shit list for aaaall the ways you haven't had her back (Which I assume isn't the first time. Just a feeling). And when that ship sails my friend, hoooboy...

Sarah's not the problem here, it's you. Because at this point  you're willing to let her get away with anything."
I'm super confused. Hasn't this been posted before??
"Dear God, this guy’s a complete null set."

"I'm with you... how was the previous post indicative of abuse in any way? I read it. OP you flaked twice on your partner. They're allowed to be annoyed with you. They're allowed to want some space when they are annoyed. If money, physical appearance, cleanliness and stability aren't priorities for you, then perhaps consideration for your partner should be."
Cool. So what? That doesn’t provide them with a blank check to do as they please. 
Thank you. I really needed to hear this.
I didn't even drop my baby. I set her on the couch and she kicked against the back of it and it propelled her headfirst off the front of it. I cried for two days afterward thinking I was a terrible mother. I still am haunted by it. 
"Dude, almost everyone you date with at your age is going to have some sort of sexual history, including you at this point if you end up moving back from this guy. Accept that everyone has a history and that history has nothing to do with their current relationship with you. You're being irrational. You won dude. This guy chose you and has moved on from his exes. Honestly, you sound super insecure and it isn't your bf's job to cater to your insecurities."
She's needing a stepfather for her baby....don't do it
"Gosh, can't imagine how a winner like her is still single. "
"Genuinely good people don't sexually harass and proposition a married man at his daughter's wedding and then cause a scene bc they were rejected. The fact that she was drunk doesn't excuse her behavior; if anything, it does the opposite! (*in vino veritas*, as it were)

You keep saying Sarah has a good heart, but that doesn't fucking matter if her actions are toxic, entitled, and destructive. She is showing you the exact kind of person she is; believe her actions, not your wishful thinking. "
"Seriously,  instead of spending thousands of your sibling's money to build a fancy one.  "
"I agree with you about him being a ""the grass is always greener"" type, which in turn makes me wonder what he'll be like in a marriage after a few years.      

Regardless, this guy is not a good partner. He doesn't seem to care at all about OP's career or what she sacrificed for him the last time he unilaterally decided to move across the country. No way should she take another hit to her career to trail after him again, especially not at this age.      "
"It seems like he's fetishizing/objectifying Japanese women though. Even if he had a strong preference for a particular ethnicity, it's not normal to miss out on time with his girlfriend to watch interviews with Japanese porn actresses. Especially when they're on YouTube and he could watch them whenever. Especially because he's not watching clips of random Japanese tv shows to improve his language skills, he's exclusively watching sexy women."
Or be in an adult relationship with balance and compromise. 
"if you read his previous posts his gf's age keeps changing from 20 to 29 so who knows if any of this is true. a month ago she was 20 and had a porn background,  4 months ago she was 29, now shes back to 29."
"The way you set boundaries is by discussing them clearly and frankly, do this.  ""Ben, you are entirely too physical with me and that needs to stop, OK?""."
"&gt; The one thing I wish I can do is straight-up tell Sarah that I think she's making a mistake. However, I know that as an adult, it is her life and her needs that she needs to address.


You can. Friends can give friends honest, even blunt, advice."
Guess I better leave him first then. :/

"&gt; If I do so, would that mean I'm abandoning Sarah to ""fend for herself"" when it comes to her choices in the wedding? 

No, it would mean you're respecting Carly's (and everyone else's) autonomy as a person to make her (their) own decisions."
"1. No you aren't
2. That doesn't have anything to do with a living situation"
Uh... a bachelor party is not an excuse to cheat on your partner.
"&gt;I feel like he is in a difficult situation.

That he put himself in. That is his own fault.

You don't just have sex and create a child and then they're obligated to be with you the rest of their lives. That comes from raising your kids \-\- being there for them, loving them more than anything else. Your grandfather actively decided not to do any of that for your father, and that's why they don't have a relationship. Your grandfather literally had your dad's ENTIRE life to change his decision and he didn't.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If you decide to start speaking with your grandfather again, I'd keep it pretty superficial. Or maybe even explain your side of this situation and see what he says."
"I would ask this at /r/JUSTNOMIL

"He's absolutely emotionally cheating on you AND he's initiating a grossly inappropriate workplace romance with a subordinate.

Why the fuck would you stay in this relationship? This man doesn't give two shits about you."
"Not that it helps you, but this marriage is not going to last a year, I bet."
Your husband is being selfish and self\-indulgent and a poor role model. 
"Hun, I'm a mom, a god-mother, an aunt...I love kids. I would NEVER do what your friend dud and neither would anyone who's not an asshole. She would be honestly a bit awful to even ask (because bringing a child is clearly not in the spirit if this trip and asking forces you guys to say no or have a terrible trip) but to just INFORM you? Oh hell no. Your friend is quite self-centered, no?"
"43% of Texas voted for Clinton. Clinton won in the major cities (Dallas, Austin, Houston) but lost in the rural areas. Are you moving to a big city or the rural towns.

I would say move and give it some time to find your peer group. It might turn out that your husband doesn't like it or the job might not work out. If you try it and hate it you can move away with or without your husband. You have not been to Texas and judging it on what think you know. You will be better able to judge once you've spent some time there.

Plus, double the salary could get you nicely ahead with your retirement! Even if it's only for a few years."
"Suggesting a different faith is a bit moot as the girlfriend wants to expose *her* child to *her* faith. She wants to share something important to her with someone important to her. It's not just about religion, but about something that is part of her: *her* faith. She's going to be biased towards her faith as that's part of who she is.

What OP wants is possible (it's my and my husband's situation), but it works only when it's something both partners want. If I wanted to raise my child in my faith, my husband would not be the right partner for me and I would have broken up around the time OP is now: the moment where you discuss important life goals, time lines, etc. This is where you figure out if a relationship can be long-term. 

Breaking up hurts, but divorce after years of fighting over differences you can't overcome is worse."
"I would lay off OP, maybe when baby is here she will see she has a choice.

When she holds her vulnerable child she may see.

But everyone banging on at her about it will only make her dig in.

"About that part of your story - it’s seriously not okay how this child behaves. He knows no boundaries, thinks he can do everything he wants and wants to be the center of attention all the time? It sounds like he ‘overpowered’ his mom and she can’t say no to him at this point. When a child misbehaves like this in your home, and their mother lets it pass, it is absolutely your right to say something."
"Preach 🙌! Seriously OP, everything that ladisty said is exactly what you need to read, absorb and consider. "
"His and her hearing tests, perhaps? Also, just make an appointment at a sleep clinic and just tell him when it is."
"The banana peel thing is so gross, and food items being left out like that can quickly lead to bugs that are difficult to eradicate.  

I'm not seeing where OP apologized, empathized with the parents about how gross it is to leave food scraps on someone's desk, and offered to make it up to them somehow.  Chores seem reasonable.  

Does OP work?  If so, there should be a bit of money for the rent or cleaning lady.  If she doesn't work, she could be helping Martin out with the chores so he's not quite so tired.  "
"&gt; We've had heart-to-hearts, I've been weeping, in tears in front of him, begging him to go to the doctor, and he's promised, he's apologized, he's sworn he'll do it the next day, but he doesn't. 

If this is the case, you have a much bigger problem than his volume.  He doesn't give two shits about you."
"Google ""pervocracy missing stair.""  It's incredibly common behavior to pretend that bad behavior didn't really happen:  it's just a different form of victim-blaming.  If the victim is to blame, then none of these Good People have to face up to the fact that they've been enabling a bad person.

The key is cut him AND anyone who excuses him out of your life."
"From a comment of OP'S 

&gt;No none of that. He was obsessed with the 'get rich quick schemes' that were mostly scams and that's how he lost the money. He was also just difficult to count on and would guilt me into giving him more money. But he's grown up now and isn't like that anymore at all. "
Sounds like you moved in WAY to early. Moving in four months in? You barely know the guy yet. 
"&gt;She has been crying all the time, claiming all of this is not fair for her. 

No, this is about as fair as it can be. You were always honest with her about wanting kids. She was quasi-honest with you - saying she didn't want them, but would have them for you. Fair enough, except she kept kicking the can down the road. Now, it's hard to know if she was just avoiding having kids out of anxiety (while deluding herself as to her intentions), or cynically just trying to run the clock out until it was too late for her to have kids, but in the end, she finally came down on one side.

&gt;Now she told me the death of her father made her think about having family, that during all this time she has done nothing with her life, and that despite the fear, she is into having family with me now.

I would not trust this statement at ALL. In addition, you are no longer in love with her. I think you need to hire a lawyer and start on your divorce. "
"I think an attempt was made.  OP states that she isn't socially adept and hadn't realized what was gong on for quite some time.   in that time they were having dinner and drinks out - alone and apparently texting one another.

Of course there is always a chance his wife is a controlling and jealous harpy.  But I think he gives his wife a lot of reason to not trust him."
"Honestly it would not surprise me if both get canned. Not that OP did anything wrong, but because that's just how some HR departments are run."
Is the woman in her 70s acting as a domme? It’s amazing that she’s been able to make this a career. Kudos to her. 
"Stop trying to control your image mate, that's the real problem. People tease you because you're so serious about looking perfect. "
"no doubt. He is 9 years older than her and he chose to stay in a relationship that is very abnormal. I would put money down he is manipulating OP to put her in exactly the same sitation she is in at home, just with him instead. He found the perfect girl to be completely dependent and obedient to him."
"The one problem I see with this approach is that Claire then could try to fix the faux-reasons. Like, offer to pay more than 1/3. Then it's back to OP to refuse, as it wasn't really about the money in the first place. "

"That’s not silly at all. Animals are my life. I wouldn’t date someone who doesn’t like animals. I know that I want a life with pets and animals. My husband is an animal lover too so I know I get to have a life full of the animals I want.

"I think they were referring to the fact that you had unprotected sex with a woman you've only been with for 3 weeks. This is unwise because that means you either want a child with someone you don't know, or you don't want a child and you are not taking any precautions."
"This sounds like a very unhealthy obsession with another woman and its not just creepy, its kind of scary dude. He needs therapy on his own first and foremost to deal with that. Then maybe you guys can work something out as far as couples therapy like another person said here. The way he comments about it around you seems disrespectful and kind of like he can't control himself. Its one thing to develop a wandering eye but its another thing to completely obsess over someone. 

It's good that you guys talk about it but I'd be a bit stern about it. If it's really nothing to worry about he should stop. It makes you uncomfortable and its inappropriate. The least he can do is stop talking about her to you."

"Of course it’s not that a parent is bad if they don’t make a point of saying it, it might not occur to them as something that needs to be specifically said, or they think it’s obvious and goes without saying. But sometimes kids really need to hear it especially when they are struggling. You can tell her that her behaviour has been bad and that you’re angry and disappointed in her right now, but that will never take away from the fact that she’s your daughter and you love her.

And even if she reacts by being dismissive about it or shutting down or rolling her eyes and saying “whatever mom” deep down it might still be useful and healing and something she needed to hear. So don’t be discouraged if you don’t get an enthusiastic, happy or grateful reaction from her. Say it anyway. "

"I was caught stealing when I was 17 and I am a pretty successful attorney now, so please don't give up on her yet. There is plenty of time to turn things around. That being said, all the defiant acts, especially those involving the police, will have a consequence on her adult life. You should make sure she realizes this. But you also need to realize there is something more going on with her and you need to help her deal with it. Either you need her to open up to you or to a counselor. Grounding is not going to solve this problem. It seems like it has made it worse. For me, I was grounded for two months. Which meant I was blocked from the only people I felt comfortable openly talking to about what was going on in my life. This was incredibly isolating and caused me to become very depressed and seriously withdrawn from everyone (friends, family, and teachers). The underlying problem might not be something that can be resolved, and if that's the case, helping her might just be helping her learn how to deal with it properly. For me, my dad's alcoholism had hit a precipice and my mom (feeling she had no one else to talk to) was talking to me about whether or not to divorce him or continue helping him. That was just all too much for me at 16. Not wanting to go home, I hung out at the mall, and not having any money, started stealing, a lot. Then stealing started to feel good. It was an adrenaline rush that distracted me from dealing with my problems. Your daughter's problems might be school, friends, relationships, or you. I don't know, but you need to help her figure it out and figure out healthy ways of dealing with it. Don't worry about what went wrong, figure out how to make it right. "

"She has been long consumed by the trap of social media, by your words.

The main issue with people that are this brainwashed is that they find something wrong with you if you're not at their level.

These people's lives are not solely based on their own personal interactions with the world, but also on what the world tells them through the screen.

Relationships, people's goals, celebrities, love quotes, etc it all adds up to seeing what they don't have and getting insecure or comparing it to what they have and getting upset.

To conclude, your choices are few and the best potential outcomes for you are limited - You tell her, if you haven't, that social media is not meant to be a representation of your life because you know better.

Only you know how you want this to proceed, but in my experience it's too difficult to get someone like that to listen and understand.

Stop that right now. He is with you. He chooses you. What if’s are nothing but damaging. 
My take: he's just not that into you.
"Unless her husband specifically asks her to, OP should not be intervening in the relationships her husband has with his siblings. It's not her place. He's an adult who can enforce his own boundaries. She should help her husband make decisions on how he wants to interact with his family, stand by him and support him, and if she feels it's necessary she can always herself refuse to see the brother or have him in the house. But I don't think she has any right (or duty) to police her BIL, this is her husband's call."

The one thing that is never in the Disney story or romantic movie is that all long term relationships/marriages are, in a large part, a business partnership.  You pay bills together, you plan your futures together, you make day-to-day decisions that affect the standard of living each of you gets to experience.  It matters a *great* deal more than most people acknowledge.

Communication, sexual compatibility, parental ability, life goals; it ranks right up there with all of the other major deal breakers.  So, you should not feel guilty for treating it like one.

That being said, there are some practical concerns involved.  At 45, your husband likely has limited opportunities to start over.  The more likely solution is keeping him in the same field and/or utilizing his skills at a job for someone else so that he has no overhead and more stability.  I'm not sure what form that takes or what opportunities there are in your area, but you may have to let go of any sort of notion that he would start over in a different vocation and make it big.

It's clearly time for the coming to Jesus talk about his financial and/or household contributions. You need to really give this some thought beforehand so that you can communicate your expectations, your needs, what you're willing to compromise on and what you are not.

Keep the business partner theme in your mind when you're discussing these things.  I know it sounds somewhat callous, but right now you have to focus on the practical and not the romantic.  You will never achieve the things you mentioned wanting in your post (more travel, faster retirement, a new vehicle) if you don't shake up the status quo -- as hard as that may be."

Time to have a serious talk with Josh about setting boundaries with his mom if you guys are going to have a future together. It may be time to postpone the wedding at the very least until you figure this situation out.

"It's a method of manipulation. Basically showing intense passion very rapidly in the relationship, and then take it away so the abusee/victim becomes dependant on the abuser/manipulator, and constantly fiends for that fake ""overly passionate love"". Once the victim is dependant on it, the manipulator has control over the person. 

Google ""loveisrespect"" and go write the quiz - ""am I in an abusive relationship?"". Note, your relationship seems emotionally abusive - there is a reason you are posting here. Deep down, you know something is off. And there are strong chances you've been ""groomed"" for 10 years where you think things are normal, but they are not.

"Exactly. You can speak the truth without trash talking an ex. I see far too many people who decide to take the high road and not share what someone did to them, only to be burned by it and losing their own reputation, friends, or even family. All because taking the high road is the ""honorable"" thing to do.

Do no harm. Don't talk trash about that shirt you hated that your ex wore all the time anyway. Don't talk trash about how your ex always left the laundry in the washing machine, all mildewy, forcing you to rewash it. Don't talk trash about their genitals, or the way they moaned in that weird way every time they orgasmed. Basically, don't talk trash about the petty stuff that will just make you look petty.

But more importantly, do no harm to yourself. And if your silence will harm you, especially if your ex is openly sharing their version of events that paint you in a bad light, then go ahead and share that your ex cheated on you, or used to break things when you argued, or shamed you for your sexual history. It's your truth, and you shouldn't let an ex take that away from you."
"Yeah, but at such a young age there is a big difference between ""14, going on 15"" and ""15, going on 16."""
"When I was growing up (I'm female), I understood the term as a deterrent to guys to go after young girls. The slight is not on the girl, she can't help her age. I would hear guys talking and they'd say ""Yeah but she's jail bait"", they'd shrug it off and forget about pursuing the girl. They didn't want to go to jail. "
"It was a bonehead thing to do.  I know there was no malice but it was silly irregardless of his sexuality or life choices outside of work.  

For most of us, our work persona and our home persona have distinct traits.  Of course we are the same people either way but we all portray what we wish at work and relax at home. 

This is a lesson of discretion.  We never, ever, ever, no matter what, tell another person's story either directly or inferred.  I have a co-worker who I'm the closest to in the company.  She is struggling with addiction and while people know, they do not know the details of what is happening day to day.  I get asked about her all the time because it's known we are close.  

I say to them ""It's not my story to tell, I'm sure you would appreciate the same discretion for yourself"".

It was a mistake and I hope he manages to navigate this to his satisfaction.  Let him be.  He may forgive you, he may not.  If he doesn't, that is his right, he has no obligation to ease your guilt or to make your feel less bad about it."

"&gt; So about eighteen months ago I met the most wonderful person I've ever met in my entire life. 

You hadn't met him until you met him. There are millions billioms of men on the planet. You can 100% meet someone else who is the most wonderful person. 

&gt; We have happily been in a relationship for about six months now and it's going superbly well. I have never felt this way about anyone before, ever. 


I'd be willing to bet my left pinky and both my little toes that if you asked your girlfriends, they'd tell you that you have 100% said this about past boyfriends. I'm giving up summer sandle season for you girl!  This is how we always feel when we have a brain pulsing with love chemicals and we are in the thrilling throws of new relationship energy. All my boyfriends have been the Best Most Wonderful guy until we broke up and I met a new... BMW, as it were!


&gt; six months


Your brain is still full of love hormones. 


&gt; I have never had such a strong sense of belonging, meant-to-be, complete understanding and love on both physical and emotional levels. 


I guarantee you can find this with someone else on this planet of billions - someone who does not want children. 


All this to say, I realise you are in a love hormone stew and that is exciting, but this is mostly just you on a magic carpet ride of brain chemicals. He's just a man. There are a lot of men, many of them wonderful. Don't fall into the trap of thinking this is The Last Good Man You'll Ever Meet Ever. Because that is 100% not true. How many times can I say 100%?  You'll be fine if you walk away from this relationship because of this conflict. You will find someone else. The power to love that freely and passionately is in you, it isn't going anywhere."
"Yea. He has a habit of, ""oh she just left me"" or ""oh she just changed I don't know what happened with her"" with his exes. I feel like his version of things is, ""I don't know, she just left me."""
"&gt;I don’t prioritize physical appearance, **stability**, money, or **cleanliness**, and while I don’t want to change those things about myself, they definitely make me not a good partner for most people.

These things, the things I bolded, aren't just like cutesy quirks that make you unique and special. 

Being slovenly, pack rat, or unsanitary and unhygienic are signs of serious mental health issues.

Being unstable is also a serious sign of mental health issues. I mean, the word ""unstable"" is literally used to mean a mental health issue that's not being treated.  If you mean stability in any other way it's still a huge fucking issue. 

Being ""stable"" simply means you are keeping the base level of running your adult life properly in a way that doesn't burden others. 

It's absolutely *not ok* to be in ***ANY*** relationship while *choosing* to be a slob, unhygienic, emotionally unstable, financially unstable, etc. 

I don't understand the responses in you previous posts.

Leaving crap in a blender for a week is horrendously disrespectful. It's disgusting. It can ruin the blender entirely. If you insist that you get to use household appliances in a way that ruin it you're going to have to buy your own. WTFFFFFF?!? Of course your partner told you not to use it anymore. What's their recourse?!? You just get to ruin shit because it's part of your ""personality"" to not be clean?

I have a feeling you're a young woman who has been drifting without direction and you have mental health issues you're not addressing. 

People who are directionless sometimes try to cultivate interesting personality traits that aren't personality traits. Hoping it will lead to direction or passion, or commonly, an excuse to avoid becoming a grown up. 

You're 24. Time to decide what you want in life and do the ***hard work*** to get it. 

I have a simple life. I'm a mom, wife, artist, woodworker, writer, and I like to smell the roses. But it still takes hard work sometimes. 

It's not ok to leave gross messes. No one cares that you're personally ok with it (other than it's an obvious sign of mental illness) because it's disrespectful to those around you. 

It's not ok to be ""unstable"" because unstable people are takers by definition and that's also disrespectful. It's one thing to need support now and then when life gets unpredictable. But choosing to be unstable means you are putting your burdens on others. That's ridiculously disrespectful!

I've spent the last five minutes trying to work out what a car port is. Is this a garage?
"God that's a fucking weird thing to say under the best of circumstances. Even if he was straight that's just a weird fucking thing to say ...

Leave him alone, he doesn't want to be friends with you anymore. Seriously, LEAVE HIM ALONE, this isn't about your feelings. "
"That's exactly what my boyfriend said when I was 15. He was 25 and kept telling me how mature I was for my age but that we shouldn't sleep together. I felt like I coerced him at the time wearing him down until he said yes.

Now I know that this is sexual grooming 101. It uses 'intermittent reinforcement' of pulling back so the victim pushes forward fearing abandonment and the abuser can move to the next stage all while keeping their hands 'clean' because you pursued him. You take their burden of responsibility, they take your trust and suck you further and further in.

Because you were the one who wanted it remember? They said no. It's your fault. How could they a grown adult who initiated the relationship withstand a child? They twist it round so you're the manipulator and they were bewitched by your charms despite you being younger, naive and totally out of your depth. It's called 'projection' and it's the manipulator's favourite trick to get victims to do stuff without even questioning them.

And I know you'll object to be called a victim because it's so very hard to accept we've been groomed and abused and manipulated. I met a man like this at 15 and now at 40, I still find it hard to say 'victim' because I wanted to sleep with him. But I was groomed and manipulated and my consent was a) illegal and b) not freely given because it was based on his lies and deceit. 

I didn't know any of that because good relationships weren't modelled for me as a child and I carried totally unaware that relationship was abusive until my 30s when I started reading advice columns and people like you would use exactly the same lines as he said with the same desperate confusion in their voice I had. And then I realised I'd never had the power and he had always had it from the first moment but grooming means you don't see that.

Google 'the boiling frog analogy' if you still don't believe me."

"It seems to me like the built up that entire relationship in your head, when the fact is, if M *really* was into you, he would have took all the steps to be with you the way that D is. The potential wasn’t realized because M didn’t care to realize it. All of those things that you mentioned (not having jobs, being shy, etc) are excuses, and not even good ones at that. "

"I read that a little differently. I don’t make a habit of canceling on anyone last minute, but sometimes there are extenuating circumstances. I read it more as Melanie felt like there was no room, ever, for those circumstances like when you’re stuck at work or your partner has something going on or you don’t feel well. Maybe I misread it, but that’s how I interpreted it. "

"You need to apologize to your parents for:

- being disobedient

- totalling their expensive car

- getting kicked out out of private school

Then go to state community college, then go to state school. Since your parents are covering the living expenses, you just need to cover tuition which you can with a job. No debt needed. As your parents observe you knuckling down, they might step up the amount of help.

Yeah other than your living expenses.

"Maybe find a job that you *truly* enjoy, then. Are there any passions you could turn into a profession?

If only I was that suave in real life.
"&gt;I have asked her about it but she says nothing is wrong, I'm over-reacting, this is just normal life, she doesn't feel like having sex all the time. 

When did you have this conversation?  I think you need to sit down with her during a down/relaxing time when neither of you has been thinking about having sex.  Sit close enough to touch.  Bonus points if you hold her hand.  Then start the conversation by saying ""I'm not judging or complaining, I'm worried about you.  Recently you don't seem as interested in having sex, and for as long as I've known you, that's not normal *for you*.  Can we talk about what may have changed?""  Or something along those lines.  Obviously you have more information, but I'd be worried she's having some depressive issues, or problems with birth control, or *something* dramatically stressing that's causing this.  Libidos change, but this seems to be drastic and sudden.  "

Its vile. And also rape in a lot of places if you lie about your birth control
Did he apologize to you at least once? Or was he hanging out in pity party central? 
"I mean that is so unattractive I dont even know how it doesnt drastically change your opinion of him.

I read through your replies and you said he had gone to dinner with women alone in the past and you'd known and been ok with him doing so. 

So he is basically wanting different standards for the two of you, with the implied reasoning that you are not trustworthy but he is.

I mean, doesnt that make you think less of him?

Ps. You are 24, and he is 29. I would argue you are at different stages in life, but, him being that old, means he isnt suddenly going to mature. This is who he is, and that behaviour is part of his makeup. You will be with an immature, passively agressive/manipulative (because trying to guilt you is just that) person, if you chose to carry on with him. And please dont keep your roseshaded glasses on: You CANNOT learn from this as a couple when only one of you is still learning from the consequences of their actions. He quite clearly doesnt want to learn. He is happy being the way he is, he just wants YOU to change to accomodate his immature jealousy."
"I had a much bigger comment that said everything you did, I am glad I am not alone. She made it clear she was tired of him not being proactive enough, yeah she was harsh but stepping on eggshells all the time can build up resentment and she was probably bottling things up to try and be kind and understandable but getting frustrated by the lack of action.

"With references, you can state negative things as long as it’s factual. If there is evidence, you can state it. It’s more company policy to skirt around negative references. Granted people will sue for everything.

"To me it sounds like a “I’m sorry you’re upset, but I’m right” non-apology, instead of a “I’m sorry for what I did, I understand why it was upsetting, I won’t do it again” real apology.

I don’t think there is an appropriate time to tell your boyfriend’s sister that she needs to lose weight. They aren’t family, they aren’t friends. OP brings girlfriend into their shared living space, and she’s telling sister that her body’s wrong in her own home. Repeatedly."
"After reading this, I'm not sure that your issue is really about this one instance of him not texting you. I think this is more a ""straw that broke the camel's back"" issue. If this was the first time something like this happened, I think you'd be able to deal with this lack of communication better and give him the benefit of the doubt, but the build-up is causing resentment on your end. Maybe you need to think about whether you're getting what you need out of this relationship and if you can handle these kinds of situations all the time. "
"I agree, I took my large end of year bonus and quit, I should have worked one more year and taken my (2017)  bonus to make sure I had a larger buffer. But a year after quitting I am at my previous salary's income (pre tax).

Its hard to see whether im being resentful or expecting too much from a brick and mortar business."

"&gt;Also it was things we used to get off to in porn so why wouldn't he be turned on by that ?

/u/DiTrastevere said it best:

&gt;People don’t always want to try the things they like in porn in real life. 

I watch stuff in porn and on tv all the time. I enjoy watching it and even fantasizing about it. But I don't want to actually act it out.

Fantasy is good for when you want to do something but can't. It's also good for when you like the thought of something but are iffy on the reality of it."

"Yeah I'm going to go a different direction than a bunch of people on here. 

Tbh if my husband did this for me, I'd be completely turned off. I 100% think that sex and trying new things related to that needs to be a conversation.  So, what I am saying is that - while the idea was good, the surprise was not. 

I think you should have consulted him first, maybe shop for toys together to bring with you and then try them together. I think the fact that he didn't like it all means that you need to have a conversation about WHAT turns you on. This could have nothing to do with you and his attraction to you but rather what gets him excited. 

Also will verify that just because someone likes watching it in porn, doesn't mean they want to do it. "
"HOOOLLLLYYYY HELLLL !!

OP, This would explain everything perfectly: Your mom cheated on your dad, got pregnant by her lover (your now step-dad), had you, and then decided to kick her entire ""old family"" (your brother and his dad) to the curb.

That's why neither of them want anything to do with your brother: he's no one to your step dad, and just ""the kid from a previous marriage"" to your mom.

I would be absolutely shocked if this wasn't exactly what is going on. Try asking your mom, see how she reacts."
"He disrespected you and your whole family, and didn't contact you until much after he got back. This shows he clearly doesn't care about you as much as you do about him.

"&gt; you're basically saying that you don't trust him to be careful with something that is important to you

Yes, she's saying that. And it's a 100% accurate assessment, so her saying that isn't a problem.

&gt;Does he have a car? Has he gotten into accidents with it?

He got into accidents with her old car, remember?

&gt;every time you tell him no, you're telling him you don't trust him

She shouldn't trust him! He sucks at driving and he hits things!

Why do you think she needs to let him damage her car just so he doesn't have to face the reality that he's a shitty driver?"
"Dear god you need to leave your fiancé. This isn't fair to her at all. You don't even sound like you like her very much, let a lone love her. "
No dude. That's not a reasonable excuse. She's not over him and that automatically makes her not a friend to your relationship. This guy isn't going to prioritize you.

"Both Carolinas make you wait one year and if you happen to be intimate with your soon to be ex, the clock resets (assuming someone is vindictive and tells the judge). There are also no exceptions whatsoever, including infidelity and abuse, so the wait sucks no matter the circumstances."

Being someone's boyfriend doesn't magically grant you mind reading powers. She is shit at communicating and trying to turn that on you. 

She is just way to childish to be in a relationship. "
"How is your sister around the house she's in now? Does she clean without being prompted? Does she have a job? Does she do her own dishes without prompting/leaving in sink? Is she going to do her share of taking out the trash and checking the mail? If you share groceries (which I do not recommend), is she actually going to buy groceries? 

From what you wrote about letting friends stay over for however long she wants, and not already having a DL, there are just some key indicators that she's not ready to move out. I think you are setting yourself for a year of stress and some negative impacts to your relationship with her. I lived with my sister for several years and at times it was stressful but we were always respectful and on the same page. If you are not on the same page, its not going to be pretty.
"
"&gt; Your brother may have anticipated something like this happening

I haven't brought it up much because it makes him sad but I think this was money he was getting together to try help our dad, but then since he died he put it into a trust for me instead

"In the future, I’d recommend using condoms at the very least. Maybe talk to your doctor about a long-acting form of birth control (i love my mirena iud and people have said similar things about the implant). 

It’s possible to get pregnant using the pullout method, I’m not going to lie to you about that. However, it seems more likely that your period is irregular (may be due to stress or the fact that your hormones are all out of whack because of being a teenager). The fact that you had a negative pregnancy test 2 weeks after sex is a good sign! Definitely get a dollar store test and try again ASAP. 

Is your sex partner supportive? Maybe he could help you buy the test?"
"&gt; even if he isn’t hitting on you.

I cannot possibly imagine that he wasn't hitting on OP.

"I'll take a slightly different approach. On days like this, does he blow off plans to spend time with you in favor of playing video games, or is it more like ""it's our day off, so we'll both do whatever""?

Your girlfriend is emotionally blackmailing you and if you give in then she will use this tactic for every difference of opinion you ever have in your relationship.This needs to stop now.
"You should have stayed broken up. It sounds like she only tried to get you back so that she wouldn't have to go on the trip alone if her friend flaked.

I would let her go, both on the trip and out of your life."
"Something isn't sitting right in this situation. Your boyfriend would rather live like this (and by default, let you, daughter #1, and unborn daughter) to appease baby mama? Instead of hiring a lawyer, getting a written out custody agreement that baby mama can't argue, and a set amount he is to pay each month that baby mama can't object to. There is something missing. He claims he won't be able to see his daughter until the custody agreement is finished. How does he know this? Who told him that? Even if that was the case, wouldn't it be worth it to have a set schedule with his daughter? Wouldn't it be awesome to not worry in the back of your head how much money she is going to siphen from you and your child, because your boyfriend is refusing to take real legal responsibly for his daughter.

You are not reacting correctly. There is either some part you are intentionally leaving out or something between your boyfriend and the mother of his other child that you are not aware of. Something isn't adding up, and you should 100% be weary. Dana isn't your problem, the father of your child is making a concious decision to let Dana make these demands and restrictions...

Also, the fact that he is purchasing her weed and cigarettes (C'MON!!!!) instead of reporting her to CPS is... Weird. Failed drug tests, even for weed, can sway a custody case. Sooo... Your boyfriend supplies it to the mother of his child. Right, cool.

Your boyfriend cares *so much* about his daughter and you *don't get it"", but he isn't even willing to take the proper steps to ensure she stays in his life legally. Girl, I hope you are taking notes. Huuuuge red flags. Hope you and unborn daughter enjoying being second to Dana. And maybe prepare yourself to be in Dana's shoes in a few years. 😐😐

Also, I know you you defensive before when someone else said it... But I am saying it again... You (and your boyfriend) had absolutely no business bringing an innocent life into this shit show. I feel for the children in this situation."
"&gt;At my age, I am supposed to be able to be completely responsible for myself, BY myself. I NEED to do everything on my own, even if that means starving and sacrificing sleep and taking up another job. 

Honestly, if you can't learn how to accept help from others your life will be a lot more difficult then it needs to be. Humans aren't hyper-individualistic out of necessity - everyone needs help from others. We've evolved specifically to work together as a group.

Edit; and what the hell is a ""casual ex"" anyways? a FWB she broke things off with? Ex's aren't casual."
I think you need to let her go dude. You two are hardly in a relationship. If you see eachother once a week you've barely even seen her IRL 12 times so far in 3 months? That's ridiculous. 
Isn’t she talking about him going it at their home? I wouldn’t consider that public. I have a husband and two sons and nut touching is a constant here. 
"Stop focusing on saying no.  Change the conversation (if you still need to) to one of priorities.  Make out the list of what you have in flight project wise and routine work.

You aren't ever having to say no, rather you're focusing on what they have as the most important work.  You end up looking like a superstar. "
"Fuck that dude! Clearly he's not over his ex or he wouldn't care about appearances THAT much and honestly he's just low key being mean to you. Maybe you should consider leaving his ass for even talking to you like that, trust me he doesn't deserve you. You go be happy without his bullying. You do you!"
"Crazy parents gonna be crazy.

Your boyfriend isn’t crazy so just chill.

I’m seeing a lot of leave but why? 

Your boyfriend stood up for you, neither of you are crazy religious so it doesn’t effect you or him. Wouldn’t be an issue if you had kids etc.

I personally think it would be unfair to tar your boyfriend with the same brush as his parents - especially when he’s made it pretty clear he doesn’t agree with their views. We can’t choose our family."

"As someone in their early 20s and currently a student nurse, the next update OP writes better be “I broke up with her and I’m suing”. You can’t fuck around with other people’s body fluids. We treat everything as potentially infectious especially if you have open wounds. This girl is practically 30 doing stupid shit like this and she doesn’t give a fuck. There is absolutely no benefit in staying with this chick. "

"Start looking for another place. If she didn’t get rid of them after he smashed the patio furniture 2 years ago, she never will.
He’s violent, enough said, get away from there."
Do you just want him to KNOW or do you want him to CARE? I'm sure he knows you think he's awful. If he cared.. He wouldn't fuck around on your sister. 
He’s not a good person. He’s controlling and abusive. These are not characteristics of good people.
"&gt; Timescale-wise we're talking a few months since she's lived here permanently,

Thats still longer than you shouldve allowed her to abuse your daughter.

&gt; This was the first time my wife's every hit me, so it's not quite her go-to reaction

But its not her first time shes physically abused your daughter, so it is fair to say its her go-to reaction.

&gt; I absolutely do appreciate that trying to bond when she's a stepparent is really hard.

Its not so hard that she should feel the need to abuse her step child in order to bond. Controlling and abusing is not bonding."
"Er, no. Even considering abandoning your wife who is dying of cancer for his own selfish reasons is utterly disgusting. "
"What kills me about people like that is that treatment could've been less expensive, less invasive, and with less horrible outcomes if he had gone earlier.  "
Oh. I feel so sorry for him. This is his only chance to feel like he's funny.
No. Then she is still giving in to his ridiculous and controlling behavior. 
"The problem with you being financially comfortable is that you can easily end up being used. 

For the health of the relationship, it is time for you to demand more. By demanding almost nothing of him, you are enabling his self-indulgence, and subconsciously he is not prioritizing you because you are not prioritizing yourself. He is taking his cues from you. 

I am not blaming this situation on you, not at all! 

Nonetheless, you need to make some demands. For instance: 

He needs to get a part time job by the end of June at the latest. 

The next time he sees this girl, he is introducing her to you. No more dates *at all* until this happens. 

Upon meeting her, you can get a read about what their dynamic is. Trust your instincts. Look at how they act more than their words. What vibe do you get from them? From her? Behonest with yourself. 

If they seem like a couple, or if you get any whiff that she is in love with it has a crush on him, then you are within your rights to ask him not to see her any more if he wants to remain in this relationship with you. 

If he pushes back and tries to call you controlling, then he is free to find another living situation and do as he pleases. 

You sound like a catch. You do not need to beg for the leftover scraps of someone's attention. "
"Just because she hasn’t outright hit your child doesn’t mean she won’t. Had she hit you before last night? First time for everything. There will be a first time she hits your daughter as well. Your job is to protect your daughter from this abuse. Do not attend therapy with abusers, it’s not recommended. The fact that she puts the responsibility to ‘fix’ things on you shows she accepts no responsibility for her abuse of both you and your child. Do your job.

P.S. what she’s doing even without hitting her is still abuse. Don’t lie to yourself about that."
"My best friend has dentures (her teeth were damaged from whichever antibiotic it is that stains permanent teeth if taken as a child, tetracycline maybe?, and in general she just had bad teeth genetics). 

She also has a new boyfriend and was nervous about taking her teeth out in front of him. So I get it. 

Her boyfriend definitely didn't run for the hills, and his reasoning was the same as yours. He wanted her to be completely comfortable around him. 

Even knowing he wouldn't run, she was still nervous. I don't think it's a nervous you can just get rid of. You just have to make that leap. 

This will be the only time you'll be so nervous about it though (with this boyfriend). Just keep that in mind, maybe it will help you rip the band-aid off."
"My wife has trichotillomania, she is always trying to find something to stop herself. Have you ever found anything to help?"

So, you both kinda screwed up here by having a kid without first discussing what your hard limits were. Please make sure you start doing that before you keep having this fight at every step of his development.

&gt;""Whatever, it's not like I'm going to win anyway.""

I don't think you should back down. Just a heads up that if you want your marriage to go well (which is a big if, by the way - sometimes people find they're incompatible and it hurts everyone for them to stay together) then trying to make him feel not like that should be your top priority. That's a really strong message from him in terms of how he thinks things are going. It'd be wise not to ignore it, or you might find that both of you lose down the line."
" I don’t really think “they won’t remember the pain” is a valid reason for putting them through an unnecessary procedure, but that’s just me. "
"Yeah I was having deja vu too. I think the woman was much older though. It was bizarre because prior to that, some woman had posted here asking if she should meet with her son’s older autistic gf to try and build rapport. Lots of people *swore* it was the son who was posting his side of things after the woman (his mom, presumably) posted hers, but I think it ended up not being the case. It was eerily similar though. "
Why is amsterdam bad? I'm visiting there in a week
"I was there two weeks ago for three days recently and it was a perfect amount of time. Day 1: red light district &amp; coffee shops, day 2: bike around and visit clog/cheese farm, visit parks and picnic, day 3: bunch of museums. We could have stayed longer but saw a decent amount and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Have fun! "
"Well, at first it was innocent. His boss was our age so we’ll all hung out. She would buy my ex gifts, but she also bought gifts for me too. I thought we were all friends. I had no problem with the two of them hanging out alone.  
It started slowly, but soon snowballed...he would go to work early and stay late to “help” boss lady. He would also help her outside of work(she had a disability that prevented her from driving, among other things). 
He would ALWAYS answer her texts/ calls because “she may need help at work.”  
Eventually she started having relationship troubles (because she was spending more time at work than at home) and leaned of my ex for support. One more reason he gave me for why he had to be at her beck and call...
So the signs are: increased text activity,  he/she finding more ways to be with said person, staying late at work, spending less time with you. 
Idk, it can be different for everyone. Sometimes it’s just a gut feeling. "
And you willingly have sex with someone who calls women hoes? What does he think about you? 
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought it odd that he assumed he could easily immigrate to NZ. From what I understand it's pretty difficult?
"Words matter. When someone says ""yeah I'm married but blah blah blah"" that gets a different response than ""I'm married and she's a wonderful person and she doesn't deserve what I've been thinking about her."""
"Yep, it could be that she's overcompensatingly cheerful, trying to present a light workplace mood so that she can be distracted from what's going on with mom. I could see my younger self doing something like that, with good intentions and awful results. "
"Or he has cheated on more than 1 girlfriend (I know a guy who is 35 and has cheated in ALL his relationships, including the marriage he is in now) and it's pretty safe to assume this is a pattern and a personality trait."
"&gt;I can generally tell fairly quickly because they make my skin crawl, no matter how normal they seem and people think I am being judgmental for not liking so-and-so when he's so nice, whatever is my problem, etc. 

Can I ask you a question? What do you do in this situation? I'm working with someone like this and any time I've even suggested he gives me a weird feeling, my co-workers brush me off and talk about how over the top nice and kind he is."
Your GF gets different things socially from her friends than she gets from you.  Be glad she's not expecting you to be all things for her.
"I mean, I've had sex several times with my boyfriend where I didn't get off but I was still happy and satisfied afterward. Maybe you guys should try tantric sex. You're focusing too much on orgasm. "
Well they started when him and his wife were still together. He was replacing her before they were divorced and she didn’t let it be a smooth transition? She “made it harder” for them? I guess the punishment for your wife acting out while you’re replacing her is posting revenge porn. Harsssh
"&gt;I know that she's absolutely resistant to therapy and is going to take me telling her this as a huge rejection (""So even you don't want to help me"") and I'm really evaluating if this is worth risking the friendship dying.

It kinda sounds like she wants the benefit of therapy (someone to give her validation, someone to provide her with a listening ear, someone to give her advice) without paying for it or doing any of the work. I'm guessing she doesn't understand that good friends don't use each other in this way and that's why people go to therapists.

Maybe tell her that you feel like the questions she poses to you are way about your paygrade.  Tell her she wants validation for choices that you personally wouldn't make and that you'd like for her to stop putting her in that position.  Because it's not fair to either of you.  

Do not offer to pay for therapy for her again.  That's a really sweet gesture, but that's way above the call of duty for friend.  And she may actually be the type of person who'd thrive in therapy to an expensive degree.   Cath could need at least a year of weekly sessions to reprogram herself into a functional adult.  Unless the costs associated with something like this are totally trivial to you, don't make yourself responsible for her."
It's bears all the way down...
This.  When I read the title I thought it meant she recently found out that he'd done it previously not that he'd literally sat there and simmered for three years before doing it.  That's a special kind of toolbag.  
"Yeah I think you are in the right. You're not even asking him to stop being friends with her, just that he tells her when she oversteps boundaries. I don't think she+the snap is the big problem here, but rather that your BF wouldn't even tell her it could make you uncomfortable? Sounds like he doesn't want her to stop with her flirty behavior."
I think maybe talk to him about what you’re thinking as this feels kind of like it’s bordering on fetish territory and you need to make sure you’re both on the same page with it.  
"I'm a bi woman dating a straight man. He has NEVER implied that my sexuality is somehow his real life porn. He is highly respectful of me and other women and I have never had to ask, ""Does he respect me less because of my sexuality?"""
"It may not be controlling, but it is seriously insecure. People have different relationships with different people, for myriad reasons, history, shared experience, adventures, intimacies, inside jokes...it's confusing to me that you wouldn't find this scene rather lovely, and indicative of the close relationships she's able to sustain, and not immediately find it so threatening. It has nothing to do with you whatsoever. "
You're overreacting. The guy was clearly buying drinks to impress her friend. Take her at her word.
"She cheated on you. If I were in your shoes, I’d dump her- wouldn’t stay in such a creepy relationship. There’s a difference to being “controlling” and “knowing where your gf is”, you don’t just show up at a party without your gf/bf without telling them, and it’s weird that she expects you to consider that as normal. "
"I was in a similar situation before, same exact late night phone call, and deflection tactics.  Tried to blame things on me, for ""not trusting her""   I would get out if I were you, I waited 6 more months and she was cheating the whole time.  Shitty situation, but better to just leave her stuff on the curb.  Good luck. "
"Asking for favors is something that we all need to do from time to time - asking for help when you truly need it makes you strong, not weak.

I would tell him that you're in a potentially dangerous situation with your boyfriend and you need a place to stay temporarily if that's at all feasible. Let him know that you are more than happy to do household chores in return, and pay him back when you are able.

Do you have a job or are you looking into getting one?"

Do you talk to your husband about any of this? what does he have to say? would he help you stay active enough to avoid talking to SIL during family events?"
"Okay, no. That's creepy. You shouldn't have those on your phone. It would be WAY too easy for those to fall into the wrong hands."
"I don’t know about her situation. My ex did not fair so well—lost gf and job. Out of respect for my current s/o I don’t have anymore communication with the ex. Not that would ever want to anyway. 
Oh, and he was super lazy about getting me back. I don’t even recall. I think he thought I would automatically take him back. Jerk. "
Did you get to see the clogs ripening on the vine?
Abortion isn’t something women choose on a whim. She’s carefully considered it and made a really tough decision. 
"I don't know enough to say whether or not it would be illegal but it's absolutely unethical. I'd feel so gross knowing that I was married to someone who felt it was okay to do that, it completely strips their right to consent. "
She didn't even try. Didn't even consider it. Her stance is not about snoring.
Years ago? We used almost the same thing but with ascii far before emojis. It's not some crazy new thing. 
"It's weird, I know when my girlfriend looks nice in public and have seen people looking, it doesn't bother me as much because I know she's with me. Sometimes I catch eye contact with some dudes, just laugh a bit and shake my head. Now I would understand his concern if you were throwing sideways looks back at them or something similar."
"""Cheating is ok as long as no one finds out"""
"This is all really hard. I’m sorry you and your wife are going through this. It sounds like her mentality of one day at a time is the right one. 

We make these plans for our lives then life gets in the way. It’s frustrating and painful sometimes. But there are things over which we have no control. 

Have you looked into therapy for yourself? Having someone else to talk these things through with sounds like it will be very helpful to you.

Finally, lots of people have kids in their 40s. I know it isn’t ideal for you, but nothing in this situation is ideal. "
"You guys seem to have gotten married way too soon. If you'd like to try and save the marriage, maybe suggest therapy together. He doesn't seem like he'd respond well to you bringing up his resentment yourself. I don't think this marriage can be saved. He's incredibly hateful and you've only been married a year! "
"&gt;I think you should let this guy be ""comfortable,"" with being single

lol yes. i had an ex boyfriend would didn't lift a finger when i had to pack up my apartment in preparation to move somewhere else together \(he had been living with me at my apt for the past 3 months, and on and off before that\). On the night before i had to be out of my apartment, i had to call another person to come over to help me pack stuff \(as my boyfriend had conveniently gone home to his parents place that night\).

He didn't really have an excuse, he just said that he would help when ""i had something concrete for him to do"", or he would say I'm being too obsessive about it.... he'd basically say  anything he could to get out of helping. He mostly just played video games and complained that I was in a bad mood \(because I was, since i was doing everything myself\). Over the years I have helped him pack, find places to live, move, i've written papers for him, i've called in sick to work in order to help him finish assignments, made him hundreds of meals...

Some people are just lazy. And if he's not lazy, then he should have a reason for not helping you. Since he doesn't, I don't think there is a reason to justify his unhelpful ness. There must be some other reason for it and I cannot imagine that it is a good one. He sounds like he just kind of sucks."
Could he possibly be using these condoms with this same male friend?
People who don't respect your feelings or physically hold you are not good partners.
jesus christ you need to tell him RIGHT NOW
"“Some sort of bomb”

He made her have an abortion and then had sex with her best friend while she went through an obvious mental health crisis.

When people are having a mental health crisis they generally aren’t thinking clearly.  He knew that and took advantage of it. "
"I’m sorry man, but you should really look into some therapy yourself, because it really seems like you have narcissistic personally disorder, or *some* sort of personality disorder. 

You can’t see how pressuring your wife into an abortion causing her to have a mental breakdown, then actually having the emotional capacity to sleep with someone a few *months* after separating isn’t completely and totally messed up? Not to mention *with someone she knows and sees often still?????* 

Then you have the audacity to say she “baited” you into it, as if you’re the victim in schtupping her friend??? No one forced you into it, and I’m sure your wife expected you to love her enough to not even be able to fathom sleeping with her *friend* mere *months* after separating so that she can get a handle on her mental health. 


How is that something that you could feel sound about? How is that something you can stomach with no issues at all? And then to go online and try to get a bunch of strangers to tell you you’re right and she’s wrong? 

There’s honestly no way this relationship with you is healthy for her. I really hope she gets into therapy and sees that. "
You won’t get him to understand. His concerns are valid considering the facts. Sorry. I think he’s right.
"It's not a matter of him 'letting you' go. You're an adult woman and can go anywhere you want. The issue is will this cause a strain on your relationship, and is that a trade\-off your willing to make to go climbing?

It's also not a matter of trust. For many people the idea of their significant other camping and possibly sharing a tent with someone of the opposite sex for three days and three nights goes outside the boundaries that they have in a monogamous relationship. Being faithful is more than simply not having sex with other people. Going on a one\-on\-one trip in close quarters is considered an intimate act for many people and there is nothing wrong with him not being comfortable with that. "
"It's his wife's house too though, so at least some compromise should be made here. 

I think the line needs to be drawn at constantly eating out. If his parents are that picky they'll stop coming over so much on their own, everyone wins."
"Imagine having someone comment on your physical appearance every time you leave the house, even if you’re wearing pajamas and look like shit. If they have the right to say something to me, then I sure as hell have the right to say whatever I want back at them. It’s a power play and the only way to win is to take back that power. OP did the right thing. "
This whole comment is truth and beauty.

Regional and cultural differences are real. These are not intended as snark. It’s a valid, differing point of view.

But dads acting overly cautious of girls bodies makes (can make) us feel bad for a lifetime. Cover up, dress decently, boys only want one thing—those comments can make us feel our bodies are bad. "
"So it just occurred to me, is your dad on your bank account? Cause once you are 18 your absolutely have to remove him. He is controlling and will fuck you over financially the next time you are planning to do something that will give you independence."
"I’m currently in your situation. And the best thing you can do to spend time with him is free stuff. Go on hikes, walks, picnics. Anything that gets him out of the house will help him without making him feel bad about his financial situation. My bf and I have date nights were I cook at his place. I get extra of everything to help him out low key without pressuring him into receiving financial assistance. 

Right now he needs your company and needs someone to vent. You should let him do that without trying to solve his problem. Eventually he’ll ask for help when he needs it. Until then get creative with dates that get u both off the couch without spending money ie bike rides, basketball, badminton in park. "
Thank you.  I'm in a bit of shock after this.  Just never imagined I would walk in and see her like that.
"""when someone reveals their true selves to you, believe them""

It's been one year and he's already cheating on you and tries to justify it with saying ""well, you were doing evening classes and we saw each other less?"" Fuck that. He slept with her once and was planning to do so again and would have kept going if you didn't find out. 

Also, what kind of fucking idiot sleeps with a tinder date without a condom, requiring plan B the next day? 

Leave before you contract a disease. "
"Imo your bf brought this entirely on himself. I see people in the comments going 'but she said after three years, he's just going according to her timeline' - that's not how it works! Marriage is serious, it's a commitment between two people like you said. It's something that should be discussed carefully to make sure that both of you are on the same page, not 'oh, well one time she said she wants to date three years before marrying so proposing at two years should fit'. The only thing that should be surprising about a proposal is where and when, both parties should know that it's coming. 

If anything this highlights a big problem in your marriage, imo - he's not listening to you, especially if you had told him before that you weren't ready to be committed - it's not clear whether you told him after he proposed or before. If anything his actions during the proposal - again, not listening to you - mimic the rest, lol. 

Up to you whether you want to fix this, but he might have just saved you some time and energy. If the two of you do decide to work on things then the first thing to establish is that he needs to listen and communicate with you and slow down. "
"You just have to get over it. He was 19 when you started dating, how would he have possibly taken you to Paris?"
"Actually studies show that couples who wait longer than 2-3 years to get engaged divorce at a higher rate and are less happy than those who get engaged in the sweet spot. Usually if they don't get engaged by then it's because they aren't actually the right fit and know it, but inertia carries them into marriage anyway."
"This ^

Also,
If a proposal is public, or hell, even if it isn't, I feel like it should be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon before the fancy proposal part.

In a relationship, you both need to be on the same page. This means you two need to excel at communication with each other. If this isn't the case, you definitely weren't ready.

Contact him (letter is a great idea!) and let him know that you still love him and still want to be in the relationship. Explain why you're not ready and the rest is in his court.

"I didn't see anything negative about you in that comment.  Nowhere did he say you don't care about this girl or her health.  But at this point I think you need to care about you.  She's in her own place now and obviously doesn't want company.  I know it hurts, and I know you're worried, but sometimes it's best for everybody to just move on.  I'm sorry, because you sound like a really good boyfriend."
"6 months is not a long time OP. If you have core differences in how you view life and your futures, it means you’re not compatible.

Netflix and chill means he wants to have sex. You could not go. You could bring someone. Or you could tell him that you you only want to watch Netflix and hangout. No sex. 
"You're so right, how dumb of me to keep drinking during the date! If a friend told me she'd been on a date and drank the same way I did, I would have lectured her on it. It's crazy how when you're put in a situation like this, it's difficult to think as logically as you normally would. Also, I was drunk enough to not know where I was going and had trouble finding the subway; however, I didn't ask for help and pretended to know where I was going, maybe that's why he accompanied me?"
"You frame it as though she's the one who should be making this compromise but in all reality it's better for your family to go to Dubai. You have a kid now. Enough. You come second. If you want to be in the kid's life and support your woman you obviously have to make a hard choice, but a good choice. I know your career is important and nobody is saying not to practice IT but if she's the breadwinner here that is OK. It seems like that is the bigger problem to you"

"Please break up with your girlfriend. You're not just ""not ready"" to be married/have a kid, you actually just don't want to be with her. This SUCKS for both parties, but you need to do the right thing for you both. Do not continue to string along your girlfriend. She deserves to be with someone who loves her entire person and who has the same wants and goals as she does. You deserve to be with someone who you love as an entire person, including someone you are sexually attracted to.

Yes, this breakup will be HARD. Yes, your girlfriend will be super, super upset. However, long term you two will both be happier apart. If you continue on your future is going to be one of these options:

* You get married and have a kid(s) asap to make her happy. You're miserable because you weren't ready for any of that. This turns into resentment. You both end up miserable and end up divorced, or together but also miserable.

* You stay together but don't get married and have a kid. In a few more years your girlfriend finally gives you an ultimatum. Whether or not you follow through, she is massively resentful of you. You're miserable and probably break up. Except now you're several years older and have essentially wasted a good portion of your 20s. No, it wouldn't be ""too late,"" to still find someone else/have kids, but it won't have been a good way for either of you to have spent your time. Your girlfriend will be especially upset because her goal is marriage/kids and you'll have essentially strung her along for years. "
"&gt; Friendships can blossom into something more. It just takes time and patience.


I don't recommend this view because it implies that he can *expect* friendship to blossom into something more, as long as he is patient enough and sticks around long enough for that to happen. That's not fair to OP and it's not fair to the girl either (since really he'd just be playing at friendship in the hope of something more). 


It's probably not what you meant but I wanted to address it for anyone who doesn't get that. "
"&gt; I *do* want to go out, even with our couples friends and my friends, but when we’re invited, she says she doesn’t want to. She doesn’t drink or act like that with really anybody but her new friends. Not even me. THAT is my primary concern.

Ok, so maybe she feels comfortable with this new group of friends? You've known her as a person who doesn't like to go out or drink and maybe she met this new group of friends, clicked with them and felt comfortable enough to come out of her shell."
"But wait another week or so, to get your feelings back on track. Right your emotions might have the upper hand, and that's not the time to reply. If the wedding is still several weeks away, take your time. "
"I would think it reasonable for him to not be okay with it.

You don't have a Costco to work at? Or a unionized Kroger? Any normal bar tender can earn 20/hr with tips on Friday &amp; Saturday. You usually start by being a bar back.

You were supposed to put in your entry level dues from ages 18 - 24. Sorry you gotta do it now. "
Personally I would figure it if you are physically straight before trying a relationship.  Can you have sex with a woman?  It wouldn’t be fair to her if you aren’t capable of that. 
"Maybe some counseling would be beneficial. She is really way over anxious as it is, and this obviously shows it. "
"you're only thinking about breaking up? i prefer to be relatively bare as well but it being a prerequisite for sexual activity, where i absolutely MUST be clean shaven is exhausting and unrealistic, at least to me."
"It just doesn't work though. I'm like OP, I just yell the most vicious thing I can think of, because it's the only thing that works. You're not engaging in an argument. You're demonstrating hostility in the face of hostility. Taking the language out would defang it, make it ineffective, and they'd just laugh about it."
"Yeah, the Brazilian bit is the clincher here. This is not anything to do with you seeing his family, this is just about him being a jerk. Time to turn this on\-off relationship firmly to OFF."
"You break up constantly. He criticizes you all the time.

Break up permanently and find someone better suited for you. Sheesh."
"&gt;my mother is my everything

That's your problem, right there. She's more important to you than your own wants and desires, more important to you than girlfriends.

You might not want people to tell you to walk away, but you don't have a choice unless you want to stay in this unhealthy man-baby relationship.

Either you seize your adulthood, or you'll be a ""mummy's boy"" through some of the most defining years of your life. I'll tell you this, a girlfriend won't put up with being second-best to ""mummy"".

You say ""her love"" is affecting you. It's not love. If she was demonstrating love, she'd be letting you become a man, and letting you make your own mistakes, and learn your own lessons - painfully if need be. She's not. She's mollycoddling you, trying to protect from the very things which will help you mature.

You need to cut down on the contact. And I mean right down. Stop picking up the phone every time she calls. Go days without talking to her. Go bungee jumping. Go parachuting. Go drag-racing. Or at least go and do something that pushes your risk horizon, else you'll be in that cotton-wool bubble forever."
"I am not yet married or have any kids, but I have told my mom that if I ever had kids my dad is not allowed to be with without me and no matter how many years go by that will not change. If he did it to a daughter and wife he can do it to a grandchild too. 

Overall cutting them out, is it a pretty distinguishable feeling of “wow without them my life is o so much easier and stress free”?"
"But, there are about 8 Saturday’s and Sunday’s in a month. She’s watching her nephew 2 or 3 of those days. How is this adding up to be such an issues?"
"She's trained you to  put her feelings ahead of  your natural progress in growing  up.   

You need some help to see that this is a bad situation.  Do they have a counseling center at your school?  If so, arrange to see someone who can help you turn *yourself* around because the problem is not your mother, the problem is your inability to separate from her."
"For some reason a lot of parents don't find this clinginess/nosiness to be poor behavior. Like, they think it's cute and fun that their kid is interested in their grownup friends and wants to talk to the grownups. It's infuriating!
"
"That was a super rude and insensitive thing for him to say. If he's ever put you down before, or if there's any indication that this might be part of a larger pattern of undermining behavior, then I'd go ahead and end it now. Your partner has no right to dictate how your body should look.

If he does show genuine remorse, then you should take some time to think about what it will take for you to feel secure in this relationship again, communicate that to him, and keep an eye out for other red-flag behavior. "
"All this stuff just kinda happened to you huh?

You got this woman pregnant at least 4 times. You actively chose this life. "
"Oh no. No. Your friend has been a shitty friend because of a serious mental illness. My guess is that she cannot handle as much as she used to, and probably feels miserable and guilty that she’s not hanging out with you as much as you’d like. She doesn’t need “tough love.” She needs compassion.  

That being said, it sounds like reaching out at the same level as before doesn’t work for you either, which is fine. Reach out as often as you can with love and compassion, whether that’s once a month or once a semester. If you need to let the friendship go for your own sanity, that’s fine too. But she’s not being a shitty friend AT you. She’s doing it because she’s going through a rough time."
Are you for real?! How anyone could be this blind to reality is beyond me. 
"I very much wanted to be on your side at the beginning of this. When you mentioned not wanting him to get into bed with his outside clothes on I thought...ok, that's a little bit picky but it may be a good idea, especially if he works outdoors or if she has allergies or something...but then you mentioned the sunscreen. Do you really expect the man to shower off every time he wants to get into bed? Because of a little sunscreen or moisturizer or whatever *might* be on his skin? His comforter is touching the floor? REALLY? And the air conditioner thing - I get really hot at night. If I couldn't sleep because I was overheating and you got up and turned off the AC that I had just turned on because you think the *filter is dirty*...honestly I would probably ask for a divorce right then and there. You ARE a nag, and your requests are not normal. I consider myself a very clean and neat person but honey, you are neurotic about cleanliness and I don't blame your husband for being sick of it. Living with you sounds uncomfortable and exhausting. You should probably see a therapist about your obsessive need for cleanliness. "
"Dear Jesus God.

This man is an abuser.  I know, he doesn't hit you, but that's only a small fraction of what abuse involves.  What he's doing here, methodically beating down your self-esteem is *abuse.*

It doesn't matter if you lose the weight, and you know that because he's already laid out the other goalposts:  the stretchmarks will have to somehow disappear, and then he will torture you about the cellulite which can't be treated, and once your teeth are fixed he'll inevitable complain that your boobs are too small and why do they hang the way they do?

There will never be enough plastic surgery, diet or exercise that will sufficiently ""fix"" you.  **That's the point of the exercise.**  He wants you to be always off-balance, always unsure of yourself, always full of self-doubt and empty of self-esteem.

It makes him happy, to do this.  That's why he does it.  He will never ever stop.  No, there is no magic arrangement of words that will make him see the light.  Yes, you are communicating quite clearly.

Could you Google a few things for me?

* lovebombing

* trauma bonding

* cycle of abuse

* gaslighting

* Issendai sick systems

I'm guessing at least three of these will sound familiar.  After four years, I'm also guessing that trauma bonding has taken place--you know, the ""rollercoaster ride"" with its low lows and incredibly high highs?  And the highs are SO FUCKING HIGH that you convince yourself that he's finally going to change?

It's addiction.  Trauma bonding creates an addiction to the abuser.  If you are at this point, realize that it's just a physiological response to the absense of stress, and you'd be feeling this with any man who abused you:  it's not a sign of love, just science.

Please get therapy while you have some self-esteem left.  Whatever you have to do to get therapy, **do it.**  It is really just that important.  Your abuser will not stop until all spark of individuality and resistance is crushed, until you just give in and numbly go through the motions of living as you wait for death.

I wish this were an exaggeration, but it is not.  Assemble your Team You and let them know what's going on.  Once again, get therapy:  your husband has installed malware and you need help getting your brain back to its factory setting.  Reinforce your social network.  Double down on activities that give you pleasure.  Until you find the strength to leave him, learn how to gray rock: it won't fix the problem, which is that your husband is an abuser, but it will provide some relief.  Go to loveisrespect and take the quiz.  Read *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft.

I hope you find your way free."
"I think that's an oversimplification - she doesn't like being called bossy because she thinks her rules aren't unreasonable, not because she doesn't like the word. If my husband called me bossy I'd be hurt by that too, it all boils down to the original issue of what is reasonable."
"Questions: 

Did the women Ask you to rev your engine?

Did you rev your engine because the crowd was mostly women? 

As always, flip this situation around. Your girlfriend knows a really cool party trick. She does said trick in front of a bunch of dudes and gets lots of attention. Later on, some women ask her to repeat party trick and she says lol nah. It seems like the likes the male attention right? 


That being said, she is def overreacting by escalating this to cheating. You need to talk to her about how to express her insecurities. And if you revved your engine specifically for the ladies, yeah I mean that’s kind of douchey and inconsiderate to do in front of your gf. "
"I would predict her native culture is one where women, regardless of their age, might be less self-assertive than, say, American women."
Girl why is this 20yo hanging around 17yo girls??? Idc if you’re over age of consent. Age of consent where I live is 16 and it’s still goddamn weird. He sounds like an idiot and shouldn’t be getting between two friends. Both of you need to kick him to the curb! 
"It's weird that you've had serious conversations about this and she keeps moving things. I have a problem with not putting things back where they belong, but I do believe things have their certain ""home"". Towels in towel cabinet. Mouthwash in medicine cabinet, strainer in second drawer under the utensils, etc etc. Do you think she is intentionally making you crazy? Does she resent you for something? 

Can you buy a label maker and label where things go? "
"Why do you think she is bad for him?

Right now your only issue seems to be that she doesn't talk as much as the people around her... why does that make you dislike her? 

You don't have to spend time with people you don't like. It might cost you this friendship. He's been with her for five years and it seems to be working for him.  "
"Umm, what about the ""fuck me"" eyes at dinner last night? That sounds like an extreme boundary crossing."
"&gt;  In that event, if things get physical, your boyfriend will be the one taking punches.

Well he was up on the balcony"
"Your boyfriend has NO RIGHT to tell you how you should handle this. I am sorry, YOU were being trashy?! You were OVERREACTING? He clearly has no idea what street harassment feels like and has zero interest in trying to empathize. Honestly this is a huge red flag. He doesn't seem like someone you can count on if you were to get assaulted. "
Right?? Like that’s sexual assault at the least. Kinda just sounds like rape to me 
"I don't know what else to tell you. You have a whole thread of people telling you to be honest with your boyfriend, but you clearly made up your mind about how you feel about yourself and the situation before you wrote this post. If you're just looking for validation about what you did, you're not going to find it here."
"I feel like their relationship is pretty close to nuke town considering he's willing to sleep on the floor because of her BS... but yeah, you're right I think. Unless she gets therapy just having a separate sleeping space won't solve the problem."
It's also hard to  sympathize when she is very obviously and actively in these comments avoiding responsibility and any mention of her being the one who needs help. 
"Yes in Australia and yes cost of living is high. It is low at $25p/w which is why we stressed to them that it will be going up once they are on their feet with their jobs.

As I said in my post I was the same at their age \- a messy, wasteful teenage boy. My parents were tolerant of me for a while as I made the transition to adulthood and I feel we are doing the same."
"The bottom of your feet also touch the bed and the sheets and if you've been walking around your house barefoot, you're transferring that dirt to your bed. 

There is NO SUCH THING as completely clean."
"Other cultures actually do have the concepts of outside clothes! I grew up in Russia and we changed clothes when we came home. It's like wearing your sweats inside, only you do it all the time, not just when you're lounging. Similarly, you'd wear your ""house clothes"" in the morning until you were ready to leave. We never wore shoes in the house, either, and we still don't. "
Is that normal for a MOH to book extravagant things like a boat without consulting anyone and then afterwards tell everyone to pay for it?? That seems a bit crazy. 
"Yeah, reading through the comments and I'm pretty convinced people are right. IDGAF about religion but you're being annoyingly angsty and disrespectful. Rebel out of view of your mom like a dignified person."
"For reals. He might be a cool cheating lying POS, but he’s still a lying cheating POS."
"Next time when he says ""I wish I had a hot wife"", tell him you wish you were married to a gentleman. If he says you're fat, ask him to look in the mirror for a change. Ask him if he thinks he's Prince Charming or something."
"No, he texted someone who was on vacation, clearly not working and contributed to make fun of them. I wouldn't apologize, I'd probably just bring it up with him when back and say that I'm sick of the jealousy and pettiness. "
Your parents didn’t know your 15 year old sister was missing for days? This whole story sounds like bullshit or either your sister needs more responsible guardians

Actually I've learned a lot about relationships by reading this sub every week. Reading all the solutions helps me come up with solutions myself when I'm in similar situations.
Being too exhausted hasn't stopped you form hanging out with your new girlfriend however. 
"Ok good, I'm glad your security situation isn't as bad as I thought. Definitely speak to the women around you and get them to knock some sense into the guys.

If you have a cell phone, then tell them that you will phone them immediately if something happens. You need to be able to enjoy your life and not have to live like a nun, especially since they didn't even believe you at first."
"This relationship seems so one-sided. It seems like she has no opportunities to initiate intimacy, and is (sadly) accepting the scraps you give her when you are so drunk and sloppy that it can't possibly be very enjoyable for her. Because you are too weak willed to stick to your convictions. You are using this poor girl so hard, OP. You've been exclusive for 2 months and her resentment is only going to get worse, or she will find someone else who treats her like a partner, not a drunken sex toy. "
Some people are ready to settle after a year. You should break up with her and let her find someone that will understand her point of view.
"It’s abusive. I think you might have grown up around behaviors like this and normalized it a little, since you just referred to it as “childish” in a different comment and think that he must have learned his lesson. He’s not gonna learn this lesson until she moves out and never speaks to him again =\ highly doubt this will end other abusive and nasty behaviors from him, because that sort of insanity and cruelty doesn’t spring from nowhere."
My guess is she's not actually single. 
Your boyfriend is embarrassed by your lived experiences. That’s not a healthy relationship.
and free the dog from this nightmare too - it clearly is MISERABLE in these surroundings
"But you wouldn’t be having it “for the heck of it” it would be to foster closeness and emotional bonding with you and your girlfriend. She might have been cool with waiting two months ago, but if you have no idea when you’ll be ready to start fucking regularly, she’s just on the hook waiting and wondering what’s so wrong with her that you won’t have sex. If you have given her your reasons for waiting, great, but telling her “eventually” and keeping things so up in the air is just unfair. Clearly this bothers her more than she tells you and your friend blabbing about your past only compounded whatever doubts she already had. So what’s stopping you? I’m not saying you have to have sex with her every day starting right now, I’m not saying she’s owed sex because you were promiscuous in the past. I do think you need to figure out WHAT she could do to help make you more comfortable. And what you both could do to bring fun, mutually enjoyable sex into your relationships."
"The end result is the same though, the dog is not toilet-trained. Do you have a doggie door so he can take himself outside to go when he needs to without having to alert someone to take him out? If he will really toilet on command, why can't you and fiance establish a routine where you take him out several times a day at set times and command him to go to the toilet (and get a dog walker to come in the middle of the day to do the same) so that he simply doesn't have enough poop or pee left on board between times to have accidents?"

Talking about it will embarrass both people. Just ride it out and you'll get back to normal friend territory naturally

"&gt;  I realize I am too generous of a person. It makes me feel good to help others,

That's a wonderful trait but there are, unfortunately, people who will take advantage of that and will bleed you dry if you let them. Your bf (hopefully soon to be ex) is one of those people. Dump him now, focus on yourself and then when you're ready, go find someone who will not only genuinely appreciate your generosity but will also reciprocate it. I guarantee that person is out there and attainable, but you won't ever find him while you're still with this asshole."
People wouldn't think it's fine for a 23 year old guy's 28 year old GF to take his 15 year old brother across states for 5 days without telling anyone. I would absolutely think she was fucking the teenage boy.

There's a good chance that birth control can help with this quite a bit. She needs to see a doctor about this ASAP.
Don't fantasize about leaving him and finding someone better. Just do it. You have given this guy every opportunity to actually change. You need to face reality. He is never going to morph into a brand new person. He is who he is. You don't want to be with him. You don't have a future with him.

It's still selfish and an asshole thing to do. No excuses.
"I don't think he thinks you enjoy fighting, I think he enjoys riling you up because he doesn't care about your feelings. He doesn't care that you get upset with him because you're still fulfilling the role of his bang maid, he just has to ignore you and minimize you. Girl, you deserve better. 

Edited to add that just love is not enough. Respect for each other and each other's time is extremely important and entirely lacking here. "
Maybe you should reconsider dating someone who will never stop being ashamed of you and your life because of his deepsetted insecurities

"""Please, call me Dr. F."" or ""Actually, I prefer Dr. Last Name in the office!"" is totally okay. Keep your tone light and there shouldn't be any issues. If they insist on saying your first name after that, a firmer, more assertive tone is called for, and is also totally appropriate. ""Again, it's Doctor F."" If you feel weird doing that, you could try the old ""Susan is my mother"" tactic.

It may be that they're more comfortable with you than a male doctor, or it may be a respect thing, but the point is that you deserve to be treated the way you want to, and referred to by the name you give them. It's okay to ask for that, and if they slip up, correct them. You're the doctor, you're in charge! "
I thought your job was important to you. 
"The whole thing about him thinking a kid is easy and will be the best thing ever is seriously scary. A lot of men get this idea ingrained in them from a young age. The fun part is such a small percentage of the real day to day drudgery of child rearing. 

If he doesn’t tolerate puke from a dog, he is going to be seriously disenchanted with the reality of being a father. 

If you truly love him and can accept that you will inevitably be responsible for the heavy lifting when it comes to caring for the dogs, then just keep it that way. You both will be happier for it. "
"Congratulations, you're are officially his bang-maid. Get out."
"Your boyfriend is manipulating you. You’re smelling bullshit because it’s there. It’s not rude to say you don’t want to come to something or don’t have time. But painting your SO as the bad guy and using them as a scapegoat is mean to your SO. You’re not his parents. He doesn’t get to blame you because you don’t control him. 

You aren’t overreacting. It’s something immature people do. This would be a deal breaker for me. "
"DO NOT LISTEN TO YOUR FRIENDS. Seriously, they are giving you the kind of advice that, if followed, ends with you raping someone. And you seem like a nice young man who wants to respect the women he's dating. Take all no's as no's. Take all maybe's as no's. If a woman gets mad at that, she's not the sort of woman you want to be dating. You want someone who is straightforward and free of bullshit."
"Psychiatrist here. Therapy has the potential to heal you in an important way with your parents. The goal of therapy is to help you learn to accept yourself with your limitations and to improve your overall resiliency, sense of agency, tolerance of a wide range of thoughts and affects, self-continuity, realistic self-esteem, capacity for intimacy, moral sensibilities, and awareness of others as having separate subjectivities. Because people who lack these capacities cannot yet imagine them, such individuals rarely complain about their absence; they just want to feel better. This can mean with your parents as well.

If you are looking for a good website or therapist, please feel free to message me. I think because the situation you are facing is unique to Indian culture, it might be good to find an Indian therapist who can probably better relate."

Also, even if she did go back to work, after however many years out of work she most likely won't be able to get a job that pays the same as she had pre-pregnancy, as well.

"As someone who has been in open relationships and thinks you and your husband have a GREAT thing going - you absolutely should NOT involve your kids or your parents in this right now. Your kids are far too young. They can (and should) be learning all about sex, love, safe sex, masturbation, etc...but what you are describing is a very intricate and complicated *emotional* relationship as well as the *sexual* relationship between their *parents*. They really shouldn't have to try to wrap their heads around something like this at an age where just the development of pubic hairs is enough to cause 5-alarm panic. I think the issue here is that you're looking at your sexual and romantic exploits as a public lifestyle - you want to be Out and Proud Polyamorists! But there is really no reason that the world (or your parents, or your children) need to be made fully aware of these exploits. If my boyfriend and I decide to have a threesome here and there I don't call up my parents and say, ""Hey mom! This time we had the third guy keep his boots on!"" There is no reason to ""come out"" as having a sex life. Least of all to your 8 to 13-year-old children. "
"He may be able to change,  but it's both unrealistic and unfair to plan your future on him changing."
"Okay, you were way too vague.  Did you basically challenge your bosses qualifications and cast doubt on whether he actually had them?     Nobody can give you advice when you're like ""well things got heated, things were said, I was sent home"".  

That's  really not enough to go on. But yeah, chances are good if you were repeatedly insolent to your boss, your ass is toast.  Why would you think lipping off to your boss is a good idea?"
"This is what I would do too. She's had the conversation many times, and her boyfriend is clearly not interested in listening. He's not inconvenience at all--he spends half the month with OP, half the month with his son, and he doesn't have to do clean-up duty in either case. OP should make the spare room into her room, and leave her boyfriend to his own devices. Perhaps that would be a wakeup call."
"You have some very good advice here already, so I just wanted to ask... 

You don’t really believe that just because someone has a website that makes it legit, right? "
"Yes, so too bad for them that they decided that clinging to their disgusting ideas was more important than building bridges with the woman who is to become the children's new maternal figure. They did this to themselves, point blank. Children don't need grandparents. They will be fine. "
"I’ve been there to put down four of my pets over the years. It’s actually pretty miserable, but I would never tolerate somebody telling me I can’t be there when my pet is put down. If somebody “ordered” me not to be there, I would consider that an intent to betray my connection to my pet.  

That said, you need to decide what to do for yourself. I think you ought to either preempt the whole thing, on the grounds that they already announced their intent to do the same to you, or just ignore their “order” and go anyway. Who cares if there’s a scene, really. Vets are used to scenes when a pet gets put down. "
"You need to go see a therapist. You're 25. Having been with three girls at that age is not a high number. And you know what? If you leave this guy, as you grow older, you'll find that the guys you'll be with have been with more and more women. Because they are older and have more life experience dating people. You're not going to find a 30 year old virgin.

Your jealousy and insecurity are way beyond what is normal for people. It's irrational and if it continues it will destroy your relationship. You need to put an end to this hate that is consuming you for absolutely no sensible reason."
Why are you even considering it? You don't mind being his backup plan?
"This this. He sounds like a gem, and like he's respecting you and letting you bring up something that you have a lot of shame wrapped up around. 

In a weird way, this is an amazing scenario. You're free! You're free of this secret and hiding it from the person you love, and that can be a tremendously healthy and wonderful thing. "
"Yeah, I agree that this is an abusive, controlling relationship.

And there is absolutely fuck-all you can do.

Go to Captain Awkward and start looking through letters like ""a girlfriend is not a pacifier"" and ""what to do when a friend is dating Darth Vader""  (these aren't exact titles, but they'll get you there.)  Also, sites such as thehotlne and loveisrespect have some advice about the precious little that you can do here--call and talk to someone while you are there.

ETA:  Maybe try out *Helping Her Get Free: A Guide for Families and Friends of Abused Women* by Susan Brewster."
"&gt; Partly I think the issue is that it would suck for Andrew to successfully isolate her from everyone given he's a controlling ass. I think you should make clear to her that you will always be there for her if she needs anything or she wants to come talk when she is having a hard time or if she is ever in trouble. 



This is a very important observation.  Abusive partners normally try to get rid of their victim's friends, especially any friends who seem able to assert themselves.  Andrew explicitly doesn't want you to support Sarah, because that will make her more resistant to his control.  His reasons for objecting to you as MOH are absurd.  It's not supposed to be about ""looking"" right -- if that was all that matters you could just hire some actors to be the wedding party.  It's supposed to be about the bride and groom's friends who are there to support and encourage the couple in their life together.  


I've never even known a man who gives a second thought to these aspects of the wedding.  They can usually barely get their tux and be at the church on time.  This isn't about the wedding.  It's about getting rid of Sarah's friends.   And that is a very, very bad sign.

"Okay as much as your BF probably should've handled it better.................

I fully agree with him. I've seen some bad shit with Arbonne, lula roe, cutco.... It is scammy MLM shit man. Do not even think about getting into that shit. Not even to be nice to your friend and become part of her 'team' or whatever. Now bear in mind, Paula may not know about the true nature of what's she's getting into. Most people do not and have not researched it. Furthermore many people that have been in the company a while will deny deny deny to the grave any negative things about the company because it hurts their downline and they are living a in a sunk cost fallacy. If it were me, I would do my research and show it to your friend. If she is still not swayed and wants to remain blissfully ignorant (she probably will because some Arbonne meetings can be HIGHLY motivational) then you need to say that you don't agree with what she's doing and if she's going to hang out with you she needs to not bring up selling products to you or getting you to join her team or whatever.

Do some research (don't recommend YouTube btw, MLMs spam YouTube with videos that have titles like ""Arbonne a SCAM!?"" that are actually made by Arbonne employees to say ""no it's not really a scam and you can get more info about joining in the link below!"" 

Then tell your boyfriend that although he was right in calling out bullshit, he needs to do a better job at confronting people like he did, especially your FRIENDS. Tell him he could have done it in a more respectful manner. "
"It's his home too.  He doesn't have to ask your permission to invite people over. Honestly he doesn't even have to give you a heads up but he did.  You are absolutely allowed to establish house rules about guests spending the night but that should be done as a group and not imposed upon him.  If he wants to have a romantic interest spend the night why shouldn't he be allowed to?  He's an adult, not your child."
"You said in a public setting that your boss wasn't qualified for his job and basically implied his incompetence resulted in your teams underperformance and you think that he's going to want to keep you...

I .. I mean, dude, seriously?    Were you dropped on your head repeatedly as a child? "
"I dropped my sister down a flight of stairs because I was wearing roller blades and tripped (too lazy to wait til I was outside to put them on). (I was 11, she was a few months old).

Shit happens. But the extreme reaction means wife should probably get therapy to remove the guilt/anxiety a little. Otherwise she’ll helicopter parent this kid to the nth degree "
"I agree that the kids should have this last link to their biological mother, but if they lose out, it's because of their grandparents \- not because of their dad. "
"Everyone in this thread seems to be ignoring the fact that you e been dating this dude since January. It’s been literally five months of dating it’s not crazy you don’t know his friends/family and I consider five months pretty damn casual still.

Call for a welfare check on him but that’s it. Don’t go over to his house don’t go to his work you’re not a professional there’s not a damn thing you can do and he screamed in your face. He’s unstable. Idk what people expect you to do he’s an unstable dude you’ve been with for five months his welfare is not your responsibility if this is a psychotic break idk what you could possibly do. Call the cops for a welfare check then stay the hell away cuz it sounds like you’re dodging a bullet. 

Don’t go to his work like people are saying. Seriously. It is the wrong thing to do it’s only been five months and that’s super weird for a gf of five months who doesn’t even know his family. Five months is not even long enough to establish a pattern of behavior for all you know he’s always rhis unstable and going to his job is only gonna set him off or redirect his crazy back to you. Call the cops for a welfare check and then stay the hellllll away. Even if he unblocks you. "
"He stated in the OP that he's consulting with a lawyer for this reason, so he seems to be handling the situation as well as he possibly can. Good for him. "
"Everything else in this thread made me laugh, but holy hell this one made me cringe. Your poor mom!    "
"Wow. I had to go back and check your age because you're acting like a bratty teenager. Your monitoring of his social media is invasive. He's allowed to be on snapchat without talking to you. I'd be emotionally exhausted by someone demanding I account for every second spent on social media every day, not to mention irritated. Give him a bit of space to breathe or the only way he's going to feel he can get it is by breaking up with you. "
"I like this response, it’s firm, puts the decision in Claire’s hands, but it doesn’t sound aggressive or mean"
"You are definitely not overweight. Your clothing sizes are small. And while BMI is not a perfect scale by any means, it can give a bit of an idea of where you're at. You are *barely* in the normal weight range, and if you lost just 1.5kg you would be considered underweight. Your mom is just wrong if she thinks you need to lose weight.

See a doctor because they will honestly discuss if you're at a healthy weight with you, and they can comment on your overall health as well. And see a therapist because you definitely have some issues with food and with body image that need to be worked out. Then you can tell your mom that you've seen a doctor about it and are doing what they suggest so she needs to stop commenting on your size, weight, exercise habits, food intake, etc."
"&gt; My parents always used to tell me if you don’t have a parent teach you at home ... then eventually if you keep being a little shit you’re gonna find a parent outside in the streets 

Oh man, this made laugh and finger snap because I feel like it needs to be said.

I think American culture used to be so that if a kid was acting up, adults felt like they were in full power to tell them to knock it off. These days, there’s a “don’t tell me how to raise my kid” mindset even if the non-parent is just tellig a kid to not run in a store or something. There’s probably a sweet spot somewhere in between these two approaches.
"
"Everything is cultural.  What the poster described above are the cultural issues surrounding age gaps which is what you asked for.

They weren't being specific to you, those were quite a few broad generalizations and possible reasons of why people would react poorly, why someone would hide it, what the stigmas could be, etc.

I don't know how better they could have laid it out.  

Another thought experiment: how do you think people would react if you were dating a 16 year old?  What would the general consensus be on your relationship, on your maturity level, etc?"
"&gt; The other part of me, however, is louder. And it tells me that groomzilla isn't just a zilla. He's been this controlling all along.

You know him far better than anyone here, so I'll defer to you on this one.  But this isn't your first rodeo, and if this is part of pattern for him, then it won't be the last time he's this way.

Where is Sarah in all of this?  You mentioned in your first post that she gave in to pressure from Andrew to drop you as MoH.  But have you had any communications with her since?  Where is *her* head at?

Because she's the one who's really in a bad position here; if Andrew is like this over something as absurd as who-walks-with-whom in the wedding party, then I'd bet a shiny new nickel that he's controlling her in other ways as well.

You and she are close enough that she asked you to be her MoH.  You need to find out the reality of their relationship.  Not that you may be able to *do* anything about it, because she's an adult and can choose to be with a jerk if that's what she wants to do, but she needs at the very least the opportunity to talk with *someone*, because it would be awful if she went through with marrying an abusive control freak simply because no one ever listened to her doubts.

Ok, that was very strange; I don't know what it was that moved me to write that, because it's tangential to your question.  But I've learned to pay attention to my instincts on matters like this.

If you have not, *talk* with her.  It could be important."
Are you implying that this was something she chose to do?
"You are an inspiration. Truly. 

In all seriousness, though, I would sit down your boyfriend and talk to him about the reality of catcalling. As a guy, he clearly doesn't have experience with harassment and doesn't understand how common it can be. If he still insists that *you* are the trashy one in this situation, then he's not worth your breath. "
"I'd just like to know why you had sex with black woman back then when you were so racist. Did you think they were good enough to service your needs but not be treated as equal people? I'm white so I feel like I can't speak for People of Colour, but I'm also a woman and I find you using her for sex but treating her entire race, including your own flesh and blood, like shit the most offensive."
"I’d like to mention, even if you *were* fat, you still wouldn’t be deserving of being treated like this. This is NOT how you treat someone you love. Fat people are still people (not that i think u/NekoNina was implying that, i just want to make sure OP understands this) and they are still deserving of being treated properly. 

OP, i am 4’11 and 115. I’m not fat, and neither are you. Your husband is telling you things to purposefully break down your spirit so you feel grateful for his attention and presence in your life. 

He doesn’t love you, he loves the feeling of being in control of you. "
"The thing is, what your wife needs most is what you refuse to give her. You probably know it on some level. She can’t forgive herself until you forgive her. The way you do that is by acknowledging that it really was an accident, admitting that you were scared for your child, you took your fear out on your wife, but that was unkind and unfair. Say you're sorry. It’s a big person who does, a small one who doesn’t. Then you two can start to move on.

"
Why give the kid more nightmare fuel in addition to reality?
He wasn't direct though. He didn't bring up his mom and sister's impressions until the next morning. She's not a mind reader.
Why would you even tell your parents? You are a grown adult and don't have to tell them anything you don't want to.
"Good for you. You may have saved your own life.

Please seek out some therapy to help you deal with this and prevent it from happening again."

Bisexual people are not any more likely to cheat than straight people. Bisexuality is a sexual orientation and it has nothing to do with cheating. 
My abusive ex always found a way to don't it as being MY FAULT. It was never his fault when he choked/hit me. It was always something I had done to make him.

"It’s probably both intentional and unintentional, in a sense. If she were in a right state of mind, she wouldn’t do it. But she feels powerless over the pain she feels, so she hurts herself to express it. And she feels powerless over your choices (because you’re a human with autonomy), so she self-harms to express her displeasure with decisions you make. 

It’s a maladaptive coping mechanism, and she does it because her wires are crossed right now. That doesn’t mean she isn’t infringing on your right to independence, and that she’s not manipulating you. She‘s doing both. It’s just that if she were well, she likely wouldn’t do that. But she’s not well, and she doesn’t want to be."
"But that's what it takes sometimes. For someone to be treated ""against their will"" in order to start to see that it IS possible and they CAN feel better. 

I totally understand each person is different, their experience with depression will be different, and each relationship is different. 

But a good friend of mine DID drag me to the car. The difference is I did truly want help but I was too depressed and too overwhelmed with the ""steps"" needed to get that help and actively participate in the help that I couldn't start. 

The idea of hours of Googling what doctors would accept my insurance was already too much to handle. I just ""didn't know how"" to do it. Physically, mentally, emotionally. Of course intellectually I knew how, but along with motivation severe depression screws with your cognitive ability as well. Most depressed people also have some level of anxiety.

""I'll spend hours on the phone and never find a doctor who'll see new patients AND take my insurance. I'll be stuck feeling like this forever because help is out there, I just can't GET to it. I can't deal with that idea so I'm not going to even start.""

Because that makes a lot if fucking sense, doesn't it? /s

It did at the time, somehow. 

My awesome friend who had been there himself did a lot of the legwork for me. ""Here. This is a list of doctors with appointments available in the next 2 weeks who also take Aetna. Call one."" 

""But what if they're not the right doctor for me?"" 

""Then go back to the list. See if you can get meds to start to deal with the immediate symptoms. Ask for the one you took before that worked. Once you can function a little better THEN you can worry about finding another doctor if you need to.""

""I don't have any clean clothes.""

""Nobody would care but where's your laundry card? I'll do a load.""

""I don't know where to start explaining to the doctor everything that's been going on.""

""Here. I'll help you write a few key events/points down to take to your appointment. Even if you can't talk about it or lose your words you can hand the doctor that.""

I wasn't TRYING to throw up road blocks. I genuinely wanted the help. But every ""step"" towards getting the help was *simply more than I was capable of*. 

Someone HAD to walk me through it and do a lot of it for me. Just like someone with broken legs needs a wheel chair."
"While it may have been a fantasy romance in the beginning, I don't see how this marriage is working for you when you admit he may have felt forced to marry. That's the opposite of romance. You may not have forced him to marry, but that kind of thinking is what led to this. Don't put all the blame on him but then say it's something you decided together. Bad decisions all around. Large age gap, and you barely knew him."
"You shouldn’t be feeling guilty for getting hit. Your friend is the one who messed up and made a scene at the party by slapping you. Let his idiotic self deal with the fallout and feel the consequences of getting that drunk.

Yes!  Your mother will be so happy you opened up to her and that she can still do her job: keeping you safe!
"I wouldn’t put it like that, let’s not jump to conclusions here. She may not be cheating yet and may not have the intention to do so right now, but no one can deny it is not ok that she wants a male roommate rather than you or another female. What I would recommend is that you try telling her how you feel rather than how a female roommate is better than a male, and if she doesn’t change, I agree you should have some self respect and dump her. Remember what she is doing is not ok, she should prefer you over anybody else."

"To answer your questions:
&gt;Why is he constantly texting me and making it sexual when he’s married with kids? 

Because he wants to have sex with you, and, even more than that, he wants to know that you want to have sex with him.

&gt;Is this some sick joke or is he angling for an affair? 

He wants an affair.

&gt;Why even badmouth me and then suddenly want to be back in my life?

The badmouthing? That's because a lot of people, even after they've broken up with you, still want you to be theirs. Even if they don't want you, they want you to want them-- it makes them feel good about themselves. They think they're still entitled to your emptional investment. They resent you having moved on afterwards, because they think they should always be the most important person in your life. They need you to be the unworthy person and a mistake, and they need to know that they could have you back if they wanted.
And he wants back in your life for all of those reasons, and beacuse being married with kids is hard, and because he wants to see himself as someone that can sleep with a younger woman (or a woman that isn't his wife), and/or because he wants something new, or something different... And maybe he doesn't want to leave her (maybe he does, but doesn't want to be seen as the bad guy), but he wants you attention.

Bottom line: he's super sketchy, was after you broke up, is now that he's married, and you should block his number.

I don't really understand how her education or the parentage of her kids has any connection. There's a lot of judgement here on your part that's just unnecessary if you just don't want to sell them. Just tell her you're not interested in selling the cars to anyone at this time.

"Why do you feel like you need to be ""fair"" to all religions if you aren't invested in any of them, and aren't engaged with them yourself? There's a lot of ideologies I would not want my kid exposed to. It's not like choosing a favorite color. If your kids want what you're proposing ""when they're older"", they can just take a World Religions course in college.

Contrarily, your girlfriend's religion isn't just something she's randomly picked up out of a dustbin that you're humoring her in. It's something personal and meaningful to her. Not as ""a religion"" but as a part of her past, present, and culture. 

To me, the only serious compromise here is: let your girlfriend share her faith with the kids, and engage in it the same level she engages with it. If that's going to church, celebrating holidays and talking about what those holidays mean to her, praying with her, okay. That's her level of engagement. As a couple it's ""fair"" that you let her engage  with her children on the same level she's engaged at.

And you should engage on the same level you're engaged at: That is, if you want to talk about your opinions and beliefs, encourage the kids to think critically, share with them other faiths (and why you don't believe these, or how you arrived at your conclusions), share that. Share the part of holidays you enjoy with them and tell them what's special to you about those holidays, if it's for more humanist reasons.

But it's not reasonable to say ""Hey wife, shut up about your faith until they're teenagers, then we'll let the kids pick one religion randomly from a deck of cards...and if they're smart, they'll refuse the deck!"" Your way isn't ""fair"" at all  or reflective of the way you and your girlfriend engage and relate to religion, it's just stacking the deck your way instead."
"&gt; If the dinner was really important it would have been planned, not put together in a few hours.

This is absolutely and completely not true. Sometimes these social obligations happen because something spontaneous happened. Maybe they are celebrating something good that happened at work. Maybe there are unexpected staff changes at work, and he needs to invest in his relationships.

The fact that it wasn't planned doesn't mean that it wasn't important to your boyfriend or his supervisor.

The fact that you couldn't give your boyfriend the benefit of the doubt in this situation suggests that you don't really trust his judgment? Does he have a pattern of inconveniencing you for small selfish reasons?"
