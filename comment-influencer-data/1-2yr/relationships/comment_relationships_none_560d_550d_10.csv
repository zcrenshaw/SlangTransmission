Is feet that smell just because a thing? I just thought his feet get sweaty and that just makes his feet gross.
The eugenics insult is throwing me for a bit of a loop
Please don't blame yourself and don't let him put any blame on you.  He is being emotionally and verbally abusive.  Please seek help from family and friends because he is ignoring you and your needs and poisoning your son against you.  He needs a wake up call that what he is doing is not acceptable.   I know you love him but you have two little ones on the way that will need all your attention and love so focus on them and your son.
"I mean, the eventual divorce will surely upset her more. I would try to get her support as long as he hasn't poisoned her against you already. "
"No never, she has however accused me. She calls my women friends bad names, for example you know that *sl** friend of yours she got a boyfriend* and since she calls all my women friends that i answer *well which one? I got so many sl** friends? How about just her real name*.  "
"You need to seriously stick up for yourself here. I understand you feel some guilt, but he agreed to another child and anytime you have sex to reproduce you roll the dice on multiple babies. Nothing he has done is ok. It is not ok for him to tell your son mean things about you, it is not ok for him to treat you poorly because of something out of your control, it is not ok for him to not help with his children because twins were unexpected. You should not be letting him off the hook on this, because he is acting like a grade a asshole. You need to be angry and indignant that your husband is behaving this way towards you and all of your children."
"Please, absorb the cost as much as it sucks and get away from this tool bag. Also, bring down the hammer on his career, he doesn't deserve your compassion or consideration. He's at your mercy now, because he is the one that screwed up in a big way."
"100%.Really,I can't believe anyone would even search such nonsense unless done on purpose."
"Yes, you certainly can, just like OP does. It's still rude to overtake a planned event with something else entirely. If you planned a backyard barbecue from 7-10 and someone showed up at 8 with with a DVD and invited all your guests to the basement to watch, you wouldn't feel a bit put out that your party was cut short and your guests are all still in your basement at 2am? All the money and effort you spent to put on an event, down the drain because someone else decided they'd prefer a different type of party? "
"I'm sorry that your maternal family are a bunch of abusive enablers. Sticking together is probably how they cope with their own abusive pasts &amp; tendencies. You've stepped out of the cycle and called attention to it but they don't want to see. It's easier for them to all decide that you're the one who's wrong. You're not. 

You're right that you can't let your mother back into your life. If everyone else chooses to take her side that's that. It sucks and you deserve better. At least you can make sure your daughter will never endure what you had to go through. "
"Shorter version of events: 

OP: I sure wish your dick was bigger.

STBXBF: ""That was really hurtful. 

OP: ""I just said Ok and that I was sorry...  I didn't think it was a big deal""

Your post does not evince in the slightest that you understand what an emasculating experience you subjected your boyfriend to. Nor do you show any concern for what he's obviously going through emotionally. You barely show any awareness that he has emotions. Certainly you display no empathy. Your entire post is about you and how your boyfriends reaction is making you feel. 

I do not know the degree to which your post is putting the real you on display, but the you that it puts on display is pretty horrible. Consider that maybe you're the problem here. I realize I am being harsh but your post is one of the most self-centered and selfish things I've ever seen on this sub, and that's saying something. "
"I do not consume that particular genre of German porn, thank you very much.  "
"Again, the military has a disciplinary and court system, they want a report of this on file. "
"I agree, if action isn't taken I don't think he'll learn from this and there's nothing stopping him from doing this with another woman. Why not, if he got away with it last time."
"That is so not the point. He should have supported her and her vision, even if he felt people were “bored” (which I doubt. Her party sounds great — even friends who like to party can be happy drinking, eating, and chatting).

He totally disrespected and undermined her. Like I can imagine him in the car joking with his best friend about how “my wife wants to have this boring party, we need to liven it up!”

I would be pissed."

"You should be asking him this. ""Hey, you mentioned marriage while we were having sex earlier, was that an in the moment thing? Let's talk about our future and where we see this going!"""
"OP DO NOT SHARE THE CHANNEL ON REDDIT, EVEN IN ""PRIVATE"" MESSAGES."
"Do you really want to invest your time, energy, and emotions into someone who doesn't want to accord you basic human decency?"
"If you don’t want another baby, why on earth are you not using condoms? "
"I think idealy they would all 4 of them sit down and talk about this, but OPs husband has made it clear he has no regard for her thoughts on the matter and doesn't want her involved at all."
Thanks for all the reassurance. All these responses are really helping build up the confidence to make the decision.
"Unless she was holding a gun to your head she didn’t force or make  you do anything. You made a choice to cheat. Just being brutally honest. Your gf deserves to know the truth. You owe her that much. If the tables were turned wouldn’t you expect her to tell you? 




You still aren’t understanding it. You don’t get to preserve your relationship that’s up to your gf to decide whether she wants to or not. You went on a beer tasting with this girl once before?? So you pretty much went on a date with her is what I’m understanding. Once again she didn’t put you in any situation, you gave her the opportunity. Don’t act so ignorant. But it’s pretty obvious you aren’t going to tell your gf anything. Ignorance is bliss. "
"Or donate them to a shelter- depending on the cheap yarn, they can be super soft and moderately inexpensive, so it's not like giving a bunch of shitty hats away."
"To give you some advice you may not want:

Be honest, and be empathetic.

"... that's NOT how intuitive eating works. Intuitive eating works by listening to hunger and satiety cues, only eating to satiation, and eating a variety of foods. Source: am using intuitive eating for weight loss, and now find myself slightly sick feeling when eating to excess, plus very slowly losing weight."
Definitely agree. It's also one of those things that is very easy for an Ali to mitigate after the fact - 'it wasn't like that! You're exaggerating! I was messing around! It was just because we were drunk! You're reading into things!'  Addressing it directly when it happens is way more effectual. 
"So very cringeworthy. I can't imagine going a whole wedding without dancing and celebrating and just... hanging out with my spouse. Even if I was in a wedding party or whatever. Tbh I wouldn't want to be married to someone I didn't want to dance with and do tequila shots with, you know? Husbands and wives should want to straight chill when they have the chance... it's sad how some relationships stray so far from those roots of just enjoying each other's company.

Is it kids that ruin it? Because I was in a terrible marriage but we still were joined at the hip when it came time for fun. Lol"
"I was talking to a family friend who fought in the Iraq-Iran war in the 80s as an iragi soldier today. We were talking about the support giving to soldiers with ptsd and he was critical of it. Your post reminded me of our talk and how difficult it can be for people who havn’t experiences war or drama to understand how it effects people. It’s not just ptsd, but guilt and grief and things you tell yourself to make you feel better, Different people react differently but it takes years to process it and start to deal with it, and even then different people have different levels of sucess with it. My friend lives a normal and well adjusted life today, but it still effects him in many ways. Your boyfriend has seen, experienced, and done things that is traumatic and he has some work towards processing that, work that could take years.

That he is supportive of his goverment still and won’t strongly take a stance against what he witnessed could be his true opinions but also a part of that process. If he volontereed, then he has no one to hold responsible but himself and that can be a great weight to bear. So instead he decideds that it wasn’t that bad so he doesn’t have to take on all that weight at once. This is not to suggest that you don’t hold him accountable for his stated opinions, but to show how much work he can still need to do with himself.

So the question isn’t just if you can stand by a man that is seemingly against human rights, but also if you can stand by a man that is in the early stages of processing his trauma, if you can stand by someone that still has a work to do on his world view, and if you can stand by someone that will most likely be cast out by his community of his opinions are found out. Because with how your boyfriend is talking there seems to be a long road ahead of him and there can be a lot of roadbumps on such a road. You need to gove some serious thought what it can mean for you to try to walk that road with him.

You can talk to him about his time in the military again to get a greater understanding of how it is effecting him. Don’t focus on the events, but ask how he feels about what happened, how it effects how today, what he is doing to get through this, and what his plans for continuing dealing with it and with being a venuzuelan goverment supporter in a city of venezualan expats who dislikes the government. How does he react in large crowds (like the one that killed his friends)? How does he react to loud noices? How does he sleep at night? Will he ever want to return to Venezuela? What would he tell your potential children of his homeland? Would he ever consider doing something to adress the crimes he saw commited? What would he do if you disagreed with the venezualian goverment? What will he tell other people about his beliefs in the future? Just how much understanding does he have that he has experienced is still effecting him today and what is he doing to adress that?

But as you also describe feeling distant from your boyfriend and like you don’t even know him anymore, then I want to reassure you that yiu are free to leave at anytime. He has not just done some troubleing things in the past, but are still struggeling with fully renouncing such behaviour. That would be unacceptable for many people. Also, sometimes we found out something about people and it changes how we feel about them, and wheter or not we think it’s fair we still can’t just change how we feel now. This might be the end of your relationship, and if it is then it’s okay."
"&gt; Is it kids that ruin it?

Nah, last night we put baby to bed and made shooters and watched trash TV. This weekend we are going hiking and wine tasting. Life with kids doesn't have to suck, lol."
"Ouchhhhh. My heart breaks for your wife.

You ABSOLUTELY should unfriend her, stop texting her, etc etc etc ALL of the above. Brianna's feelings shouldn't be spared in the least bit here, worrying about your sister in law's, sister...that's quite a stretch of relation there and I'm sure you not having contact with her is something literally no one in your family will care about in comparison to making your wife feel loved. 

PLEASE do something very special for your wife to make up for this. Plan a weekend away, have your parents watch the kids, write her a letter explaining your devotion, just go all out. I get it...sometimes a married person's thoughts wander, it's human nature to have a crush. You're not wrong for that specifically, but you're totallyyyyy wrong for letting yourself pour all your attention that night to Brianna. The fact that you are admitting you have a crush on her is a HUGE red flag that you need to stop this in it's tracks. The fact that she is contacting you and seemingly reciprocating the crush is another HUGE red flag. No no no no no no.

If your wife doesn't feel comfortable being around your family again yet, please allow her that space. This may even be an opportunity to fess up to your family (since they already seem to have caught on) about your behavior with Brianna and how your wife is very hurt and how you were wrong for acting that way. I would at least talk to your mom and your brother about her."
"He's the one who said ""I hope you're right"" in the first place, when he KNOWS she has stolen things from him.

That's not him 'being honest'. That's him trying to pin the blame on you, and that's super shitty of him. "
"I mean, we're not the emotion police, so take this with a grain of salt, but it seems to me like your reaction was way out of proportion. Not the coming home late thing, the *sobbing* thing. Do you do this very often? Is that why your partner refuses to engage when you are like that? Do you escalate your own behavior because he has always ignored your feelings/was cold when you were upset but not freaking out, or do you freak out to get a reaction from him and he has become numb to that tactic?


It sounds like a deeply unhealthy dynamic. That is not how reasonable people attempt to solve problems together. "
"Given the circumstances, OP *does* come off a bit crazy for her reaction. I wouldn't want to deal with it if I were her boyfriend either, cause I'm guessing this isn't the first time she's had a meltdown like this. "
"&gt; Abusers usually come back to taunt their victims after they've managed to escape so 1) I think Mike slept with you on purpose and 2) he will absolutely tell her because he knows it'll hurt her.

I totally agree. Also, Once it gets out that he abused Alicia, he will claim that both OP and Alicia are just bitter."
"&gt;him posting a few ads over the course of a year shouldn't negate everything.

Yes, it should negate everything. He doesn't know what to say to you because there's no justification for it."
"&gt; IRL I definitely did not imply she has succeeded only due to money and luck. There was tons of praise for her work ethic in there and I repeatedly acknowledged how hard it must have been to get through all her coursework and research.

If this is true, it sounds like you were giving her a lecture.

Your ""ring toss"" example also seems really condescending and insulting. She's literally a rocket scientist. I'm sure she understands the concept of privilege and the fact that she has had help getting where she is. She wasn't insulted by your comment because she didn't understand what privilege was, but most likely because she felt you were giving ""luck"" more credit than her own hard work and prioritization for her success. Doubling down by explaining in a very simplified way what privilege is was probably doubly insulting to her.

&gt;I didn't take it personally until she said ""You’re the one who decided to be a fashion designer,"" afterwards. I had been just trying to make her aware that having the support of family increasing the chance of succeeding, and we've both been lucky to have help.

I feel like you set up the comparison between you and her by including yourself when you pointed out all the ways she has been lucky. You talk about how you both had it good, but then her parents did all these other things for her too, while your husband had to pay his own way and that's why he's not where she is. If the ultimate point to this discussion was your original statement (that you think she's lucky to go to France and you wish you could go) then I don't see anything wrong with diverting the conversation right back to that point. You DO have a lower-paying job, which is a contributing factor to you not being able to go. 
"
"The fact that you still want to work things out with this guy after he showed his true colors, plus that you thought you might be the bad guy in the original post suggests that you have some self confidence issues. A therapist may be able to help with that."
You need to enforce some boundaries. For yourself. For him. And for her. 
"Don't feel one bit guilty.  Keven is the Golden Child of your family.  Everyone should praise Keven!

But Kevin isn't as awesome as your family is making him out to be.  At best, Kevin did't do the legwork to figure out housing, didn't stick with school for any length of time, and did't make adequate preparations.  But my guess is that Kevin probably hadn't even been accepted to the school, had no money for school and his housing, and planned to just guilt his way into living off you all along."
"I read over that part of the OP and had the exact same thought 'Oh looks like OP had decent parents!'

My parents are not the worst by any measure but there have been issues in the past which has helped mold my mindset anytime someone uses 'FAAAAAAMILY' as an argument. It's sometimes people with more stable homes have a little trouble grasping at first. If the partner doesn't want to be walked over by his parents, listen to him. He's probably given them two, three, a thousand chances to be less controlling and was disappointed"
A child has rights. A fetus does not.
"I get the point you're trying to make, but all types of abuse are ""actually"" abusive, not just physical."
"I second that. His parents, his choice. If I were OP, I’d have already blocked their numbers. No one needs that kind of drama or negativity in their life. It’s abysmal. "
"I didn't ask her that, but it might be good to bring it up. I might be able to get her to realize that she wouldn't like it either if I shared some graphic details about her with my family. "
"So everyone here seems to have pointed out the issues with your wife. I won't bother getting into that.

I just wanted to encourage you to let your tenant know you are not evicting her. Op, these are the type of tenants you WANT. She's young and felt bad about damaging your property, to the point that she paid to have it replaced. Yes she should have talked to you. But overall, her heart was in the right place. It would be easy to buckle to your wife if you're coming home to her yelling about his tenant but I think you know this kid doesn't deserve to be evicted. For a 21 year old she showed a lot of responsibility and maturity. She's a good tenant and she not only doesn't deserve to be made to move but she doesn't deserve an eviction on her record simply because your wife is acting nuts.

Sincerely, someone who accidentally put a hole in a wall at 21 and patched and painted it and emailed my landlord to let her know it was done."

"Yup. I don't know about you or OP, but my back door opens into my kitchen. If I were getting security cameras, that's one I would want."
"So, I think he is just proud to have a girlfriend and is maybe a little immature about it. I don't think you should call him out in front of his friends, though. I would bring that sort of thing up the next day when you are sober. ""Hey remember last night when you referred to me as 'your lady' in front of your friends? It kind of makes me feel weird and just reminds me that I'm the only woman in the room. Can you just call me by my name in front of other people? I don't think they need to be reminded that we are dating constantly."" &lt; or something like that.


Do you mind if he slaps your ass when you are alone? Sounds like he needs to be reminded that slapping your ass falls in PDA territory. Oh, and also remind him that he most certainly may not slap your ass 'whenever he wants to'"
"While researching charities is a very sensible thing to do, this might not be the path to avoiding a family fight.  The aunt and mother in law are already being pushy about donating to a specific charity.  Responding to them with “actually, your chosen charity is unethical and wasteful” will probably make them feel embarrassed/defensive/angry.  Easier to avoid the fight if you don’t go in criticizing their choices.  

OP and her husband could do some research to find some charities that they can enthusiastically support, though.  And then when asked for donations to other charities, they could respond by talking enthusiastically about the charities they do support, and that they have allocated their entire donation budget this year to those charities. Then OP and her husband can end the conversation on a note of “there are so many ways to make a positive difference, and it is wonderful that we’ve all found great causes to passionately support”.  "

"Man when I was 18 one of my guy friends got annoyed in my place becuase my bf at the time only called me ""my girlfriend."" he sais he was just proud that i was his and he was proud to be mine. He would sometimes reffer to himself as ""your boyfriend"" like make a bad joke and say ""arent you so glad your boyfriend is funny?"" 

For whatever reason my angsty 19 year old feminist kicked in and i would get mad every time he said it. He was a good guy, i think i was just looking for something to complain about. 

Fast forward to my more recent ex, i was always ""his friend"" or would introduce me by name, no title. No facebook status ever either. We dated for 2 years, him never calling me his gf was really just a big red flag. He was too scared of commitment and i didnt ever feel like he was proud of me. Id way rather always be called ""girlfriend"" than never being called it, that hurts to your core man. 

I dont think its a jealous thing, i think its  a ""im proud of this woman"" thing. Chill. "
"This isn't fixable, your sight will always remind him of his destroyed marriage, find another job, I'm sorry. You could go to HR with this but then good luck explaining that you didn't actually know the wife when you slept with her - you'll both get fired."
" I don't see a problem here. He has a stable job, owns a house and a car more then a lot of actual 28 year olds can say. This seems like a personal problem. I know saying ""age is just a number"" is cliche but it works pretty well here."
"He seems to be at the same life stage as you. What's the issue? Life stages aren't based on age.

IMO, you kind of (over)reacted like an ass and owe him an apology. He sounds like a decent, hardworking guy who knows what he wants. "
"Start the proceedings now so you can't be accused of gold digging if he does get the promotion. For the sake of yourself and your children, grow a spine and take this man down before he's worn you down so much he blows you over with a breath of air. "
"To be honest, approaching things logically means you consider everything rather than jumping in based on a feeling which can be great. But yeah, the damage to the piano is really horrible and it is a shame that your belongings (particularly something with so much sentimental value) got damaged because he was hoarding animals and not willing to care for them or clean up after them. I guess if it helps, try to think about that logically too - logically, if he is at the level where he is not caring about your personally valuable belongings, he is not in a position to be a caring husband.

Hope it all works out for you, and there's no rush."
He’s 39yo. He knows exactly what he’s doing.

"1. There's nothing wrong with scheduling sex. Yes, you generally hear about marrieds with kids doing it, but it works for any couple that may be short on spontaneity. You've been together long enough for the initial can't-keep-your-hands-off-each-other phase to be over. 

2. Can y'all compromise on this one? You get comfy when you get home but change into something sexy later on.

3. If you both feel like things are a bit stale, go find some ideas. Watch porn together, read each other the smutty bits from a book of erotica. Start small, you don't have to go full sex dungeon. 

Good luck!"
Divorce. You ain’t got kids and the time to deal with this shit.
"I am so sorry for what your family is going through first of all.

Dude. Enjoy your youth. This is ridiculous. 
"I hope like hell you have a good counselor lined up for when your daughter snaps from stress. Poor bunny.

The problem is people don't realize that when it comes to academia and getting into good colleges, a lot of this doesn't matter. They look at your GPA and your SAT/ACT score and that's it. And doing all these activities? All that shows is that your daughter was in a lot of activities. It doesn't show that she's dedicated--in fact, quite the opposite. I've known kids who were declined from their first choice schools because of that. They wanted someone who was really good at one thing instead of just okay at five things."

"Nope, it's also why lesbian exclusive dating apps fail, because they get overrun by dudes full of themselves."
"Look I totally agree that you're right and she's wrong, but that's not going to actually change the situation here.  You've outlined how the issue is ongoing and you've missed various things in life because of her insecurity/clinginess.  This is not new, you were not surprised when she expressed her opinion on this trip, you already know what's up.  It has been several years.    
   
You are making the fundamental mistake of thinking you can force her to change by showing her how right you are.  That is absolutely not going to happen.  If you could change her, it would be perfect because you could go on your trip and keep dating her and not get screamed at.  I totally understand that.  It would be the perfect outcome for you.  Getting screamed at, breaking up with your gf, and missing family/friends, are all BAD things that you don't want.  So you prefer to keep thinking there is another path that allows you to avoid all of this.  There isn't.  Those are your options and it has been YEARS and you say in other comments that the attitude is a deal-breaker.  So it is time to stop pushing back the decision.  This is decision time."
"I have a history of depression and anxiety and am also a mental health professional. That said, now that my child is almost 4, I recognize I had severe postpartum anxiety that went completely unchecked by me or my husband because it didn't manifest as what we were expecting. I was totally functional from an outside perspective but it was a huge added level of stress to our relationship."
"OP - nothing to be ashamed of. Your partner is manufacturing that shame as a misdirection for the fact that he was snooping on you. He violated your trust in a big way and cares more about finding tools to control and subdue you than he does about these nudes, I promise.

Remember that ultimately, nobody can make you do or feel a certain way unless you let them. Don’t let your boyfriend have this kind of control over your self worth, particularly when this entire situation shows that he’ll happily weaponize it against you. Deep down, you must know you deserve to be treated better than this."

"Argh this is so shit. You do need to look after yourself though and you don't owe it to anyone to keep him in your life. I hope Lacey gets out, but whatever happens *none of this is your fault*. If he hurts her again, the only person to blame is him. 

If you're in contact with Lacey maybe you could point her in the direction of loveisrespect.org and *Why does he do that?* by Lundy Bancroft, but don't put yourself in danger. "

"Well, was it? You don't make it sound like containing your dick was a big deal for you, but if it's something that matters to you for whatever reason then you might've objected.

And you aren't asking her to hide a small aspect of her. You're asking her to *hide her whole body*. Come on, dude. Nothing she can do is going to make you want to have sex any less, and treating her like she's just a walking talking reminder of your unfulfilled sexual urges *is* pretty disrespectful. As if her very existence, her audacity to have a *body* around you is only to antagonize you. She's just being a person living in her own home."
You’re young enough that you can still find what you want. Having a kid when you’re 20 with a 30-year-old guy who has emotional affairs doesn’t exactly sound like the key to happiness. 
"That's so ridiculous. That email was before the relationship started and he was annoyed because he thought she ""wasn't that type of girl"" as though sending nudes ever makes you some kind of anything. She had forgotten about it. He also searched specifically for the ex.

In this case she searched herself because they'd been having significant relationship issues and found he'd been actively hiding stuff. Should've probably addressed him but he has given cause for concern too."
This is a difficult situation. You guys need to see a therapist ASAP. 
"If the first thing my gf had to say to me after sex was how much I looked like her ex, you can bet I'd be *extremely* displeased. "
"I think it helps to think of someone's gender identity as separate from their sexual identity. My bf wears sparkly eyeliner and nail polish and has a balance of masculine and feminine characteristics, but he is only attracted to woman. I think the reason I never feel worried about that stuff is because we both have frank and open conversations about our relationship to our own gender identities and to our desires. If you create an environment where you can fully understand each others thoughts on gender, and talk openly about all desires, even if they're taboo, it's a lot easier to trust each other. So I think you just need to talk through this more, ask him if he's only ever been interested in woman or if he's open to the idea or men, ask him how well he feel like the label ""man"" suits him or ask him if he's always been this openly feminine and into fashion, or if he used to feel pressure to conform to masculinity.

Well you're not. You're bringing up something that's unresolved. That's completely fair. 
As long as they don't have a prenup she should be in pretty good shape since it sounds like he's a very high income earner. She should consult if and when the time comes but I highly doubt OP will get screwed here. 
"&gt; I was unmarried and the father promptly disappeared (and later died).

&gt; At the time J was too young to make a decision and we left his surname as his father's out of respect.

J's in a household where he now has two step-siblings who are the biological children of you and your husband, he looks different from all of you, **he has a different name from everyone**, and you wonder why he feels he doesn't belong and is constantly rebelling?

&gt; Husband does not want to give **step-son** his surname.

This should have been hammered out when you two were married, along with making T simply J's son, no ""step"" prefix.

"Can you quote where I said being a bad partner made her a bad mom? I don't think I did. Pretty sure I said that he's entitled to his feelings either way and has a right to be upset. She could be the best mom in the world, but if he doesn't want her in his life that's his decision and it should be respected.

Also, being gay doesn't give you carte blanche to cheat. She could have been an adult, remained faithful till the end and told her husband she was a lesbian and ended things respectfully and amicably. Instead she was selfish, snuck around behind his back and betrayed his trust to satisfy her own desires. She's also not gay, OP says she's bisexual, so your narrative doesn't really hold up."
This.  Additionally there is that pesky fact that the vikings never traded in African slaves.  The presumably white other wife he was referring to actually has a better historical justification for taking offense at the slave comment.
"&gt;Well yeah, Kwanza is kind of a faux tradition. The Civil Rights Act is older than Kwanza, it's not some ancient African holiday kept alive in America through the Middle Passage and the evils of slavery.

It's not faux. It's new. Every tradition is new at some point and this one very essence was created to build a bridge between the two cultural identities people were struggling with at the time. There are some people who have taken it to heart, about 6 million people said they were going celebrate Kwanzaa last year. 6 million people celebrating something moves it out of faux category to me. It's not universally celebrated, but that inherent with every tradition. 

&gt;The real black American holiday is Juneteeth.

Is one of the holidays. Calling the real is a bit much. Just like Kwanza not a lot of people go out of thier way to do anything about  it. "
Ditto.  Past behavior is indicative of future behavior.
"Did you two discuss the kids at all or only marriage? Either way he seems disinterested and is making excuses because it sounds like he doesn't want to get married. After 7 years this should at least be a discussion and not stringing you along. Personally if his response is always like this, to me that would indicate he does not want the same future you do. You also mention children. Does he seem to want kids as well or make excuses about that topic too? I honestly think if he can't have a mature conversation with you on this topic, it may be time to move on rather than waste anymore time with him. Even if he's unsure of marriage at the moment he should be able to tell you what he sees in his future but is instead giving you nothing to go off of. "

The national Girl Scout organization and the BSA do not fuck around with people stealing with their fundraisers.

Girl Scouts especially are dependent on their cookie sales to stay active."
"That's absolutely ridiculous. I have an office job. When my son was born I helped out a ton.  No ""clearing my head"" or any of that garbage.  I went to work, came home and helped out.

Your husband is being a selfish ass. "

He is happy that you're upset.

I'm just trying to help you understand why your girlfriend may seem more frustrated than she should be over this. You sound like a great partner and you are obviously concerned that it upset her. I'm trying to drag you toward seeing this from an emotional perspective, and how that perspective isn't necessarily wrong just because it's not coldly logical."

"&gt; there isn't anything she can do to prevent it from happening short of refusing to speak to guys when with me which is not a reasonable thing to expect of her

See, this is what bothered me when I was reading your post. She makes a point to try and include you in the conversation, so she's not dumb. She knows exactly what they're doing by excluding you. It baffles me that she continues to engage these dudes when their rude-ass behavior should be a turn off to any decent person. That she's cool with you leaving the table all together to avoid the eventual gross rudeness by the men that approach her. I mean, she's obviously attractive enough to pull dudes on her own, why does she need to pick up these guys while out with you? She's just doubling down on excluding you. That's shitty."
Dude. They literally said that they're not an actual egg. Rude. 
"You were very clear in your intentions and she understood exactly what you said and didn’t fight it. 

She wants a relationship and you don’t. 

If she is seeing another guy, she is doing right. "
"Yeah, like this is not even an unusual thing. A lot of guys like fat women, enjoy spending time with fat women, and are sexually attracted to fat women, but then when it comes to being public about it, the shallow side and fear of what people think suddenly shows up. Most fat women have dealt with it. I have been both fat and thin. Trust me when I say women know when dudes are doing shit like this, and it ain't cool."
"Or, y'know, if you read the original post, you might recognize that this guy seems pretty reasonable. He's not making a big deal of the lunches; he is upset because she planned on unnecessarily sharing a hotel room with the other guy. If the wife is making jokes about how plausible it would be for her to share a hotel room with this guy - and she makes the joke in such a way that the husband is able to not realize it is a joke - then there's definitely some kind of thing that goes beyond his trust issues. 
But yeah - therapy is probably good for both, and for his trust and/or trust issues.
And double yeah, forcing her to quit the job would be pure relationship sabotage.

"&gt; Am I the only asshole that thinks its crazy to consider porn as cheating?

I don't know you, so I can't say that you're an asshole. And you're in all likelihood not the only one that thinks it's crazy to consider watching porn as cheating. And I'll even grant you that OP's wife might have overreacted, taking into account the fact that she said she didn't mind him watching it, and that he might not have watched porn had he known about her history with it vis-à-vis her parents.

But — and you knew there was a *but* coming, didn't you? — I can absolutely understand why people would consider watching porn as cheating, or a betrayal on the level of such, specifically the people who got left behind as their partners got to preferring porn instead of sex with their significant others. There are a shit-ton of people who have destroyed their relationships and families that way."
"It is BS because fat people exist all over the place, and it's going to be impossible for her to live a normal life if she's suffering a panic attack every time she sees one.

"Alright fine I'll bite.

Sexting. Paying for the services of live camgirls. Masturbating on FaceTime with someone you know personally. Porn.

They are all sexual in nature, but one of these things is not like the others. Can you tell which? 

It's porn. All the other things have a very important component to them: interaction with a live person. Porn doesn't have that- millions of people can watch the same video and the porn actor won't establish a personal connection with a single one of them. You won't develop any sort of intimacy with Sasha Grey, she's not gonna fall in love with you, your chances of meeting her alone are extremely low, the video wasn't made with you specifically in mind.

All the other things allow for emotional and physical cheating due to the presence of a live partner. Porn just doesn't."

"Your parents are a hot mess express. Holy fork, dude. 

What your mom did, especially the note to you, is absolutely horrifying. Instead of owning up to her own terrible behavior she blamed her child and that is just not something you come back from and pretend you're even a mediocre parent. 

It's true it comes down to your dad on whether or not to take her back. The fact that he'd rather continue to not be able to function on his own and take her back after what she said to you is also pretty horrifying. I know he was hurt too, and he apparently is pretty codependent. But he's prioritizing himself over your emotional well being. And that sucks. Is talking to the counselor at your school an option? If so do it. Now. 

By your age I'm assuming you're a junior or a senior. It's time to knuckle down at school. Make sure you graduate. And then get a job and out of that house. I'd say go as low contact as you can while still being allowed to see your sister. She needs at least one person in the family who sees your parents' relationship for what it is. 

Also it sounds like your mom has a scapegoat/Golden child thing going on with y'all. That's a dynamic in a lot of families where one or both parents are a narcissist. There's a subreddit somewhere for children of narcissists. Maybe head over there for some stories similar to your own and advice on how to make sure you and your sister don't end up with no relationship due to that dynamic. 

Good luck, man.

"Here to give advice, not argue over the political correctness of a statement, OP doesn’t want to have an abortion, her reasons for that are not important, so I was suggesting that an alternative to abortion is to proceed and give the child up for adoption.

OP, you should definitely maybe talk to a therapist about it. They might give you the ability to kind of delve deeper into your feelings about relationships. It could be any number of reasons why you feel this way and it may or may not have something to do with your sexuality. You just might need the opportunity to talk about it. "

"Everyone has said it first and best. Your siblings are trash and, in your shoes, I'd be done with them: low contact at best. Also, Mom still remembers you in some corner of her mind, which is why she wanted the name.

What I haven't seen anyone mention is this: Keep seeing your mom...don't insist on who you are if she's confused, just say you're there to see her because she is so special to you and you love her. Get to know Little Lulu. The dog is going to outlive your mother's ability to care for her, and I think you should find a way to adopt her if you can. Little Lu will be a very special connection to your mother and a symbol of her love for you, even when she was unable to remember you exactly or once she passes on. 

I lost my mom almost a year ago to Alzheimers. I promised her at the end I would take care of her cats, so now I have Mikey and Willie, her beloved companions. Wouldn't trade it for anything.

Yeah. I do think he might be on the spectrum but it is also 50% denial, at least. I think he just doesn't want to believe...things he doesn't want to believe.

I am seriously alarmed with our country at the moment. So is he but he refuses to believe it will get worse. As someone who is Jewish I have a hard time understanding why he would believe that it would not get worse.  His mother is like this - 100% full on denial for things she doesn't want to be true. To the point she made up a conversation with my mom about how radiation was not needed for her breast cancer (a whole other story)."
"You don't have to go this far. Inheritance is not automatically community property. When OP gets the money, no matter how much it is, just put it in a separate account.

"I mean, he is entitled to feel whatever he feels, for sure. But shouldn't he also be responsible for inspecting the source of his discomfort? What exactly about this makes him uncomfortable? Is this activity *really* more provocative than a hot yoga class? (All that bending over! All that spandex!)

It seems likely to me that he has some hangups over preconceived notions about what this activity actually entails. I totally agree that they should talk about his discomfort, but rather than shaming her for a hobby which she's having fun with, maybe he should also try to pinpoint the source of his discomfort as a goal in this conversation, so that the two of them can decide: is his fear based on a slightly paranoid and inaccurate idea as to what pole dancing ""means""? Or is it a difference in actual values (as you noted, a lot of people here are crying prude on him), in which case they are likely incompatible partners?"

"&gt; any trip he wanted to take on his own even would be cool
&gt; I feel like since he decided to make this a committed relationship that taking single trips out of the country shouldn't be a thing.

I'm totally confused. You are OK with him taking trips on his own, but not this trip because he's planned it for a long time? Or not because it's international?

Your boyfriend doesn't want you to come on this trip. He also doesn't want to say that, AND doesn't want to say why. That's a huge problem. Instead, he's pretending to care about your vacation days and funds, overruling your decisions abut your resources.

I think you first need to determine what YOUR position is.
""I'm uncomfortable dating someone who takes international trips without me"" or whatever it is.

Then you're going to have another hard conversation.

"You're 100% correct. Before this time in my life, I was a very happy and confident overweight woman. I just lost weight because I wanted to not because I felt hideous. I danced and enjoyed myself and did things as if I wasn't overweight because I wasn't going to let that stop me from enjoying life. 

The whole point of her post was so vile. Fuck overweight people for trying to be happy, right? Until we don't lose the weight we aren't allowed to be happy or feel good. Fuck us."
"Thanks. I should have mentioned that we've tried therapy and it didn't work so well. Perhaps our therapist wasn't great. She just kind of kept telling us to figure it out and make time for each other :/ For like $100/session, it seemed not worthwhile to continue it. We then tried another one who was even worse - kept canceling sessions and not really understanding our problems at all when we did meet. 
Any ideas for how to find a competent therapist? I usually post on local social media groups for recommendations, but, perhaps unsurprisingly, my post  of ""Does anyone know a great marriage therapist?"" did not get any responses."

"Whoa whoa, I’m not saying that those things aren’t open for discussion. Obviously, it’s going to come up in relationships, as it should. I’m just saying she has made her position about the Reiki thing pretty clear and he’s pretty clearly against it. Asking questions that come from a place of trying to understand the other person? Cool. If the questions make the other person think more deeply and reassess their beliefs, even better. 

Beyond that, though, people come to their own conclusions about spirituality in their own time because it’s deeply personal. This girl might be making a big mistake, but him trying to convince her that it’s fake is likely not going to work, because her beliefs are based on personal stories to do with her family. 

She may look back later and realize he was right, and I totally understand the pickle he’s in watching her potentially waste a bunch of money.  I just know I would feel resentful and disrespected if my boyfriend tried to “prove” to me that my views are wrong, and from her responses written above, she is starting to feel that way too. "

"Have you told her she's not reducing the cost of her trip, she's just asking others to pay the cost for her? This is super rude. She obviously feels entitled to people's help and entitled to vacationing, which is a luxury and if she can't afford it she needs to not do it. Maybe show her these comments? I don't know how to get it through to her that this is inappropriate. I'm 25 and I love to travel and am in no way wealthy enough to do it as often as I want.

Taz, on the other hand, is more of a pet/lapdog breed (Westie), so it's hard to get even people who understand dog breeds to understand that he's a pretty time/effort-intensive lil guy.

&gt; You should know that you aren’t being a “helicopter mom”, you’re being responsible. You sound like a great pet owner.

Thank you so much. Even if I don't come away from this thread 100% knowing how to approach the situation with Jerry, it's still been really helpful to hear that the general consensus is that I'm not being psycho about this."
I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion. One person acting overly annoyed and petulant doesn't really constitute gaslighting. from Op's perspective it seems more like he is having other issues and taking it all out on her. 
"If your girlfriend is hospitalized while the two of you are in a foreign country, you need to do all you can to keep your own mind and body strong -- that includes rest and mind space.   Visit her as much as you can but there is no reason to camp out in her hospital room."
"I dealt with this before.  After the third argument/discussion on the issue, I ended the relationship.  Not going to give up my best friends just because the person I'm dating is insecure AF.

Was a shame, too, because we really got along well."
"I think it's fairly normal for women to need more clothing space than men. We almost automatically need one more drawer just for bras - an entire clothing category men don't need. But beyond that, there are more expectations for us to have a variety of clothes for different types of events. 

Even in the army - where it should be totally about function - when I was in, at least, men were issued dress uniform pants, and dress uniform shoes. The women were issued dress uniform pants, dress uniform skirts, dress uniform flat shoes, dress uniform heels. And for some reason that I never fully understood, we were often told by HQ that certain events required us to wear pants, others required us to wear skirts, etc. 

Civilian life is like that too. My husband can have one suit that he wears to work 3 times a week and nobody notices - and he can turn around and wear the same thing to weddings (even his own) and funerals. But if a woman wears the same dress to work 3 times a week, it becomes a thing. There was a news story about that a couples years ago: ""Male TV host wears same suit every day for a year; no one notices."""
You seem like a really nice person and have handled this with a lot of maturity. I’m glad things are looking better for you.
"Take the microphone and give a great speech about how the bride is the love of your life's mother, and how happy you are to have gotten to know her in the 7.5 years it's been since you met her daughter. And on behalf of both you and your wife, you wish your MIL and FIL a lifetime of happiness. "
"I've been a light sleeper my whole life, and while I expect those I live with to keep it down when I need to sleep, I know I can't expect dead silence because that would be impossible. I didn't like wearing earplugs either at first, but I got used to them. If he really can't tolerate them, then he should try turning on a fan or getting a white noise machine. They're great for drowning out the little noises of doors opening and closing, toilets flushing, sinks being turned on and off, etc."
"As others correctly pointed out, she's worried about her own job prospects. I don't think it's jealousy in the sense that she doesn't think you deserve what you've earned, more so that it's hard for a 21 year old to make it in the world in general, and the only way for her to get over that is for her to lock down a job. 

Sure she shouldn't be taking her stresses out on you, but as far as ending the relationship over the fact that she didn't fawn over your good news seems a little extreme. You mention she said 'well done' so I'm also not sure what your expectations are here."
"Honestly that depends so much on the individual height/frame. If you're 5 feet tall with narrow/thin bone structure, then honestly 160 lbs is pretty fat. But if you're 6 feet tall with broader bone structure, then 160 lbs could be average or even on the skinnier side. "

"is this in France? You don't have to answer that but I've spoken to a doctor who did med school in France and described this system. From what she told, if you end up ""bottom of the barrel"", your only options are provincial hospitals and then just the specialties that have little direct contact with patients. Just for some context. 

Something unrelated: has he looked into research positions? That way he wouldn't have to do a full career switch and start from square one."
"Professionals recommend 6-12 month minimum before introducing your SO to a child that age. 

So at the VERY short end OP should have introduced the kid for the first time in December. But that’s when they were already moving in...

I personally think for a kid aged 6, 12 months then you meet the kid. Another 12 months then you can consider moving in together. 

When you have a kid your life isn’t just about you. Sure if you’re single and childless you can go from that to living together in 12 weeks. I think it’s crazy personally. But you’re both adults and you get to make choices like that. If it implodes, well, you were adults. You knew the risks. You chose to anyway. So it goes. 

But when you have a child your life is no longer just yours. Your decisions affect their life. You moving in with an SO has a huge impact on their life. So you don’t get to be so rash and throw caution to the wind. As their parent your job is to slow down. Put them first. And protect them above all. You don’t get to have them meet a revolving door of SOs. They just got attached to Mike, but now he’s gone, here’s Fred. And there goes Fred. Onto bill!

It is very hard on children and will teach them not to get attached or trust the relationship will last. Then 10 years down the road you find yourself wondering why your kid never likes your SOs... Because you set them up to dislike them and be closed off. 

Would life be easier without a babysitter? Sure. Would life also be easier without a kid? Probably. But that’s not your life when you have a kid. You have to make the tough choices even if it’s inconvenient. Kids aren’t about convenience. And deserve more than what you find convenient. 

Source: am dating single dad. Met his kids after dating 15 months. Known them now almost a year. Won’t consider moving in until 3 years dating and 2 of knowing the kids. Yes it is was hard not seeing him all the time our first year of dating but it was worth it. Their mom met and moved in with her boyfriend in under a year. It’s very important they have a stable relationship model. And it’s better we figure out we look likely to last by dating longer before moving in. Moving in and breaking up will be even harder on everyone. We are mitigating the risk as much as possible. "
"Some medical knowledge like anatomy etc hasn't changed since Hippocrates day. I also hope that they are only really looking for safety here. Is the test marked in a way that the wrong answer counts against you? Maybe he's doing too much guessing? Or answering some questions in automatic fail kind of ways. 

At this point, however he is studying is not working, to continue repeating it isn't going to change the outcome. He needs to look at the exam as a game and figure out the right way to play it, not study medicine generally and hope it works this time. 

(Really I think he needs to change career, but what he's doing now isn't going to work)"
"Well, it was really the boyfriend's mistake."
"Then get your landlord involved.  Your landlord wants him there even less than you do.  There is a reason that clause is in the lease.  He can legally become a full tenant if he stays too long, and that is a major headache for the landlord.  A headache he is going to take care of.  

That being said, there is a chance you will get evicted too if you are on a shared lease..."
"If it were my friend, I would impress upon her the seriousness of the situation. Maybe have her read some articles about how abusers’ actions tend to escalate. Tell her you want to help her but you can’t help her if she wants to continue to put herself in harm’s way. She is only endangering herself and you by staying in touch. I would let her know that you’re being a friend by putting your foot down about this. I know it is hard to think clearly for people in an abusive situation but she has to know that any contact is dangerous and unhealthy at this point. 

Hopefully you or some other resource can help her to see the reality of the situation. If she cannot or if she gives you reason to doubt her if she claims to have discontinued contact then you are not wrong if you choose not to live with her. 

Edit - my best friend wanted to give an abusive ex the benefit of the doubt by not reporting him to the police. She had moved and limited her contact with him but he knew where her new spot was. He had never been so violent before but a few weeks after the move he came to her house, forced entry and I guarantee you he would have killed her if my cousin hasn’t been there to spend time with her. They both fought back and called the cops but they were lucky he didn’t come with a weapon or when she was home alone. Abusers escalate. "
"&gt;Labor Day is moveable. I just want to know that there are plans in the works for committing ourselves to each other.

A hard deadline is probably better. No one wants to be the SO who gives ultimatums, but a few people have posted here about how they agreed “marriage after x” and then it became y and really z before they’d be comfortable getting married, and the goalposts just kept moving. The stuff he’s mentioned is vague and not really within one's control. 

Saying he wants to live alone and be “free and independent” is also a pretty big red flag. "
"The reaction is normal and can be healthy if every family member is okay with it. OP is not okay with it and has asked them to stop. 

They haven't stopped. And that is where it crossed the line from dark humor to cruelty. A healthy coping mechanism isn't okay when it is causing another family member pain. Full stop. "
"&gt; if he decides to stay with you.

Why would he? She has already signaled that their bright future is in fact very dim and their good sex life is starting to get boring. This relationship is down for the count, and while it may get back up again once or twice, recovering and turning it around is in the miracle category at this point."
"&gt; Platonic intimacy is still intimacy, and sometimes the platonic part drops away very suddenly.

This.

I was trying to explain that in another discussion a couple of weeks ago and was downvoted.    Long lasting relationships  are based on intimacy and intimacy starts and grows outside the bedroom in hundreds of small interactions that give the participants the chance to develop and deepen trust over time.  Dating can't compared to day to day low key exposure when you have the chance to talk about anything and everything over a long stretch of time.

"What she did to the guy who groped her was an underreaction imo. 

But she clearly believes physical retaliation is okay in general, and to me that's deeply concerning. She's truly unable to stop herself from reacting? That just seems scary to me. I think it's a red flag. "
"You shouldn't care what your brother thinks at this point, if he is willing to cut you off for dating a white man. "

Spoiler alert:  He's not going to change."
But ultimately you see your decision as being the right one because you are standing by it. You need to accept that what you did was a mistake.
"Coming at someone the way you did (extremely defensive and seemingly angrily) doesn't become negated just because you said ""oh, but I'm not directing this at you, so don't worry!""

Just like someone saying something mean or offensive and then ending with ""I'm just joking!"" doesn't make it okay or a joke.

I imagine your wife probably responds the way she does because she's emotionally exhausted from attempts at communication between you two and she is apprehensive about the sort of emotional environment you create when you're upset. "
"He's not responsible for all the dates, but if he's shooting down her date ideas, then he should be contributing some of his own."
"She's controlling. This isn't healthy. 

She didn't get her way. She was disappointed. That's cool. You can be disappointed. You can even be unhappy with the situation. But she decided to throw a prolonged temper tantrum and is doing ridiculous things (not talking at all the days you're apart??) to make this situation miserable for you. A good healthy partner would listen and try to understand where you're coming from, even if they're not thrilled with it. A healthy partner will let you know they're not happy in a way that isn't attacking you, just communicating how they feel. A good healthy partner would support you and help you meet your needs and understand that many of your needs have absolutely nothing to do with them. 

She is not a good healthy partner friendo."
So you're stringing her along out of selfishness?

He's right about one thing: you should leave and not come back. Don't date someone who calls you ugly.
"I love you, I still need to find out who I am. That’s the lamest way of telling you that he is done with you. 

It is normal reaction if you are in love with someone. When my wife and I were dating, there were breakup fights and she went into hysteria... it scared the crap out of me that I wanted nothing but to take care of her. Some women cry and get very emotional. It is not uncommon or unnatural. You are probably beating yourself up over nothing. I get the embarrassment... it will dampen over time."

"Once you get a GED, community college is the right choice for you. 

They have a substantial number of ""lower level"" classes that will get you ready for actual college level coursework. 

Also, you can finish entire 2 years of your 4 year degree at a community college, while paying just a fraction of the cost. Most community colleges have a transfer program with local 4 year universities, where they will accept all the classes taken from the particular track at CC, and apply them towards your 4 year degree.

"Relationships dont work without trust. 

*Period*. *Full stop*. 

If you can't trust her to go to this party where her ex will be then you guys shouldn't be together. 

If she really cares about her relationship with you, then *she'll* police her own behavior w/r/t Todd because that's what reliable partners do. Yes, people lose inhibitions with drugs/alcohol, but she's **28**, not 19. She should know by now her limits around alcohol and drugs and how much she can have without losing her judgment skills (if she doesn't, that's a red flag in its own right and there's 9000 r/relationships posts about that). And she's already shown that she's capable of setting boundaries when it comes with her ex; she cut contact with Todd after he started trying to get back with her. 
 
Talk to her about your concerns. Set some boundaries, **together**, when it comes to behavior at the party. 

IF you can't trust her to police her own behavior in risky situations/around her ex, then you really need to do her a favor and break up with her. "

"If she posted, she’d be told to dump you.

You’ve demonstrated you’ll capable of taking what you want without concern or consent.  Pretty hard to unring that bell.

At minimum, you need to put your phone in a different room if/when you have sex again.  Delete any photos you took and any ones she has sent to help alleviate her concern you’re sharing them.  Spend more time at her place where she can feel less concerned about hidden cameras."

"Thank you. This sub leaps to accusations of abuse wayyyyyy too easily. Especially with women, weirdly. It's like they're trying to overcorrect the unfortunate trope that women can't be abusers."
Yeah exactly. This situation could easily have been with a 2200$ one and a 2600$ one. Point would be the same. 
"I understand where your coming from I would not like it either if I were you. I would make a point to your girlfriend that because of the past that it bothers you. I think you do trust your gf (reading your post) but you don't trust this ex which is very normal. I would see what she chooses to do. 

What concerns me is why she said one thing and you both agreed it was a good idea that she then changed her mind and put you in this situation that would not sit well with me. I don't understand why she told you one thing and  is now doing another it says that she had no intention in the first place. (actions speak louder than words) this being said she has every right to go but is not really thinking of you here in my opinion. I would definitely not feel valued here but I wouldn't want to stop her going to see her friends so my advise is to let her go and see if she's any different after the event with this said ex and things like arguments and distance and other red flags. I would not go looking but I would be aware of them and address them as you see fit.

Regarding boundaries you got to reflect on your last relationships and decide how you want to be treated in this one and maybe your next one, which part was not ok and why was it and so forth.

Also the fact that she still talks to an ex (""despite breaking of contact"") that is trying to get back with her and she is not sticking to no contact would really have me worried, could you explain how this ex contacted her if she went no contact that would be a huge red flag and you would have every right to walk away. I would based on the fact that she talked to an ex while in a relationship who was trying to get back with her despite her saying she wasn't talking to him I would leave just on that mate but I don't know the ins and outs of what been said between them or not but I still would not like that. This again is her saying one thing and doing another I would be careful with this girl."
"I think she chose the karaoke and dancing because that’s what she enjoys. With no thought to what anyone else would like.

Considering how she treated that poor girl soon after, I don’t think this kind of selfishness is new to her."
"She's an adult. She can decide for herself if her relationships are healthy and if she's being abused or not and if they are unhealthy and/or she is being abused, it's still none of your business and nothing you can do. Sucks, but that's parenthood. The only thing you can do is be open and supportive and if/when she comes to you for help (if she ever feels that comfortable or that you have that kind of relationship), then you can ASK her what she wants, in terms of how to best support her. 

Frankly, this whole thing is coming off a bit patronizing, both to your adult daughter as well as to her mother. You've been re-involved in their lives for 3 months and what, now you want screening privileges to decide who your daughter can and can't have relationships with? Um, no. I think you should work on mutual respect. These women are adults and can handle themselves just fine and if they can't, there isn't fuckall you can do anyway. "
" I'm not the person you're asking, but I would feel the same way. I wouldn't ask you to get therapy, but I wouldn't want to be with you anymore. To me, it would indicate a set of severely mismatched values. I'm not even against prostitution, per se, I just think it's a dangerous/ seedy/ unbecoming way of life and I wouldn't want to be with someone who participated in it. Just like I'm not against marijuana, but I wouldn't want to be with someone who smoked it. "
"This is a situation where I'd say you need to pick and choose your battles. Is this really something you want to blow up into a big argument?

"Honestly, With the information provided, I don’t understand where her fiancé is coming from at all. Unless there’s more to the story, he’s frankly being incredibly judgmental and just an all around jackass. Kate hasn’t done anything wrong, their personalities just don’t mesh, and he’s trying to emotionally guilt her into ending the friendship entirely? Its just so unreasonable. "
"In this context, it sounds a lot like he went through the messages looking for something that he could use to turn the argument around on you, either to shut you up or to put you on the defensive to divert you from the topic at hand. No matter what his reasoning, it's really manipulative at the very least and claiming he's lost your trust due to such a innocuous conversation is also controlling. You need to tread carefully going forward because his behavior is full of red flags."
"So my best friend is an opiate addict.  Started with legit meds to buying pills on the street to injecting heroin.  We’ve heard it all. We’ve stood by her when she had evenings like the one you got told about later.  Her closest friends from high school pretty much have abandoned her for similar events. She has been to rehab many times.  She has been to jail. She lost a great job in which she was wildly successful.  Right now, she has been clean from her drug of choice but just took two steps back with a dui.  

We just get worn out. I love her and care for her.  We all miss the person she was but we haven’t spoken to that version of her in years. We keep hanging around waiting.  We want nothing more then to stop worrying and fighting and crying. We all want her to have a wonderful life. However none of us have any power here. It’s all her.  

I understand the physiology of addiction and I know it to be real and a mighty big hurdle to overcome.  Yet, at some point, any addict that is is clean today made that happen.  They did it, alone.  Sure they may have had some support but the change was made because the addict chose to not be held down any longer.  

The people that love you will let you back in,  eventually. Just because you think you’ve been doing good for a few months, doesn’t mean they are ready. Just like at times you weren’t ready to get clean, they aren’t ready to trust, just yet.  Some will not come back. Some will.  You will not get to decide or push any of them for more then they are willing to give. 

Life is worth it. Perhaps you won’t be close to the same people like you once were but there are countless people who will love you today. You will meet people who admire your courage and fortitude.  They will not have any painful memories which taint the relationship and they only see you for the kind and strong man you can be. Just because they may not be the same people, doesn’t mean it can’t be great.  Good luck.  You deserve to be amazing.  "

"Hi, 

I was you.  


I had an ex husband that was a pabst blue ribbon guy at 32when I was ready to move up to wine and micro brews lifestyle.  

I even got my ex to ""buy in"" for a while but reverted back in the end.  I ain't against a cheap beer day now and then but it was indication to me that we had two different ideas of what our future should be.  We had two lifestyle goals.  He wanted to be in bars, playing pool, taking fireball shots.  I wanted to be a two expensive beer, done for the night, with a bit of trivia night kind of girl.  We were just becoming two different ideals

IMO opinion, when I was in the same situation I would see two feelings. 

1) you worked really hard on something and wanted to be done a certain way and your husband decided to completely takeover and do it his way  like @drbarnowl said


This second one may be me projecting but go ahead and have a listen

2) you have an idea that you are walking away from that type of lifestyle and he isn't.

AFTER this all blows over, a few weeks, start talking to him about how he wants to see himself in his 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's.    I feel that you two may need to start doing some future planning and seeing and planning now for your future.

I think there is a real need to refine your marital communication and marital goals"
"You are not in a respectful marriage. You might struggle with lows elf esteem, but you come across as so kind and disciplined, I guarantee you that you deserve better. Lots better. "
"So... your husband is the ""fun guy"" ... the one who has to be the life of the party, even if that means undermining you by taking over the party?  And he didn't even help clean-up, other than a token effort, because there was something more fun to go to (like golf) and dumped it on you (the responsible one)?

Does he always having something more fun to do?  Do you take care of all mundane responsibilities like clean-up or manage the household while he goes off an has fun? (or is ""too tired"").  

I don't think your friends are the issue, they just went with it... and are probably used to your husband being the fun guy, and perhaps the comments back were less ""that was fun"" as much as ""that was entirely unexpected because that's not what was advertised"".  

The issue sounds like your husband prioritizes being fun and liked by all, but hasn't matured enough to realize part of being a mature considerate partner is not having to be the centre of attention all the time and doing the less-fun/thank-less stuff like cleaning.  

I wonder if this is a problem in other areas, where else is he doing fun and avoiding responsibility?  Does he help out other people before doing stuff at home (the boring stuff, not the hero I'm amazing jobs)?  Does he do the dishes and expect accolades?  Does he undermine when you are trying to do ""the right thing?"" with jokes?

For the party, I'd sit him down and talk to him about how he went explicitly against your wishes for the party, took over to be the centre of attention, and failed to help clean-up.  He was disrespectful and immature.  You also need to work on your boundaries, you should have expected he do the majority of the clean-up and not play golf after what he did.  Ask him how he's going to demonstrate both of these things on an ongoing basis.

I'd then consider if this is a much bigger issue (because I know couples where the fun husband undermines the wives parenting with jokes, or she's stuck paying the bills and he's playing video games, or he's out with friends and she's home cleaning, or all other sorts of ""fun guy"" habits).  If that's the case, it's not just communication, but your own boundaries you need to work on."
I'd cry at all my birthday parties growing up because they didn't go exactly how I pictured them (even though people were having fun.)
"He's a predator.  You've only been dating two months - break it off, immediately, before he gets to be more than just handsy."
"&gt; Sounds like the other 10(?) people involved wanted something totally different.

They're not hosting. They don't get to make that call. She would have been well within her rights as a host to start showing people the door. I've been to parties before where the guests were ready to keep going, but the hosts were like ""We're getting pretty tired. Time to call it a night. Let's do this again soon."" I was sad to stop, but if I want a party to go a different way, I'm free to host one."
"You said she 'played up' how gross it was, so it can't be that awful. Your parents aren't stupid, they know you watch porn. They won't care about that in comparison to what your sister has done."
"So in your perfect world, OP would have essentially had a snit and tossed all these people out of her house? Once the party was going in a different direction there was no changing it in the moment. ""Shut that shit down""? Honestly that would've been a really stupid choice and created a lot of drama and definitely ruined her party. 

At least she knew people were having a good time even if it completely broke her heart people were ruining her party."
"This is exactly what I was wondering, too.  But like you, didn't wanna just make big baseless assumptions.  That's a totally valid thing to want.  Her and her husband just need to be on the same page.  He should have asked before doing what he did.  And she needs to sit down and talk with him about it if this is the case.  "
I've never had an in depth conversation about my sex life with any friend. It's really weird to me how common this seems to be.
"Holy shit, are you me? I went to my department head to tell my side and made it clear I wasn't trying to take any action, just trying to make a third party aware of the situation. Then I started CC-ing the department head on every high stakes email conversation I had with my advisor. It was pretty shit right to the end but I made it, my career wasn't ruined and is in fact on the rise, and I hear my advisor lightened up substantially after losing 3 students."
"#1 priority: Make sure you are safely away from him. 

Once you know you are safe, then you can formulate the rest of your plan. 

To reinforce other replies, this is reproductive coercion, it is a type of abusive behavior. This is not normal. Please stay away from this man. 

Do not think that you are ruining his career, HE made choices to ruin it. Do his command a favor and report this behavior. If his command doesn’t act appropriately, take it to NCIS.

"That's a pretty dramatic description for what actually happened, which is that he brought some beers and changed the music.  She could have said ""Hey, no,"" but instead she ran away to sulk and cry.  They both sound like they're deeply immature and bad at talking.  "
Maybe but she would need more proof than her telling the court that he admitted it to her because he could just say he didn't.  Then it becomes he said she said and that will never get a conviction.
"&gt; is worth much more than paying 7.5% interest on $40k  

&gt; You guys should speak to a financial advisor.

No reasonable financial advisor would argue to invest in anything before paying off 7.5% debt.  Like maybe there's a discussion to be had at 4% or 5%, but 7.5% isn't even close."
Sounds like you're referring to the earlier post about the twins. There's a big difference between two people deciding with their words to try for a baby and consensually having unprotected sex--even if one of them had reservations inside their head--and someone specifically *not* consenting to unprotected sex and having it sprung upon them by deception.
Yea exactly my thinking. Last night when it happened she swore she saw a person next to me in the dark.
"I'm 8 pounds overweight, was 40.  Doctor brought the hammer down over my blood sugar.  And know what my husband said?  ""I'll buy you flowers for every five pounds you lose.""  And he does.  "
Then odds are good you're probably better off without her.  It sounds like she's really not a good person.  
"&gt;you think I should just go about my normal life and not make time for someone?

I don't think that's what they are saying, you should obviously carve out some time to hang out with someone. However, going out of your way to be available all the time makes it seem like you don't have your own life and you're dependent on the person you're dating. Which is a turn off because they want someone who has time for them but also has their own things to do. It's all about balance. "
"So... No. The answer is no.

You name one hobby here - gaming. And you don't actually share it with him at all.

So what's so great about these aligned hobbies?? You could be with someone who actually does stuff you like **with** you."
I just looked up what they are and oh. My. God. Hell no. 
"The double standard is suspect. I understand why she wouldn't want to bring you with her friends because having a guy along ruins the dynamic, but then you should be allowed to go out on your own too."
"To me it depends on what he means by tracking fertility. The symptothermal method is a legitimate birth control method that is highly effective if used correctly, though unforgiving if you cut corners. A fertility predictor app based on calendar calculations is no method of birth control at all.

"&gt; but I also think she was equally in the wrong for turning her head and walking away. So if you don't care about the problems women face, well, neither does she."
"Can I ask what may be a silly question? Does your boyfriend have any facial hair, or is it possible he uses a facial product that may be irritating your skin? It's just that you're noticing breakouts and itchy in areas that are commonly irritated after a heavy making out session.

I think it's totally fine for you to tell him that you really want to feel comfortable and enjoy spending time in his home, and that would be a lot easier for you if he would tidy up before you came over. 

But please don't consider moving in yet, even if he does clean up his act. Three months together is just not long enough for that kind of commitment. "
"When you try to do everything, you end up doing nothing. 

By the same token, when you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one. 

&gt; I really think it’s okay especially since we are together practically 95% of the time and see her family a lot as well as mine. She claims I’m being selfish

You spend 95% of your time with your girlfriend and she *still* isn't happy. My guess is you could attend her step-sister's event, but the next time you choose to go to your friends wedding instead of her family's brunch, she will call you selfish.

Go have a good time with your family. "
Dude you seem like you could overexpain boiled water to yourself. You didn't want to commit so she found someone who did. Easy peasy. Now go and find some other nice artsy girl that will be happy to live with your complexity. 
"Yeah, you're too young. The dynamics of a relationship *vastly* changes when you leave the uni because now you don't live in the student bubble anymore. Don't get pressured to getting married by her or her mom. You're not someone's escape plan."
"&gt; I was not allowed to talk to my friends about issues

Nobody gets to decide this but you! Complete and utter relationship secrecy is not the answer. Complte and utter openness with your friends isn't the answer. You have to weigh the moral and ethical costs of a given situation and make a choice."
"She is cruel, Thank you for the reply."
"How do you know if your state does this? What terms would I use to investigate that?

Yeah part of my issue is the missing out on making friends part. I do enjoy a lot of alone time but not a whole weekends worth. I'm definitely going to look into social activities or meet up groups but I don't even know where to start looking.
"I wouldn't frame it exactly as you did in the post, she will only be more hurt hearing all the little details, and there won't be anything you could say to justify it to her. "
"Then who is it you feel is ""predatory"" here? Just curious. I get that this is weird or perhaps inappropriate, but why that word? This girl just seems meek and stunted."
"And on weekends it's sport #1, mommy &amp; daddy #2, OP #3.  I'd not put up with that.

"&gt;I do not exaggerate when I tell you that that was the single most painful night of my life. I felt so much pain that I wanted to become so heavy that I would be able to crush through the ground beneath me until it all caved in on me and buried me. **ut(sic) what was going on in that room was only half of the pain. I was so panicked and absolutely crushed with guilt about what I had done to my friend.... He hadn't deserved that. He was just as lost and searching as I was, and most of our conversations revolved around our spouses and families and how much love we had for them, and how much we didn't intend for this to happen, or even want it.**

If the way you wrote this should be chalked up to the perspective from which you wrote it and my analysis is off base, I apologize, but...

From reading exactly what you wrote and trying to read between the lines, you really, really need to take a serious look at your position in all of this. Your husband, who is working full time, going to school full time, AND raising your kids and dealing with the issue of their potential abuse at the hands of their father, according to your description, doesn't seem to hardly cross your mind. You're sitting in a room dealing with this with your husband and you're agonizing about what this internet friend is going through? 

&gt; I acknowledged that this had been going on for years and WE had both done this; we had become roommates, and we had never even noticed the distance that had grown between us. 

I'm sorry, but it sounds to me like your husband has bent over completely backwards to make y'alls life work and to say that he is partially responsible for this situation because he is doing everything you outlined is doing him a disservice to say the least. 

In order to feel better, if you ask me, you need to first face the fact that **you screwed up.** You need to admit to your husband and, more importantly, to yourself that you did what you did and take ownership for what you did. Then, you need to commit yourself to making changes in your life that will allow you and your husband to bring things back into balance. 

What you had was not a ""consuming online emotional relationship."" It was an emotional affair. You need to be thinking about what to do to repair your relationship with your husband and earn back his trust. 

Edit in response to your edit:

&gt; but it is something that happened to me. I didn't want it, and did my best with what little knowledge I had at the time. Please try and be kind.... I could use some help, not judgement :(....

Wow. No, this did not happen to you. Until you stop thinking about it in those terms, you will continue to suffer. This isn't judgement, this is the truth, though I'm sure it is harsh to receive it this way. "

None of this relates to this:

"I met my husband playing D&amp;D and worked in a game store for a while - here's the scoop:

The D&amp;D books that you bought are part of an ""edition"" which is the rules of the game.  This includes all of the ""mechanics"" of how it works, like how characters move, combat, character stats, etc.  

Every so often they'll publish a whole new set of books with updated rules.  This serves to make everybody buy the books  again, and also to change the rules to try to make the game more fun and easier to understand.  For example, in the early editions, sometimes low numbers were good and sometimes high numbers were good.  This was super confusing, so starting with edition 3 ""high is always better than low"".  Additionally, releasing a new edition gives everybody a ""start over from scratch"" so weird loopholes and out of balance mechanics are gone and it encourages people to reset their expectations and get creative again.

Edition 4 made some major changes that turned out to be rather unpopular.  It increased reliance on miniatures, and reduced the amount of complexity for most characters. This took away some of the fun for the older edition players who derived a lot of joy out of scouring the books for the perfect combination of skills, items, feats, classes, etc to pull off that super epic ability.  

If you just started you're probably playing edition 5 which I haven't played much, but seems to have reversed some of the more unpopular 4th ed changes."
Kids move schools ALL THE TIME.  Its much easier when they are young than in the middle of high school.  He will have the added benefit of getting to know his extended family.
"&gt; A couple months ago I guess my girlfriend rsvp’d to her step sisters quince. Now I don’t remember if she told me about it or not so let’s just assume she did. 

The vagueness of this is kind of key. It's either her fault for making plans for you without consulting or your fault for not taking the time to put this in your calendar, double booking and cancelling on something you were told about *months ago*. 

Secondly, these aren't two little events. It's a wedding and a quinceañera. A quinceañera especially is a culturally significant activity and if it is like every single one I have ever been to it is likely that they have been planning, budgeting and rehearsing for anywhere up to a year. It is a big deal for you to miss out on it and depending on her family could be pretty insulting not to go. 

If it is your fuck up, bite the bullet and go to both. 

edit: last sentence"
"&gt;When I discovered this I was angry at him and didn't want to talk. I tend to raise my voice when mad so I have worked on removing myself from the situation and discussing it at a later point so I have time to cool down.

you are allowed to have feelings. It is OK to be mad and express your anger at him when he really fucks up.  

Go downstairs and rearrange his music room and do a really shitty job and make it hard for him to find stuff or do anything.  Unplug all his cables and put them away for him.  When he's upset parrot his own lines back at him - you were helping - how can he be upset since you were cleaning - etc.  Maybe a taste of his own medicine will get thru to him."

"Tell her to proceed with the court case. She has to pay a small fee to file the grievance. Then she has the onus of proving the value of that stuff to the judge. Then if the judge agrees, you pay her. 
Or offer her the $200 if you feel that is a fair amount, and if she still insists on the $500... she should prove it to a judge. "
"What on earth makes you think a moment of affection between two parents is a lie? Obviously OP loves her husband and he loves her, just because they're having issues with him being inconsiderate doesn't mean they resent and hate each other. Just because they're having problems doesn't mean they don't still love each other. Stop projecting, this is an incredibly rude comment and I'm indignant on OP's behalf.

Good luck figuring out what *'real'* love looks like."
"I'm sure your friends would never have wanted to hurt you, so the first thing you can do is tell them that you're really uncomfortable with this and don't see that changing. I expect they've got contingency plans and had began preparing themselves that your husband might say no before they even asked him the question.


That leaves you with one last problem: your husband doesn't think of you as a team and is fully capable of turning your life upside down without any hesitation. How can you trust him after this?"
I don’t think you know how language works
You don’t trust your boyfriend enough to respect his privacy; that’s not a great sign.
"Yeah, I definitely disagree with the advice about ""cut her off. You don't deserve that disrespect, don't ever see her again."" That's a bit extreme, and it's likely not anything she did *wrong* or even unreasonable, frankly. Most therapists have similar fees - do I always agree? No. But that's how it goes. And again, there is a level of investment with mental health professionals, and this is one time where I think giving into the 'sunk cost fallacy' is wise.

Unless you're prepared to be 100% honest (which I certainly cannot with stuff like this), or ignore it and truly let it go without resentment (which, again, is hard for me, but YMMV), it doesn't have to be about the *money,* it can be about your budget. I earn decently, and it can be irksome when people suggest that since I can technically afford something, that it's not a big deal. You still operate within a budget, even if you earn well, and get a raise. Hell, that's how acquiring wealth works.

I totally get not wanting to lie, and that's smart! But I also think that it's reasonable to bring it up and not *totally* eat the financial burden of that fee. 

As I see it, you have 3 options: 1- bring it up and ask it to be reversed, knowing that you'll either need to find someone new or feel bothered when she doesn't reverse it, 2- let it go entirely and try to not feel anything about it, or 3- mention it in a 'softer' way and make it more about your budget than the money; skipping a session will put some of the burden of the fee on her

Well wishes! Stuff like this is really a hard spot to be in! I truly believe that finding a new therapist, seeing as you like this one and she's helped you, should be a very last resort"
"Yeah, the whole line “I’d sleep with you and keep dating her if no one would get hurt” sounds a lot like sniffing around and planting the idea of making her a side piece. I have no idea why no one else is seeing what a huge red flag that was. This guy is manipulative and not even clever about it. If OP had said “I can keep a secret and I won’t get hurt!” He’d fall into her vagina with a quickness."
"This is exactly the point that so many other posters are missing. It isn't just about the party. The party is a symptom of a larger disease. At root, it's about the way he treats her, and he treats her like shit."

"I am Indian and honestly, I don't care if you don't find Indians attractive. Indians tend to date within their own race anyways for cultural reasons. It's actually more insulting for you to try to date someone you're not attracted to. Don't sweat it, everyone has preferences. Just don't be an asshole about your preferences. I am generally not attracted to black &amp; white men/women though there are some exceptions and I don't find that racist. I doubt Indian guys out there really care that 1 girl doesn't want to date them tbh. You're overthinking this. "
"&gt;When the waitress came, I inquired about an item with her. He perked up, ""let's just get an appetizer!""

"Just try and figure out which particular lotion smells bad. You can test then individually, one per night. It's best to test on the skin, but go ahead and sniff the product individually first to see if you can find the culprit. Then offer to buy her a replacement for that particular product, and let her choose the replacement.

I would try to avoid comparing your routines. There is a huge cultural element to female skincare, and you won't win any friends by criticizing the cost or complexity of her routine. Stick to the basics: one of the products she uses is giving some lingering scent, and you miss smelling her.


A number of months ago, I started using a brilliant lip product at night for moisture. My husband criticized its pungent smell (lanolin is an ingredient) and said he didn't want to kiss me and that the smell reminded me of his mother. Ouch- message received! I rotated it out with a scent-free product most nights, and save it for sparing use. But, I also laughed and didn't throw it away entirely- it's my face and my choice.

So good luck and show her you want to work with her, don't just attack the whole routine or belittle her choices. It's important to her for a reason."

"You were right not to want him after this.

He ended things in a selfish manner, devoid of empathy towards you and completely selfish on his part. 

I am big on respect as the primary foundation stone of relationships, and there is no respect towards you in his actions.

unfortunately, shoulders to cry on are hard to send through the internet. 

So, be young, be free, do all the things you like and understand you are leaving behind a weak and disrespectful man. "
"People freak me out. I have celebs/Internet personalities that I enjoy but I can't imagine giving a rat's ass about their personal lives/families/SOs. Like I truly don't understand that. That kind of rabid fandom truly creeps me out (a friend of mine once went to stand outside to catch a glimpse of some celebrity and I remember thinking, ""what the fuck? Who goes and gawks at a human being like they're a zoo animal?""). There was a YouTuber I followed and she stopped vlogging/talking about her personal life because some crazy person tried to blackmail her into being ""IRL"" friends somehow, it's so scary. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.

My fear would be if your husband does some kind of statement about privacy, it could offend some fans (because some people apparently lack boundaries) or make them paint you as the bad guy/evil harpy wife. Maybe he could take the Lin Manuel Miranda route and kindly ask people to take pics of your child down/say something along the lines of, ""I love you guys and appreciate the support, but I want my kid to have a normal childhood/I'm worried about how online attention could affect them, so I'm making that part of my life off limits, can you guys help me out by refraining from discussion on this stuff?"" Like, make them feel like they're helping him out/part of something good? Maybe a PR person could help out with the best way to do this. 

I'm by no means a celebrity, but I have some local recognition because my job puts my name out in the public a lot. For my own sanity, I don't google myself, ever, and if I see mention of myself somewhere, I DO NOT read it. I click off immediately. I told my husband not to google me either. One of my colleagues was getting bashed relentlessly on a local online forum and I never want to read that stuff about myself. Someone also found pics she had on a dating profile and edited them to look much more scandalous than they were and posted them on a website. People are fucked up. She was able to get them taken down but it's so disheartening. She even had a creepo show up at her house. Early on, she would always check in at public places or tweet, ""I'm at such-and-such place, if you're in the neighborhood, stop and say hi!"" and didn't get why I was like, ""Uhhh, please don't do that."" That creepy attention put a stop to that. It's hard when you have innocent intentions and can't imagine people being such creeps and then they are. :("
"If they're both working full time to make ends meet, that is a bit much to ask.

Have you ever entertained the idea of hiring a professional nanny who could be trained to deal with your son's needs? I know that's more expensive than having family pick up the slack so you can have personal time away from your son, but it might be worth it. If you're lower income, there may be some care service options that you could apply for.

On the general topic, one thing to think about is that this will probably happen with any relationship you're in at some point. You seem to be struggling with the fact that you're more tied down due to your son's condition than this specific vacation particularly. Have you ever met with a therapist to talk about these things?"
"Nope, not at all.  But I think you’re dealing with a lot of internalized misogyny, since you really buried the lede about your husband’s awful behavior. 🤷🏼‍♀️"

"I think your husband gets to go to his coworker and say, ""I'm so sorry, but I misunderstood the situation. My wife had already planned to give those tickets to friends/family. Here's your money back with my sincerest apologies.""

"I’m a little confused as to what type of “decision” you think you have to make. You’re sleeping with a man who isn’t committed to you except to the extent of a friendship.  You don’t owe him anything because he doesn’t owe you anything.  He isn’t asking you for commitment. You can say no to sleeping with him at any point. There’s not really a decision you have to make.  

Just keep dating others and looking for what you actually want. I personally think the whole FWB concept is incredibly naive and doesn’t take into account the vast spectrum of human emotions or the biological closeness felt during sex. I don’t think it’s a route to happiness but instead meaningless attachment without the security and love of a deeper relationship. It’s not wrong for you to want a relationship, but it would be wrong for you to ignore that healthy desire. 

"
I honestly believe that it is a power move even if he doesn’t realize it is. Sorry you’re dealing with this. No 34 yo should be doing this. It’s childish and ridiculous.

So much this. When I went off to college, part of why I went a few hours from home was because I was just so sick of being around people who knew every embarrassing thing I'd done in elementary school and vice versa. I just wanted to meet people without all that kiddie baggage.

A lot of women won't care about this, but a lot will.

Often women like men to be men, they enjoy the masculine traits of them, the strength, confidence, energy, etc. 

Wearing stockings is very feminine and can ruin the image of a masculine man for the women.

I've seen a few posts on here (and also r/sex) where women talk about trying to indulge their man's fantasy involving submission/ female domination/ him wearing panties it stockings, and the women saying it's an extreme turn off.

Everybody is entitled to their opinion on sexuality. I personally prefer my women feminine, and wouldn't be attracted to overly masculine women. And for some women it's vice-versa.

So enjoy your fetish, but be prepared for that potential reaction. Especially if a women goes into dating you thinking you're a strong military man. But of course you could find a women like in this thread who wouldn't mind it at all."
"Hi! I’m a vegetarian, so hopefully I can help with this a little bit. It’s pretty difficult to have a diet with less/no meat and still keep it low carb. I figured that’s why he’s eating so much fish. He wants to have an adequate amount of protein without loading up on carbs. 

There are lots of amazing protein options for vegetarians, but he might be a little wary about them because of his previous low carb lifestyle. Most low carb diets encourage people to not eat legumes or grains, but I really think he should try incorporating them into his diet! Beans, lentils, quinoa, and steel cut oats have good amounts of protein and loads of other nutrients. There’s even pastas now that are made entirely out of lentils! These options do have carbs. It might be something your boyfriend has to get used to, but I think if he wants to cut down on meat, he’s going to have to consider eating more carbs. It’s all about balance! If he can do this, the meal options for the both of you will increase. 

I think you’re both going to have to compromise a little here. Obviously fish is off the table for you, but are you open to eating more vegetarian dishes? &amp; for him, he might have to come to terms with having more carbohydrates in his diet so that the two of you can enjoy a meal together again. 

I’d also suggest checking out some food blogs for inspiration! Changing your diet can be difficult when you’re not used to it. Since he’s into healthy eating, I’d recommend Cookie &amp; Kate and Minimalist Baker to get you started. They both have delicious recipes that can be modified to suit your tastes. Good luck!"
"Uh, do you have a source on this? "
"You need to communicate with your boyfriend. He apologized and you said it was fine-but it wasn't? You need to tell him that. He needs to know how much that hurt you, and he needs to work on thinking before he speaks.

It doesn't seem that the two are particularly close, and you mentioned that this girl is very introverted. Is it possible that he was trying to make her feel more comfortable but came off too strong?

Finally, you have some confidence issues, that is clear. You need to realize and find the things that are attractive about *you*, and what about you your boyfriend loves. Try to find one thing at the end of each day that makes you attractive. Talk to your boyfriend and maybe have him start doing more verbally romantic things. Once you realize your own qualities and values, it will be easier to brush off other people who *might* be more attractive to some."
"you aren’t overreacting, imo anyway. showering once a month is.... kinda crazy to me? maybe you need couples counselling. or anyone with half a mind to slap him out of it. he’s obviously fallen out of some very important habits and needs to rebuild them. make yourself clear. set some ultimatums. you don’t have to break up over this, but if he isn’t going to respect you enough to SHOWER, then ?????????? if you have to argue with him to shower, who is really being ridiculous here? a shower is a lot easier than an argument. or losing the affection of your wife. 

edit: also, the comment about depression. you need to talk about this."
He could've been nicer about it but his concerns and wants are very valid 
"Ann does seem like a good person but I really don't understand why she can't just... Not engage with guys when hanging out with you. Why does she have to entertain every guy that comes up to her? That sounds exhausting and that's not really being a good friend to you. Does she notice how they treat you like shit? I wouldn't be interested in any guy that ignored my attempts to bring in my friend into conversations.

Is it so hard to just say no to guys and focus on hanging out with you?"
"You seem like a chronic talker who can talk himself into anything but has trouble delivering. 

I have a friend who thinks that TALKING about opening a restaurant is all it takes to have one, and year after year he is surprised and confused about why he doesnt have a restaurant yet. He has elaborate menu plans, interior design ideas, staffing procedures, food sources. But he hasnt applied for any loans, talked about building leases, or WALKED IN A DOOR AND PUT MONEY DOWN on anything. But he is totally ""this close"" and it will be open ""this year."" It has been 5 years of the same thing.  In that time other restaurants have opened with a similar concept.

Time is passing. Every second is a missed opportunity. Pick up the phone. Make a reservation.

"I'm not married, so maybe married people will have a better opinion on this than me and my opinion may be totally off base.

"So he is changing his name to something similar to Typhoon Terror? Torturer?  Okay I get that this is related to wrestling, but it's still really stupid. Is this even real? 

Like your parents are overreacting and probably egging him on to do it by being so strict, but your little brother is being kinda dumb at the same time. 

Anyway, I'd stay out of this mess. Maybe let your brother know that this isn't the best idea and maybe have him compromise by making his middle name""Typhoon Terror""

We know she's desperate and manipulative. I wouldn't put anything past her."
"Aww isn't it sad when you slip, trip and fall on someone else's dick?

Dude she made a deliberate choice to cheat. She obviously got hit hard with regrets and was open about it which may mean that she's actually remorseful and willing to rebuild your trust. 

Visit chumplady take a read through what genuine remorse looks like. And consider whether she is showing it. 

Either way postpone the wedding. Divorce is far more expensive than a cancelled wedding. "

Mike Pence would never talk that way to Mother!
Yep. Sometimes the relationship itself is so toxic it should just be ended. This really seems like one of those times
Wanting your partner to help you out when you have the flu is not out of bounds or super-needy. Calling your partner after they've been gone a few hours is not out of bounds or super-needy.
Sometimes the flu makes you so weak you need someone to monitor how you are doing and bring you fluids or food.

"FFS, she didn't get pregnant by herself. He has a right to his feelings, but he doesn't have a right to blame her and disclaim responsibility for a situation that was 50% caused by him."
"I think you nailed it here. This wasn’t the same as both the guys approaching Ann and OP, he flirted with OP just to get his friend an in with Ann. It’s ridiculous that people are saying that OP thinks the guy owes her a relationship. This guy straight up used her, &amp; it was a shitty thing to do. I wouldn’t want to date someone that teamed up with his buddy who played games with my friend in order to get to me. "
"I do not know what kind of support you have, or how you will manage. As Germany is not your home country I guess you have no financial support from them, or do you have the same rights because of EU?

There are organizations that might help you, but you need to decide soon, as the abortion time in Germany is 12 weeks I think. "
"Even if it is presumptuous about your new interest and it doesn't work out, you made the right move. It's almost impossible that your friendship with Lisa is 100% platonic. "
It might be shitty to her but she can deal because it's probably what's best for you.
"I think so far it sounds workable, as what he's said is insensitive, but not controlling or actively malicious.

I know a couple of married couples where one is a saver and one is a spender. So far, they handle it well because they have separate finances. One couple does have a joint retirement account that they both contribute the same amount to, and have both agreed that that money is hands off. The other couple doesn't have anything like that, and I've wondered how that's going to be in 20-30 years, as it looks like one is going to retire very cushy, and the other may *never* be able to retire, because he doesn't save *at all*.

But not my circus, not my monkeys. 

Anyways, if OP's husband starts actively *telling* the OP what he's going to do with the money (making it clear he's going to do whatever he wants, no matter how she feels) or gets passive aggressive/shitty/abusive about it, then I'd be worried, if I was the OP.

"Yes, he might be more open to that than therapy (though therapy would be great as well)."
"Yeah. It’s sweet (and heartbreaking) when your 3 yr old says “Don’t go mommy! I’ll miss you”. But ya know what? They eventually grow out of it and don’t have a major meltdown every time you leave. 30 years old and still doing that shit?? She is grossly immature and manipulative. If she hasn’t grown and matured in the years you’ve known her, that should tell you something. "
"Read her comments. He is completely neglecting parenthood, he doesn't even hold them."

"I’ve read some of your responses and you seem unclear on what you exactly want to try to spice up your marriage.  “Newness” and that type of excitement naturally fades over time, and seems normal.  I’m not surprised that your wife isn’t able to satisfy you because after reading your post it’s not clear what it would take.  I would suggest communication, but before you communicate you need to know exactly what’s going to make you happy with your marriage and have ideas/solutions to bring to the table for her. "
"In certain areas of study, professors are much more relaxed about being on a first-name basis with their students. I’m an art major and literally every single one of my art professors asks us to use their first names. I also don’t think it’s unusual for a professor to be on a first-name basis with his/her TA. Sounds like this guy is being a consummate professional."
"Let me get this straight, you were married and decided that rather than split up, you’d have an affair with the shiny new woman who ‘got you’. Then you realise that (mental health issues aside) she’s treating you like crap and dangling you on a string that you seem to happily bounce up and down on the end of whenever she feels like talking to you. 

To add to this, you tell your poor betrayed wife everything that’s going wrong while expecting her to emotionally support you. That about right?

God your wife must be loving the karma in action she’s seeing. 

You though, are one of the most contemptible posters I’ve ever seen in this subreddit. You treat your wife horrifically and say she never got you the way this woman did and yet you feel victim enough to go and beg her to hold your hand while you cry about how sad things are for you. 

The only advice I can give you is to leave them both the hell alone and get more intensive therapy. You are not a victim of circumstance, your wife is not the bad guy and you can’t hide from your own inadequacies forever, especially not in the arms of another woman. 
"
"I don't see it this way. I've always been overweight but I haven't been bullied. I was a happy, confident fatty if such a thing exists. I lost the weight because I wanted to be healthy as I know obesity fucks everything up and I have family with diabetes. I didn't lose the weight because I hated myself or how I looked. I was fine with that. I'm not ugly by any means even as an overweight woman. 


I just lost confidence in myself when I gained the weight I lost. It really bothered me. I had so much more energy and that's why I'm going to lose the weight again. I want to be healthy.

The people who are cruel and bully others aren't worth my or anyone's time. Being fat is fixable. Being an asshole is a different story..."
I don't really thinks its race baiting a little culturally insensitive but if this is his best example of race baiting he needs to let it go. Lightly call out the insensitive pieces but getting this worked up over examples like this isn't really productive.
"Okay, so he didn't just turn into a jerk. He has always been a jerk it seems.  OP, if you are serious about trying to preserve this marriage it is time for counseling. It doesn't matter if you gained weight or are not put together enough. Because how he said it is way more shocking than what he meant to say here. He was cruel and that is just no way to live."
You nailed it. I hope she leaves this man. 
"Certainly hitting the person who groped her is *not* a big deal, in my opinion, that's just basically self-defense. The kicking and dumping water? questionable, perhaps. She does seem to be on the side of the angels, though."
"For you it is. Different people have different boundaries, that’s the point I’m trying to make. "
"Right. I'm on the sceptic side as well, it's probably placebo, which is a recorded thing. If you can make people feel better due to misplaced belief while they are ill it's not a bad thing either.

It is a bad thing to be out 10k for people to shoot bodyheat off themselves though. Clearly she's well into the 'exploit' part of the practice though and that is going to make it harder. 

Regardless, his GF probably found a lot of comfort and joy in getting involved in the community, so OP's only going to lose while he tries to convince her this good feeling thing is bad. 

At the end of the day though it's what you can take in your partner. My wife's sister does reiki and I think it is total bullshit and dumb, but it makes her happy and she isn't pushy about it, and, it's only my in law.  She can be who she wants to be and I'm all for her being happy.

But if it was my wife, well, I'd be like OP. It's hard to look at someone and feel love and respect when they are basically telling you the earth is flat. "

"“Oppressed” 

Holy fuck."
But he told her he would call her back when he was done--how was she to know when that was? Making time for your partner and choosing to support them is also part of being an adult. She shouldn't have to keep begging for his attention. 
"dm me her username, i want those deals. 

also, in response to numerous comments saying she should dump ig and just start a website... this is terrible advice. ig marketing is a fundamental part of digital marketing in general. its basically another in road to driving people to your site. so make a site but keep IG too.

advice for op's girlfriend: make a wix site. post your deals in blog format. link to it from your ig. integrate your ig feed to your website as well. use seo and sem to push your site up in google results (google garage has a free course teaching you how). once you get steady traffic coming to your site, you can use google ads to make a little bit of revenue. eventually, you can partner up with travel companies or hotels/museums/parks to promote their business and keep a portion of their sales. if you're smart, calculated, and realistic about all of this you can have a legitimate side gig on your hands."
"Ask her why her need to have you at the gym with her is more important for your need to have a lazy Sunday. Make it clear to your gf that you value your lazy Sundays and you aren't going to change your behavior here. If that's a dealbreaker for her, then she can always move on from the relationship. If it isn't, then she needs to accept that you won't go to the gym with her on Sunday mornings and shut up about it. "
"Don't beat yourself up- you did the best that you could in the moment.  Would it be helpful to figure out some generic response you can use against a variety of nasty comments, so you don't have to 'think' during a confrontation?

""I am an adult and will decide how I live my life."" ""I expect you to respect my boyfriend and my relationship.  If you don't, you will not be a part of my life."" etc.

Don't waste your breathe telling your grandma she's wrong, just draw your boundaries (treat and speak of my bf with respect) and consequences if they are breached (you will not be a part of my or my son's life).   They'll either be in your life and act like decent human beings, or they won't be, because they act horribly.  Good luck!"
"You are a huge reason he’s fat, by the way. The entire point of research is that its done by professionals, who are experts in their field, who have spent decades becoming literate in *science* and minute details that take longer than a single google search. 

With your logic, you can literally form any opinion by “doing your own research”, because of confirmation bias.

Example: I like to drink alcohol. I see one peer-reviewed academic study showing that alcohol is poison and bad for your body. I also see one loud Facebook “article” saying “drinking every day is good for you”. Which one am I more likely to believe?

Do you ignore everything professionals say? Do you believe your doctor or insist that the blood pressure machines have some sort of ulterior motive? You people drive me up the fucking wall."
"My wife and I joke like this alot. I get it. I don't think it comes across that way like many of these people do in this thread. However, my wife and I are both on the same wavelength with that stupid humor and know where the line is drawn. Your boyfriend clearly doesn't have that sorta humor and you gotta just apologize and say you just were being stupid making a bad joke and let him stew a bit. You'll be fine."
"""condom idolatry peer pressure"" wtf? 

Literally only ONE thing matters here--she said no and he ignored it."
The amount of control you all insist on maintaining leads me to think your normal meter is off and you’ve been raised by narcissists who simply can’t handle not being able to manipulate SOs...this is one of the oddest situations on the sub for sure. 
"You clearly do not run a business, especially one busy enough to justify half a dozen people on payroll in addition to two owners. That is insanely impractical. Having joint decision makers on opposite schedules means your business has no decision makers. Either one of them needs to be the designated shot caller, or baby needs a full time daycare/nanny situation, or one of them needs to be home full time. I don't care which, though the fact OP has been home for **seven months** without insisting on coming back or hiring a nanny means that she is clearly more okay with staying home than she is letting on. 



Being 50/50 business owners and 50/50 co-parents works in a progressive daydream but is kneecapping the hell out of the business in every practical sense. "
"Lol... you say the time to be nice has passed, and then your post is just more of that nice and friendly garbage. It’s not going to stop until you get mean. "

Because she gets to have it both ways: constant sexual attention *and* the ability to say she is blameless.
"I am not sure the OP is a reliable reporter of the situation, though.  In general, family members help out with wedding stuff.  That's a pretty standard thing that people do, especially for low-key family weddings.  They might be the only ones helping during the reception, but I wonder if other family members are doing other stuff to help before or during the wedding.  

The OP clearly dislikes her wife's mother and it's hard to separate out what is an actual snub from what the OP is interpreting as a snub."
"&gt;  ""teens"" and ""petite"" and ""small boobs""

Some guys like smaller women just like some women like taller guys. Generally, searching ""teens"" yields more petite women with smaller busts. "
"Then she flat out lied to her boyfriend. From here it's about what your goals are. If you want to keep the friendship with her, go along with what she said and deal with the awkwardness. 

If you want to go the truth route, her boyfriend seems at least a little reasonable (didn't forbid her from seeing you). You can talk to him and say, ""What she said wasn't completely true. We were both blackout drunk and don't remember making out. She was afraid to lose this relationship with you because she really likes you. I'm sorry I contributed to this happening but it's not going to happen again."" 

EDIT: However, if you actually have feelings for her in a romantic capacity and you're denying it, that's a whole other can of worms. "

You and your wife are amazing. Thanks for sharing how you two have made it work.
"&gt;and fought over what she perceived to be ""frugal"" not cheap.

I recently saw a write-up about the difference in cheap vs. frugal, and the bottom line is that cheap is when one is treating others with inconsideration to pick up their slack, inconveniencing others, and not giving a shit because the person seems to come out ahead. I think your gf ticks all the boxes...try to google it, it's a good little read, had columns to list examples of what would be cheap and what would be considered frugal, very easy to read. 

Frugal is when you are saving money and/or resources, but it's not affecting anybody else. 

Listen, my brother-in-law is like your gf, and I am filled with resentment towards him. I have no respect left for him. It's the only thing my husband and I argue about; husband has finally (on the last trip) booked them a hotel room, but of course using our hotel points, so BIL and his wife still didn't have to pay for anything.  They took a tour of the city (we live in a tourist city) while we were working and complained that the tour wasn't good enough, because they choose the cheaper option...they were actually huffy about the fact that we weren't there to buy the more expensive tour for them, which they would have taken without a second thought. And no, we aren't well-off. 

Fifteen years of this shit from them, and they've never so much as bought a cup of coffee for us. 

It has strained my marriage. 

I don't know if there is any fixing her or if you need a better partner, but this will, I predict, affect other relationships in your life, so I just want you to be well aware of that. 

If she can't afford these trips, then she can't afford them, end of story. Life doesn't owe you anything; she needs to do what she can within her own budget. If that means going to the local lake for a long weekend instead of going to Scotland, then that's what it means.

 Ugh. Now I have to get the idea of my BIL out of my head lol. "
"&gt;If he prescribes Birth Control, do not tell you mom. 

Or find some way, **any** way, to refer to it other than birth control. Just call it ""my prescription"" or something. Honestly I wish it wasn't called birth control, if it wasn't always referred to as birth control or contraceptives it would really help break the idea people have that it is only for preventing babies."
"&gt;if she is 160 and of average height she is unlikely to be ""fat"". It's just not something you are into. It's okay if you are not attracted to her body type if you are not criticizing her for it. Dieting does not work. Restricting your food for weeks almost always leads to binging and gaining additional weight from where you started. I want to make clear that dieting differs from making good food choices and exercising. 

None of that is true. If she is average height, she is over weight.

Too lose weight is a life style change, its very possible to lose weight and keep it off, but most people just go back to their crappy habits..."
I feel like the main issue would be him exchanging nudes with other women. I would consider that cheating in my relationship.
"So you aren't vulnerable about anything? You have no fears or goals? No regrets or embarrassing things that have happened to you? Your gf wants intimacy and to get to know you better. The way you build intimacy with someone is by being vulnerable to them. Maybe you don't have that many feelings, but if your gf wants to be with someone more in touch with their emotions, then maybe you just can't meet her needs and you should find someone who doesn't need as much emotional connection. But this girl will leave you if you can't learn to be more in touch with your emotions."
"Yeah, having a house buddy is great when you are in school.  Someone to help cook and clean and pay the bills -- especially when you are busy with tests and classes and money's all a bit tight.  And because you are in school -- a sort of extended youth -- there's a reason to not take things too seriously if you don't want to.  ""Hey, I'm still a student!  Save that commitment stuff for when it's adult time!""  Well, adult time is a-coming and he's losing that protective barrier.  So, instead of fishing, he's cutting bait.  OP, as faerystrangeme says, move onto to someone who wants you in all of your adulting, decisive, clear-minded glory."
"Some people have it worse. And by worse I mean friends who stick around and enable drug addiction.  You're lucky in the sense that your friends have enough principles to shut down that shit and call you out on it. What you're dealing with is true consequences of your actions, and hey, not many people deal with immediate consequences. Some of those people might be dead as we speak. So take this as a lesson and work on yourself before you can even expect forgiveness from others."
"Truly, be thankful that somehow you escaped their small minded views. 

Maybe work on a broken record response for when this inevitably happens again. Short and sweet and not terribly instigating. Something like, “please don’t use that language in front of me” and when your family responds with the inevitable “why?” “It’s not racist.” “Black people use the word, why can’t we?” You’re ready with your broken record response, “please don’t use that language in front of me”. Say it over and over, don’t get pulled into arguing on their logic because it’s illogical and you’ll never win (“it doesn’t refer to black people”...wtf)

This internet stranger is proud of you for standing up to your family!

"Eh, I think she might need her own therapist. Your therapist has your side of the story and all your biases. Your wife deserves a fresh slate if she's really going to tackle these issues."
"I sympathize.  I don't like changing diapers, much, either.  But an adult knows that any project involves work that you don't ""like"" to do.  And babies take more than most.

I know you're exhausted, but don't let him off the hook.

Look at it this way, you're doing 50+ work hours plus commute hours plus parenting hours every week, not including the weekends.  He's contributing, what, maybe 40 parenting hours per week?

So, for things to be fair, he needs to go out on the weekend, and get a 10 hour/day job -- *then* you can do the parenting on the weekends.

Do a quickie spreadsheet of the hours, and you can clearly see that you're carrying the entire family on your back.  It's going to break you (before you even consider putting another child in the mix).  

It sounds like your husband is about to kill the golden goose.  He's just going to keep asking for luxury until there's nothing left of your marriage or of your family life.

He's comparting his life as a stay-at-home dad to the life of a single guy with a full-time job.  That's not the deal.  You didn't sign up for you to have a over-full-time job and a part-time at home life, and for him to have a full-time at home life and the rest of the time off.  He's not a *nanny* FFS!

That’s not fair. A babysitter would do more than her husband does. 
160lbs is overweight for many women. 
"I think that's exactly what it is. Last year my boyfriend and I were supposed to see a movie but I had an anxiety attack so we just spent the two hours talking instead and my mom is still convinced we are lying and were actually doing ""inappropriate things"" (for some reason she is afraid of straight up saying the word sex in front of me) "
"Listen to this, OP. I have an ex who thought either he was super smart or I was very stupid, cause he didn't even bother to hide his rampant infidelity. I caught him on Facebook so many times trying to cheat, calling his emotional affair partner ""babe"" and ""sweetheart"" in public comments, and joining dating &amp; hookup groups right out in the open. Cheaters can be incredibly bold."
"Him not being upfront about the cheating during the break up or the reconciliation would bother me. Lying by omission for three years is a violation of trust. 

If this is a deal breaker is up to you to decide, but I would question him why he wasn't honest about it."
"Yeah, even if she doesn't want a traditional job she may be able to parlay one of her new hobbies into a business or revenue stream. It might not be possible to get a non-traditional or flexible job which pays the bills now but many people (including those with mental health issues) work a day job while they're getting their ducks in a row for the job they actually want to do. She needs to figure out what that is, what it requires — going back to school, getting training, finding an entry-level position in that field, whatever — and start working towards it. Having severe mental health issues fucking sucks and it can be disabling. I've had to take time out before because of my mental health. But checking out altogether isn't viable, long-term."
"My daughter just got her license,  just gives me peace of mind if there is an incident or accident she would be able to get in touch with someone without being at the mercy of someone else or god forbid remember a phone number.  "
"It’s gonna take them a minute to settle on some healthy coping mechanisms — they’re still relatively early in her illness. Like they said, their mother is going to forget all her kids, and maybe then siblings will appreciate how cruel they’re being. This is their shitty way of coping with that knowledge.

So yeah, it’s certainly not kind or healthy, but it’s one of those situations where it’s hard to hold people 100% accountable for the hurt they cause."
"Yeah that makes sense - some of the things he says are similar between the 2 of us, are things that he at times finds annoying about me - but he speaks about them in her very fondly. "
"He *is* in love.  It isn't ridiculous, it's real.  You have to treat it as something serious,  not something to be mocked.  

Just because you've been together for ages doesn't mean he can't have fallen in love with someone else.  You have to  and make it clear that that you consider his investment in her it a serious threat."
"Every time you think a thought, you build stronger pathways for it in your brain.... This is why many people who come out of deep depressions continue having automatic thoughts of suicide for a long while after, even though they don't actually wanna die anymore - it became their go-to automatic self soothe when they were in pain, and it happened so often and became so engrained in them that even though they see things from a different perspective now it's still the first thing their brain jumps to when a problem comes up. It helped me feel better before, why not now? 

Avoiding other kids as a child and not allowing yourself to trust your classmates helped you avoid conflict, avoid pain... So it became an engrained coping method. Now that same anxiety that used to be so beneficial is causing you the pain instead of alleviating it. Those old coping methods are holding you hostage.

These repetitive, learned thoughts can affect people negatively in the future if they don't learn to question them. Accepting negative automatic thoughts puts people at a higher risk of failure, relapse, when something new or scary or hurtful happens. People who accept thoughts like that and don't fight to change them are at a higher risk of regressing back into sadness. We need to learn new ways to cope with pain that help us now, in our new situation.

The goal is to catch these incorrect, negative thoughts and feelings as they come and replace them with something else.

In the beginning of change, the bad beliefs come and we accept them as truth. 'This sucks, but it's okay. I could just kill myself.'

Eventually, we start to catch those thoughts as they come and we learn how to reroute them with something else we believe instead. 'Yeah, I could do that, but not yet. I want to try fixing this first.'

Then, the automatic thought in it's entirety becomes 'This sucks, but it's okay. I could just kill myself. Well... Okay, I could do that, but not yet. I want to try fixing this first.'

If we keep this up we eventually start to believe we really can fix things, because now we're really working hard to take control.

Some day, with time and patience and repetition, the automatic thought becomes 'It's okay. I can just kill myself... Wait, what? Haha, that was dumb. Of course I'm not gonna do that when I could just find a solution.'

This continues until one day you wake up and you realize that you haven't thought of suicide at all in almost a year... How did you not notice that sooner?

Yeah, it does take a lot of hard work and effort and patience to truly rewire your neuronal pathways... but that kind of happiness is worth it. It was for me, anyway. If I'd given up, I'd still be agoraphobic, still have panic disorder, and still be trapped in a tiny, sad world...

I prefer this new one. You can do this OP!"
"Yeah I have never heard anyone say before that you have to keep having sex to make it stop hurting, that doesn't make any sense at all. "
"He gets a power trip of off it. 

Its not about helping the two of you have a good day;  it's about flexing the power to ruin your day, to *control* your emotions."
"Unfortunately it doesn't sound like OP has made that connection yet. It's the difference between, 'I have made a mistake. I can see how my past experiences have led to this' and 'I did this because last time etc etc'. I hope one day she can make that jump."
"Yeah, whenever we have people in like plumbers/cable guys/etc who won't have time to properly greet and cuddle, the dogs aren't even part of the equation. They go in the bedroom behind a closed door until the work is done."
That's not just possibly true. It is true. He's a douche.
"""Don't you wish you had had children earlier so they would be gone faster?""

I want to disagree but the amount of borderline fucked up comments I've heard from 50+ year olds makes me agree with you. 
"
&gt; The truth is though, I had settled

...

&gt;I was adamant that I loved him and went over all the reasons why

Although he's been cheating and lying for months, right now, he is telling the truth and you're the one lying to him (who cares!) and to yourself.

The way you described him (good job, has good family, fix things, good father, isn't a jerk...) has had nothing do to with love."
"I agree, my daughter's have friends and sleepovers and I'm about the mothers age I could never imagine involving myself in my daughter's social life like that. She has to learn to grow and make memories on her own. 

It's probably just me but I think her behaviour is abit weird to be honest."
"Yup. We don’t drive in the country where we live, but my husband’s uncle jokes about the times he’s had to suddenly pull over so my husband could get out and vomit. Husband hates cars and has terrible motion sickness. Nothing whatsoever to be ashamed of. "
Hey let's not judge people who choose to remain celibate until marriage just because they haven't had sex yet. I have a feeling most girlfriends would be very concerned if they found a box of condoms in their boyfriend's car and they know they haven't used those condoms with them. It doesn't matter whether or not they had sex before.
"I was addicted to benzos for 3 years. Ended up in the hospital 4 times after mixing with alcohol and overdosing. Spent about 2 years blacked out, drunk, or in a daze. Scared a lot of people, hurt a lot of people, lost a lot of trust. Lost myself.

Been sober 6 months after being sober 8 and relapsing for a month. I don't do AA or NA anymore, not my thing, but it's extremely important to surround yourself with sober people. I voluntarily live in an Oxford house because it gives me the accountability I need right now and an amazingly supportive environment. While relapsing, I ruined everything I'd gotten back and I realized how hard it is to rebuild and how easy it is to destroy. Oxford is helping me get my life and my self back.

You might look into some kind of sober living environment. For now, work on yourself. Give your friends some time. Hang out with sober people. Try some different types of meetings. Practice meditation. Focus on personal growth. They may come back to you when they see how hard you're trying... Or they may not. Unfortunately that is up to them, and you can't control that. But you can control what you do next. Eventually, when you are strong enough, try to make amends - but don't force it now. Actions speak louder than words.

I know this is painful for you but maybe it's a lesson you needed to learn. I put myself and others through a lot of dumb shit before I finally grew up... Actions have consequences, and that's a very good thing because it helps give us the motivation we need to be better."
End this relationship. He's abusive and horrible. 
"OK, but moms never call it ""babysitting"" their own kids. Only dads."
"I agree with most of your points, and appreciate them. The only one that is wrong (and in the grand scheme of things doesn't matter): the gift from his father was a symbolic amount from a shared pastime they have. My fiance is pretty tight-lipped about financial issues we have, so I feel confident the check was simply a ""good job getting a doctorate son, we're proud, have fun"".

I'd like to do the freelancing work. It however affects my SSI amount, therefore affecting my state insurance. I'm not even legally allowed to own a car or a laptop, since those are funds that could quickly be liquidated.

I have 0 desire to shoot down legitimate suggstions, I came for help and I am getting it. This is just not a feasible solution, though I greatly appreciate that being brought up."
"&gt; I dont want to break up I just want him to change

That's not how life works.  It sucks, but that's reality."
"Wow I’m sorry OP.  You’re seeing a side of your GF that isn’t pretty. 


You have two serious things to think about:



- if you married her and had kids, would she play favorites or bully one of them?  My thought would be yes


- secondly, she’s trying to “fit in” and be liked by the popular kids.  And many bullied kids have said that their teachers didn’t help them because they wanted to be liked as well. That’s sad.  Your GF should be a positive role model and prevent bullying.   I don’t know the politics at te school, but if you were te parent of Allen, I would tell you to report this to the principal and superintendent, requesting a) your GF be investigated b) school strengthen its anti bully processes and c) your GF issues a personal apology to Allen and his parents privately AND she issues a one to the students 

- thirdly, the act of cutting hair is physical and would be taken more seriously than just verbal
Harassment.  


- fourth, the popular kids could punish Allen if your GF is punished (or they are).  Talk to the school about how to protect him"
"I don’t think you effed up at all. Seems like a normal reaction to a breakup. Some people cry, some people don’t. Now that this is over, you just walk. Net another guy and maybe you will get messaged some time in the future. This is how it always works.... when he pings you back you walk all over him."
"&gt; the stable secure thing we had ... we fought quite often ...  She wanted to break up a few times 

What part of the relationship was a ""stable, secure thing""? A stable, secure relationship is not one where you're fighting often, always teetering on potential break up, and generally doesn't involve infidelity.

Just that it's your first girlfriend is definitely not a reason to try keeping a damage relationship together. Move on and learn from your experience."
She's gonna end up fired. 
"Well, I'd be furious if someone destroyed 6 months of hard work. I'm amazed you are patient enough to type this out.

This isn't a sign of healthy behavior, and I'd be careful, if I were you. "
"2 weeks is very specific, she’s basically asking for permission to go have sex with her ex."
"I didn't realize you were receiving SSI. Makes perfect sense but I don't think it's mentioned in the post. I empathize, I have friends on SSI who are in much the same situation. The system is so fucked.

That's tough, if you feel like you have to contribute materially but you can't. Do you feel like you need to contribute in general or to your household specifically? What I mean is, would volunteering for a cause your fiance supports feel like a contribution?"
Because her options are 1) breakup with her boyfriend that she presumably loves 2) accept that he will keep cheating on her since he’s proved unwilling to be in a monogamous relationship with her or 3) enter into an honest open relationship that has the potential to be fulfilling for both parties. 
"You might be right. If only the internet wasn't around and there aren't a million ways to be passive aggressive nowadays, I'd agree. But for example, she texted our group chat about how great the dinner was last night thanks for coming! But it's just ridiculous because they obviously arranged the dinner in a separate group chat, or she approached the others individually. Why gloat about it where I can see? I really don't get it. Could she be that oblivious?"
"That's a bit harsh. A relationship is a partnership, there should never be a situation where one person goes it alone because of a mistake. Open relationships can be incredibly tough and it isn't always a matter of jealousy because she could do it and I couldn't but more of, man I don't know if this is the reality I expected. Either side can very easily become self-conscious and lose their confidence. Open relationships take a dedicated partnership that talks through each event, each misstep and each success. Giving advice that either person should handle the way you suggest is an awful example of how not to do this. Aftercare, whether it's in a open relationship or something more complex like s/D roles, is key to maintaining trust and respect for each other.

OP, be there for your SO. He wanted a two way street for this relationship which shows he wasn't just in it for himself, but the reality of all of it probably hit him harder than he expected. Remind him that he is your number one and maybe you two can go out together as each other's wingmen."

"This post is awful.

&gt;If she goes, despite your obvious reservations, then whether or not she cheats isn't even relevant, the point is that by going she's shown you exactly how important you are to her and how much she cares about your feelings.

Let me paraphrase: ""If I matter to you, you won't go."" What a manipulative load of bull. OP, don't listen to this person. If you did, I'd be the first one telling her to not waste anymore time with *you*."
Brides and grooms very often are not the ones planning their bachelor(ette) parties. It's not really suspicious that he was the one to deliver the invite.
"Sounds like you're doing great and don't need to change a thing. He's letting you pay for small stuff...and on $20k a year you can't afford much more. Normally I'd say you make 20% of what he does, so you should take on about 20% of the expenses.... but at $20k salary you really don't have any discretionary income.

It sounds like he enjoys buying you things that make you happy. And it sounds like you're showing your gratitude and doing your part.

However, if its making you feel anxious...something my girlfriend and I did that helped when Im in tight spots is set maximum spend amounts on gifts ... so neither of us feels like we're inadequate. "
"Clinical neuropsychologist in training here-- I obviously can't provide a diagnosis, but his symptoms are definitely a cause for concern and this should be addressed with a medical professional ASAP.

I noticed that you mentioned in a comment that he still does well in his classes and memorizes things for tests; this doesn't mitigate my concern. The type of memory one uses to memorize facts (semantic memory) uses separate brain processes from the type of memory one uses to remember recent events (episodic memory), such as conversations and things that happened to you throughout the day. It sounds like your boyfriend is having a tough time with his episodic memory.

You mentioned being concerned about insurance/finances. If you wouldn't mind, could you tell me the city where you live? If you're near any major research universities/research hospitals, there may be neuroscience laboratories studying memory issues, and major clinical neuroscience studies often have neurologists evaluate the subjects. He wouldn't have to pay to be in a research study, and depending on the nature of the study, he might even be compensated for his participation if he's eligible. ***no promises that I can find one that suits your needs***, but I will do my best to look into this for you if you're interested.

You don't have to answer (or you could PM me), but I have a few additional questions that might help my search for specialized laboratories: 
1) how long has this been going on?
2) has he ever had any form of brain damage (e.g. concussion, sports injury, vehicle accident, etc.)? 
3) does he have a history of excessive alcohol consumption? 

In the meantime, I understand why this is so frustrating for you, and I'm sorry you're having to go through this. You deserve to feel cared about and heard, but your boyfriend's memory issues are blocking him from giving you that reassurance. Until he officially sees a doctor, I hope that you can try your best to be patient with him, because this is likely a medical issue.

Also, please tell him to get some sleep! Sleep deprivation and memory issues often go hand-in-hand. I'm not suggesting that sleep deprivation is the cause of his problems, but sleeping too little will only make things worse.

Honestly, the way you've described it, no. Yeah, things may be cleaner but do you actually feel comfortable living in your own home?

I could not respect someone who believed in bullshit hippie witchcraft. 
"\&gt; I however, refused to believe the issue lay with me and shut\-down any suggestions of getting tested; this mostly stemmed from insecurities about my masculinity being questioned.

\&gt; but I was met with only stone cold silence. Once we got home, she finally spoke and told me that she will be sleeping in the guest room for the next couple of days.

I feel like this is probably a perfect description of the communication in your marriage. You stubbornly refused to take a simple test that had massive implications in your future together, all because your precious masculinity would be hurt. Then, when the results come in, she immediately uses that mistake against you to shut you off emotionally in an extremely trying time.

Then to top it off, this whole Skeeter nonsense is a pretty simple fix. If she goes through with it, you divorce her. It'll probably end in divorce anyway, but that will just make it jump up a year or two. "
"She started dating him as a teenager. That’s a red flag for a history of abuse. I doubt it’s money, although certainly there is a power dynamic aspect, and money will be a part of that."
"Well said. I can understand OP and her brother electing not to pursue a relationship with this man. It was their choice as adults, and they made the decision that seemed best to them at the time. However, turning around and reaching out to him now, solely because OP's brother suddenly has something he desperately needs from him? That is utterly repugnant.  "

"Giving him the choice is tantamount to making him feel guilty if he doesn't want to help the family who's disowned him.

I get what you're saying, but that's putting him in an awfully shitty situation after being told to get lost. 

If you go to a person asking him for a favor after you've rejected him and told him he isn't welcome in your family, and a person's life hinges on his doing that favor, that's not much of a choice. I can understand why she'd do it anyway, but can we all step back enough to realize how potentially awful that could be for him? He showed up on their doorstep crying for god's sake. I hope he has moved on and made peace. Maybe it's a fragile peace that would be turned upside down by this request."

"For whatever reason they prefer the group dynamic when you aren't around. Maybe when you drink you're less tolerable to be around. Maybe they have a common interest that they like to talk about but feel that they have to avoid discussing because it excludes you. Maybe they are all part of a fight club and they don't think you're tough enough.

"She's both. It's not even that she wants to ask to stay at someone's home, it's that she keeps asking even when they say no and asking for ridiculous things. It's cheap, not frugal.

"Holy fuck. Fuck her. Thank God you are having your child first..... do you think she would go crazy and induce labor early to get that name?? J/K

I'm sorry you have to go through this. That woman is ruining your happy time. I have no doubt she is going to try and manipulate you into changing your name. Don't let her win. She needs to learn to buck up and be an adult

My mom found out she had an older sister a couple of years ago when she showed up asking for her part of her inheritance and they had the exact same name Wilhelmenia. One goes by Wilma and the other Helma. Man were they pissed. 

I think the key is, if SHE wants to go through with naming her kid after your grandmother and soon to be your daughter, nicknames are key.
"
Thank you. I've been trying hard to support her and I'm glad she's not the only one who appreciates it.
"I don't think it's slippery slope, but rather, an extension of his already-present feelings about his fiancee's sexuality. I don't think he's going to keep her from leaving the house. That's absurd, and I apologize if I was unclear in my meaning.

I agree that people's boundaries are different in different relationships. Hence, why there are even open relationships. They're not for everyone. And not everyone is secure enough to be married to a stripper. But it's important to acknowledge the reasons for these feelings, and not blame the person (in this case, OP's fiancee) for being ""selfish"". Not that you called her selfish, but many commenters in agreement with you called her that.

Every relationship has boundaries. Hence, why I keep pushing the ""open and honest"" communication thing. OP shouldn't try to control his fiancee's behavior, and she shouldn't completely disregard his feelings for her own benefit, either."
"Your 1 to 5 are all reasonable reasons to evict him. But there are a few things you still don't seem to be understanding when it comes to tenants. Yes it's your home, but as long as someone is renting a room in your house it's their home to and you need to respect that. In regards to the common spaces, yes its extremely common for people in a shared living arrangement use those, even for long periods at a time. It's not a common courtesy to avoid those spaces just because you own the house, again it's their home too. If you don't want tenants using those spaces, then you need to make that clear before they move in."
This comment is so scary and accurate. I hope OP can find peace in all of this cause it’s a gets worse before better scenario now :(
"Come on, she couldn't even go two months without sleeping with another guy. I think it's all well and good to forgive her, but I have no idea how you could ever trust her again."
"Lol wow, yeah, you were and are definitely in the wrong."
"Why are you so fixated on this narrative that OP showing preferential treatment when the real problem is that the mom is NOT keeping up her end of the bargain? OP doesn't have full custody, he pays a good amount of child support so that SHE can provide for him. If there are gaping differences in care, it is because of her neglect and the courts.

The older son is jealous over material goods, which is stuff she is suppose to be buying with the child support money. I don't know what love, guidance and opportunities have to do with anything here. OP fought a custody battle, tries to forge a relationship with his son, and obviously cares. "
"If she talked about what she likes in bed, tactfully and at an appropriate time, this might apply. But the timing and the way she explicitly compared OP to her past lovers ... I don't blame him for feeling insecure. Very odd."

If your sister hates you then you should tell your parents. That is inappropriate and the girlfriend should be ashamed
"Can you turn on your phone camera whenever you are alone with her? Even just for a minute. It doesn't have to hold up in court, just to your family. Depending on state laws maybe you're supposed to tell her she's being recorded - that alone may be enough to stop it."
"I'm not sure if many people saw before it was deleted but a few days ago there was a post from a troll who linked to his google spreadsheet where he had recorded literally hundreds of /r/relationships troll posts he had made.

"You're over-reacting and over-reaching.

Your brother has basically told you this relationship has an expiry date, so you'd be wise to get off his ass about it. He gets to make his own choices, and you're not actually doing shit to help him make good ones. You're just embracing the drama of this.

Don't ask him to dump her. Express your concerns (or skip that step, because it doesn't sounds like you've be hiding them) and ask him if he is happy with his living situation and ask him if there is anything you can do to help him with his lease issue. Tell him you don't want him to feel trapped. "

"Yikes. is it possible she was on any kind of drugs when she got back? did her FWB dump her? I'd probably reach out and say something like ""Hey, the other night was super weird, it's everything ok? ""

She might actually have a case for sexual harassment. There aren’t enough facts here to opine on that — we’re getting a one-sided third-party view. And what his manager says now vs what HR decides may be very different.


You mentioned ”demands” a couple times but haven’t said what she wants.


From where I sit, it sounds like your boyfriend fucked her and then dumped her when he got caught. You are standing by your man - fine, whatever. You need to get tested for STIs and use condoms for at least six months (or, if you stay with him, forever).


Boyfriend probably needs to look for another job, and possibly run all of this past an employment attorney.

"&gt;This is my first relationship.

This is why you're letting a lot of strange things slide in the name of love.

&gt;She also dislikes me working with female coworkers.

This is, as your gut feeling is probably telling you, ridiculous. Women are in the work place. To suggest you only work with men is not only nearly impossible, but a clear violation of the trust in each other. She simply doesn't trust that you can be around women because...what? That you'll cheat? That the women will rape you? Either way, her insecurities are the real issue here.

&gt;She was also abandoned by her parents when she was younger and raised by other family/friends.

This helps explain the abandonment issues shes dealing with. She can't cope with you leaving. She probably feels like its like she being abandoned again...which explains her aggressive behavior when it even slightly seems like shes being abandoned. Its a reaction to her childhood, probably.

&gt;I find it odd she seems so focused on the time I spend with female coworkers in the workplace. Is this normal? I barely talk to anybody and nobody in my department socialises outside of work. I've tried telling her the positives of me working, like being able to get a place together, start a family, etc. She says it doesn't help though and makes her feel worse.

I dont know if its normal, but it is common in both directions. There are plenty of dudes asking their SOs not to work with other dudes. In either direction, its stupid. 

If you trust your SO, you trust your SO. Thats it. Its not like you work at a porn casting couch agency. 

&gt;When she gets angry I find it hard to comfort her but she says I need to be persistent until she feels better.

How long do you think you can keep this up? To put the burden on you is, taxing. Its not really sustainable I dont think. 

Having said all that. She's had some issues in life that she needs to sort through. Right now shes taking it out on you even though I think you're doing all the right things. Her situation with her parents is very important. Its something she'll need to work through and understand. Maybe you can help her get some therapy? If you leave this as is and hope for the best, I doubt anything will change. I think you need to have an honest conversation with her, because either way, its going to affect the relationship eventually. 

26 is a weird age for a lot of people. Its like we are supposed to be adults, but we haven't quite figured it out yet (yes I am speaking for myself for when I was 26). I distinctly remember feeling like an adult, but I know I wasn't that mature. It took me a few years to really get myself and my shit together. At about 30 is when it felt real. Sometimes, it takes time. Some of us are late bloomers.

I think the key is to understand why she's feeling the way she is, and then figuring out a way to make some improvements to the relationship.

It is not ideal to say the least...
"Hi! I'm not autistic, but I'm trans and a person with chronic genital pain. As you might imagine, I am *really* choosy about where and how I want to be touched. I won't lie, it does screen out a bunch of people who might not be outright sexually violent, but who are not particularly attentive, concientious, or open to doing things differently. There still are plenty of people left! What helped me was to give direct, unambiguous instructions, like literally pointing or bringing their hand to the appropriate zone to demonstrate where was the border between painful/non-painful places (of course you can do this in a ""sexy"" way, you don't have to be a drill sergeant)  and to people I was interested in having sex with again, a diagram with likes, dislikes, and total no-zones. Most people were suprised but positive, and some made diagrams back."
"Definitely narcissist. Their behavior will NOT make sense, and you will be left feeling super confused because you will be trying to put the pieces together to understand what happened. But you won't be able to. They thrive off of this confusion, and when you call them out on it (you'll feel like you are explaining why XYZ is wrong, as if you were telling a 5 yr old) they will swiftly make you feel like if YOU did something wrong. Cut ties NOW. These people are toxic. They have soul cancer. "
"/r/DeadBedrooms can be of some help here. 1-2 times a week with an infant/full time work and for your age would be good for most people. He can't just lay the blame because he's dated ""wilder"" people in the past. "
"&gt;  I am 19 I earned my lisense and need a car to get to campus or I have to keep getting up at 9:30 to take the bus!

the horror"
"Even if he's just a normal alcoholic, they probably have files from picking him up doing something inappropriate while drunk before if he's as into that as he seems here.."
"My best guess here is that your husband feels guilty about not working.  When you are home and working in plain sight this guilt becomes worse.  So in response he feels worse to better ""justify"" his not working.  This is all probably happening on a subconscious level."
There isn't a sacred norm for this. It's pretty standard to share with your family in some places. What's wrong is that she's doing it when he asked her not to.
"Question as someone with two cats...one who could afford to lose a little weight and one who is the perfect weight (we adopted him a bit underweight and he gained a pound and looks great)

How?  They have separate bowls and I put probably 3/4 of a cup a day each. I want to make sure skinny boy stays healthy, but I'd also like my big guy to lose a bit as he's getting older and has never been active. The new cat has added some activity and I think he's maybe lost a pound or two, but a few more definitely wouldn't hurt him. Advice, if you have any on dieting one cat and not starving the other?"
He can't erase all the allergens and it sounds like he has already done a fair amount to accommodate you.  It would make more sense for you to take an antihistamine.
I think he was actually agreeing that OP should check. 
"Yup, the waifu mention definitely means she's into ""geeky language"". She sounds cool, go for it!"
"It's not about Jake Paul, your mom is depressed. "
"You shouldn't be mad at your friends for having fun. The party changed, and they went with it.  Honestly, it sounds like a great time.  Nice wine party for a while, then everyone lets loose.

Assuming you set strict boundaries with your husband, and were very clear this should not happen, you can be mad at him.  But your friends did nothing wrong, and this is all about you."
"I think that would come off as an insincere apology by trying to contextualize your apology, you know? It's usually better just to be straight forward with: I'm sorry I did X. Then let her ask probing questions if she wants more info. "
"I'm a little confused about your timeline, does this:

&gt;I’m taking off of work to do this

Mean you're skipping work in favor of playing hockey? So watch the kid earlier in the day then go play instead of work? Just how often are you playing vs spending time with your wife and/or your kid?"
"This is ... the most helpful thing I've read. I almost cried reading it. Thank you for explaining so well what I am going through. I hear my own experience so much in my comments. I love his family so much and that is a big part of it -- I know he would be an excellent partner to me, if only I could be a little more tolerant! 

Thank you. I think reading all of this has hammered home to me how much I do love him and don't want to leave. But we'll see how things turn out. Hopefully it all works out for the best (though knowing myself, I can't really imagine ever having NO doubts, haha). "
"Who actually owns the property?   Who is liable for the mortgage?  If he's the only one on the paperwork, it could be considered separate property in some states.

You need to get yourself educated about all of this."
"&gt; I didn't block my ex for the same reasons. I thought he may turn violent and wanted to know if the tone of the texts changed (they varied from ""I love you. We can make this work"" to ""You fucking c--t""). He sent them every 30 seconds for a week.
&gt; 
&gt; 

My ex called me every day at the same time like clockwork, basically when he left work in the car on the way home. It was a 50/50 coin toss between ""I love you, please give me another chance"" and ""you're a fucking whore, you've been cheating on me for months""."
"Maybe after WW2? Definitely not realistic for a young adult these days in America.  Moving out, yes; buying a house, rarely. "
"Rest assured no one burns letters in this day and age lol. Maybe they'd shred it, but who fucking burns letters anymore? 

He's totally bluffing about that. He read the letter, but he choses to lie and pretend he burned it so he doesn't have to address your honest feelings. Block his number or if he texts you, text back ""bye Felicia"" and then block him."
"What will he do? The divorce will effectively be *his* fault. He seems to have an alcohol problem, does he expect that he'll be able to fight for full custody? 

Divorces are hard, but the law is pretty cut and dry. You'll split your assets in half and one of you might have to pay spousal support/child support to the other (depending on your incomes) and that's a pretty fixed rate. "
"In that case you call 911. If your partner is threatening to kill themselves over you not giving them enough attention something is seriously messed up.

Speaking as someone who used to be depressed and have suicidal thoughts, I find it very hard to believe he's actually going to harm himself. I am more scared of him harming you if anything."
Going to counseling with an abuser is a terrible idea. 
"TBH she is probably mentally exhausted from being your emotional support person. She is young and she wants to have fun instead of being a caretaker.

Right now your thoughts are only about how she is affecting you and nothing about how your problems have affected her.

You should focus on your own mental health."
Yes. I'm posting this as someone who used to work for a child advocacy organization. It's credible.
"**DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN WITH THIS MAN**   

If you want to stay married and support him that's fine, and that's on you, but **DO NOT** introduce a child or children into this fiasco.   Adding a child would be cruel to the child, and there is **NO GUARANTEE** that your husband could actually pull off being a full time stay at home parent, in fact the responsibility would probably be too much for him to handle, no telling what happens then.  

The best thing you can do for yourself is to leave him.  His behavior is going to get worse as he gets older and has less and less life skills, the depression will accelerate. 

The gap on your resume is easy to explain, you were caring for your ex who needed help, and that's all that you need to say."
"I like that HER allowance was for GROCERIES and GAS. AKA - daily necessities that HE gets the benefit of, and she still had to bring him receipts... good lord.

OP, when/if you make a budget with a partner in the future, food, gas, utilities, etc, those go on their own budget lines, and those are necessities. ""Allowances"" are usually for things like, clothes, outings, fun things, non-necessities. Calling the money for food and gas your ""allowance"" is so so so wrong."
Plans change. Life changes. Tell him to grow up.
Option 5: I'm taking the kids and leaving.
"The more someone says “I don’t want to or we shouldn’t go to court about this”, the more important it is that you do. 

Don’t pay her a cent unless she’s actually willing to take you to court. And don’t worry about your record. Small claims is not a big deal, this shouldn’t affect you in the future at all. 

You offered to help months ago when this was relevant, she didn’t take you up on it. If she wants more now she can take you to court. "
"I wanted to defend him and say that he doesn’t mess up much. But the truth is, when he hurts me (only “mess up” I can think of), it doesn’t get resolved and he doesn’t apologize. So then I’m left with a laundry list of situations that I resent. 

But that’s the thing- it’s hard to mess up when you rarely do anything anyway. "
"She also has those text messages where he says ""sorry"""
"As someone who has worked very hard to get where I am, I can understand why your friend would have taken offense to your comment.

Saying she's ""lucky"" to take nice vacations can sound like she doesn't deserve to go on those vacations, or that she had little agency in creating that opportunity for herself. Sure, she had help getting where she is. She had some financial luck by way of help from her parents, and some genetic luck by way of having the sort of mind that makes being a rocket scientist even a possibility. But she also clearly worked hard to get where she is.

Getting a Ph.D in aerospace engineering is not easy. It might be less hard if you have parents helping your financially, or if you have a natural aptitude for math and science, but it's still not easy. It requires work and dedication and motivation. She had to work to get a job at a prominent company with a huge salary. She has to work hard every day to earn her keep at this company. And, regardless of how huge her salary is, she still has to budget and prioritize her spending to make that month in France financially viable. No matter how large the salary, it would be easy to fritter it away on expensive everyday luxuries. Not everyone could be where she is with hard work, but WITHOUT hard work she would not be where she is either.

It sounds like she heard your comment as minimizing how hard she works to have what she has, and when you went to great lengths to point out her privilege she likely saw you doubling down on the point that she doesn't really deserve the life she has.

It sounds like both of you were being too sensitive. While you clearly hit a sore spot for her and she overreacted at first, I think jumping into a large-scale lecture about privilege to your friend is very much overkill. The fact that you brought your husband into the example makes it sound like your assertions that her lifestyle should be attributed to luck are directly tied to a jealousy over that lifestyle. 

As for the jewelry thing, if you don't want to help, don't help. Personally I don't think what she said insults your profession...it is a fact that being a designer has a lower income potential than an aerospace engineer. While it was rude to point that out, I don't think it's so egregious that it justifies cutting her off from your ""professional designer advice"", that's a decision for you to make.

"His side is that he's a virgin and he found someone young enough to manipulate into fucking him. Just dump him already. Have sex, if you are going to, with someone your own age. Stick that rule for at least the next 10 years."
Embrace the awkward.  This is your son's safety.
"&gt;He told me if I don't approve, he'll just do it anyways.

I would let him know that by Friday I'm either calling a couple's counselor or a lawyer to book an appointment, but that unlike him I'm not going to make a unilateral, marriage destroying decision without any discussion so his input on the matter is welcome."
"I was created using a sperm donor.  That being said, your husband is absolutely wrong here.  First, you should absolutely have veto power in this decision. Second, if not done properly, he could wind up on the hook for child support for years to come.  Third, he doesn't know how he'll react to having his biological child being raised by people he knows and him having no say in the child's upbringing. 

It'd be a whole different ballgame if your husband was interested in being an anonymous paid donor for a sperm bank - that's how I came to be.  This scenario is just a nightmare in the making.  "
Sorry but she’s allowed to get drunk. If he actually believes he has to kidnap her to control her then she should run a mile.
"Unfortunately the truth isn't terribly convincing in these types of situations.  

""We didn't do anything"".  *yeah right*

Then some random person talks to the cops,  claims she was seducing you while you were a minor.  Etc etc.  

Can you get in trouble?  No.  Can she get in trouble?  Well, yes.  Even if they don't prosecute her, they can elect not to hire her again.  And her teaching career is ruined.  And lets say they arrest her and put her picture in the paper, but she's found innocent.  Again, that's the truth, and nobody will believe it."
"Switzerland, for all its riches and modern status, is essentially a very conservative country. Outside of the cities (and even there to a certain extent) people can be quite xenophobic and closed to anyone deemed a foreigner. It’s not an easy place to “become Swiss” in. After all, you can be a third generation resident (i.e. your parent was born in Switzerland as were you) and still not be a citizen. "
Your sister is wrong but you're just as bad. It seems you have a lot of anger towards women you should seek therapy. 
"You might direct her to the National Domestic Abuse Hotline website to read about intervening in a public domestic violence - they advise to be cautious about your own safety and their only recommendation for intervening personally is if you can gather a crowd to have safety in numbers.

That being said, if you witness a physical assault - particularly by a larger and stronger person against someone smaller - you really should call 911.  But your girlfriend's fingers would work as well as yours.  "
"In that case, you should hold in your emotions and be walked all over. /s"
I've been guilty of this too. Especially if there's a mirror in front or me or I'm in the back of the room. I just... zone and that occasionally can be perceived as staring. 
"This is YOUR HOUSE. And YOUR RULES. 

Do not set a precedent with your father by bending to his will when he visits. Honestly, I don’t even think you should address the fact that you’re sharing a room, if he brings it up, don’t argue with him. Say “Yes, bf and I decided to share a room. This is not up for discussion.” 

And sleep in your own bed. If he has a problem with it, he can leave. "
"I doubt your dad thinks you’re still a virgin if you and your bf shared a home, separate rooms or not. If he does, he’s delusional. You don’t owe him any explanation, you’re an adult and it’s your home. Your sex life  is none of your dad’s business. "
"Oh sweet Jesus. 

I wish I knew something to tell you to do. I guess I would ask what you’d like to accomplish? It sounds like many of these individuals are adults who are making their own poor choices. 

I have no idea how you can help Mary. I mean... gosh. 

I’m so sorry. I just wanted to give you a bit of support, if little advice. "
Completely true. At least I didn't have to witness it.
"Hello, weirdly enough time I have some experience in this.
What you need it a grief counseling because while you were not together  you are still grieving.
The next part, your current significant other will not die. I also have a hard time with this. Every flu bug and every little cold  it scares me but I just remind my self that he is not my ex and that things will be okay
Feel free to message me if you need anything at all"
That awkward moment when you realize there's somebody in the foreground and you've been blankly staring in their direction for 5min is hysterical.
"Yeah, this. Even if I was stuck driving a cheating bastard, I wouldn't leave him stranded in middle of the road. I'd make sure he gets home, or at least have a plan for someone else to pick him up in a not shady location if I really didn't want to be in the car with him. This is such a deal breaker, the lack of maturity is ridiculous. Especially as he is now mad that ""something happened"" with his more mature brother? lol. "

"She's done you a favor.  You've seen her true colors now, she's 44 and she acts like a toddler, my goodness.  This friendship is a wash and you'll be better off without the baggage of it. "
"I don't understand why she hasn't left already. If the sister is so bad, and everyone else is still supporting her then in my book they aren't really any better."
"&gt;I still try to be a good person but sometimes it feels like you can be a really, really terrible person too and it doesn't even matter.

I know it might feel this way sometimes, but it is so, so far from true. You tried to be a good person, even though your parents didn't give you the support you needed. I am in no way letting them off the hook. But the thing is, you succeeded! You *are* a good person! And the universe has rewarded you with financial independence, a wonderful fiance who you are going to marry soon, and the strength and wisdom to set boundaries with your imperfect family. What did all that extra attention do for your sister's life? How has the universe rewarded her for her behavior? "
"So, you're an adult now. Getting a new parent at this age isn't really an automatic thing like it is when you're young enough for them to step into a parental role. You're 21, you don't need parenting. When someone is 35 and their parent remarries, no one says they have a new step-parent. It's just their dad's wife. This is honestly meaningless. And let's be real here, this probably isn't going to be a forever relationship. Eventually it'll likely be an ex-wife situation."
"How long have you been dating? If it’s super new maybe a little weird. But if you’ve been dating for more than a couple months, then it is 100% normal for him to watch your dog. If he wasn’t a dog person or was uncomfortable being responsible, he is certainly not obligated to, but it’s actually really weird for you to NOT want to take him up on a nice offer based on some principle about who paid for the dog. 

I mean, if you move in together or get married are you still going to tell him not to do anything to care for the dog?"
Because sis wants to be together. Just the two of them.
"It's inappropriate because your sister has put you in the place of a boyfriend. She's jealous of your girlfriend because she feels like you're cheating on her. Nothing about that is normal.    

If your sister isn't inclined to back off and create a more normal sibling relationship with you, you'll have to force her by imposing boundaries and defending them religiously. If you won't do this, you run the risk of ruining every romantic relationship you have. No woman wants to put up with their boyfriend's sister acting like they have some sexual rivalry with each other.    
"
"I made a throwaway for a reason.  But on an island, so quarantine is strict AF.  There's a reason we'd not attempted to get at least pup here before.

As per moving: it would be 2-3 months rent to break the lease, plus another 3-4 months rent to start at the new place.  Plus moving costs and any pet deposit.  So overall, looking at close to 10k USD.  It was about 7k usd for me to move when I swapped jobs--that was without breaking a lease."
"She owns the house husband lives in, but lives in another country herself. "
It’s really sad :( it definitely sounds like mental illness.
"Yeah, that’s kind of where I’m at on it. Unfortunately I doubt I’d be able to swing that considering they don’t live particularly close geographically and it might be too early to ask her to go on a trip like that 

I get that it sucks and is shitty from Lisa’s perspective, but if you were in her shoes, what do you think an appropriate reaction would look like?"
"He won’t move, because of the animals... gets more animals 🤨"
"His money is his money to do with as he pleases.

But if he's committing fraud in your name, you should report that."
My guess would be Twitch streamer not that it really matters/relevant to the post
"To be honest, these are very reasonable suggestions. Sexual relationship take work, like all relationships, and neither of these requests seem excessive.

I get that it would be ideal if you could hang out in your comfy clothes all evening and sex would just happen spontaneously and passionately. However, you, your boyfriend and all of us here already know that that doesn't happen. You have sex 2-3 a month.

So, do you want to keep hoping for a fantasy that doesn't exist and wind up in a completely dead bedroom, or do you want to grow up and realize that sometimes being in an adult relationship means everything is not the fairly tale life you are hoping for? 

So you can be a little disappointed that you aren't sex magnet even when you put zero effort into it. Or be a little disappointed that you have to plan ahead for sex rather than it just happening all the time. But it's needs to be the same way you feel when you don't win the lottery -- the alternative doesn't mean your relationship is broken, the alternative is what REAL LIFE looks like. "
That's the nature of the sub. People with easily solved problems don't ask the internet for help. They fix them. Here people share issues they've tried to fix and can't.
Like he didn't even slowly build up either. Just bam knocked her into the ice. At some point he's going to use that hockey stick to kill her. 
"Former Waiter here. 

15% is fine. I would never bat an eye at 15% unless I did something insanely special for the guest like got their food comped without a mistake from me being made. 

75 cents at the bar is a bit petty though. I'd raise my eyebrow. Like what's the extra twenty five cents too much? Just make it a dollar. 

The rest of his behavior is a little uncomfortable. The keeping track of drinks and talking about it a lot. I'd talk to him about that more than the tipping. If he's receptive and tries to change, then a little gentle teasing should get him to come around on the 75 cents next time he tips at a bar around you. I wouldn't fret over the 15%, I tip 15% if all the Waiter did was take my order and disappear. "
Because that's super rude 
She's not a good person and she's not you're friend. It doesn't matter that she is pregnant. There are thousands of pregnant women all over the world who don't insult people and prey on insecurities. I would just block contact. You deserve better. 
"The tickets are in your name, correct? Meaning that they weren’t his tickets to sell. He needs to return her $450 and tell her he’s sorry, but he didn’t talk to you before selling them, and you already have plans for the tickets (even if they aren’t concrete, they’re your tickets to do with what you will.) I repeat, you do not have to sell them. They’re yours, you paid for them, and your husband needs to handle his mistake like an adult."

"What is wrong with you ? You can go on a trip without your SO just fine, you're just dependant and clingy like OP's girlfriend, but the difference is your wife is also clingy so it seem fine to you guys."
"Yo wtf? She doesn’t need to do anything legally, she can (and urgently needs to) just leave her boyfriend, he has no legal right to her daughter. This advice is trash OP just LEAVE. "
"Believe me when I say sleeping around in college is *way* overrated, especially if you're female. Best scenario is you get some fun sexual experiences. More likely, you have some mediocre experiences with frat-types who want to ""mess around"" before actually developing themselves enough to have a functional long term relationship. The worse case scenario is horrifying enough that I'd rather not type it out...

Don't ditch a healthy, functional relationship over a hollywood fantasy of your 20s."
"I am actually the daughter. Is it so obvious? I can't handle it when I see my family having a great time together with my dad but I'm the only one who can't have fun because my dad hates me and my mom is basically tolerating him and loves all the gifts and vacations that he takes her on every time he's caught cheating. She catches him cheating, cries to me on the phone as I live away from home, makes me hate my dad even more, then makes up with him. But what about me? I'm always left in the dark after she makes up with him then come flaunting her 30k rolex that he got her after she caught him cheating....

I've been depressed for years, I hate how my relationship with my dad is going and I know it can't be fixed, and I hate how my mom and my siblings are on good terms with him, it makes me look like I'm the bad person, that I'm the terrible daughter who hates her dad for no reason. 

I know this post might be twisted, but I posted it because I'm sending it to my parents. It might piss my mom off, it will actually, but I have to come clean. I did her a favour by telling her ""story"" from different perspectives. Because she might feel bad about telling me about her issues, who knows? Even though every time I give her little to no feedback, she tells me that I'm selfish and that no one cares about her. 

She was telling my last week about my dad and that he says that he doesn't like me. That was the final straw. I want him to know that I didn't just stop talking to him because I wanted to, it was because he does drugs, is a cheater and has a baby with another woman and on top of all that, he's a layer for masking all of this off and pretending to be a good father in front of me and my siblings. I know if he knew that mom told me about everything, he will try to make up with me and get everything right, but because he doesn't know, I've been mad at him for years. As for my mom, she's only mad at him until he buys her something expensive or takes her on vacation... Been crying for days because I feel like I'm an outcast within my own family. I'm sorry for wasting your time on this rubbish if a post. And thank you for understanding"
You may be biased but you're right. I'm an atheist and see them as cult-y. So do many others regardless of their own religious background.
Isn't it like prep school coke? 
"&gt;No. She also works. Gets in at 8am. 

Can I ask what you do?  Where are you in the morning routine?  Could you take some of the morning drop offs and let your wife sleep in?

&gt;I offered to give her a call everyday last time this happened and she found that idea patronizing.

Well, to be honest, if she's not going to get your daughter to school on time then you're within your right to be upset.  Something has to change since this keeps happening.  Either you call her, or she puts her alarm somewhere she can't reach from bed."

Someone who's hungry? I enjoy sharing plates myself but OP specifically said the place they went to had small appetizers that weren't large enough for them to split one as their only dish. 
He has at least 12 decapitated heads in his closet. 
"So what I'm hearing you say through reading this all is that you feel you're making sacrifices for him and doing things for him and he's not doing the same for you. If that's true, then you need to sit down with him and have an open and honest conversation with him about this.

You also need to take some responsibility here. Your gas gauge is broken, get it fixed asap so this doesn't happen again. Just because you leave work for him doesn't mean he has to do it back. Would it have been nice for him to help you out? Yes. Is it required of him to leave work to do so? No. I think you're blowing this instance out of proportion because you're fed up with feeling like you're always giving and he's not giving back to you."
"Reading your post, it sounds a lot less like your issue is with the suggestions themselves, and a lot more with the fact that his drive is innately lower. As a girl with a crazy high sex drive, I get that. It's hard and confusing to understand why they don't just go for it when you'd take any opportunity to. 

Do you initiate when you two are, as you describe, just sitting side by side on the sofa?"
You actually have a point. I didn't see it that way. Fair enough stranger
"&gt;Often times with women I find that they look best with little or no makeup, however this is not the case with her.

I think you should tell her in these exact words. And then come back and tell us how she responds. Please.  "

"I'm not American, so I don't have the same cultural background on this, but I agree, OP looks to be going out of his way to read racism into this issue. 

If my family were afraid to say something about my partner in case they might be taken in a way that might be insulting to her, I think that would be far more detrimental long term than a throw away line about Vikings taking women. "

"No, but it sounds like when he came up with the idea, it was not inclusive of his dad necessarily. It was more like, hey, maybe he could come. So it's not like he was always planning a trip with his dad, or planning a solo trip, just a trip that he specifically wants to exclude her on. 

Idk, I guess you're right that he's totally allowed to do that and he doesn't owe it to her to invite her, but I'd be hurt. "
"Being rejected hurts, it’s embarrassing, and awkward and it changes the relationship knowing that one of you feels so much stronger than the other. 

My guess is he feels super uncomfortable. He opened himself up, made himself super vulnerable and got shot down and his plan to avoid feeling shit about it is to cut ties as much as possible. 

Do I think it’s right? No. Do I think it’s your fault? No. Is it his choice to do this? Absolutely, it’s his feelings in question. 

I get that this hurt you but he’s probably been hurting for five months or so and if you care about him, let him do what he wants. In the long run it might help him and you might grow close again in future, I don’t know. "
"Ehhhhhh.... I get what you're saying, but I don't think it's selfish at all. One year is not long in an adult relationship. Heck, I've wanted to take trips with other people that weren't my husband and vice versa (though at this point we wouldn't go on a dream trip without the other). It kind of *feels* like OP has been nagging the shit out of her dude over this trip. Like, she totally gets that he doesn't want her to come but she might be able to make him feel sorry about it any ask her to come if she keeps bringing it up and starting arguments over it. I've been there. I don't think it's any indication at all how important she is to him. He can be totally in love with her and still want to do this trip for himself. People are allowed to put their desires above their SO's from time to time, especially when they aren't married."
"hell naw im not going to bother him with this becuase its moronic and i know it is. 

Its not just my cousin, everyone is always telling me hes gay. random people at the bar i work at, other family members, its obnoxious. after hearing it so many times my stupid mind runs amok"
"Because unfortunately that's the reality of living in a country with truly awful worker's rights. It's horrendous advice, but it's also the only advice to give in this situation."
"Tbh, you seem like the racist one here. You’re so focused on race that it’s a bit fetish-y. "
"It doesn’t come down to your “fragile male ego.” It’s deeper than that. Wanting a monogamous relationship shouldn’t be deemed an “ego” problem; it’s par for the course and your girlfriend is the one wanting an extremely unique and special circumstance. It sounds like she wants an open relationship.  

There are many women out there who would happily commit to you, and only you. I never really advise people on here to rethink their relationship but this one reminds me of what my friend, who is lesbian, went through. She fell head over heels for a woman who wouldn’t call herself lesbian and kept pushing for the permission to sleep with men. It tore my friend apart for years and she couldn’t trust women. It was a toxic situation and it ended up with her being taken advantage of multiple times. 

Can you imagine if your girlfriend was a man? Everyone on here would jump and call the dude an asshole for pushing for threesomes and including women in the relationship and for reiterating to his girlfriend he was attracted to other people. And kissing other people in front of you? Wow. Needless to say the reaction would be right. Just because sexuality is fluid and society is “progressing” a certain way doesn’t mean these things aren’t extremely hurtful in a relationship. Just because she’s a woman doesn’t make her desires any less harmful to you. 
 
Stop trying to be the “chill” boyfriend that could potentially find it sexually enticing for your girlfriend to sleep with other women.  Deep down this seems to be making you feel deeply inadequate. Most people would feel the same. You have to decide for yourself what to do with that. You have different priorities than your girlfriend in this relationship. Hers is focused on her ability to obtain sexual pleasure and yours is your ability to have a commitment. It seems like a fatal mismatch. "
"Yeah I mean with all due respect I don't think you really got what I was saying. People joke about age all the time because everybody gets old, I'm 32 and all my friends joke about how we're getting old now and how hangovers are worse etc and it's acceptable because it happens to everyone. 

It's really not the same as calling people names, and OP didn't deliberately pick on her insecurities he just made an offhand comment that would usually be completely acceptable."
"And that's why you don't go to therapy with your abuser. You are literally saying it in this comment. Email the therapist, dump her, and set up your own personal therapy."
"So there are two answers here. There's the ""everybody works together to make everybody happy"" answer, and the ""I am your father you will do as I say"" answer. You don't have any control over which of those your dad will be willing to accept.

The ""work together"" answer involves trying things on your dad's end to make it easier for him to sleep. Earplugs, white noise, or quiet music can help mask sounds and make it easier to sleep when someone else is wakeful. Unfortunately, depending on your dad's personality, he may take offense to the suggestion that HE needs to make a change; he may expect you to be the only one who works on this problem.

In which case, your options are basically get by as well as you can, plan ahead during each day to minimize nighttime noise, and move out as soon as possible."
"Sorry you are going through this OP, But I think the best thing to do (although tough) is top be the one to make the decision.

ask him to leave and stay somewhere else, find a lawyer and start the process for divorce. You and your daughter don't need this in your life.

I wouldn't be surprised if he (likes) someone else and is hedging his bets with her. Please for your sanity find a lawyer who is good with family law and divorce him. I fear that you will be yo-yoed around for a long time before he finally leaves. "
"&gt;At this point, I’m pretty embarrassed and considered stopping, 

&gt;Now, I feel a like a massive idiot. 

I mean, in this situation you definitely are a massive idiot. You're 28 years old and doing this silly bullshit? Get therapy. Maybe that will show him you're actually serious about not being a shitty girlfriend, and if not, it'll do you good when you get dumped for this."
"You aren't a jerk for recognizing that after three years, your relationship isn't going to magically be the same.  You are under no obligation to get back together with her.  You aren't the same person she was in love with.  

Declining won't make you a bad guy as long as you just stick to that.

""I'm sorry, but I don't think that's a good idea.  It's been three years.  We can't just pick up where we left off after that much time.  I'm a different person and you probably are too.  What happened back then was unfortunate, and I'm glad it's been cleared up now, but I've moved on.  I really do wish you well, but I can't go backwards.""

There.  No blame or anger - just the facts."
"It's not fucked up to not want to touch your partner after being touched by 1 baby all day, let alone 3. A lot of mums feel touched out and don't want to be intimate when they're caring so much for a tiny baby. Plus, they're 9 weeks old and there's 3 of them, that's a lot of touching and constant care they need. 

OP replied to a comment to say he basically does nothing apart from sometimes change them and her sister comes over because she needs help and he isn't there to help. "
"He is working long hours then he is ""clearing his head"" then he is sleeping through the night and then he is whining that his wife is working 24/7 to care for triplets."
"You know without a doubt now. So start making arrangements to leave. This isn’t salvageable. And even if it was, are you so desperate to get married that you would marry such a jerk? "
"I dated your boyfriend for 10 years. TEN YEARS. Ten years of me wanting to have kids, marriage, save for a house... ten years of him saying I had issues to work through before he would marry me, I had to lose weight, be a better housekeeper, support him more, blah blah blah. You feel like he put conditions on things... because he did.

False promises aren't promises, they're lies. You'll be happier when you move on. When my ex and I broke up and his relationship with the girl he was cheating on (with me apparently) ended, he came crawling back to me.  When I told him it would never happen (I had respect for myself and my family for the first time), he flipped and told me that if I had loved him, we would have been married by now. I had told that ass since our first anniversary, I was ready to get married to him.

6 months after I left him, I met a man who would give me his entire world. He was just as eager to marry me as I was him. We'll be celebrating 2 years of marriage in December, our sons will be 14 years old and 1 years old. You deserve a man who is eager to marry you. That is what your dad would want for you. &lt;3"
"She’s an asshole because you tolerate it. If she suffered consequences for being shitty, like getting dumped once and for all, she might learn a lesson. "
"And if I had been on the jury at your trial, I wouldn't have voted to convict."
Great reason to dump this guy. What a colossal jerk.
"She would definitely have a right to any state welfare services, no matter what nationality, and he would have to pay child support while living in Germany. I have no idea what her chances of getting anything from him if he returned to the US, but I'm guessing they're slim. Also, the usual term is 14 weeks in Germany."
"Start making plans to break up. Get a job and save up some money to move out. If you have to fight so hard to get even a scrap of attention, it's not worth the effort"
It is all so strange. I’ve never dated someone that I didn’t ask (if only for the sake of conversation) how old they are. 
2 months? lmao more like 0 months. NEXT
"I have a lock on the phone and he doesn’t know the passcode. I truly don’t think he’s trying to look at it Bc he’ll do it when we’re specifically doing something together like watching tv, cuddling, etc. so he can see my reaction when I realize it’s missing. "
"You ""let"" her hang out with friends? Yikes."
"After reading your comments, it's clear you're still not over Lisa. Or, at the very least, she has you so on the hook that you're unable to stand up to her. She'll either reel you in with some kind of guilt, or feelings of obligation, or she'll just be \*pouts* *SOOOO hurt* that you're doing this to her! That you'll cave in and do it for Lisa, of course you'll be there for Lisa, how could you be so cruel to poor Lisa?

As long as you and Lisa are ""friends"" like this, where you're so afraid to displease Lisa that you're willing to sacrifice a potential decent relationship, you'll never have another relationship.

I understand you're in a tough position. But you have to choose. And I know if it were me, I would definitely not be choosing Lisa. I would explain to Lisa that something has come up and you can't go on the trip. Lisa will be upset, but if she's truly a good friend, she will understand. And if she doesn't understand, and she pouts and fusses and calls you names and makes you feel guilty, then she's a really shitty friend and your best served by getting her out of your life."
"We’ve got at least one ex-stripper (that I know of) doing pole at our studio, and I really hope no one in the studio would make derogatory comments about strippers, since we’re really big on self-acceptance and never judging yourself or those next to you.  "
"Well, you did change the deal by taking a 60k pay cut after agreeing that she didn’t have to work ever again.  I don’t know what to tell you here - why did you make that deal with her in the first place that she never had to work ?  I think you see now that that was a mistake, right ?"
She is completely wrong here and this is just silly.  This is basically entrapment.  How long have you been with her?  I can't see this lasting long if this makes her freak out when it was of her doing.
"Using both condoms and birth control combined has a very low failure rate. Worrying about things that are nearly impossible is just a waste of time. That would be like saying don't go outside because there is always a chance you can get struck by lightning. Always.

"
"Ok this is from r/deadbedrooms, and is often massively biased but here's a few things to check up on:

1. How's the division of labour? Not just housework but making appointments, planning, reminding etc. If it falls on her mostly she might feel like a parent and you only do things to get laid.

2. Have there been any physical changes? Is she under a lot of stress? Is she possibly depressed?

3. How intimate are you both with no expectation of sex? Do you both just kiss and cuddle? Touch each other affectionately? Does she worry that if she kisses you she has to have sex?

If any of those may be true then it's important to work on those and address the issue. If not, you should seek couples counselling to find out what's happened and why because you deserve to feel fulfilled. I really do not mean to be biased but it seems like something she's stuck on, not you, and those issues I mentioned often come up."
"&gt;I don't think I'm going to ask her to quit her job just yet.

Don't.  It's not *her* problem that *you* made assumptions and got insecure, or worried, or whatever you want to call it.  She did not break any trust.

Honestly, a lot of what she did sounds like just two good friends.  This one just happens to be a dude.  I mean, sometimes you get co-workers who you just click with and are instant friends.  I have plenty of friends from work who buy me candy/stuff that makes them think of me, and I've totally brought food for them.

I'm glad you came forward with your feelings, and I'm glad she was honest and open with you. But please don't make her feel guilty or untrustworthy just because she made a friend."
"Good God Man, that is rough rough rough. You are a strong human being and you are right, closure isn't always long talks or righteous screaming its just getting up and never looking back - ever. I'm sorry you went through this, and OP I'm soo sorry you're going through this - please take solace in knowing the truth about your rotten friend and your equally disgusting EX-BF. "
"Girl those are low bars. ""He's a basically decent human being until someone mentions race"" is not an endorsement. 

If this is what he's willing to say to his WOC girlfriend this early in the relationship his real views have got to be super horrifying. Like ""Richard Spencer has some valid arguments and actually David Duke isn't a bad guy"" horrifying. 

Whether you decide to try to talk to him about it is completely up to you, but I really think you should cut your losses and find someone who doesn't not-so-secretly think Brown vs Board was a terrible decision by an activist Supreme Court and school vouchers are the way for nice white parents to avoid all those urban elements in their school districts."
"Lol, no, I'm not. None of my female friends have ever cheated on their husbands. It's not rare to be faithful. "
"As others have said the locks changed and landlords involved, but you can request police accompany you home too if you think he'll be there. And take friends with you to have on speed dial as well or family if needed. 

If you someone savvy with tech in your friend circle have them check your phone, your computer and when in the apartment look for hidden cameras. Actually the Domestic Abuse Hotline's website has a page dedicated to abusers tracking people via electronics and what to do, so maybe just check that while you can.

Stay safe. "
It's not stolen though...
"That's pretty much I'm feeling with it, I think.

It's not like I will be starving while he starts twirling his spaghetti and evil villain laughing at me. 

If I need help with it in the future, than that's what partners are there for each other for.

Thanks "
"I moved to Russia for my husband two and a half years ago.

Logistically, other people are right on the money. It's great that you're creating an independent life for yourself, with a stable job and income. That's *so* important.

In these kinds of relationships, a naturally skewed power dynamic can form -- you're in his country, speaking his language, using his money, working in his socioeconomic system. 

I personally found that the first six months were easy. But then, unexpectedly, I started to get really depressed. For the first few months I had been in 'adventure' mode (i.e. ""bring it on! I can handle anything!"") and somewhere along the line, the grind of real life sets in. The drain of constantly speaking a foreign language, the little extra effort that every single interaction takes, being *so* far away from family and friends, even just keeping track of a different currency that might not feel quite 'real' -- you can get temporarily exhausted. And that's okay, you just need to be prepared to deal with it, and your SO needs to expect and support you through it.

Two years after that initial depression, and I'm doing a lot better. It takes time, but I'm slowly acclimating, and assuming your relationship works out long-term, you will too. Have a good support system and steady finances, and persevere. And remember that it's okay to need help to do so."
"It seems like the OP would like to spend their time out hooking up as well, but just hasn't been as successful.  She spoke glowingly about the time that she thought that a man genuinely showed interest in her.  I think that they are both going to the club to spend time with each other **and** to meet men.

I agree that maybe they should try other activities, but I don't think that Ann is the problem here.    "
"Definitely. Therapy is just some extra guidance and help in getting things sorted out. Ultimately you still are the ones who have to do all the work but you can discuss it in a safe environment and better understand each other.

If you decide on therapy it's not like ""you have problems before even getting married so what's the point"". In fact, you are showing that you're both willing to put work into the relationship and you care for it enough to make sure you do everything you can to make it a good one. And that's something really precious.

Edit: typo"
"So which is it? You were having an affair or you guys were on a break?

"
"&gt; I pushed him and told him to, and I quote “fuck off” and to not speak to me again.

No, that's shitty. Are you really so lacking in self awareness? "
" That is pure manipulative bullcrap, and you know it. And yeah, you should let it get to you, because it should make you ask the question: ""why am I with someone that doesn't want me to be with my friends? Why would I want to be with someone who makes me choose between her and good people I care about?"" And the answer is: a good person doesn't do that. She's not being a good person, a good partner. She doesn't have your best interests at heart. Don't ignore this, she's telling you who she is: a jealous, manipulative person. Believe her."
"I came here to say this. I've noticed that the more time my SO and I have to cuddle, snuggle, talk affectionately, giggle and laugh with each other, the better our relationship is. 

Just a recommendation for you, Op. I feel so content, protected, loved, and sexy when he spoons me, then starts to caress my hair, then moves to my back.  (The move usually leads to more things, I'm melting like butter after just a minute of the back caresses.)"
"It can be done. It’s interesting that the ones who want to stop you are coming from your lifestyle. They think they’ll lose you. They’re trying to tell you this is the slippery slope to leaving the church.  Religious communities have a way of not wanting to let go, and that often means setting up a strong “them v us” dynamic in order to retain their own. 

My mum is catholic. Very much so. My dad was a mass-every-day type until he left college. I’m never sure what the trigger event was, as he’s always been very discreet about it, but my mum and dad’s worst fight was over trying to get him to go to Mass shortly after they got married. And I felt like a failure because my grandmother’s last words to me were to “ask your father to go to Mass and pray for me”, and he wouldn’t. 

It could have damaged our family. But my mum felt, like you, that not going to Mass didn’t make him a bad person. He’s not. He’s chairman of the town social services committee, he fundraised for, oversaw the building of and still chairs a respite care centre for people with profound disabilities and he runs the town meals-on-wheels service, and he put a lot into his family too. 

Anyway my mum says “there can’t be a heaven if someone like your dad can’t get in, so I don’t worry about being separated in the afterlife as much as I used to. God forgives sinners, he can forgive a good man.”

We were all raised catholic. I gave up going to mass at 16 apart from special occasions (until at 18 I joined the folk choir for a few more years). I’m not religious at all now, but that’s not exactly choice so much as a lack of faith that I can’t really disguise and don’t feel comfortable pretending.  My dad encourages me to go to Mass for my mum’s sake, but they respect my choice just as they respect each other’s choices. "
"Your mother is creating a hostile work environment. Her actions need consequences. As her boss, and daughter, are you prepared to give them?

This is why most companies do not allow relatives to work under one another."

"&gt; not cheating or open marriage related, god no

So...the ""out of your league"" woman whose number you got two years ago and were asking when to call/text was your wife?"
"Get a lawyer to protect your rights as a parent and get away from her.  I have friends that have very good coparenting experiences without staying with a negative partner.  It is possible, but you need a strong custody agreement and good personal boundaries."

I don't mean to sound judgy but the age difference is extremely large. You are at different stages in life right now and will face bigger challenges because of it.
"I know! I do think I’ll call it quits with being his friend if he doesn’t change.


It’s like a lose lose situation, either I put him as gay and I’m a bad guy, or I let him use and take advantage of these women, which makes me a bad guy. "
"You could directly ask your father to invite you to his house. 

You could also approach it in a less direct way, such as by offering to drop something off to him at his home, or by saying that you’ll be in his area on Saturday, would it be ok if yo stopped by?  

If you’re in regular contact with him and have met his wife on multiple occasions without any issue, I don’t think you should assume there is some big bad reason that you haven’t been invited over.  It might just be that your father and his wife just generally don’t invite people over, and your brothers managed to make themselves the exception to that rule.  

I have a neighbor that will periodically say “lets do dinner, you make Italian and I’ll bring the wine”.  He isn’t my favorite neighbor, but we have dinner with him a lot more often than with any of the other neighbors that don’t invite themselves over.  "
You really have no idea if that’s what he’s doing. 
"I'm just gonna throw this out there. Your cousins' kids see that Chris is getting special attention and then whine to Mommy and Daddy. Instead of trying to teach their kids anything they expect you to treat them the same way. 

The best thing for you, Chris, and the other kids is to stand your ground. Your cousins will likely throw a hissy fit, because they also sound entitled and spoiled and will continue being on the receiving end with their children's' hissy fits. 

So the TLDR: Your cousins don't want to properly parent their kids and expect you to cater to them. Don't and stand your ground. It's better for everyone."
Yeah this is basically what I'm thinking at the mo.. I miss him but whatever grief I have is nothing compared to hers so who the fuck am I to stop her. Does reporting it block her access or stop new posts? I don't know if I'd want to do that without speaking to her first.

"So, I work with special needs individuals. For more than a decade. I'm a firm believer in a kind of almost eugenics that would better the Human race as a whole. It's not dependent on skin color or gender. But things like down syndrome, autism, debilitating diseases and conditions that mandate life long care are not beneficial to anything. They are simply, undesirable traits. I feel humanity would be better off if these could be removed entirely. Disabled people are a burden on those around them and the society they live in. We need to stop pretending that they're not.

 But that doesn't mean that we can't value them. That doesn't mean that we treat them any worse than we would like to be treated. This guy you were talking to may feel that disabled people don't have anything to add to the gene pool, but if we stripped everyone with the slightest neuroticism out of the reproductive race, then we'd be left with a small group. We learn from our struggles. You have value. You have a life full of lessons and worth to share with the world. Even if your lesson is 10,000 ways to eat a bowl of cereal, it's important to you. You matter."
"Speaking through her dead son seems a little morbid, and it's probably her way of ""keeping him alive"" even if it's her own words.

Edit: the person I responded to asked ""why is it unhealthy""

"Yeah, especially at her height. At her most active her maintenance calories were likely no more than 2200 or so. With how calorie dense processed food can be, it can be really easy to overeat majorly. Especially if she went from eating a lot of lower calorie food and working out a ton to eating a lot of calorie dense nutritionally shitty food and living an inactive lifestyle. 

140 lb gain over 36 months is ""only"" a bit under 5lbs/month."
"So the whole morning routine falls on her. Is she getting enough sleep? I know the snooze thing and forgetting details was a big issue for me when I wasn't getting enough regular sleep. And I mean I need like 8 hours of sleep to be good whereas some of my exes only needed 6 or 7 and would get on my case for ""sleeping too much""

On a more relationshippy note, when you approach these conversations with your wife are you coming in hard or are you trying to approach a solution?"
"The Spanish Flu is obviously a bullshit comparison and you know it. The people who die of the flu in other years are usually very young or very old, not otherwise-healthy 30 year olds.  I hate being sick as much as the next person, but OP should be able to manage on her own for one night. "
"You need to stand up to her. Have a talk about this with her again. Don't do it when she's acting like this, bring it up during a meal or something. 

She brushes it off by saying that it's normal and she does it because she cares. Again, stand up to her. Maybe don't say that it's ""not normal"", but say that it isn't healthy for her or for you. It's not healthy for her to want you around 24/7, and it's not healthy for you to have her make you feel this way. She needs too socialize outside of you, and you need to socialize outside of her. Explain to her that you can't spend all of your time with her. It's not that you don't like spending time with her, you like spending time with other people, ie. your girlfriend too. You need balance. You're not picking your girlfriend over your sister, and you're not picking your sister over your girlfriend; you're picking both and making time for both. 

If she doesn't get that her behaviour is detrimental and stifling, that's definitely a problem. Really put your foot down, but try to be as nice ad possible about it without being a doormat.

"&gt;He has MASSIVE inadequacy issues, literally doesn't think he's good at anything or worth anything. 

It's really hard to have a healthy relationship with a partner like this. I've struggled with these feelings in the past, so I definitely get it, but if he's not taking steps to address his insecurity and depression I am not sure how you could expect it will change. Especially since it's impeding your ability to communicate on an issue of such importance with any specificity already, what do you think you can reasonably expect from him as a married partner? 

You mentioned that you feel like you might be lazy too. Is this something you want to change/improve on? It's much easier to make those changes when you also have a partner interested in self-improvement. My fiance and I of course struggle with this stuff like anyone else. We've wasted our fair share of weekends playing video games! But we're always trying to come up with gameplans to get better at managing our time and responsibilities. It's very motivating. Right now you have the opposite. And I'd guess it's demotivating. "
"I can say from experience that this IS fixable if your BF has the will to change. When I met my DH, he was insecure about his crooked teeth and hadn't been to the dentist in almost a decade. He was brushing his teeth regularly but had several years of neglect built up. I encouraged him to start flossing with me at night and even offered to pay for a dental cleaning (he was unemployed). He received tons of praise (and kisses), gained a lot of confidence and now takes GREAT care of his teeth. The key is to be upfront but sensitive and supportive. Tell him that you really love his smile and want to help him take care of it. Bad oral hygiene is sometimes the product of phobias, insecurities, etc., BUT...it has dire consequences. If this goes on, it will absolutely become a deal breaker. Since you really care about him, you need to be open about this and give him a chance to change."
"You're absolutely entitled to feel uncomfortable; I don't understand why your emotions are so easily dismissed around here. Talk to her about what you feel and why you feel like that. Also try to figure out what it is that makes her want to do pole dancing, instead of any other just as healthy fitness routine. 

And the fact that a lot of people have no issue with it whatsoever is good for them, but that of course has nothing to do with how *you* feel. "
"After having quite a few roommates... I've learned that if it's not spelled out in writing, you can't have ""expectations"" of someone else-- they will floor you each and every time.

* Take a landlord class in your city.
* Learn how to write up a lease (you can search online for leases to get ideas).
* Learn how to write up a roommate agreement (search online for ideas). In this agreement you would include all the things that you want out of the situation, like cleaning, quiet hours, guests, use of space, etc.

I'd suggest finding someone who is BUSY outside the home... student + PT job, someone with a FT job... charge less for that super busy roommate, they're a gem! If someone is working from home in your house... write up specific rules about how you will share the space. 

Post your agreement on the fridge or in the kitchen. If they show a pattern of violating your agreement, the next time you see them in person, kindly request the behavior you had agreed to, ""hey, I've been hearing music play after 11pm. I need to get to sleep for work by 10:30pm. I'd really appreciate it if you turned it off after 10pm or wore headphones. Thanks.""

Edit: And bollocks to all the people that will tell you you're unreasonable. If you discuss something upfront, and they agree, that's between the two of you. As far as guests are concerned, my roommate and I agree to text the other person if we're having a guest over, and no more than 2 overnights per 7 consecutive days without a conversation in person."
"Just because an individual has a low libido, does not mean they're happy for their partner to become non-monogamous. It just doesn't work that way for many people.

"It sounds like you're his girlfriend, not one of those two brothers, so tell him if he wants someone to prank constantly he can go move in with one of them. He's 34 and the fact that he can't stop ""pranking"" you is embarrassing. Ask him why, if he loves you, he gets so much amusement from making you feel genuinely upset, and if he thinks it will help your relationship if he pushes you into resenting him with his behavior. "
This is all the more reason to keep the inheritance as separate property. There is no reason for part of your biological father's hard-earned money to go to your husband in the event of a divorce. 
"I'm not her so what do I know, but I'm not sure ""I don't know why I made that joke"" would reassure me in that context. Might make me think it's subconsciously revealed preferences.

Not that you shouldn't say it if it's the truth; just giving a reason why it might not be as reassuring to hear as you might think."
"Congratulations! You told him he’s succeeding!

He’s trying to be manipulative. He’s trying to be controlling. You “explaining” this to him only confirms that what he’s doing is working just as he planned.

But seriously, unless they are being ANNOYINGLY loud (like, screaming) I'd ignore it. 


Seriously, if someone hears you pooping, do you want them to let you know that they could hear you when you come out of the bathroom? No. The bathroom is about privacy. If they have sex with the door open, then they are not properly using privacy. But what they do in their room and behind a locked bathroom door, I'd give them the illusion of privacy, if they are not going out of their way to be obnoxious about noise level."
"&gt; if it harms none, then that belief isn't yours to challenge.

It's harming their relationship, and it's going to harm her economically when she gives away escalating amounts of money for powers she only thinks she's getting.

Letting your friend buy a rock that keeps leopards away ""because it's harmless"" only works until they move on to paying even more for something equally worthless - and now you either have the same issue you did before, with 10x the cost, or you let them do that too. Or they encounter a leopard and think their magic rock will save them.

Basically, it's harmless until it isn't."

She’s blowing off steam. It happens. I would be more worried about the fact that she called off your wedding because she worries that she’s going to be the one doing all the emotional labour in your marriage the rest of her life. Time for some soul searching and tough conversations.
"I’ve been fat my entire life too. There’s plenty that I could do about it, and that you could do about it for yourself. You just refuse to acknowledge the fact that you just don’t *really* want to do anything about it, and thus you’re removing any accountability from yourself or your husband for the component of this that is your responsibility. 

Look, I’m not saying any of this to shame you or your husband, but to deny that there is a strong correlation and causation between certain health problems and obesity is to deny basic reality. I’m not saying you’re “wrong” for being fat, but you’re denying decades of established medical science on this subject, seemingly to remove any accountability for yourselves. *That* is wrong."

"Yeah I'd agree with this. My mam and dad when they got married didn't have a ton of money. She got a ring which wasn't really her taste and always felt very looked down upon for it. They're married like 20 odd years and last year she got a nice shiny sparkly one. it looks very impressive and it draws the eye. She feels less looked down upon and she's certainly less anxious about it. I think for something so long term, it would be no harm to set aside a little bit here and there to get your soon to be wife something she can be proud of at some stage."
"You're incompatible now and too much damage has been done, this is just where the cookie crumbles.

As one girl whose mental health has been very damaging to a relationsip - to another. This is what happens. 

You know how HARD you had to fight to stop thinking of death as a lover? SO HARD. Now imagine, someone fighting that fight for someone else, but they din't have the knowledge that ""it won't happen"" that you do. No matter how many times you tell him.

The mental breakdowns add up, and while he might not resent you or hold them against you, they did effect him, they did wear him down emotionally. Even if you finally got help and you're in a good place now, there is still a low of emotion and faint resentment on both sides. 

His side thinking you might not be stable enough to see a future with while he doesn't provide the right level of affection and romance (it's hard to feel romantic when your relationship is plauged in darkness). He's probably drained. 

Your side not getting enough ""normalcy"" and romance and having someone who can't handle a relationship with someone who is ill.

You need to stop being selfish now.

&gt;  I don’t want to let go. I don’t want this to end!

That's understandable, but it's not your decision. 

It honestly sounds like you both tried so hard, for so long but ultimately - love isn't everything. Security, trust, understanding, those things have left your relationship a while ago.

There is no pin-pointing anything. It's just all the small things over time coming together. 

Start healing. "
"I don't believe her reiki stuff and would have a lower opinion of her intelligence for believing this stuff.  I think you have a fundamental incompatibility there.  

But you are being REALLY insulting here, while covering it up under the guise of ""I'm just asking questions, why can't I ask questions""?

Like this stuff about ""oh, if you have these magic powers why don't you go do it in fromt the skeptics society and earn millions of dollars??? And then donate it to charity, because you are such a good person right? Why don't you do that?  Is it because is fake magic?    Why don't you prove it's not fake magic?""

You came across pretty poorly here.  You've allowed your natural hatred of alternative medicine because of your history with your Nan to come out against your girlfriend.  You are using this as an opportunity to attack the people who you feel wronged you...  but your gf didn't wrong you.

If you can't accept or respect her beliefs, then break up with her.  You don't need to keep treating her like shit. "
"So it took him 7 months to realise you’re ‘worth it’ ?

Hun, for seven months he did not give a flying fuck that he was destroying you. This man lacks compassion.
For almost a year he was cheating and did not care about you. He said he has *always* had cheating tendencies. Do you think he can suddenly stop ?

If you were to change that, he would have changed seven months ago. 

He will cheat again. Have some self respect and move on"

"You're ""better at multi-tasking"" because you push yourself to. He's not good at it because he knows he doesn't have to step up since you'll just take up the responsibilities he drops. 

If your husband respected you, your time, and your effort, he would pull his weight. He is not doing that. Stay at home parents have it hard, but he sounds like he's only parenting a 40hour week (since he goes away once you get home) but expects you to parent at least a 56 hour week on top of your full time job (counting the hours you're home with kid).

Absolutely do not have another child with this man until he can do at least half the work with the child you already have."
"I’m def most in agreement with this response. I know sexual assault is a hot topic that we’re all trying to understand better and I think this could potentially fall into a grey area that you can now make extremely black and white for him. If you tell him your upset, you do not and will not ever want sex without a condom, and you need him to start listening to what your saying is ok, he needs to fully take that on board and actually do it. The reason I think it’s a grey area before you’ve said all that (and I know I could be opening myself up to criticism here) is that as a girl I have been in similar situations and said no but not really meant it. I mean I have meant it but when I was younger hormones got the better of my rational brain and I would have taken the risk! (Hell, I’ve even taken the risk in my 30s but an unexpected pregnancy with my long term partner was much less of an issue for us!) And when he said no you didn’t, I might have even laughed too. I mean, you were there, and you know him and how he said what he said. If you think he was trying to push you into it  then go with your gut. If you think he was lightheartedly seeing what you could be persuaded into and has no idea you could be upset by it, it’s worth a conversation imo. "
"&gt; Valerian is for sleep disorders, it makes you tired much like eating turkey will

Turkey doesn't make you tired. That's a myth based on turkey's tryptophan content (which isn't any higher than other animal based proteins to begin with).

"For starters, I’ve only met 1 out of 2 of his friends. I just know that if we all live together, cleaning will be the biggest issue. That can be sorted out if we live together, but I don’t really want to spend my time nagging my boyfriend &amp; his friends to help me clean. Also, right now I just have to deal with my boyfriend or myself having people over. Now add two more people to that....

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve lived with many different roommates before, but I’ve outgrown the whole roommate thing. My boyfriend &amp; I have had a schedule going for 3 years &amp; it’ll be interrupted by 2 other people living with us. 

My boyfriend says he’s “trying to help us all save money”, but living in a house means higher rent, higher utility bills, etc. His friends could easily find a 2-bedroom for cheaper. Also, I feel like he’s excited they’re finally moving down here, but he didn’t plan on having a girlfriend &amp; he’s just trying to make us all, or himself, happy."

"well not exactly. If I had primary custody the nearly 2000 dollars I am giving in support will be greatly reduced if not eliminated. I would have no problems providing for my kids equally int hat situation.

I am giving my two sons the same amount from my resources. I am not however, using my wife's money on my older son, who has a mother with more than earning potential than my wife and I."
"Even if you got custody, what you’re saying is that you wouldn’t be able to spend as much money on the older son because of your wife’s spending. You’re making excuses not to treat your kids equally. He doesn’t understand the situation because you’re being unfair. He gets to live with his single mom with less stuff and then gets to see it dangled in front of him every weekend. I bet you’d be pissed if you were in his shoes. It’s not as simple as “life is unfair.” You’re giving your younger son preferential treatment. A good father gives all of his children the same opportunities, the same amount of love and guidance, and doesn’t try to explain away the gaping differences in care between children. He fixes them. "
"Yeah, he’s totally taking advantage of you. I’m a SAHM to an almost 16 month old toddler (which sounds like the age your’s is?), so I understand some of his points, but I don’t understand about 90% of it. 

First, that age is super difficult. Then add to it that my kid still can’t walk? Yeah, it’s tough. One point I’d like to bring up is that children act out more around the parent who is their primary caregiver. For instance, when we go to her mommy and me classes, she’ll sometimes throw fits if I’m in the room with her. But if I hide out of sight and her dad is with her, she has an absolute blast. Same with bath time. She hates it if I’m doing it, loves it if he’s doing it. It’s all about me being her safe person. My husband has a few complaints you have about him accomplishing more with her around than I do, but this kid will scream if I even go upstairs for 2 seconds to grab laundry. She’s just historically a much better kid when he’s the one watching her. So it’s just easier to maintain the house when I have a second parent to help.

But that’s where my understanding stops. When my husband comes home from work, I start doing chores. Of course I also help with our monster, but that’s when I get things done. His only responsibility on work nights is to help me with our kid. I also will cook while he watches her, but if I don’t feel like cooking on a work night, I’d never dream of making him cook. And as for your husband not knowing how to cook, I was also kind of bad at it too. Our oven broke—which took away most of my meal ideas—so my husband taught me how to cook the dishes he knows. He helped me practice so I could take over.

And on weekends, we divide our time. He’s figured out how to play on his computer while watching her, so that’s helped *a lot* at giving him some free time! But unlike other posters have said they do, we divide chores on the weekends. My job is just as challenging as his. So on the weekends, almost everything is split.

I do think you should talk to him more and maybe even attend counseling to get to the root of the problem, but definitely **DON’T** have more kids right now. If he’s acting this way with just one, adding another will be incredibly hard on you. Also, with you being pregnant, would he clean up his act to help you with all the physical chores? I don’t imagine so.

Good luck OP!"
"&gt;  Once I thought about it, I HAD to access it

No, you didn't."
Can confirm. We're going on 4 years since our youngest and our sex life has indeed not bounced back to where it was before kids. . . OP's Hubby needs to grow the fuck up and/or invest in some time with his new best friend pornhub or maybe help more with the kids so OP has some time and energy left to devote to him. . .
"Have you tried tossing it back to her? ""It's okay if that doesn't work, but I still need more closet space. What do you suggest?"" "
"Wow, do NOT move in with her. You could easily end up literally in the line of fire. That is scary. "
"&gt; I don’t want to have to wait till college (four months) to be able to date him again

Wait. 4 month is is nothing (I promise), and reading this, your mother is not right in the head. You need to keep as much of your life as you can away from her. 

She crossed a line, but she followed you from middle school to high school specifically so you had nowhere away from her. She doesn't understand lines. You need to start protecting yourself from her.

Honestly, it would not surprise me if she tried to follow you to college so she could keep directing your life. "
"Don't tell him. Not just for how it will affect your friendship and his and his fiance's opinion of you, but because of how it will taint the past for him. You will break his trust, and he will examine your history together, and second-guess every ""friend"" thing you did, and wonder if you ever even wanted to be his friend, or were you just trying to ""nab"" him. If it's painful to be around him, then distance yourself, but don't tell him about your feelings.

I think he helped you during a very difficult time in your life, and you're seeing as a prince who rode in on a white horse to save you. It's sort of like how some patients get feelings for their nurse or doctor or therapist - transference. But he was always a friend, and maybe he still could be, if you can recover from your feelings without telling him about them."
"Absolutely not.  He probably thought this would help assuage your previous concerns about neglect, but he has no intentions of following through.  He thought/hoped you would say no so he wouldn't be the bad guy.  You were spot on when you said ""he was all for hanging out when it was convenient for him"".  To be honest, I think you need to have one more ""come-to-jesus"" talk with him.  If he really can't see the fault in his approach, then I don't know what else. Well, of course focus on getting better first."
"&gt; Why does this friendship make me uncomfortable then? 

Because he's openly dating another woman while married to you, and he thinks that's fine as long as he's transparent about it. He pouts when she doesn't show up even though you're right there to celebrate with him. That's hurtful.

Partners should put each other first. Leaving a date with his wife so he could text another woman isn't OK. Texting another woman while in bed with you also isn't normal. And just because they're not texting inappropriate things doesn't mean he's not having an emotional affair with her. He's very obviously too attached to her.

You need to communicate with him about this and tell him it's bothering you. I am fine with my husband being friends with women but I wouldn't be OK with this. Don't let him brush it off by saying you're overreacting. Your feelings are valid. Don't let him excuse it because he's ""honest"" about it. You're not being petty. You're hurt because he's blatantly prioritizing another woman over you."
"Trust your gut on this one. Your boyfriend has the makings to become an abuser. He doesn't have empathy for you. When you're hurting he turns it around on you and makes you the bad guy. He invalidates and gaslights. He doesn't really believe you're ""always depressed"" or whatever. He just says stuff like that to manipulate and make you go away because he doesn't want to have to think about you. This isn't a real relationship. You're just there for him. "
"OP should just admit she and her brother never wanted a relationship with their half-brother, which would be reasonable and within their rights, instead of using that bullshit excuse. 

She probably realized if she had done the former she'd come across as even more selfish than she already is so she made that up. "
Don't forget their mother denied his existence when she lied to her husband by failing to mention she had a child before they met.
"&gt;He also insisted I have her license revoked and not allow her to drive at all. 

Your bf is a petty and vindictive jerk in this scenario. I hope this is a one-time thing and isn't indicative of his usual personality."
"Many people are suggesting you break up with him right away, which frankly I don't think is a bad idea.  He's taking more from the relationship than he's giving and being with someone like that gets exhausting.  This is not a partnership.

Both my wife and I have had depression and anxiety problems, and yeah when they go on for a while it can be hard on your partner.  We have always had the policy that the the depressed person has to be actively working on improving the situation, and as long as they are the other person will pick up the slack for as long as it takes with a smile.  Actively working on it could mean getting back to exercising, reducing stress, going to therapy, or taking medication...the key is when you try one thing if it's not working move on and try something else...you can't get complacent.  You said your BF is ""working on it"" but honestly it doesn't sound like he is really putting much effort into getting himself to a better place.

If you want to stay with him, first thing is to have a serious talk letting him know what needs to change and what will happen if these things do not change.  I know things like depression don't go away overnight but if he can't take baby steps (like stopping getting drunk by night and slamming energy drinks by day) you're never going to see any progress...if I was you, seeing consistent progress would be a requirement for sticking around.  If he doesn't take this seriously, it's time to move on."
How exactly would variety be better for you if you are completely satisfied with your boyfriend? Are there certain acts or whatever that you want to try? Perhaps a threesome? Or do you just want to fuck this hot new guy you met that makes you feel real damn special?
"i can understand your frustration and it's absolutely justified..

it's not just about the theatre, it's about you two being together and doing something that makes you happy for your birthday. he shouldn't sulk about hating the theatre, he should be happy that you're happy. i really don't understand how he can be so cold about the situation, but anyway!

you're not in the wrong and i agree with you entirely. you should tell him how it makes you feel.. like yeah, he doesn't need to go to the theatre but doesn't he want you to enjoy yourself on your birthday?? plus it's a show you may never get to see again, come on man!! he should want you to enjoy this experience :/

have a serious conversation about it! he may change his mind once he realises just how special and important it would be for you :)"
"Seriously. I watched civil war THREE TIMES in theatres for my boyfriend, because he loved that money and watched to watch it over and over again with his friends and siblings and such. 

I hate Captain America, and I especially hate that movie in particular. He had no idea that I didn’t like it until a few months later, because I didn’t complain about seeing it. 

Likewise, he took me to a cat cafe for my birthday because I love cats and he knows how much I miss them. He’s a tad bit allergic to cats and doesn’t really like being around them. "
"I would be concerned that the brother would sell the real estate for a low price ($100) and have the real value of the real estate ($100,000) paid to him “under the table.” This avoids taxes AND giving any money to the OP.

"Fellow Seattleite here, I have heard from transplants that it is hard to make friends in Seattle and it is a bit true. Native seattle people are a bit insular. 
If you are looking for romance, online dating seems to be the biggest way to meet people, but it's kind of shot in the dark whether you'll meet someone you like. However, there are tons of apps, so you can maximize the number of people you meet and go from there.
If you are looking for friends, you have a lot of cool interests that make you perfect for Seattle. There are so many reading groups that you can find via Meetup. There are also tons of board game groups based around specific stores. A lot of the store have events around different games each day. You can lookup Card Kingdom/Cafe Mox and see the events available that sound interesting to you.

Most importantly, say yes to all the invites that come your way. That is the best way to make friends. Even if you aren't interested, you will be exposed to and meet a variety of people that you could help you feel a little less loney.

Best of luck!"
"OP plainly stated that the reason he was able to get the car was because *she* got a good-paying job.  *Her* money paid for a car that she didn't want, and if someone spent thousands of dollars of MY money without my consent I would be mad. as. hell.  I have nothing to do with this situation and I'm furious for his girlfriend. 

His girlfriend needs to leave him and take the car (which she can either use or sell).  OP's reaction to that would be very telling.  After all, he (well, she) bought it for *her,* right?  "
"Seriously! This is legitimately a *huge* pet peeve of mine and I can (and have before lol) rant about it to people for hours.

I've always had big dogs, so maybe I'm biased, but my mum and dad taught me that training is very crucial. It really annoys me when small dog owners insist, ""Oh, it's fine! The bite doesn't hurt!"" Like fuck it doesn't. Do they not know their small dogs' origins? Plus, tiny teeth can definitely hurt -- that's why it hurts when puppies nip and their mother or littermates chide them. These dogs have bitten OP multiple times, and it's just...ugh. Talk about shitty friends.

"Sorry to pile on to this, but I’ve also been your husband in this scenario. 

Again, it was all totally platonic and innocent for months. Just texting and calling all day, but nothing that wouldn’t stand up to close scrutiny from one of our SO’s. It actually didn’t even occur to me that it might be heading towards something inappropriate, until one day it did and I left my long-term girlfriend for her.  

I’m not saying this is definitely going to happen with your husband, but all the same signs are there.  

Honestly, ask yourself why he would devote so much of his time and thoughts to someone who was just a “friend”. Even our very best friends we don’t often talk to all day, every day.  Sending her gifts and wanting to leave a night out just so he can send her a goodnight message are the kind of things you do to impress someone when you’re trying to date them.  

Having been there myself, this all seems horribly familiar and I doubt it will have a happy ending for you. "

"From someone who was married to a heroin addict  I can assure you that no amount of love or care will help him if he makes the choices to use or be around people using. He has to want to stop and he has to be doing everything in his power to stay away from those people and those situations.  I found mine dying multiple times. Overdosed 8 hours before (I was at work) and had been without full oxygen that entire time. It was a miracle he didn't have brain damage. That happened another time but he had only been without oxygen for 3-4 hours. I ended up with PTSD and traumatic nightmares and flashbacks for six years after. 

Bottom line, enabling someone is killing them. If you love him, do not enable him. Make very real consequences for him using drugs. Has he done rehab before? It usually takes people several stints in rehab before they make a permanent change. If he doesn't have consequences then he will continue to do it over and again and he will probably die. 

I would require him to go to rehab and complete it before considering being with him a day longer.

"I was your fiance over 10 years ago. I didn't want to get married, and wanted to be the stereotypical 20yr old but was too scared of what I would lose: my house, my support, my family (they loved her) and honestly my friend. She wasn't a terrible person, we just weren't right for each other. So after calling off the wedding I spent the next 8 months being a completely shitty person. Pretend everything was ok with her, but be out with my friends too. Purposely pick fights and alienate so she would leave me, but wanted to be taken care of.

Eventually I did find someone else and that is the only thing that made me cut the cord. 

My advice is to call it quits and move on. "

"For one thing, I think that you've not been able to forgive him for how he treated you in the past and that resentment has tainted your relationship. I'm not saying you SHOULD forgive him either, just stating that the way he treated you has clearly had really lasting impacts on your relationship. 

I mention this because I might not be that upset if I said I spent a day in bed high on cold medicine and someone said ""nice""--they might mean ""nice, a day to rest at least."" You know? So it's clear that this is a pattern of behavior with him. Do you feel like this is how you deserve to be treated? Can you be happy with him the long run if this never changes?"
"Hey, fellow person on dialysis here, high five! The system that my boyfriend and I worked out is that he pretty much pays all the living expenses and I buy groceries, cook, do the laundry and keep the house clean. Of course, he is very understanding on the days that I just basically have to lay down and zone out like a zombie (that post-dialysis washed out feeling of utter exhaustion is no joke).

The thing is though that we decided to never get married. But, that is influenced more by the fact that I am dying and I don't want to saddle him with my huge medical debts. If you can get on a transplant list and have hopes for a long and productive future where you will be able to pay for your bills then by all means get married. I guess my SO and I sort of see our situation as having a final, definitive deadline rapidly approaching - we'll enjoy our time together and I will pass without leaving him in a poor financial situation.

But the point of my response is that I wanted to tell you that you CAN own a vehicle and a computer (and a cellphone as well) - those are actually protected assets that cannot count against you and cannot be liquidated in order to pay debts (at least in the state of California). You should find out if there is a social worker at your dialysis facility - they can help you out with getting in touch with helpful resources. If your county has one, look into a ""Meals on Wheels"" type program, also, if you have trouble driving, there are often ride programs for the disabled. Trust me, I know how hard it is to set aside pride and ask for help, but the more you try to do by yourself and the more you have the festering feelings of guilt, the more your health suffers.

But yeah, definitely seek out a social worker if you haven't already been assigned one - often, once you get started the whole disability SSI + state process, they will assign you one, but sometimes it isn't 100% clear who they are. Also, Social Security has a work program to help people on disability get jobs (like part-time stuff) while still receiving disability checks - I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head, but it's probably on their site.

Good luck, I understand the situation you're in and can attest that it sucks and it is VERY difficult to go from a fully-functional, self-sufficient adult to a dialysis-exhausted, weak, disabled person who has to rely on others. There's this massive emotionally draining aspect to the whole thing and it's very easy to slip into depression...so get help now, don't be ashamed to ask for it. Trust that your SO loves you and wants to do everything he can - don't reject him, show him gratitude."
"You dated someone that is the same age as a high school senior for a year, when you were in your 30's. Sorry but that is going to make you look bad, especially if you work together. In your post you don't seem to see anything wrong with dating someone 12 years your junior so maybe that's part of the issue too, and your friends see it as strange that you keep justifying the relationship.

"
"Your examples don't really make sense, if you think about it. Not wanting to do the dishes is really different from not wanting to do something sexual. 

Adults have to do dishes, period. I don't have any sympathy for complaints about having to do dishes because nobody wants to do the dishes after working all day, but we all have to do it. It's a chore, and keeping up with household and yard chores is an adult obligation. You see how this is different from sex, of course. Getting out of bed early sometimes is just part of being an adult. Trying to be sexual when your body is screaming at you not to is not. I don't think you are really thinking through what her body likely feels like right now, with the plummeting estrogen, the libido-suppressing effects of prolactin, the reduced testosterone, etc. You are comparing her situation to just normal shit that you don't feel like doing (or doing her a favor like watching a tv show you don't enjoy) but it's apples and oranges. She isn't denying you sexual intimacy to be selfish. This is what has happened as a result of her feeding your child, and it's really common. You need to give her time. "
Just don't end it to make him happy.
Yep - sounds like a hostile work environment.
"Dude...

Step one: grow backbone and stop worrying about what your ex thinks/does. She sounded jealous and unreasonable anyways (asking you to choose between her and a platonic friend). 

Step two: change study groups and even classes if it's possible. No need to work with someone who makes you uncomfortable if you don't have to. 

Step three: ignore the new guy completely. Is he really ""rubbing it in your face"" or are you just around them too much so you are always reminded of the break-up?

Step four: you need to regain some confidence! SHE CHOOSE TO DATE YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE! It's not like you're some loser who can't get a date. You will be able to find another girl.

Step five: MOVE ON. Want to know how to really get back at them for rubbing it in? Find someone new and be happy with them. Sure you're low right now after a break-up, but once you get back into the game you will quickly forget all about her. Remember, she picked you in the first place, not him. She only got with him after you. 

Step six: Actually move on. Don't stay hung up on this. "
"Maybe this means I'm a hot mess too, but honestly this does not seem that crazy to me. I think you kind of get a day or two to be a disaster  when your long term partner drops a breakup bomb on you. If you're still going full melt down days/weeks later, ok you should probably get a grip and apologize, but immediately after I think you should cut yourself some slack. Clearly you have some self awareness and a sense of humor about your reaction, so I'm guessing you're genuinely not a psycho normally and the people around you know that and they will give you a pass on this. I really don't think you have anything to apologize for. I'd just let it go and since you run with the same crowd I'm sure you'll organically run into him, and if you still feel the need you can always bring up a casual  ""sorry for the melt down"" then. "
"Like removing him from my phone and stuff, being civil if we meet by accident, and not chasing him for anything or for any reason."
"Do you think he would want to date you or even continue being your friend if he read this post? If he knew you thought was a mediocre ""5"" that might bore you? That you're only attracted to him ""in theory"" and don't even know if you want to have sex with him? That you know you could ""do better""?

Like, he already said he didn't want an open relationship (probably because it sounds like 'I want to fuck other dudes because I'm not into you that way') but you're hoping he'll be more receptive now that he's been rejected by other guys? 

I honestly feel bad for him reading this."
"PLEASE CLARIFY

When you say fucked, you mean drunk right?"
"I think if you have no further intentions of ever seeing her the more honest and even humane thing to do is to not text anything IMO.

That way there is no raising of expectations or any igniting of any false hope.
"
"The only red flags here are your out of control insecurity and jealousy driven desire to control.

&gt; Also is it possible to have female co workers that are some what attractive that you have no interest in?

I don’t know how an adult woman can ask this."
"&gt;She questioned why SHE was having to pay double electricity (when that’s not what we said)

She knows he won't pay, so she'll have to pay his share, and it's easier to blame you all for being completely reasonable than blame the guy she took back after a violent blowout for predictably being a shit.

Honestly, depending on the details of that fight, a simpler solution might be to say that he's not allowed in the apartment because the rest of you don't feel safe with him there. And as others have mentioned, check the lease, because essentially adding a fourth full-time resident may expose you to all kinds of headaches."
"&gt; His side is still open as he wants to get even as he calls it

Sounds healthy. /s"
Leave fortnite out of this 
She wasn't visited by the Magical Pregnancy Fairy.
"&gt;my brothers and their wives do this

How does your mother treat your brothers' wives?  And are the wives some of the family members that don't like her?  

Honestly, it sounds really shitty for you to leave her with people that hate her while you go have fun with your brothers.  And your family liking things on Instagram doesn't make up for the shitty way they've treated her in the past.  It will take years of them being kind to her for her to believe they don't still hate her.

"A quick Google search brought up this information:

&gt;An applicant for naturalization after three years of marriage to a U.S. citizen must meet the following citizenship requirements:
Be at least 18 years old. ...
Be a permanent resident (green card holder) for at least 3 years. ...
Have been living with your U.S. citizen spouse for at least 3 years.

Either they have a bad attorney or they are not being completely honest with you.  She should already be a citizen.

I think you need to get the romantic stars out of your eyes, do some research, then tell him to contact you after he's divorced."
Throw everything else out and just focus on him getting in your face about whether he can do an activity with your kid. That alone should be enough to sever ties. 
"And if she did need to get to the hospital, would have been really helpful to have someone alert enough to notice and take her."
"Time of grief? He saw a gif without his girlfriend's face in it, made while they weren't together, and he's 27 years old. He's far past the age where this kind of reaction could be seen as normal. I get it, seeing it would have been a kick in the guts, but to be hanging onto it for this long? Nah. "
"Yes it is completely unconscionable, but that sounds about par for the course for you and your family."
"&gt; she told me to lighten up and get over myself, our mom was going to forget us all at one point. 

I think they know what’s coming down the barrel and they’re using this horrible “humor” as a coping mechanism. Normalizing it, making light of it, is just their way of avoiding the horrible reality of losing their mother well before she actually physically passes away. 

I used to work with Alzheimer’s sufferers as a volunteer and I saw this type of humor a *lot*. Their children did it, their partners did it, even the patients themselves (the ones in the earlier stages at least) would occasionally crack dark jokes about the effects of their condition. “Well now I have an excuse when I forget my wife’s birthday!” “I knew my sister was the favorite, Mom keeps calling me Katie and I’m a 30 year old man!” Etc. etc... 

While I *definitely* think OP’s siblings need to snap out of it and back off (OP has made it painfully clear that she sees no humor in this, understandably), I don’t think it comes from a place of “Mom’s never gonna forget *us,* we’re *special.*” I think they know what they’re up against, and are just feeling powerless. Some people will fight like hell not to feel the full impact of a loss until they absolutely have to, and I think that’s exactly what’s going on here. "
"using whataboutism to minimize the impact/tragedy of the transatlantic slave trade comes right out of the white nationalist playbook. If it looks like a racist and talks like a racist, it's probably a racist."
"Since nobody else have said it: Your wife has no right to police your body and masturbation habits. No right whatsoever (as long as it's not... idk cp and dead people and the like.)

She needs some serious counseling, jeez!"
"It sounds like this Ann is a great person and is a really good friend to you (prettiness aside, which, as you've been honest about, is not her fault). If she really is a good a person as you are making her out to be, then she would want to know that you were being ""used"" (for lack of a better term) to get to her. Tell her the truth, especially if she asks you how your guy went.  "
"This situation is wild because she never expressed discomfort and encouraged him and is going back on that, but people are allowed to have boundaries and preferences. It’s not productive to bash others for those. "
"This is what we call a red flag. Most people are a little more reserved around new friends, but you tried twice to push her to do something she didn’t want to do, even if it’s something as small as a picture, no still means no. If this is any indication of how the rest of the friendship will go, her putting a line in the sand and you crossing it, I would be very hesitant to continue the friendship if I were her. I would give her the space you said you would, asking her out or continuing communication after you said you’d give her space, is another situation where she is putting a line in the sand. Don’t cross it. "
"I had a customer at my restaurant job tell his daughter to stay in school or she’d end up like me. I said that actually, I was putting myself through school with this job. Your friends dad is a jerk."
"Yes, tell him... there's a reason why he didn't tell his mother to watch his appartment in the first place.."
"I mean, you MIGHT be her best friend.  It just might also be that she doesn't invest as much in her friendships as you do (right now or as a general rule.)  Just because your ""best friend"" level is at like an 8 on the 1-10 effort scale doesn't mean that hers isn't like a 3 or a 5.  "
"You don’t pay for PhDs unless it’s a scam program. They pay you, not a lot but usually enough to squeak by frugally."
Probably because multiple people identify the person that he’s talking at as a “victim” and regularly ask her to go wrangle her boyfriend rather than being able to just enjoy the social gathering.  Whatever he’s doing is not socially acceptable within their friend group.
"Look, clearly you came here wanting everyone to tell you how wrong the teacher is and that you were 100% in the right. You messed up and you don't want to hear anything that contradicts what you think. Why post if you're only open to hearing people stroke your ego?"
"And let’s be clear, this is abuse. This is the beginning of much much worse abuse. He’s basically testing to see how much he can get away with, how shitty can he be and what will you put up with. Leave this douche. DTMFA girl "
"He was fine. Not what I would describe as overly excited, but he did at least seem sort of happy. He was not angry or cross with me at all. "
"Do you feel like your relationship is a partnership? The way you're painting it sounds like it's out of the 1950's - he's a selfish jerk who expects you to be the good housewife and go along with whatever he wants. Is that the kind of relationship you want? You're making a lot of sacrifices, swallowing your feelings, and being the cool girl, but does that make you happy? Not all relationships are like this, this is not ""typical guy"" behavior."
"Last football season when the Cowboys played the Redskins I specifically went out of town to see my sister the week after. I thought that if I wasn't there to clean up after he and his friends he'd get so sick of the mess he'd jump in and clean it up. Well not only did he not clean up after that game, he didn't clean up after poker night on Tuesday, he didn't clean up after college games on Saturday and he didn't clean up after the NFL games on Sunday. I arrived Sunday night to beer cans literally coating our floor and empty pizza boxes and Chinese food containers. 

basically if I don't do it, he never will. "
Of course if he gets used to you always being there to pick up after him he’s going to expect you to always do it. What does he actually do to contribute to your relationship/home? 
She literally told him she did not want beer in the party. Should she have tattooed it on her forehead too so each time he looked at her he knew she did not want beer at her party? People in this thread are going out and beyond to excuse his selfish and entitled behavior? 
"Oh boy. Well, that's more complicated. What's the divorce timeline look like? B/c I suspect he will just introduce the kid to the new girlfriend at this point."
"Yeah I honestly prefer tame parties! Little bit of booze to loosen up, but still possible to have real conversations."
"I agree with you. We used to have a bunch of couples-friends and we'd always have get-togethers. The ladies would do some kind of wine tasting, while the fellas would go out to the pubs/bars. When us guys got home, the girls would be trashed, dancing to Ginuine's ""Pony"" and trying to form a human pyramid. We'd all get rowdy at that point. Someone would inevitably bust out some weed, the hostess would be passed out upstairs, and everyone would stumble home. All good intentions were out the window as soon as people got loaded. 

The OP just had unrealistic expectations, taken from movies or books.  At 28 years old she was trying to have an ""adult coming out party"" and I'm guessing not everyone was on board.  I think the husband felt a bit embarrassed (maybe he heard whispers or comments from others in attendance) and decided to cannonball the whole thing and try and ""save the night"" - from his perspective.  The OP is certainly within her right to be a bit miffed. But crushed? I think the expectations were off, unfortunately. 

5+ years sober here BTW!"
"No, sorry, we don't need to lump perimenopause with this woman's mental illness and addictive behavior. It has enough of a stigma as it is and vilifies older women in this society. Besides, young women and men can also have similar issues, and they don't go through menopause. "
"What was your plan to pay off that massive debt of yours and live on your own had you not married?

Does your husband feel like he’s being financially used by you?"
"&gt; However I do not feel comfortable doing that. I wouldn't want to ruin his career in the military.

But it's okay for him to irrevocably change YOUR life without your consent? This is not a man his fellow military people want to back them up or lead them, trust me. He's completely unreliable and untrustworthy--which isn't exactly what you're looking for in a soldier when shit goes down."
"I'm seriously applauding for you.

You did a great job at sticking up for yourself asgainst that girl.  She was completely out of line.

My advice:  Go to the professor, right away.  Tell them what happened.  Say that you don't have a problem working with Other Girl but that you'd be willing to move to another group if the professor thinks it would be best to do so.  DO NOT apologize for standing up for yourself.  "
"I was trying to be cute and ""formal."" I thought he might be impressed with how hard I worked on all the little details even down to invitations. "
"You’re completely right. 

Mostly everyone agrees that I should end it as well, and I’m also leaning towards that too. But I also don’t want to end it without talking to him about it. 

Thanks for that first paragraph, I really shouldn’t try to be more mature than I really am. Especially not just to please an older guy. 
"
"Athlete’s foot. I’m fighting it right now, and the recommendation is anti fungal spray to the foot, dry feet, don’t walk around without socks, and anti fungal powder in the shoe. It takes weeks, if not months to destroy completely. Also, the shower/bath area should be bleached weekly to prevent the fungus from infecting anyone else using the space. It’s also very important to not touch the jock area with a towel or wash cloth that has been used on the feet. 

I agree that it’s very likely he’s embarrassed and doesn’t know what to do about it. It took me an embarrassing amount of time to figure out why my feet itched/smelled. Try to have a direct, rational conversation with him about it, and mention seeing a dermatologist for help. It’s very, very common, and very, very treatable, if it is athlete’s foot, or, god forbid, even if it’s jungle rot.

"They're providing reasoning for the victim staying, not the abuser."
This. I can love someone and decide not to commit to them because they do not have their shit together ...
"Just show it to your parents. They'll love being called ""fat cow"" and ""beer belly"".

"I'm really not surprised that a man fifteen years your senior has gone out of his way to make you feel like shit for having led a normal life. What he said was designed to hurt you. And now your feel like you have to console him over it? Hah. Bullshit. He's a grown ass man, well past the point of maturity.

If he's so immature that he has to try to make you feel like shit like this, then trust me, it's only going to get worse. Next he'll love bomb you, apologise, and make you feel great. Then he'll weaponize something else about you until you're apologising for being a person. 

I'm not going to tell you to break up, although that treatment is plenty reason to. I am, however going to give you this advice: do not apologise for existing. Do not feel bad for having a past. You are not responsible for his feelings or actions. You always deserve respect. He doesn't get to disrespect you just because he can't handle his feelings.

This is unbecoming of a grown, mature man in his forties. Then again, if he was really as mature as someone his age should be, he'd probably not be interested in someone fifteen years his junior. Be cautious. Demand respect. "
"He's gone at you so much that you feel worthless as a person despite all that you're doing. No one should do that to you, especially someone who is supposed to love and care for you. You deserve so much better."
"&gt; When I first started the class I was given no instructions, the teacher just greeted me and told me where to sit. 

You are struggling with keeping your story straight. "
"Seems like he was pressured considering you guys even went to counseling and now he is regretting it and taking it out on you. I'M NOT saying how he is acting is right but I can see it from his side. I would suggest seeing a counselor again before even thinking about a divorce so you don't have to take care of a 7 year old and two babies by yourself and also because he has ""never acted this way before"" in the 9 years you guys have been married."
Then follow the advice to get the videos taken down. But definitely tell your parents first. 
"Hey, I love knitting too and had considered it and a couple of other endeavors from a home business standpoint.  You are right in that the perceived value of handcrafted objects does not tend to reflect their proper value, especially once labour and materials costs are factored in.  But, there are reasons to still do this, if it is right for you.  With my home business, it was a way to fund my hobby.  My goal, therefore, was to break even because the profit-per-item wasn't sufficient to be a viable business.  I could still keep doing my hobby without it being so financially draining.  But, I still kept my day job for actual living expenses.  The second reason why I had a home business was because I could write off certain expenses on my taxes.  A portion of my rent, utilities, etc. could be deducted because I needed space to work and to store inventory.  I had to keep careful records in accordance with the tax law in my area, but it helped out with being in a high-cost-of-living area.  That might be something to consider when you are living on your own some day.  But, in the meantime, enjoy knitting and all of the other handy crafts you are bound to pick up.  "

Hopefully this helps. I'm sorry about everything going on with your family, but things will all eventually work out. It'll just take time. Good luck!! :)"
I might even suggest that she's projecting... 
"Ok I feel like I’m not seeing something that the other commenters are seeing. 

&gt; it's just one of those situations where no one is really a bad person. 

Assuming that OP’s relationship with her boyfriend is monogamous, she is cheating on him (by the vast majority of people’s standards). That absolutely makes her a bad person in this situation. She’s also lying by omission which also makes her a bad person in this situation.

Am I misreading something? Because as far as I can tell OP is cheating on her boyfriend with multiple people and none of the other commenters seem to mention it."
If she says about waifu and then d&amp;d my money is on dungeons and dragons 100%. waifu is a nerd term so wouldn't make sense to use a nerd term and then a nerd term that some people use for dinner and drinks or whatever.

My ex husband has a demanding job and he was routinely an hour to three hours home later than what he told me. I didn’t bat an eye."
Call the cops. She's endangering everyone if she's driving drunk.
"I had a job that did this actually.  Years of experience would place you in salary ranges.  So if you have less than say 5 years experience, but are doing the work of someone with much more seniority than you, your manager still wasn't allowed to pay you more or promote you.

I fucking quit that job though, lol.  "

"I mean, the fact of the matter is, this is what happens when people get into new relationships. You're going to have to accept that this is part of life. Wait till you're older and there's spouses and kids and careers involved. You're going to have to be really self sufficient and realize that these decisions aren't made against you - people have to live their lives. 

You are totally welcome to talk to her about it. Don't pass judgment on her relationship - you are her friend right? Support her and be happy for her. Let her know you miss her and want to hang out more. But you have to respect that she's in the middle of the funnest part of either new penis or new love or both. 

Lean on other friends. "
"Your husband has already checked out of the marriage. If he doesn't *want* to salvage the marriage, there is not much to be done. If he's not willing to talk about issues or what drove him to cheat, then thee is no repairing that can be done. Ideally you would both be willing to talk about this openly and figure out how to move forward to heal your marriage, likely in counseling together, but it's pretty clear he's unwilling to do that. It seems your husband has backed you into a corner where divorce is the only way out."

"Stop supporting him through his breakdowns. You can't afford the mental energy. It doesn't sound like you get a lot in return, either. And I would let go of the dream of him suddenly becoming supportive - if it happens, that's a lovely surprise, but don't count on it.

"Normally I would say she’s disrespectful, but it sounds heartbreaking to have to deal with your partner having constant suicidal thoughts and she probably doesn’t feel good enough since it seems to happen fairly often. You both need to be selfish and work on your own happiness. "
He's showing you what his priorities are... And you aren't at the top of the list.  His sport is and you are second to that.
"Standing up for yourself is never, EVER “mean”. Women are brought up and have historically been taught that standing up for themselves or establishing boundaries is “mean”, and that it’s an undesirable quality for women to have. This makes sense really, if you’re going to oppress a group of people for a long ass time that’s the way you train them into submission.

But it’s 2018, and we’re healing from that now. Boundaries aren’t mean, saying no isn’t mean, having your own life and standing up for yourself isn’t mean. Any man who thinks it is is not someone you ever want to be involved in.

Please start reprogramming yourself to stop thinking like that now at an early age. I have female family members who held this ideology their entire lives and ended up in miserable, abusive relationships. One is divorced and the other is in a toxic codependent relationship in which they both hate each other and he abuses the hell out of her. The one family member who *didn’t* fall victim to this mentality, who has always been assertive and has stood up for herself is in a healthy relationship with a great guy who respects the hell out of her. 

Sorry if that’s a personal ramble, but I’ve personally seen this mentality destroy lives. We’ve got to kill this attitude. It causes nothing but trouble. "
"And not in the ""I'm a victim of this guy too"" tone like some ppl are suggesting. It was a stupid move when her inhibitions were low. She already felt shitty, now given the context she is horrified. She just needs to give a bare outline of events, sincerely apologize, and find out how or if she can support her friend, even if that looks like stepping way back while others give more active support."

"The biggest stumbling block is that you'll need your parents to continue to fill out FAFSA every single year in order to get financial aid.

Could you talk to one of your local religious leaders and ask them to facilitate a conversation with your parents?  Explain that you're trying to pursue a great education to be able to better yourself, contribute to your family and help your communicate.  Promise to attend religious services every week, if you need to.  (Anyone can do what's necessary to look devout for a few years, right?)"
What if you got ahold of the box of condoms to prove they had been altered? 
Who put the effort into the stuff you're trying to sell though? Who has to clean up the mess? Does he destroy the things you worked on while conveniently leaving his stuff intact? 
"From what I understand, kids are very intuitive and will pick up on underlying tensions. Notice how you started off describing your marriage as not bad, but not good either? At their ages I'm sure they notice. It sucks growing up in a house where there's that underlying, unaddressed feeling.

Either way, it sounds like you guys aren't horrible to each other or anything but you have a very sad and despondent vibe OP. It's heartbreaking to read and I imagine it's even worse to live through. You only have the one life that you're spending with this unappreciative guy.."

"So... the chair originally belonged to A' s family.  You are the ex-friend who is now pregnant with her ex (whom she miscarried with (and you drastically de-emphasize how much a miscarriage can psychologically fuck a person up).  You are successfully fulfilling the dream she had for herself... with her family heirloom.  

Yes, your husband was hurt by the miscarriage too.  I think that's why he understands and wants to give her the chair.

You are not at all in the right here, and need to do your best to calm down.  And remember that this girl was one your friend, which I find really hard to believe with your description of your own behavior.

"I know exactly what you’re saying. People in this thread are going insane and taking your words wrongly. The set up you had with your friends is not weird and it’s great you have people so close to you who are trying to look out for you. Obviously you have learning to do in terms of what is normal in a relationship but it seems that since you’re in therapy you’ve already recognized that and are making moves to help. Your boyfriend is being a little sensitive about this, and I think if you explain everything about your past to him he’d possibly understand your POV better and why you wanted to do this in the first place. Give it time. 

Moreover, it’s not weird to go to your friends about fights or discussions that have you feeling uncomfortable or unsure. There are people in this world who will try to manipulate you, and it’s good to have a trusted outside opinion to tell you if your gut is right or wrong. However, every fight or disagreement doesn’t need to be shared with friends. And if you explain to your boyfriend that you respect his privacy in this relationship and don’t talk about your conversations unless in the situation I stated before, he should be understanding. People vent in relationships, and they talk to their friends. It’s not normal to not be allowed to discuss your relationship. I mean hell, this whole sub is literally dedicated to that. "

"As someone who was pretty successful on Tinder, my number one tip is to ask people out early.

"Consult with an IVF specialist and see if it's possible to detect his specific disease before implanting the embryo into you and whether it's financially possible for you to go that route. Then have a discussion with your husband about max number of tries you're willing to go through the treatment, and also what you guys plan on doing if you can't finish the first cycle. Also see if your insurance covers IVF/if you need a preapproval from the insurance company.

Also find out if that's something that can be detected in the fetus if you do get pregnant and whether either of you would be open to abortion if it's something that can be detected in the 20w scan, or even sooner."
"&gt;I don't blame your group. If I was in your group, I would want you out.

Yeah reading the last post, I was on her side. Now she sounds insufferable and would not want to work with her.  Hanging out with a friend does not give you the power to demand when your group meets up."
"&gt; It sounds like you're bothered that she sees you in the fantasy as being seduced - maybe she sees you as being quite straight, so you'd need to be seduced (ie. this is no reflection on your masculinity).

I think this is right. She's playing with a few different erotic tropes at the same time. Lots of women like the idea of men having sex as part of their erotica, and a very common trope in gay porn/erotica is the reluctant straight guy who is seduced. It's the idea of someone being so turned on that they open their sexual boundaries that makes it hot. She may have fixated on OP's friend because it lends plausible emotion to the scenario. She might even imagine a situation where this sexual tension has existed for years and finally explodes. And, of course, some women, like some men, find the idea of their partner being with other people (with or without permission) kind of hot.

So I guess I see it as a lot less creepy than other people do. It probably just a fantasy, so I'd let it remain her secret if it were me."

Edit HA! She works at that bar AND is underaged to drink. What an idiot. Hells yes get the bar involved when you file the police report. Homegirl needs to get some grown up lessons."
"&gt;  What other normally discussed details haven't you talked about in your relationship? 

This is the other thing I can''t stop thinking about. Like what else will he just not tell me if I never bring it up or know about it?"
"Well she says she has had interactions with him that are based in him being old enough for certain kinds of pop culture and he never let on. Which, yeah, seems odd on his end. I'm betting she's made plenty of other comments. He didn't try to minimise his birthday out of nowhere."
I've never seen someone get called out for being immature and childish...then go on to unequivocally prove that person right.  OP is blaming you for her breaking up with her SO because you called her childish...wow...
"The issue is that most of those instances deal with power dynamics that make for an unstable relationship. It's not necessarily the age difference that's bad, it's the power inequality. It would also be creepy if an older person, regardless of sex, purposefully went after a younger partner *because of their lesser age*. It's creepy for a 30 year old to be looking for 21 year olds to play with and date, it's not so weird if you meet each other though work, with mutual interests, at similar life stages, and discover it later. 

I agree her thought process regarding what others might think is on par with what many would imagine, but given the lack of a power dynamic (heck, his professional position is above hers, and he's already got a house and a car), it doesn't seem to be an issue. 

That all considered, OP is near hysterical and the boyfriend probably deserves better :("

"Aw I love you lol this is great advice for everyone. I'm 36, starting to get wrinkles, lots of greys popping up, I'm noticing weight sticks to me way easier than it used to, and my husband of 10 years still finds me attractive. I've been really annoyed with him lately about normal married people stuff, but I suddenly feel more appreciative of him. Thanks 💛"
You can’t fix him though. Not if he doesn’t want him. It has to be his choice. 
"I work in animal welfare, so I'll offer my perspective. Those animals need to leave that home, especially if he is unable to keep up on the necessary cleaning. Have you ever watched Hoarders? It's a mental illness that requires professional help. He probably thinks he's saving these cats and they would be euthanized in a shelter without him. But being in a shelter with standards of care and the possibility of finding a loving capable home outweighs the risk IMO. What if there is a fire, does he have a plan besides opening all the doors and windows? There's really no way of knowing what would cause your husband to realize the severity of this situation. I've met animal hoarders who believe what they believe, even after a fire or a death in the family or any number of stressful events. They literally cannot see the harm they are causing to themselves, the animals and their families.

"In the ideal situation you would assess what's best for the child as well as you and your relationship, unfortunately you don't really have the time frame for that.


 I would advise you to talk to the cousin, at least to get an indication of how they're standing in this situation as well as their capabilities (finances for schools, health care etc.). Based upon that you could assess what can be done. Also something that's important, are you ready and capable of taking care of a child? (Regardless of that being alone or not)"
"You are engaged, which means that at some point, you are going to be part of this family, and so will your son. There is a saying, when you marry someone, you marry their family, too. That's as true for your fiance as it is for you- he marries you, your son comes as a package deal. So at what point is he going to start thinking of both of you as his family and advocate for both of your needs with the rest of the family? At some point, sooner rather than later, he needs to put his foot down and say that if his fiancee and step son can't come, then he can't come, either. His family needs to learn to plan around you guys."

"Well, idk what to tell you. She is not a blow up doll or toy. It would be distressing to me if I couldn't experience intimacy with my partner without the expectation being sex every time. A lot of women need to be comfortable and feel intimate with someone before getting sexual. 

Also, TMI but does taking care of the physical needs yourself not do it for you. If you are so jumped up you can't enjoy a hug or sitting together and cuddling, that sounds like a real issue. I get being horny, but you have to respectful of your partner's autonomy. 

So she has communicated sex feels like a chore, she has expressed to you attempts at intimacy that you rebuff as you are too horny to enjoy intimacy without getting off. This feels like both parties are hurt, and both want the other to acknowledge their pain first and apologize before making any attempt to fix the problem. 

Have you written down what exactly is it that you want from her? Maybe you both can write a list of the perfect ideal you have for what your relationship should be like. This might let you both see if you are both wanting the same things from each other, and the relationship is worth fighting for, or you both want the opposite type of relationship and it is better to separate. 

Seeing a therapist, at least for yourself, can help a lot. I would advise seeking therapy for you if she refused couples counseling. It generally helps someone go through hard situations like this and enforce health boundaries.

If your wife  really is the most important person in your life, you will have to act like every single day.   You'll wake up each morning and think about what one act you will do that day to translate your love into her love language(s)  (Google it) and every night before you go to sleep, you'll count the ways that she and your children enrich your life.

If my friend is all about it I'll still critique them but I'll be more mild and mindful and they can take what I say and feel comfortable that the decision they make is the right one because they were able to justify any issues. If I think they are dead wrong I'll do a real thing and tell them how I feel but always finish with ""if you love it though, confidence is THE NUMBER ONE THING SO FUCKING WEAR IT.

"&gt; For whatever reason, weddings bring out the absolute worst in people. 

I think this might be because weddings are absolutely ridiculous now. I went to one a few years ago and felt so bad for the maid of honor. The bride pinterested the shit out of this thing. And her wedding is becoming more and more the norm. Days long bachelorette parties, ridiculous get togethers with matching accessories, robes, etc. Tons of pictures of everyone looking happy. The maid of honor from that wedding I was talking about just got married a week ago in Costa Rica, family only. Super simple. I have seen her in so many of these events as a bridesmaid. You can tell she was totally over it. 

Asking someone to be maid of honor and then expecting tons of planning for endless celebrations is really not a favor or honor at all. "

The solution is dump this man, from a safe distance, before he assaults you again."
I disagree I honestly think you are reaching if you get offended by someone making a joke about a viking chaining people up on a boot. I can see how people think its sexist I personally don't but I can see where people got the idea. In my opinion thinking the joke is racist is just looking for something to get offended about.
"Okay, well I’ll reiterate the point. Trying to convince her of that is a) actually really toxic of you (to use your term), and b) not the right way to go about this.

This isn’t a joint decision. You can just break up with her. It may be for the best for her anyways, it sounds like she needs to completely move on from “you as her crutch” so she can deal with her issues solo and grow as a person. But who knows, i don’t have a lot of info here.

Lastly. The whole outward attitude of “heh, I’m a fucked up person anyway tho” will not serve you well in life. Promise. Counseling is a good idea, coming to terms with your positive attributes as well as your negative, figuring out what you want to improve and working toward it, being positive in day to day life rather than negative — these will all help you lower the amount of cognitive dissonance in everyday life, and bring you closer to a person whose actions you feel comfortable with and proud of. My two cents."
"No not making excuses but I was just trying to show that was my initial thought process when I first got his text.

"Because he still thinks there's a chance, but in case you never do decide to fuck him he wants to make sure you're constantly punished for it.  I'm sorry OP, I know I'm bumming you out but it's always better to know the reality of a situation."

"&gt;Relationships should be about freedom

Uh, what? Relationships are not about freedom. Being single is about freedom. You serious? What planet do you live on?

Relationships are about commitment, team work, communication and partnership. They absolutely are not supposed to just be about freedom. You both come together to work towards common interests.

&gt;I have lost many friendships because of jealous girlfriends

No, you had to sacrifice friendships because your girlfriend had boundaries. Reasonable boundaries. Although I'm not surprised you think this is pure jealousy when in your words ""relationships are about freedom""

&gt;Since his girlfriend doesn’t even know who his friend is, this is unfair

Well, seeing that going on a weekend solo trip with someone you used to hook up with is something that would make a lot of people uncomfortable, it's absolutely no surprise he wants to get out in front of it. He is *aware this could be an issue* and wants to prevent it from happening.

You have been in pain for 20+ years, which I am sure is awful and sucks and pisses you off. Understandably. But you need to realize those people at your breakfast table can’t fix you. They can’t sit and listen to your complaint every day and snap their fingers and fix you. When I feel like shit, I vent once, and then move on. Ask the others how they’re doing. Ask the others what they’re up to this week. If they have seen this new move. Read this new book. You can’t listen to someone drone on and on over and over about a problem that you can’t fix. Otherwise you feel helpless and frustrated that you can’t fix the person. You need to save the complaints for the doctors, I recommend getting a therapist. Have an hour weekly where it’s completely dedicated to you talking about yourself with someone that cares to listen and help you formulate plans of actions. It helps, trust me. "

Maybe OP is good with indefinitely sitting out of ski trips, beach days, hikes, or whatever physical activities his friends might want to do as a group, but this doesn't seem like the case based on the OP.

"Please get a grip on your paranoia lest it become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Stop prioritizing the apparent actions of anonymous women over the real &amp; faithful love your fiancee has demonstrated to you.

And I understand you worked hard to build your business. But by asking for a prenup now, you're not only insinuating your fiancee is untrustworthy, you're also implying any income from your business should be yours alone after marriage. So can you understand how hypocritical it sounds to imply *I love you enough to be my life partner/keep my house/have sex with/birth my child...but I don't trust you enough to share my money*? And all based on the sexist notion that she's inherently untrustworthy because ""women in society"" are essentially untrustworthy? Put another way, would you like it if your fiancee painted you with the same broad sexist brushstrokes?

There's a time and place for prenups. If there's a huge disparity between two people's incomes, it makes sense, or if it's a sugar daddy/golddigger type 'marriage'. But bringing this subject up less than two months before your wedding (and when your future wife is already carrying your child)? And you've been together for 12 years already?! That's pretty tone deaf (to put it nicely).

EDIT: You also mentioned in the comments you didn't expect to live this long. If you have a serious health problem, I'm very sorry. But this makes getting a prenup now even more nonsensical if you don't expect to live a long time to enjoy all that extra money after your hypothetical divorce."

Focus on your perspective “how i feel” “what i saw...” “how i interpreted this...” and avoid “you did” “you said..” blame sounding stuff. 

Its not easy, but communicating about it is important.

Ex. My bf was trying to show me something on his phone, accidentally showed me some of his porn. It bothered me because I am not like those chicks. We talked about it. "
"yes, look after yourself for real."
"I was worried I come in here and see a lot of people really ripping into the friends. I'm pretty sure that I would have, and all my friends would have, and did, rip on each other for this sort of thing at that age.

It's just kind of the age appropriate feeling out of things. If that's your group dynamic already. 

I'm glad to see people just saying they're being immature doofuses over ""drop them, they're toxic."""
"Probably because she can't confirm if you plugged it in ""right"" or not.  Now you and I both know that you plugged it in the right way, but she may have a safe routine during plugging that she does every time. "

"Yeah, but since we don’t actually know how much it is the conversation is always hypothetical. I always say I’d invest, then he’s like “but if you had to do something *fun* what would you do?” and I say boring things like buy a good pair of jeans. "
"&gt;**I have a nasty habit of coping with loss by ignoring it and pretending it doesn’t matter** until it explodes in a flurry of emotion at the worst times.

I mean, that's totally your prerogative to be that way. Your husband should probably know this about you, or at least realise that while you're entitled to your feelings about *your own* father, *he* needs to be tactful and supportive."
You should schedule a few therapy appointments. This is going to be a complex time and you should set yourself up with the skills to deal with it healthily.
Are you absolutely positive it's not a medical issue? 
"&gt; a middle-aged woman causing a fit over a cold does not justify either person's behaviour 


She's 28! Not even close to middle-aged!"
"&gt; But if I start working part-time jobs to escape (what I call ""the hot pan""), chances are I am just jumping straight into the aggressor (""the fire"", the root culprit). 

Doing a job in a field that your enjoy and are good at does not feel like ""the aggressor"". What were you studying for 6 years?

Your daily schedule is not helping with your physical or mental health.

"This doesn't seem to be about just your sister, but the fact that your girlfriend feels neglected.  How often do you spend time with her? Do you live with her? Do you take her on dates? 

Maybe this relationship is too far gone but I can see this being an issue again in the future if you don't make a conscious effort to make your significant other feel valued.

I say this as a sister who's brother is her best friend. We text every day and see each other almost every week. I love that guy more than I can say, he's a part of who I am too, I understand well when you say that.  But I make an effort to show my boyfriend how important he is to me often, and a few times a month we just spend all day together phones off. 

On the other side of things, I'm actually not the fondest of his girlfriend for reasons I won't go into here but I try to include her in things and listen to her because she means a lot to my brother and makes him happy. Does your girlfriend do the same? 
"
"I think this is fine and all, but you need to be careful with talking about a religion that has a ‘hell’ around children. They start to think that their choice is worship and not go to hell, or go to hell.

I’m not saying you or OP would be that careless, but children have active imaginations and in my experiences biblical stories and tales play on the imaginations and fears. 

I’m very non religious but I try to be fair. Everyone is allowed to raise their child as they want. But I don’t believe children have the self awareness or critical thinking skills to be allowed to choose to worship or not. "
"others have said it, but a 26 yo and 18 yo are in very different phases of life. even if in uni at the same time. the fact that it is legally aok isn't really what is being discussed. cheers. "
Have you ever actually been in a relationship with someone you care about?
"That's silly. My husband is a gamer and him, my daughter and I all have gaming PCs. All 3 pcs are in 3 separate deska on the living room. I guess it probably looks weird to guests coming over, but i don't care since it is MY home. I like how our computers are in the same room since we can all still be in the same room and talk to each other. Op's gf is trying way too hard to change him. "
"So this is basically word for word of what your ""mom"" posted the other day when providing details about your ""girlfriend."" I'm calling troll. Next time, be more original in your language if you're going to play two different people."
"Some online searches show UK prices for screened samples are 1,200 GBP on the higher end, with cheaper options availabe for 400-500 GBP. If you can’t afford that, you can’t afford to raise a child on your own should you switch to condoms and get accidentally pregnant."
"I mean, everybody should be in therapy. And those who are resistant to it even moreso. A person seeing sex workers starting at 16 probably has some skeletons of some kind in the closet. 

To be honest, she hasn't broken up because she wants to get past this, so would it really hurt if you went to a counselor together to talk it out? It would make her feel better about it, so, maybe it's worth it?"

"In my case, I shouldn't have expected my daughter to even remain a girl. My daughter is now my son. I love and accept my son fully, but I'll admit that was not something I was expecting. I had the mindset that no matter what happened no matter what choices she made, no matter what she became, she'd always be my little girl.  WRONG! 🤣

"
"He is being creepy af.  

This guy isn't good for your daughter and he isn't good for you, either.  Don't stick around to find out if he's a child molester.  The stakes for your daughter are too high.  "
"&gt; ""On the ice, I only think of hockey, my training, all my instincts, and when you skated away, all those instincts just took over and I acted totally impulsively. It's like I had no control and I know that's wrong. I will never act like that again. I'M SORRY.""

That's probably the dumbest thing I've read all day.  When he's practicing with his teammates, do any of them ever skate in a direction away from him?  Does he instinctively trip them up when that happens?"
"Who said she doesn't do those things for a dinner? I never wear makeup and spend most of my time in tshirts and jeans; I'd get done up for a company dinner with my SO. That's adulting 101, I highly doubt she doesn't do those things."
"I'm just 23 and couldn't hang out with a 16 y/o. It doesn't matter how they look, the level of maturity and the conversation makes it just incredibly obvious they're just teenagers barely starting to figure stuff out. It's gross that a grown ass man would date her honestly "
It would lock his Facebook so nobody could post. I honestly don't think there's a way to talk to her about this without her being extremely upset so I'm seconding the reporting option.
"yeah, literally any time a 31 something dude who just happened to hang out where teens congregated was trying to look after my depressed teenage life, he was trying to fuck me.

try again."
"Your girlfriend is cheating on you and clearly plans to continue to do so.

Save yourself the future heartache and break up with her."
"Best case scenario, he feels bad for dumping you like this and is trying to make himself feel better by being the kind, caring guy. Worst case scenario, he isn't certain the new chick is going to stick around yet, so he keeps you on the hook in case he needs a backup. Either way, what you do is wish him well and block him. You won't be able to move on as long as this continues."
"Your mums stance is bizarre. I get that it was uncommon for women of her generation to earn more than their men, and that when she was young it would have been highly unusual for a woman to be the breadwinner. But...clearly things are different now. She doesn’t have to like it but to harp on about it is very strange. Whether you can make her back off is difficult to say but you’ll just have to be firm and blunt and tell her it isn’t up for further discussion and stick to it, coming up with the same firm retort each time until she gets bored. Hopefully this doesn’t start getting your husband down too. "
