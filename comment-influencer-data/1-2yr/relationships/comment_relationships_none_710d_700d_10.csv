Holy fucking shit WHY the fuck are you with this guy? Thank god you're not married to him
"&gt; why sign if you knew they lied about the pay?

yeah, that is baffling -"
This made me spit out my drink in laughter. 
It's only been two months. Move on from this guy.
He didn't even go to the funeral to support you? I promise you that you will remember your dad without this piece of garbage to validate your memories. Would getting a journal and writing out memories of your dad be helpful do you think? 
"No dude. It doesn't matter when she made it. It's the fact she made it. 
I'm positive she wasn't thinking of you while she was fucking somebody else. She was thinking about herself. Cut your losses dude. This is not the kind of girl you want to be with. "
"&gt; Then was proposed to by her boyfriend, as my wife was walking down the aisle. 

Now this is some next level shit, WTF?"
"I don't know how you can convince her because dude you messed up. You LIED to your wife. Why didn't she know you spent a whole night with Jane until this weekend? Why haven't you told her about Jane at all? You KNOW she has two male friends, yet you didn't even mention how close you were to Jane? That's incredibly inappropriate and shady behavior. If you can convince her you didn't cheat then you seriously need to work on your communication with her. You're going to have to distance yourself from Jane either way."
"wait...since when did going out one night a week with a max of 3 drinks equate to being a ""barfly""......

"
"What's normal is that there is no fear. Of course there are disagreements and sometimes we yell or get a bit frustrated with each other (not every day, maybe like once or twice a month) but at no point am I actually afraid of him. Nor he of me. 
If there's fear, there's a problem."
"My family had a tradition of having Christmas dinner with a very close family friend family that lived nearby and still do at my parents. (My father's family lives out of the country and mom's is Jewish, so we had Christmas at our home.) There is a family friend of my aunt's who comes to our Thanksgivings for almost twenty years now. This has made him family like enough that my parents (different city but reasonable drive) invite him to Passover every year and he almost always comes despite not being Jewish. I personally had a very close friend who had no good family (as in severely abusive or just abandoned them) and I asked my parents if we could invite them to Christmas last year and we did. I know it meant a lot to them. 

So I don't think close friends at holidays is innately wrong and I also can feel compassion for how hard it is not have a family or place to go on the holidays. The holidays are one of the worst times for depression for many people due to this. It may be difficult for you to relate due to your large and inclusive families but some people really miss and long for what we take for granted. 

That being said, I've never tried to invite one *my* friend's to one of my *husband's* family's gatherings. I think that's where this gets unfair of him. It would impact his family more so his sister like friend needs to go to yours? Wth? Has he asked your in laws if she can come to their events? Have they said no? (And maybe your issues with her are legitimate I have no idea.) 

Edit: fixed pronouns "
"&gt; but she basically refuses to address how she has wronged me 

She's not taking AA seriously if this is the case. One of their steps is apologizing to people they've fucked over with their addiction. 

You should check out Codependents Anonymous. It takes a harder stance on shitty behavior in addicts than Al Anon does, and focuses on protecting yourself rather than supporting the addict. "
"Ask what he wants.  But keep it very specific so that he can answer in yes or no answers. Don't say ""Let me know if I can do anything."" that would be too overwhelming for someone who is grieving and stressed.   

Some examples: 

""I want to support you. Would it feel better if I came over for awhile and we could do something that distracts you, or do you want me to come over and listen?"" 

 Say ""I have made some dinner. I would like to bring it over for you, if you feel up to eating. Can I do that?"" 

Or ""I can take care of your dirty dishes and tidy up your place. Is that OK?""   "
"I think you should keep living your life in Europe the way you are now. I really like what u/stillbarracuda posted about the way to navigate the conversations from now on.

However, I would like to point out that it seems like your mother has no desire to move to Europe. Is this something you have actually discussed with her, or have you only ever *informed* her that this will be happening? Perhaps this is all due to her frustration that she will soon be leaving the country she has spent her whole life in to go live in some foreign country. I imagine you were nervous when you first moved to Europe. Just imagine being brought there with no say in the matter."
He sounds like he should wear a fedora tbh. 
"Ideally, yes. But what I think is, that if OP says ""Hey hon, you need therapy"" it wont sound good. If they go to couples therapy first, it seems less confrontational and less blaming - more 'we are both responsible for this issue'"
"Actually, yes, it would be inappropriate to ask/bring your BF. This is very clearly a “girls” event, and while not explicitly “girls-only,” it would change the entire feel of everything if a guy were there. Your boyfriend can survive a weekend without you."
[deleted]
"You're not overreacting. You saying that you have health problems as a cover for your pregnancy should be reason enough for them to respect your decision to not drink. They have no respect for you, I'd cut ties tbh"
It literally makes me think of dumb and dumber. I have never been so I high that I'm that level of stupid. 
"&gt;make sure your wife knows that no one thinks poorly of her because of the catastrophe that was your wedding. Everything reflects poorly on her sister, not her.

I really just want to emphasize this. If I was at a wedding and someone's sister was proposed to (during the ceremony of all places)I would think that person is a piece of shit. "
"Nah, ghosting isn't abandonment, if you've only had 1 or 2 dates or just messaged each other there's not really a case to call it ""abandonment"". It's rude but it's not abandonment. 

When you have an established, serious relationship, up and leaving is not ghosting, it's flat out abandonment."
"So you set a clear boundary, and then instead of honouring it, he tried to rules lawyer around it in an immature way for a bit then went back to crossing it.  Then claimed you had no right to ask him not to break it.

Even if this wasnt about something as disrespectful and unpleasant as calling you a bitch. Even if it was about something completely objectively harmless.  You ought to leave. Even then.

Given its about something actually abusive, I think its fair to assume the abuse and disrespect will escalate.

Then there's the name boundary crossing too. Again - he doesnt GIVE A SHIT what your boundary is.  He expressly says he doesnt care what you want or how you feel, he will just do it they way he likes.  This isnt boundary pushing, its fricking STOMPING.  He is testing the waters to see how easily controlled you are.

Why on earth would you put up with boundary stomping, abuse and disrespect in a 2.5 week relationship?  This has ""abusive relationship in embryonic form"" written all over it.

Run, dont walk, out of this relationship."
"My husband and I were talking to an old neighbor. He's 25 and the neighbor was a older 30s-40s woman who always had a needle sticking out of the waistband of her pants. We were sitting on the porch and while she was talking, she glanced at me, then put her hand on my husband's thigh. My husband moved immediately and I said, ""Please refrain from touching my husband"". I shut that shit down like a wife should. I have horrible social anxiety and my husband knows this so it shocked him for me to say it. But when we got inside away from the devil woman, he praised me and thought it was so cute that I came to his rescue. Lol."
"Man, I saw the original IT at mayyybe.... 6? Who knows if my parents weren't supervising me, they didn't care, or I just sneaked it one night when they were in bed. Yeah, sure -- it doesn't hold the test of time, but to my 6 year old self, that shit was TRAUMATIZING. 

My sister just saw the new one and texted me yesterday asking me if I remember how we had this clown doll that I began absolutely pitching a fit over every night, as it was in our room and I was suddenly 100% not okay with that. I still remember nightmares I had as a kid from watching IT. 

Looking at all the other posts, nearly every other person has a similar story. It happens! "
"I don't see it mentioned so here goes.  

You don't have a SIL problem.....    
You have a husband problem.    

He is willing to sacrifice his relationship and financial stability  with you to hear that she will ""consider"" mental health treatment. That sounds like her just saying whatever magic words to get more money.  

He is setting himself, and you, on fire to figuratively keep her warm and cozy.  

I can see this leading to a divorce from your husband. "
Talk to your wife. There are likely other odd behaviors making her leap to this conclusion. I would also get your daughter into therapy. And never get another dog ever.
Is anyone else disappointed that this story didn't involve a ghost?
"I'm certainly getting your point regarding her future demands. I thought she'll be content if we get the apartment but reading your reply made think, what if she doesn't."
"Of course. But since writing the above post I've realized that I'm terrified of ever having to communicate with my ex again. She is exactly the type of person who would try to convince people that I am the one who is abusive or something (as she did right after I broke up with her) if her new gf decided to tell her that I reached out to her. I don't know if telling the new gf is worth opening a can of deadly worms.

It's a...conundrum. How to weigh care for a stranger vs risk to self. I'm not sure.

Also, would this involve, like...following her through every subsequent relationship she ever has and telling her new partners about her? That just seems crazy."
"Oh yes. She will do anything she can. In fact, her logic could even be “I’m already pregnant. What more could happen?” And then next thing you know, bam. She really is pregnant."
"&gt; a good car seat

They don't even have a car."
"&gt; **And that's your opinion.** I love my friends but even if I had the option, I probably wouldn't see them every single week.

...And...that's yours?...

OP never said it was a full night of bar hopping, she said she's out long before last call, don't exaggerate for dramatic effect. You don't seem like the drinking type but 'round these parts, bars close at 2am. Getting home at 1am is hardly late unless you're in middle school. If you don't like leaving your house, that's cool. Neither do I, honestly. I work a social job and I'm an introvert so I prefer staying in. But let's be real here - the guy lives with her, has a date night every week with her, spends most days with her. She gets what? 3-4 hours a week tops without him? Because remember, he's there for the predrink. If you can't handle that, you are factually what is known as **codependent**. And that ain't an opinion, that's basic understanding of the concept. To cut back her already limited contact with friends because *you* don't like contact with friends is hardly fair. She's not out of line in any way. What you are pushing here is **isolation** from friends and that's wrong.

And again, I'm saying that as someone who can't wait to get home and unwind. I haven't been out to a bar in at least a year. But I wouldn't get pissy about a 3 hour time span when I'm not tracking my husband's movements."
"I feel very sad for your wife. 

You need to find a happy medium with porn. It doesn’t have to be all of one and none of the other. I’m a woman but I know how to moderate my porn use and also maintain a healthy sex life. And I know plenty of men who do too, including my boyfriend. "
"Wait, you guys were official, and had been together for 2 months, and he cheated on you?

This might be unpopular, but if he's willing to cheat at that stage of the relationship, then he's willing to cheat whenever. If you accept him and continue the relationship then I would not be surprised if he cheated on you again once the dust has settled. 

Whether he is the type of guy to cheat doesn't matter - he literally cheated on you. Keep that in mind and please don't mislead yourself. If the thought of him cheating on you again is too much, then you need to break up with him."
"This is, in fact, what gossipy friends are FOR"
"IMHO Not equal in cost, but equally thoughtful.

It seems he is making a huge effort to respect your desire to pay your own share of your joint expenses, and is taking advantage of his extra income to express his love in the form of gifts.

This sounds great. So many people with an income disparity would get pissy that they were being forced to live over/under their means, or about gift cost disparity. But you two dont!

You two sound just lovely! "

"After 18 months of dating, this seems too soon to me.

How have the kids reacted to each other?

Have you done any combined holidays?

"
"That sounds like some pretty tough criticism to give to a partner. Not only do you not like how she looks in what she chooses to wear, you think she chooses to wear what she does as a cop out to being more authentic like other creative friend. I don't think this is going to come across well. 

How can we reframe this issue? Can you encourage her to dress more authentically? Maybe there's an underlying self-esteem issue you could support her in addressing? Instead of saying, ""I like how that girl looks in that"" you could say ""Girl, you'd look banging  in that."""
"If she has been dressing the same since you started dating her then you always knew she dressed that way. The problem is you, not her."
"&gt;I know there's nothing wrong with him mentally; he's educated, has a good handle on his finances, knows to how fix cars, doesn't drink.

With all due respect, there is plenty wrong with your father mentally. Being a well educated, sober and financially secure mechanic doesn't grant him immunity from his crazy family members' influence. 

This has been your father's life for over half a century and he isn't going to change. You either have to accept that this is who he is and try to survive the embarrassing cringe-fest that introducing girlfriends to him brings, or reduce contact. Either way, you have to make peace with the unfortunate fact you're never going to have a normal father/son relationship with him."
[removed]
"This was my first inclination. He broke up with her because she had been too distant (he even texted her while she was on vacation, likely to shock her into rushing home, instead of waiting for her to come home so they could talk like adults). She was ""supposed to"" take the bait and throw herself 100% into her relationship with him. Instead, she realized she had outgrown the relationship (as she said she's enjoying her freedom) and didn't play along.

Ex played stupid games and has now won stupid prizes."
"Accept that there is never just one version of events. Both stories may have some validity, but to what extent is what you need determine.

&gt; She said that she went to a club with her friend

This can be easily verified. You said you trust her, why would one account of a person you admittedly describe as a ""playboy and a big misogynist"" change that without any evidence? Did he have a cell phone where he could have taken a picture? Were there any witnesses when ""he decked the guy""?

&gt; Lots of flaws, but he never lied to me.

Are you sure? Is someone only lying when they are caught, or is it still lying if he was never caught?"
"Yeah and also...if I caught the girlfriend of one of my friend's cheating, I wouldn't call him at 3AM to tell on her. I'd probably wait to see them in person. Your ""friend"" was trying to head off your girlfriend. That seems like an admission of guilt. "
"I agree with your husband. Do not lie to him.

Do not lie to your husband about this. "
"This isn't about who I right, it's about a miscommunication. Obviously you guys had a miscommunication about expectations and need to talk about it"
"Your mom is going to be a JUSTNOMIL?  Its hard for you to really impact this situation since you haven't met Katie yet. 

I think telling your mom you aren't discussing Katie is a good idea.  You don't know her so you can't really have much of an opinion.  Could you reach out to her?  Maybe skype or talk on the phone?  I'm sure she'd love to get to know someone in her boyfriend's family who is open to liking her."
"Yes! And the excuse for not going could be shitty too. ""Oh, yeah, sorry. I accidentally spilled red wine ALL over my bridesmaids dress."""
"&gt; The problem is that he only shits on my ideas when they have to do with me being under the influence of something. 

That wasn't how you described it in your OP, but ok, even with that clarification this is extremely inappropriate.

Why does he think he has the right to lecture you about what you do and don't drink? Especially since, per your comment replies below, you have never given any reason for anyone to think your use of substances is unhealthy.

Beyond that :

&gt;I just want him to get over **shaming me** for something stupid like drinking.

He is shaming you. Your partner, your SO, the person who is supposed to have your back no matter what, is intentionally and purposely shaming you. IDGAF *what* he's shaming you about, that is an immature and unacceptable tactic to use in a relationship. Especially when you've already communicated time and again that you don't like when he does that.

That speaks to a lack of respect. I would not date this person. "
"I know!  I just don't get this sentiment that a ""compromise"" involves OP 100% giving into his request (which I think is ridiculous) and no reasons why he's even requesting it.

Last time I checked that's not what compromise means!"
"&gt;Is there better reasoning than it'll cost more (which isn't true) and they'll feel bad (which also isn't true)? Like what's the angle that says oh yeah this is a bad idea? 

They fact that they will change their legal rights and responsibilities and have to go through court processes for something that can be avoided with, ""Hey, we are breaking up amicably and so are throwing a party instead for friends and family."" The only reason not to tell the truth is cowardice.

Also consider the shocking amount of lies and emotional manipulation they'll be engaging in with their family and friends. Getting married is a big deal, they may well not forgive being lied to about this.

They may not feel bad, but they should. "
"u/Tawnybog write an email to the group and use the above comment.  

I have organized a few events with my work team (~ 30 people) and this is how I usually handle it:

1. Make a Google doc with everyone's name, a column for RSVP, and a column for what they're bringing.  This way everyone can see what's being brought so you don't end up with one pan of lasagne and 16 desserts. 

2. Send an email with a link to the document and give a deadline, say 3 days before the event, by which you need to have everyone's response.  My coworkers are good about responding so I don't have to worry about this, but if you don't get feedback from people, you could give them a personal visit on the day of the deadline. 

In the email I would say something along the lines of, ""because of the frustration caused by the potluck over the last few years to the team as a whole, we will be planning this year's thanksgiving potluck a little differently."" People have option to sign up to bring something (food, drinks,  or plates/utensils/etc), donate $20 (or whatever you deem appropriate) to cover the cost of buying whatever might still be needed after everyone signs up, or not come. And use the above comment to explain why everyone is expected to pitch in. 

I would also talk to you boss and say something like, although you're happy to plan the potluck this year, if you receive the same response a previous years, you do not want to be responsible for planning any future events. Depending on the kind of relationship you have with your boss, you could also suggest that he might need to reassess the viability of having potlucks in the future.  I know how much fun they can be, but work culture has changed over the last 30 years and a lot of people aren't interested in the community potluck-type events anymore.
You could also ask if the potluck could ve moved to a Friday after work (maybe starting an hour before you usually close, if you have a generous boss) instead of completely outside of work hours. Personally, I would prefer hanging out for a couple hours after work to giving up a weekend day to spend time with my coworkers.  

Just my two cents. But good luck, however you end up handling this.  

Edit: formatting "
"Hmm I'd heavily wonder about the moral compass of anyone who wouldn't drop a note to the girl, especially if he's friends with her too."
"When your friends insulted her, what did you do? Did you just stand by and let it happen?

Your friends insulted her, and when she was justifiably upset about it, you yelled at her for assuming that the company you keep is a reflection of who you are, even though that's a perfectly reasonable assumption. You have fucked this up. You can apologize, wholeheartedly, and then shut up and wait for her to make her own decisions, but there's nothing lore you can do. "
"Two options and two options only:

Option 1: He *immediately* gets professional help from a therapist on dealing with his incredibly unhealthy and controlling behavior.

Option 2: Break up with him.


He has a *severe* problem and I would probably classify this behavior as a form of emotional abuse. You are *constantly* stressed and anxious because you're worried about setting him off. You're forced to live your life catering to his absurd insecurities. That's not remotely healthy. It's not fair to you. And it's also just wrong. And he knows it. If he won't get help right away then you need to run. This will only get worse.


EDIT: Also, this is **not** an appropriate case for couple's counseling. This is **not** a ""couple"" problem, it's not about your relationship. This is 100% on him and his behavior. The purpose of couple's counseling is to identify and fix unhealthy relationship dynamics and/or communication problems that both partners contribute to."
Totally. It’s not ok for anyone to give someone’s phone number to another person (even their mother or spouse or SO) without their express permission. OP can’t give out her friends numbers. 
"&gt;It's all boys in our family so she is the only sister. My wife has a sister though and I do not want her being offended if she thinks we named the baby after my sister and not hers (we did not!) 

Sounds like it's not a problem, just a potential problem. Just let it rest unless your SIL brings it up, then explain that it was just a coincidence and isn't named for your sister. "
"You're getting too comfortable in your friends place. Time to stop sleeping over so much and be more to the point with your appartment hunting. Because you and your date planned poorly and were an inconvenience to your friend, doesn't matter if she was there or not. She only gave you permission, not whatever else hangs on. 

If there really aren't any traces, i'd stay quiet. Either way, it's appropriate to give your friend a gift for her hospitality. Don't sleep over any time soon again, you can get an Air B'n'B or motel. "
"Why would you say your son is over sensitive? Someone hit him in the face! I'm almost half a century old and I have never ever heard of slapping someone's face as a greeting. In fact if someone did this to me I'd probably punch them.


You are severely under-reacting."
"Would she be willing to seek therapy?  There are some therapists that are willing to help, they are harder to find but they are there.

This is difficult, no-one would blame you for walking away...

If she wants to physically ""snuggle"" with the kids, I'm afraid that she's starting a grooming process with them, which could lead to inappropriate behaviour. She is also expressing problematic thoughts openly on Facebook... 
It's like an alcoholic working in a bar..."
"&gt; She is currently taking a break from college looking for a job.

And she's only 19."
"He has been honest with you, but he's not being honest with himself.  It would be one thing if he was swearing off sex or if you two had some sort of open relationship agreement.  Eventually, his lack of attraction is going to catch up to him.  He is going to see other attractive women out there and wonder what it's like having sex with them.

My real question when I read this is, why the hell can't you two just be best friends and keep all of the good parts of this relationship without forcing each other to change or overcome the ""forced"" parts?

Best friends can do all of the things you two currently do without the overlay or pressure of meeting each other's sexual needs.    "
"

It's one thing to legitimately change your mind when facing the situation for real. It's another to purposefully lie to her brother about something this important with a plan to abandon the kid if this happens.

OP doesn't want that responsibility and according to her, there are other viable options in the family. She needs to be honest with her brother, as she has been, so that he can plan accordingly. He needs to contact those people and pick the ones he thinks are best suited to raise his son and these people need to be aware of it. "
"He says, after trickle-truthing that 'maybe' he 'avoided telling her' because he didn't want 'it to cause problems'. 

Suuuure."
"Why can't you bond at home? Draw her a bath, massage her feet, read to her, put on some music, make a delicious dinner. You could actually bond with her **and** your child at the same time by just being as present as you possibly can be. Do you do that? Are you present and available for your wife and child? "
"Rational or not, a lot of people WOULD feel uncomfortable living there, which is why the price is so reduced.  You're not wrong to feel this way, but if you can get past it, you'd save some serious money. 

My dad bought a car that a guy was murdered in on a similar deal.  Back carpet was even cut out for evidence!  We had it 10+ years.  It was weird at first, but I quickly forgot about its history.  I say go for it, personally. "
"If my doctor told me any of my tests were precancerous I would be expecting comfort and support from my partner.   The monotone voice alone should have  suggested she was shattered by the potential for  cancer, but instead you told her you thought she was making it up!     I don't know what to say about this level of stupidity.  That was cruel."
"The abuse might also start if you give him too much warning that you *will* leave, OP. Cut him out of your life, quietly and quickly. "
"Yep. It's HIS family, which makes it HIS problem to be responsible for and solve (though you can still approach it as a team).

It'd be different if it was a relative of yours giving you grief, but in this case, it's definitely not your responsibility to address this alone."
"Just a garden variety asshole. No need to subject yourself to his bullshit. 

You are not being overly critical. You are not asking too much. You are allowed to be picky when dating. You are allowed to want your partner to be a nice person, who is nice to everyone. "
"I love this. I have a unisex name so get a lot of mail/email addressed to a ""Mr.""

"&gt;He's been with you three years

He knows you pretty well and has met your family so I don't see the problem there. Get ahold of your insecurity. He loves you and hasn't turned you away after learning about and meeting your family. Obviously he doesn't seem to have a problem with your family and still wants to propose. 

How... how have you never asked your significant other about their family in the span of 3y together?"

"Uh, if a five year old is considering hanging himself, you need to get those kids out of there.

Forget the kitten, though by itself it's already alarming; the fact that neither parent is attending to their kids' basic needs (no cleaning for a week?? Seriously?) is appalling. The fact the oldest is talking about hurting or killing himself is NOT a sign of good parenting by any means.

Edit: for the offended kitten lovers out there, I meant""forget the kitten"" in the sense this isn't what I would start with when going to the police to get the kids out.
The kitten should be given to a vet and ideally a new, loving family. No, I wasn't saying it should be left in the gutter to die..."
Yeah just walk right out of it with the super powerful passport she probably has...
"I think he feels like you didn't even try to see where he was coming from. He told you 7+ times and felt the kissy faces and constant texting might be him liking you, and instead of talking about what to do together or a compromise or saying something to sam, you flat out didn't believe him. Now he's right, and he's annoyed. So i think time will help, but also maybe an apology that outlines how you'll handle it in the future. "

"The only thing i can comment on, os hat regardless of Gail an her behavior, i think you should be more accepting of the idea of a “chosen family”. Having family is important to people, and not everyone gets to have that bond with blood relatives. You are perfectly within reason to object on the basis of Gail and her husbands’ personalities...but do not diminish them on the basis of not being blood relatives. You are going to get no where with that argument. "
"Hi OP, I'm a Mum and I want you to know that much of that anger comes from a place of fear. Walking in the woods at night can be very dangerous. You could have been hurt and she would never have known where to look for you. The thought of losing a child, our most precious thing in the world, is the stuff of nightmares for parents. Losing you is literally the worst thing your Mum can imagine happening EVER.

You made a bad decision and part of growing up is facing the consequences. That means not complaining about having your console taken away and respecting your Mums punishment. 

What would be best here is to understand why your Mum has punished you, apologising and waiting your punishment out to demonstrate you have learnt your lesson.

You will get to play WWE in no time! Just have some patience. "

"First of all, get rid of this idea that crying is manipulative. Are you crying to get someone to respond a certain way? If the answer is no, then you’re not being manipulative. You need to get rid of this thought because otherwise you’re just going to be stuck in a cycle of self blame and frustration. 

That being said, there are many instances where it might not be appropriate to cry - ie a conversation at work with your manager. Here are some tips that I use —

1) lie. If you’re unprepared for something and you’re crying and embarrassed by it, lie. Tell them you’re having really bad allergies and you can’t control your eyes tearing up. 

2) prepare ahead of time. Treat the conversation like a public speaking event — imagine it, rehearse it, prepare it as a speech.

"I don’t think her autism has much to do with this problem. It sounds like she has some insecurities with sex and like she doesn’t have much experience. Many women and men have insecurities with sex. Plus, sex takes practice. 

No one is great at sex when they first start out. With *any* sexual partner you have to be  willing to communicate fully what feels good/doesn’t feel good, what you like/don’t like, what you want to do/don’t want to do. 

Communicate with her don’t confront her. This would apply to **any partner**, not just someone who is slightly autistic, if you want to actually have improvements. "
"Well, there's your problem. Very few people have a vagina that feels like a clenched fist. That's what he's used to and that's why he can't cum during sex. He needs to loosen the grip and get used to cumming in more varied ways. If he's not willing to take the time to do that, you can't solve this problem."

"My husband and I aren’t big on physical gifts (we hate clutter) so we do food gifts a lot. Like picking up his favorite candy bar, or making a tray of chocolate chip cookies. Or in my case he buys me cupcakes from my favorite cupcake place or comes back with a fresh fruit salad from the store. Experience gifts work well for us too, weekend trips, concert tickets or even just a surprise picnic in the backyard."

"Assuming all happened exactly as you described, I think it was pretty obnoxious and unprofessional of him.  I know tradespeople get sick of passing acquaintances asking for freebies and favours but the proper response is to refuse, or to give a quote, not offer to help out and then spring an invoice after. He's kind of blended the boundary between friend and professional here. If he wanted to treat you like any other paying customer then he really should have given you a quote and a chance to compare prices.

I think you can't do anything now but pay and never ask him for professional advice again.

If you feel like burning the bridge you could go to whatever website reviews HVAC people in your area and leave a three star review:  'X did not give me a full and accurate quote ahead of performing the work. Then refused to return any of my calls disputing the bill'. But only do this if you don't mind losing the friendship."

* It was your girlfriend that looked through a bunch of different dudes  
* It was your girlfriend that thought to herself, ""who do I want to fuck my brains out?""  
* It was your girlfriend that got a match the next day or several days later  
* It was your girlfriend that flirted with him and _agreed to meet a stranger at his house_  
* It was your girlfriend that showered and dressed up, fully intending to open her legs  
* It was your girlfriend that kissed him  
* It was your girlfriend that sucked his dick  
* It was your girlfriend that got fucked by some other guy she doesn't even know  
* It was your girlfriend that took 6 years of trust and hard work and ruined _everything_  

The hard thing to do is to man up and cut this cheater out of your life. It's to defend your dignity and not let another human being step all over you. It's going to be rough and the most important thing for you to do is make sure you have a solid support system around you. Make sure there are people that know exactly what happened, that know what you're going through, and that will help you with the small details (like helping look for a sublet for your lease, etc).  

I promise you that you will get through this.  

As long as you do the right thing.

"As an autistic person - 

You aren't obligated to do this, but. Where with other friends you might do a slow fade, trust me that for an autistic person that would stress us the FUCK OUT. I've been in so many situations where one side is trying to send this ""we need to hang out less"" vibe and the autistic person (me or a friend) on the other side just does not get it, and worries about why that person isn't contacting them and worries about not having a straight answer.

Just talk to him, imo. Tell him your energy for one-on-one socialising is easily depleted and particularly spending time with him, that you appreciate him as a person but your relationship needs to involve taking a step back from one another."
"If she wanted to meet your family, a funeral is not the place to do it. Her mom sounds psycho.

I'm sorry your girl's mom is a loon. "
"This because attraction isn't that simple.  Movies and tv shows teach us that to be truly in love it has to be pow instant attraction and that's just not the case.  I've been in relationships where the attraction was instant and I've been in relationships where the attraction grew slowly over time.  I know which relationships were the best and most satisfying- and to be frank it wasn't the instant attraction ones.  The best was with someone who I didn't find attractive AT ALL when we first met and to this day I now compare other guys to him.  We change and grow with every relationship we have and that includes what we consider attractive.

The point is she did keep dating you so there was something there for her at that point even if it was just an underlying trust that you wouldn't be abusive.  And given what you've said about her past boyfriends she may have had to battle a heap of emotional stuff to get to the point where she could feel attraction to someone who wasn't abusive.  Depending on how bad her past boyfriends were staying with you would have been a huge step in her personal development.

If what you have now is great take the time to breath and remember that before doing anything.  Women are fascinating and complex creatures and who we find attractive to start with and who we fall in love with can be two entirely different processes.  Give her a chance to talk this out.

"As a woman who has been trying to conceive for almost three years with her husband, I think I have a bit of understanding as to why your wife is feeling like she's ""trying harder"" than you. Your comment about not being as enthusiastic really hit me - because I felt that way about my husband not being as into it as myself during our first 1.5 years of trying. I was the one constantly tracking my cycle, taking OPKs, and then informing husband of when we needed to have sex. It was exhausting. I got so angry at him around the one year mark, because like your wife I felt I was doing all the work, and he was just skipping along.  

One year of trying to conceive with no success is a scary thing for a lot of women (and men!). It automatically puts you into the ""infertile"" camp, even if your tests all come back normal. It's scary. It's heartbreaking. And sometimes not having a reason makes it even harder, because you can't pinpoint why it isn't working.  

Is it your wife that always starts the discussions? Or do you initiate them? Maybe try to bring it up at a time you have a chance to really talk about it, before she initiates it. I think it will help to show you are just as invested in this process as she is. It will take time, but if this does end up taking you some time and possible medical intervention to achieve pregnancy, constantly checking in with one another on where you're at is key. "

"You don't have to get rid of your dog. Repeat. You don't have to get rid of your dog. You do however have to make your brother a priority over your dog. He's only 9 years and has already suffered so much. You can't have him go through the same trauma you went through when you were small. You seriously cannot do that.

Have your dog be temporarily rehoused whether it's by friend, family or a place that specializes in that. Think of it as a vacation for your dog. 

And give your brother some stability bringing him home. Look into medicine he can take for his allergy or just something you can install in your home to reduce dog dandruff and fluff.

And never, ever, ever tell him you seriously considered putting your pup above him. That is some guilt your going to have to live with. "

&gt; I told him that I was really upset and are leaving his house now and he just replied with “I’m Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me.”

Seriously, the guy's a moron. "

I switched from my iPad to my laptop just to write you a proper response. I write to you as a fellow people-pleaser.

So, I was in a relationship with a guy who I thought was exactly who I wanted to end up with. The first time we had sex it was awkward because we didn't ""jive"" and I felt horrible. Afterwards he became more and more hyper-critical of me. I felt like everything was my fault and I eventually ended the relationship. But we remained ""friends"". And I still wanted to be with him. Every few months he would message me with these passive-aggressive comments, almost like he was asking things to see if I was worthy enough for him. Now looking back, I've realized that my attraction to him was less about him being ""what I wanted"" and more about me having to prove and validate myself to him. Essentially, *if he wants to be with me, then I am good enough*. This experience with him totally rocked my confidence and took me like 2 years to recover. 

The next guy I fell for after this one was similar in a way to what you described. He said, ""conversation with [me] always had to be so deep and heavy."" To say the least, it made me feel horrible. Deep, introspective conversation is one of the things I *like* about myself. You need to find someone who likes the things you like about yourself (as well as the things you don't like about yourself - it can happen, I met my fellow this summer).

This dude will never make you feel like you are good enough. He will not change. Staying with him will not make you happy. You deserve better. Focus on surrounding yourself with people who love and support you and do things you enjoy. Take care of yourself and work on loving yourself exactly as you are. If you do this, you will find someone who appreciates you for you, and he will make you wonder what you ever saw in this guy.

It's not an attempt to control her behavior; it is you establishing your healthy personal boundaries.

If she has excuses (""I was just drunk and missed you, teehee"", ""I just couldn't wait until morning to see you!"", ""Don't you want to see me/spend time with me???""), shut that shit down and reiterate that you do not care WHY she keeps waking you, you just need it to stop if she wants to continue to have a relationship with you.

"Trauma affects the body in strange ways. When reading your post, I was reminded of a story I once read in a book by a trauma specialist. I'm paraphrasing, but this is the gist :

A man was suffering from crippling pain in his arm. His doctors had tried everything and were about to start exploratory surgery. They sent him to the psychologist to rule out psychosomatic causes, just in case. 

In the course of that session, it came out that the man, who was a paramedic, was having coffee one day when he heard a car crash outside. As he approached the vehicle, he saw that the driver was a young woman, eyes glassy with shock, but otherwise unhurt. He reached inside the car to turn the engine off. This was in accordance with his training, as it makes the scene safer. As he did so, he looked at the passenger seat.

In the passenger seat was a decapitated child.

For that terrible moment, the man was caught between the human need to recoil in horror, and the professional need to turn off the vehicle. His training won out and he turned the key. But something about that conflict affected him deeply. The pain in his arm started shortly afterwards. The same arm he used to reach inside the car.

OP, your suffering is so intense that it's affecting your body. For what it's worth, I think you should move from a grief councilor to a trauma specialist. Have you been talking about how you see your husband's body everywhere you go? This is something that they can help you with. "

"He will still have to explain to everyone why he broke up with her. 

All she has to do is keep eating normally, call his bluff, and see if he walks away.   Nobody that's worth caring about will actually blame it on her.   He's trying to put the ball in her court, yes, but nobody will actually think it's her FAULT if the wedding doesn't happen. "
"You forgive your cheating boyfriend for a month-long affair and he dumps you when you get raped? Good. Riddance. 

Also, was I right to read you got ""throwing-up, blackout can't remember anything or walk"" drunk 10 minutes after you started drinking? If that's the case, you might have been drugged.

You CAN and SHOULD blame your flatmate. Freezing up is an extremely common reaction. Your ex-flatmate knew you for a long time. You were sober a lot together. He waited. He waited until you could barely move, walk, or talk to throw you on a bed and get what he wanted. It doesn't take two to tango. This is not your fault."

She may be unaware, fully, that this is so serious you are second guessing a future with her in a real way. She may think the problem lies in something else entirely. And she may write something so offbase and ridiculous that she defends so aggressively that you'll realise you'll never see eye to eye on this.

"it has everything to do with ages

You both need to grow up."
"Oh boy. Are you past me? When I was your age, I was in a relationship with a man who was, but no one felt comfortable enough to tell me so, inappropriate in every way for me to be with. 

Everyone here is coming at you pretty harshly for the age difference. They aren't trying to be mean, they're most likely outraged on your behalf and scared for you. Unfortunately this type of confrontation probably isn't going to help you, it wouldn't have helped me or made me leave him. 

I have some things I want to touch on with you, but first, I'll address your main question. One of the better ways I've found to confront someone without feeling like I'm being too confrontational is to use phrases like ""When you do X, it makes me feel Y."" 

However, he knows exactly how he made you feel, and he likes that. It makes him feel powerful when he makes you feel small. This is not healthy and it can lead somewhere dangerous. For me, it lead to visiting the middle east where his family was from, having my passport taken from me for the duration of the trip, being told I wasn't going to be allowed to come home to the US unless I did what he wanted me to do. 

It lead to me staying with him despite all of that out of fear. I didn't leave until after he tried to kill me. 

I'm not saying that Adam is going to try to kill you. I am saying that this isn't normal or healthy and it can lead to very bad places. 

The other thing that makes me worry is how long you've been with him. At the least, you were 17 and a half when this relationship started, at the most you were freshly 18. How long have you known him? How did you meet? I ask these things because I'm worried for you that he might have been grooming you for an abusive relationship. 

If you need to talk to someone who has been there, you can always message me. If it comes to it, I can help you formulate a plan to leave him and help you find resources in your area. "
"Idk, if she truely eats under maintenance and still doesn't lose weight, it's not her body. It's physically not possible to gain weight when eating under maintenance.

"And even if the guy was somehow being honest and only put the tip in, you can still get pregnant from that because of pre-come, you can still get STIs from any genital to genital contact without even penetration, and by the definition of sex the instant any penetration has occurred it qualifies as sex legally, medically, and according to the dictionary definition.

"The right thing to do would have been to apologize profusely to your folks, attempt to clean or make amends, and then follow up by being extra vigilant in the future. People make mistakes and engage in poor judgement sometimes, that's not the issue. The issue is that your fiancé is showing himself to be an immature coward who is content to run away when something goes wrong.

Your folks are right: this is a horrible trait to have in a partner. How can you trust him to stand by you when shit gets tough, if his natural response is to bail?"
"Replying to this one for visibility. OP, he *will* kill you. It's time to take your child and go."
"You need to read up on hidden bias.

We all have unconscious or automatic biases. Biases that we are completely unaware of and don't even register on a conscious level. In other words. Intellectually, I may know that being biased against black people is a bad thing, but my subconscious actions are full of negative biases against them.

A good example is automatically crossing to the other side of the street when you see a black man coming your way, or assuming that a black kid in a high end store is there to steal something. All of these things add up to very hurtful messages to the targets of these biases.

Because you have not been exposed to these sorts of things, you have these biases. Until your life experiences teach you different lessons at a subconscious level, you will have this issue. (Hence the suggestion to volunteer and really get to know people in these communities.)

Be aware, even if you have done all of this, you will still retain some hidden biases. Don't assume you will be able to get rid of them entirely. Instead, try to become conscious of them and honest with yourself about them.

The last thing to consider. It is not enough to fix yourself. You need to then learn how to protect her from the people in your life, who also act based on these hidden biases. e.g. You need to be able to intervene when your friends are disparaging where she lives."

"If I was in your situation, I would meet up with him out of curiosity. It doesn't seem like he wants to ruin your relationship with him asking you to not tell her about your communication with him. See what he has to say and what proof he has and make a decision from there.

At 6 months you really don't know someone. Sometimes it takes years for a significant other's crazy side to come out (until you're living together, engaged, married for example). If this is the truth and he's really reaching out to you to warn you then this is definitely not a relationship you want to be in.

I wouldn't tell her until you know, and even then if it's true respect his wishes and use a BS excuse because that could come back around on him.

How is she acting since you've been avoiding her? That should also tell you a bit how she is.

Edit to add: Can you Google her/look her up in thr court system and see if she was actually arrested over this incident? Just because she wasn't charged doesn't mean she wasn't arrestes after allegedly assaulting him. "
ever stop to think that maybe she was the one who stole your pills? 
"Don't get me wrong, I think she's being irrational here and paranoid for no reason, but I have to ask-- why did you spend all that time asking her if she was okay with you communicating with them like this if you'd just turn around and accuse her of sabotaging your relationship with them when she finally expressed an opinion about it??"
You don't seem to be reacting much at all.
That's heartbreakingly awful. 
"Nope. If it was a pay event, she should have said so in advance.

My guess is it cost more than she expected and has panicked. I guess if that is the case, and she made a genuine stupid error calculating, and if you all love her, y'all could have offered to chip in a bit. But then she blew that good will by DEMANDING the money, so the hell with her

"Their honest opinion is valid if it's something that directly affects the boyfriend.

"I think this is probably the best advice. Unless users have dealt with someone who has/had dementia, it is not appropriate to gauge what the best decision is going to be. There are pros and cons to each side of it. A professional who deals with dementia patients on a daily basis has likely been around someone when they have been given news like this and know how they are going to react to it. I would base my decision heavily on what the professionals that your mother is in the care of have to say."
"Stand by your partners, not your brother. But you already know that.
To the part of you that says you should suck it up because he's your brother: he didn't suck it up and came to your ceremony.

Because apparently your sexuality is more important to him than who you are as a person. Or who your partners are. 
Has your brother even meet your partners? Has he bothered getting to know all 3 of you?

I'm really sorry, but he doesn't deserve the love you ache to give him. He isn't loving you in return.

So stand by your partners. Tom even offered to stay... I bet he's as pissed as you and Bill, but he would do it for you. Tom would suck it up for you. But your brother wouldn't."

This is you doing what you want and then thinking she's unreasonable for feeling like you don't care and not accepting another apology for the same thing you discuss all the time.  Your post is replete with 'I forgots' in various forms.  Apologies only matter if you change the behavior. Other than that, it's just words.  

You aren't thinking about her unless it's convenient.   You need to figure out how to get better about this.  Every time you argue about the same issue, you chip away a little of the room she has for you in her heart.  It really doesn't matter if you think she's unreasonable or not (she's not), she's telling you what she needs and you are ignoring it.  There will be a cost to that.

"People are really good at sneaking in inappropriate comments about someone's size (or lack thereof) without actually mentioning their weight. ""Oh you don't need to do that!"" when I say I'm watching what I'm eating, so now I have to have that cupcake because everyone thinks I can afford to have it. If I'm having a bad day with disordered thoughts that day, tomorrow I'm fasting because I had 800 calories extra worth of cupcakes yesterday. 

People are also really good at hiding disordered thoughts and actions. Only one person at my job noticed that I lost an unhealthy amount of weight through fasting over a year ago, dipping down to a steady 95 lbs or even down to 92 for about a week. I would still go out to the weekly lunches and eat enormous portion sizes, but that was most of what I ate for days. I would push food like baked goods and candy on other people. Nobody noticed that I wasn't eating any myself. I would ""go out to lunch"" during that week but in reality I was sitting in my car in the park skipping lunch.

If your girlfriend is small and has been for a while, that's a part of her identity. If your girlfriend is small and doesn't eat much, that's how she stays small. If she begins to eat a lot, she won't stay small and her identity will change. That's a recipe for disordered eating, even if she doesn't have a full-blown eating disorder. "
"He's honestly being ridiculous. I would need someone who can handle me emotionally and sexually. Sex is supposed to help strengthen a relationship, so I don't see why it matters if you guys got ""addicted to it"" I don't even know what that means, that's just means a healthy sex life. There is literally nothing wrong with having sex every day or 5 times a day. Find someone who can pleasure you, life's too short to be dealing with bad sex or lack of. "
"&gt; sex might become something we get too addicted to.

That's not how it works. That's like getting addicted to food.

"That doesn't mean everything is normal.

When she actually gets tested, she'll have a lot of procedures. Extremely painful ones, to look for a variety of tests. They'll stick cameras through her cervix into her uterus. They'll load her fallopian tubes with radioactive dye and take a bunch of pictures to see if they are blocked. Exploratory laparoscopic surgery to look for endo is a possibility. She'll have a month worth of blood draws to track hormones. There's a lot of shitty upcoming stuff for her to 'look forward to'."
This should be higher. Absolutely spot on OP
"I think it's funny too. I would ground both of them, but make it clear it's not because he went to see his girl. That be reasonable to me. Deceiving and eroding your ability to trust them, especially because of their unique circumstances, is NOT acceptable. I feel it's critical to make the punishment about the deception, and that it hurts you."
"Yeah, I can easily see this continuing into a situation where he'll be able to say, ""You know what, I'm in my forties and feeling very settled and content, I'm just too old for a baby now, and I really don't think I want one..."". 

Then the OP will be 30+ with only this single relationship since the age of 19 under her belt, having never experienced a totally independent adult life on her own. At that point, having to leave and start over in her thirties after a decade+ relationship -- with the aim of finding another long-term relationship and moving toward cohabitation and eventually having children with that person -- is an extremely nerve-wracking prospect. 

OP, you need to press this issue. You're 26. You have so much time ahead of you, but you need to act NOW. After a very serious discussion, if your boyfriend is still being wishy-washy about kids, or admits to not wanting them after all, you just need to leave. "

If it were said in private between two guys I may have taken it differently.  The fact that he said it in front of you just cements for me that he meant no disrespect by it.
Call code enforcement and say you are a neighbor or an anonymous tipster.  Otherwise they will never forgive me.
"Yeah. Because it's not important, this is why you don't ask. 

And your bf never told you exactly because he was afraid of your reaction and that you would start treating him differently. WHICH IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

"/u/3543254354, please bear in mind that the counselor would only share what you said with your aunt if you said something about wanting to harm yourself or others. If you ask the counselor directly what he or she would share, they would tell you themselves. 

Your aunt wants to do an awesome job of being your caretaker, and you want to prove that you are normal and strong, not weak and broken. 

Your aunt may not believe you when you say you feel fine, even though you are a very resilient young man. 

However, the more you resist this, the more worried your aunt might get. Therefore, I recommend that you go ahead and go to the counselor, with the agreement that if you really, really dont like him or her even after giving them a fair shot, you get to ask to change to another. 

When you go, the beauty of it is, if you dont want to talk about your mother, you can talk about anything you want to! That means you can talk about normal teenage stuff, such as: 

* How to talk to kids at school about how you came to be living with your aunt. 

* In case there are rumors about your mother, true or not, how do you handle that? 

* You are assigned a group project at school and some of the kids are slackers; how do you motivate them to do their share, and at what point do you low key let the teacher know what is going on. 

* A cute person smiles at you; how do you talk to them? 

* Some jackass keeps trying to sell you drugs. How do you shut them down without having it all blow up and become a big deal? 

* Do you have any career goals? Talk about that. 

* Should you take Muay Thai or go out for football? What if you want to do an activity but you are afraid it will cost a lot? What if your aunt is afraid of you getting hurt, how do you reassure her? 

* How do you show her that you're okay and not all messed up?  

* How do you show her your appreciation for taking you in? 

* How can you negotiate with your aunt about rules and strictness? What are good ways of getting adults to trust you? 

* You got a bad grade on a test. How do you break the news to your aunt? 

* This one kid seems fun and cool and they seem like they could be a good friend, but once on a while they say mean things that they probably don't mean just to seem funny. How to you talk to them about the mean stuff while still maintaining the friendship and without seeming like a wimp? 

Middle school can be tough! So just go for a few sessions and let him or her help you adjust. *None of the other kids need to know that your seeing someone*. Furthermore, you would be amazed how many kids are also either seeing someone, would like to see someone, or need to see someone. You wiuld also be amazed at how many kids have or had crazy home situations. My best friend growing up had an older sister who was a raging hard drug addict. My friend lived in a nice suburban house and from the outside no one would imagine the crazy crap the sister and her Mafia boyfriend was putting people through. You never know about people. 

I wish you the very best. Hug your auntie, do your chores, do your best at school, get a tutor if necessary, and get involved in some fun activities. And go ahead and talk to a therapist for a few sessions. Use him or her as you see fit. "
"My mother and her best friend don’t see each other that often since my mom moved here, but they talk on the phone at least once a day.

"*I'm gonna add this- I literally just typed this for someone else here:*

&gt;This is a typical example of why most romances don't last the first term/semester of university. You are growing, he is staying the same (or reverting). You've started developing into a new person, new interests, new people, new ideas, that's the POINT of university. He hasnt. You are growing apart - fast. I'd say 90% of such relationships end at the first Thanksgiving/Christmas. It's a known phenomenon. 

You are *artificially* prolonging this relationship beyond its expiry date because you happen to live together.

Just break it off.

This made me laugh way harder than it should.
"Ugh. Weaponized emotions. Don't let them ruin your first minutes/hours/days in the hospital with your newborn daughter. If they can't agree to be there with him and be cordial, just tell them not to come, and let your mother cry about it. It's a special time for you and your husband and it would be a shame to let ANYONE interfere with that"
Yeah my parents hate my husband (only met him twice before our kid was born- 4 years into our marriage- and refused to come to our wedding cause he's not jewish).  So they did not get invited to the hospital. They got to meet my kid a month after she was born.
"This happened to us. Nine months in -
 after I had given up caffeine, alcohol, and weed and was swallowing awful prenatal vitamins every day, testing my pee to track ovulation, taking my temperature before even moving every morning, and diligently charting my cervical mucus - I asked my husband how much impact boxers vs briefs had on sperm health. 

I blew my lid when he replied he'd never bothered to Google it.

**Edit: I want to provide an update based on what happened just now.** I walked into the living room and asked my husband, ""Did you ever do that research on male fertility like I asked you to?"" He apologized sincerely, said he knew he should have done it, and was going to do so. Then he stood in the kitchen for half an hour reading an article from the University of Maryland on his phone, after which he interrupted me in the middle of cleaning to proudly recite a bunch of facts about fertility that I already knew.

I felt annoyed because 1) I had already been put on edge because I was reminded he hadn't done this research already like he said he was going to; 2) reading one article contrasts so pitifully with the hours of research I've done and mounds of studies I've read; 3) I wasn't asking him to *educate* me about fertility so that I would be the person responsible for it, I was asking him to educate himself so we could *share* responsibility; and 4) he didn't even ask whether it was okay to interrupt me (I haven't cleaned in ages and was on a roll) to ask me to think about fertility which is already on my mind every morning, night, meal, and time I go to the bathroom. 

Then when I showed my exasperation and annoyance I was feeling due to the above reasons instead of thanking him/congratulating him for having done what I asked, he got defensive... and then I felt like I had to console him and apologize for my reaction - because I really *do* appreciate him and love him and I *do* know that he wants a baby and that he *does* feel bad about not having done more research. 

I don't have a point here. My husband is a wonderful partner and I love him dearly. But this emotional labor thing is real and exhausting and makes me feel all alone in addition to feeling broken because I can't manage to have a baby. This is a team effort, but I know my husband doesn't feel broken at all."
"I hope you're right. It's gonna be painful at first, but maybe someday I'll realize it was worth it."
"He is objectifying women and literally unable to continue a conversation if an attractive woman is nearby? Ridiculous, immature, easily distracted, thoughtless, selfish, doesn't listen, disrespectful, narcissistic, rude... I can go on. He is 27 and acting like a lame 14 year old. I wouldn't want to be friends with this person let alone date them. "
"Hate to be blunt, but I think you should move on. First off you guys seem sexually incompatible. I know you're only 18 months deep, but head over to r/deadbedrooms, and you'll realize her labido will never magically increase and you'll be frustrated looking back and not realizing it.

Also she obviously doesn't love you (yet). You can't force it, it's not fair to her. You just gave her an ultimatum, and I don't know many wedding speeches that begin with ""So Greg drew a line in the sand, and and I discovered my feelings grew tenfold over a series of semi-aggressive text messages!""

So if you're not receiving love or sex, you got yourself a good ol' life partner. "
"Yeah OP really should've included that info in their post. 

The fact that she feels content seeing a long term boyfriend ""a few nights a week"" and feels that him wanting more time is ""borderline smothering"" shows that there seems to be a bigger umbrella issue of what each party is looking for in a relationship, and maybe some communication issues. It seems like bf just wants to spend more time with her and doesn't understand that OP prefers the enormous amount of space they already have. "

"Well, first of all he did AA wrong. Alcoholics cannot take breaks from going to meetings, and you gave him a few excuses for it: work, the baby, etc. It is  not understandable for him to miss a meeting just because there's a baby at home, he should have known this and insisted on going. Meetings are something he has to keep with weekly for the *rest of his life*. 

Edit to add: Alcoholics cannot have a couple beers EVER. There is no such thing as beating the disease and being able to be a normal drinker again. It will always be a progressive addiction that ruins his life as soon as he starts again. 

Secondly, if he's drinking, 100% disengage. Don't insist on him coming inside or engage in a conversation. He's already proven he's not worth talking to when he's drinking so simply refuse to. Leave him alone in the cold. Don't even listen to what he is about to say,or has said. He is drunk. Those words are meaningless. 

Thirdly, you have a tough choice to make. I would stay elsewhere until he is sober and he has enough time under his belt that makes you comfortable. On the other hand, you also have the option to leave him, you don't owe him anything at his point. You need to decide whether you are even willing to work on this problem again with him. 

Lastly, I'm sorry you're going through all this. I hope you can get yourself to an al-anon meeting too to help you sort your feelings. "
Ah come on cut the guy some slack... it could have been both!
Whatever. It seems that he should give her an ultimatum that she needs to see a psychiatrist and get therapy if she wants to be in your lives at all. 
Make her some falafel. No one can say no to falafel.
"&gt; she can just place the blame on you for pressuring her into doing it.

They're already fucked, so it's not like he's any more fucked if she later decides he pressured her into it. That's not a legal charge he has to worry about, and socially, it's certainly better than him actually being the father of her child."

Respect is a two way street. Your dad has no respect for you. If your family disowns you because you moved away from your abusive dad, then honestly, they aren't worth keeping in your life either.

"If she wanted a cat I'm happy for her that she got a cat, but it's also totally fine for you to say ""If the cat is sleeping in your bed then I won't be. I'll go home at the end of the night."" 

This is a major incompatibility.

Edit to add: someone can value your input and still not make the decision you want them to make. It's not fair of you to say that. "
"I would not go to that wedding. Obviously that will cause a bit of family drama, but there is a 90% chance that one of the two is going to do something at this event to cause *DRAMA*. Best to encourage your wife to sit this one out."
"Tell your mom that if she insists on making a big scene over this, then your brother and his wife probably won't let her see the baby as much/at all.  She's shooting herself in the foot with this one, you don't threaten a new mother like that.  "
why aren't the two girls sleeping in the same bed and the two boys in the same one? Like this won't necessarily stop the potential for abuse (same sex abuse def happens) but it's better imo
"This is way too much drama for a two month relationship, I would just break it off. If he tries to argue just tell him there's no need for him to seize the last word, you'll assume it was something clever."
It's a real talent watching the most popular show in the world.
"“I’m a fragile person”

That is what he wants you to think. But you aren’t fragile. It takes strength to recognize that you don’t want to be in a bad relationship. You already have the strength in you, so keep using it. You are not fragile."
"So she goes out of her comfort zone to be welcoming to your friends and they basically act out all the negative behaviors she was worried about.  Then you have the balls to be upset at her for not liking your asshat friends?

God damn buddy, you have no self awareness at all and no consideration for how she feels.  You are the embodiment of entitlement.  You expect her to change her life so *YOU* can have what you want.  Grow the fuck up. "
"So it's pretty common to wire a bathroom light and fan to the same ""hot"" wire so they both turn on and off with the same switch.  I think that ""ticking time bomb"" is pretty irrational and it sounds like your grandmother is getting impatient with your frequent(?) worries. Fixing a wall with patching materials (not even an electrical issue) is common and shouldn't be a concern at all.  Yet it is. 

Get in to see your therapist as soon as you can, and try not to react to ""danger"" unless you see something objectively dangerous, such as smoke or a spark or bare wires after the job is completed.

I'm a contractor and nothing you described is worrisome to me. You saw dangling wires while he was working. Well, that's the nature of fixing or installing something - you have to tear it apart first. "
"Ummm, he shit-talked cherries and then stole yours?  And there was only one cherry?  

He better have a loooooot of other good qualities because that pushes the limits of “playful teasing” closer to the “being an asshole because he can get away with it” territory."
"Ooh yeah, don't do that OP. Let her be in control of her own food. If she doesn't bring it up, act normal unless you really notice your mom forcing food on her.

By any chance is there a big weight difference between your mother (or sisters if you have any) and your gf?"
"&gt;  I'd be ok for divorce if we didn't have two young kids

You already threw that concern away. Divorce isn't just up to you. You cheated, when your husband finds out he *can* divorce you if he wants. Whether you're ok with it or not really doesn't matter. You broke the deal."
I bet this guy hasn't even read the books
"&gt; He told me that that’s just part of being a sub.

This is not a safe dom.

Honestly, more important than whether or not he thinks you are a stupid bitch, a dom who ignores any boundary at all and tells you to basically ""Suck it up. You're a sub."" is not a safe person to have sex with. 

Boundaries like, ""no naming calling"" or ""no verbal humiliation"" are not just utterly valid, they are very common boundaries. Your boyfriend is the one who doesn't understand a very, very important part of consensual sex."
"I understand it’s your treat, I just don’t know how he justifies drinking six a day. I definitely think he should see a doctor to rule out any health issues."
"I think she actually would enjoy it. Our summer vacation this year was to a cottage by the lake with no cable or wifi. So we just sat around, read some books, played board games, and it was awesome! I feel like this Canadian Christmas is exactly the same except it's 0 degrees out and snowy. I think you have a really good answer and it would be the best thing to do if my girlfriend was sane. But she is absolutely set on spending Christmas with me. She goes crazy if she is apart from me"
You missed the step where you dump Dorian into the river and distract the crocodile so everyone else makes it across safely
It's as gross as you think.
In her mind my family lied about the whole thing and that they exaggerated something she had said.
"Yes! As another survivor of an abusive relationship, all of this. I'm copying and pasting most of this from other comments I've made on posts about abusive relationships because it's definitely relevant here:

Abusers hardly ever start out showing the worst of their abusive behaviors. In fact, in the beginning they are typically sweet and romantic, tell you exactly what you want and need to hear, and pretty much sweep you off of your feet (Google ""Love Bombing""). They also often move the relationship forward very quickly, for example, by saying ""I love you"" after once a month, calling you ""soulmates"" or wanting to move in together after only a few months. They're very skilled at making the Honeymoon period feel like something out of a movie, so their victims often go along with whatever the abuser wants, because he seems like the ideal partner. Once you're trapped in the relationship, by, say, being on a lease and living together, then their true colors start to come out, and they will start to do things like alienate the victim from her friends and family and becoming very jealous and controlling (demanding that you delete male friends off of social media, to know where you are at all times and feeling entitled to go through your phone whenever he wants and interrogate you about what he finds). 

But before any of that, an abuser will test his potential victim, to see if she is likely to accept the abuse. Abusers do this by testing a small boundary, and if you allow them to cross that first boundary, they will test a bigger boundary, and so on. The people who become victims are the ones who continually allow their abuser to cross all of their boundaries, until they have no privacy, no friends, are walking on eggshells, and planning their lives around the abuser’s needs.

For example, when I met my abusive ex, I was 25 and he said that he was 23. I found out shortly after that he lied about his age and was actually 21. When I questioned him, he said that he thought I wouldn't go out with him if I had known his real age, and he liked me so much that he lied in order to get a date with me (I know, I'm an idiot but at the time it somehow seemed sweet). A little while after that, he had to travel back to where he used to live. My memory of the details is a bit fuzzy, as this was over 10 years ago, but I think he initially said that he was going to get some property he had left there or see friends, basically something innocent. While he was gone, he was acting really sketchy and secretive, and it eventually came out that he had gone back to go to court to face charges from assaulting his ex girlfriend. Of course, he spun it that she was ""psycho"" and it was all overblown and not his fault, and I believed him and stayed with him (it was my first relationship, I was young and dumb and thought I was in love). What he learned from this was that he could lie, give me some bullshit excuse, and I would accept his excuse and forgive the lie. I won't get into what boundaries he was crossing 8 years later, but suffice to say, they had significant negative consequences for me. 

He's tested your boundaries and successfully crossed them. What I mean by that is he's lied both directly and by omission, and you brushed it off as not a big deal and weren't bothered by the lies. Mark my word, he will continue to test more and bigger boundaries. There are lots of single guys out there that are very sweet and gentle, will treat you well, and don't have criminal records and drug problems (my ex also had major substance abuse issues, trust me, it's not something you want to deal with). Run from this guy and go date one of them. Whatever the circumstances behind his arrest record, it's something that you're always going to be worrying about and wondering when and if he's going to turn violent. That's a lot of stress and worry that you don't have to be, and shouldn't be, carrying around with you every day. "
"Yes. The obvious problem here is you took your wife for granted and prioritized her and your relationship last. You are now upset only because she is leaving and something you took for granted is gone. Trying to fix things now is too little, too late. It will be best for both of you if you move on. You may say you love her, but your actions say you love a lot of other things far more. "
"You know what's great for helping people get over their pride? Realising they'll be homeless if they don't. I get the desire to help them, but at the same time if you keep enabling them to kick their problems down the road rather than actually taking steps *themselves* to improve their circumstances, they'll never change anything. "
Give me a break.  OP clearly communicated the timeline.  Expectations were a adequately set.  
"Oh what the fuck ever, she called him from a bar and by all indications went along with it in every way until she overthought it.  It's not like he texts her every few months and decided to sprin a trip on her."
Stop being touchy-feely with your married ex-girlfriends.
"This is great advice. His behavior is inappropriate and if he tires to gaslight her into thinking her objections aren't valid OP should hold firm. No objective observer would think he needs to ""check on"" a teenager in her own room. "
I was concerned about the language you used where you said a sales manager job was 'too confusing for you to ever understand'. Sales jobs aren't particularly complicated and the fact that you don't think you ever *could* understand it was a self-esteem red flag to me.
"Sure, maybe contact the photographer/business about possibly doing a reshoot for a discount under the circumstances, but come on. Threatening negative online reviews if they don’t comply? What would that even look like? “My photographer’s camera was stolen at my wedding and now they won’t even do a shoot for me at a discount! Zero stars!” If anything, OP better make sure there’s nothing in the contract about being responsible for stolen property at the event. "
"&gt;He practically begged me to let him put the tip of his penis inside of me.

I don't like this OP. I don't like that a guy 7 years older than you is putting pressure on you and pulling out old lines like 'Come on, just the tip!' If you aren't ready for sex, you aren't ready for sex, and there really isn't anything wrong with that. Three months when you've never had sex before isn't an unreasonable amount of time to not be ready yet, and you shouldn't be being pressured into it by your bf.

If he can't handle waiting for you to be ready, if he can't deal with going slowly and making sure you're as comfortable as possible before having sex, then he isn't the right person for you. Remember that *you* should also be enjoying sex. Don't *just* think of you as being a 'shitty girlfriend', think about whether he's being a shitty boyfriend – are you feeling uncomfortable and upset because of the way he's approaching sex with you? 

I know it's hard, but you have every right to enforce your own boundaries. He keeps pushing you in what you're comfortable with (and hey, notice how after PIV went badly you felt guilty, so offered him a handjob? He's getting things out of pushing your boundaries), when he should *know* that any moves are in your court. He *knows* you aren't ready, you *know* he wants sex, instead of pushing your boundaries he should know that you'll initiate things when you're ready. This boundary pushing is unacceptable, and if he doesn't want to have to wait a few months (and three months in the scheme of things isn't that long), maybe he shouldn't be dating a virgin 7 years younger than him!

If this relationship ends because of this issue, it will suck (because all break ups suck), but it won't be just your fault for 'losing' him for not wanting to have sex so soon. You will be ok, and you will find someone else. "
IMO I think it's pretty controlling of her to guilt him intro eating meat. It shows a disrespect for his own wishes. There are plenty of recipes where you can modify it in a way where both people are satisfied. Plenty of restaurants to offer something for both of them. Why does your relationship change when your SO can't share the experience of having chicken in their mouth? Would you guilt someone into eating pasta if their stomaches don't agree with gluten? 
"If you avoided every spot someone had ever been murdered in, you'd probably have to live on the top of some distant mountain somewhere.

If you really feel uncomfortable, maybe get a priest of whichever religion you follow to cleanse or bless the place."
"*If you want to use alcohol as an excuse for bullshit behavior then respectfully, you should be removing alcohol from your life, not Twitter.  And the fact is, you looked at an apartment with your girlfriend, and then told another woman you loved her less than 12 hours later.  Really think about that.  Really think about how that makes your girlfriend feel.  So if you want to continue this relationship, just know that I will expect you to significantly reduce your alcohol consumption.  If you can't or won't do that, then please let me know now so I can make alternative living arrangements*

You do this and watch how fast he stops blaming alcohol for his shitty behavior."
"I quite like it, they serve as a great warning to others reading."
"&gt; Is there any way that I can talk her out of this nonsense? 

Sure! Start paying rent! Better still, *move out!* "
"Agreed here. Also, people don't magically change after marriage. Small things now become huge things after time. "
"Yep, night stocker or bagboy at a grocery store, those jobs don't discriminate. He probably just thinks he's above it. But not above letting his young wife bust her ass as a waitress to keep them afloat."
"Thanks, I really need to start learning that one sentence is a complete answer. It's when people sure you in with the pretence that they are actually curious and want to learn; in fact a few of my friends have now cut back on their meat consumption so things like that are what usually make me answer, you know? I guess I need to stop assuming that people aren't going to be assholes about it."
"They would like that. I’ve already promised to “follow God in everything I do from now on” and “marry a godly Christian man” (which I have no intention of truly following, only adding to my guilt). My parents are die-hard Baptists, so maybe if I keep up that act I can get through this "
my ob/gyn has never given me paper anything either. and yet I get PAGES of documentation when I go to the walk-in clinic with a cold.
"I'm a no-frills kinda gal, so I've told him a few times that I don't care how he does it and that I might actually prefer it in private. I don't care if it's in our kitchen after the gym. I don't really like being the center of attention and would probably die from blushing so hard.

I might try reminding him of this, and maybe try to establish a timeline like you suggested!"
"So you're in a long-distance relationship with someone who started dating you when you were sixteen.

I think what might be really happening here is you're actually dissatisfied with the relationship and you're coming to the realization that here's a guy who is local, who likes you and is close to your own age, and maybe it might be nice to be with someone who is genuinely present for a while?

If you want to date this other guy and your boyfriend isn't happy with it, maybe you should just end the relationship and start over. You just might have outgrown the long-distance thing."
"Omg, yes. Send him an email with ""can you read this when you have time"" and then go to a hotel for the night. Sip champagne, play classical music, and wait for a reply - by email, of course. "
"It's hard, but I think you need to have these conversations face to face. And once the emotional side of things is sorted out, you need to, in that moment, start working on an action plan to make positive changes."
"Simply leave. You've bright up your concerns, she brushed you off. Go enjoy the remainder of your time on vacation."
You know what? I intend to do this. Thanks.
"Just reply ""because I'm not an idiot."""
"Yes your gf broke your boundaries. Ask her how she'd feel if you shared nudes of her with your friends? If you want to try and save your relationship, make it clear that what your gf did wasn't ok (it doesn't matter if she understands why or not) and that it's going to take some time for you to trust her again. But, honestly, if she can't understand why what she did was wrong, I don't see this relationship lasting anyways."
Now that is a family that deserves you!
"&gt; What should I do going forward?

Well, you've already been told that the best thing is to move out, and away from Tim, or kick Tim out. But since that's not an option, we have to go to the next choice...

*Don't keep liquor unsecured in the house!* 

This is pretty basic, but I'll break it out just to be thorough:

1.) Only buy enough liquor for your immediate use. Don't buy a fifth unless you have enough people to drink it all within a few days. Buy flasks, buy quarts, buy little soldiers. Yes, it's probably a little more expensive that way, but it means there is almost no risk that **you** will be subsidizing someone else's drinking habits. 

It means no pre-made margaritas, but that's not the biggest loss in the world. It means if you want to have a beer when you get home at night, you need to stop by the grocery store to pick up a six pack for yourself. It's inconvenient, to be sure, but less inconvenient that someone else drinking your booze. 

2.) You need to have something in your room that can store things, and be locked. Maybe that's a footlocker or a steamer trunk. Maybe it's a desk with a locking drawer. But you need some space that can be secured against unwanted intrusion. Any special gift liquors, along with, you know, money and personal papers, can live in that space, secure against theft or accidental usage. You need to have good discipline about this, too: special bottle comes out of storage? Then before the night is done, special bottle needs to go back in storage. 

Again, this is inconvenient, but that's because the best option (new roommate or move out) is off the table, so we're working with less optimal choices now. "
I'm sorry to hear you lost a friend. Grieve quickly and move on. There are better people in this world to surround yourself with. 
"Agreed. SHE is the one who cheated, SHE doesn't get to decide what is appropriate or dictate how to move forward from here--it was her ""stellar"" level of appropriateness that started this mess in the first place. Unfortunately, she seems dead set in trying to keep them both so this relationship is dead in the water I am afraid."
"Yeah, I agree. This is going to be a miserable marriage. I’m sorry, OP :( 

I truly hate football and am annoyed by the constant football talk by my family and neighbors at every single encounter. I took an audiobook and my knitting to my bedroom so I didn’t have to watch the super bowl last year. Fortunately my husband is only kinda sort of interested so our nuclear family isn’t really effected much. I absolutely would not have married a football fanatic. You have at least made an effort to watch games and not actively hate it and he still won’t make time for you. This probably will never change. 

With respect to the phone on the date, WTF. How rude, embarrassing and honestly, mean is that?! Why does football make people so obsessed? I don’t get it. "
"Thank you, I've been thinking the same thing as I've been reading these. If every sibling agrees they all had a rough time growing up due to circumstances, except this one specific girl decides she was abused because she went through the same thing? She's just wrong. 

""She has her own reality"" is just nonsense. Yes, from her perspective it was abuse, but that doesn't make that perspective valid. It just makes her an asshole. "
"Dude, you make this relationship sound worse with every comment. 

Does she contribute *anything* positive to your life? Are you seriously happier and less stressed with her in it than you would be if she wasn't?"
"I don't know if this is a social experiment type post or if this is real, since you haven't responded to anyone, but in case this is real...this really happened to me. My (ex) boyfriend's best friend raped me. I didn't tell my ex at the time because I was reeling from shock and shame, it was an extremely traumatic experience. His friend got the jump on me and ""confessed"" we slept together to save face. I then admitted to him what actually happened to me and that it was nonconsensual. Since the friend told him first, my ex believed him and put me through a night of horrible arguments and accusations for ""cheating"" and even after he realized I was telling the truth I was never able to move past him not believing me. It took years of therapy (and dumping the ex) to recover from the whole ordeal. For your gf's sake, I hope she breaks up with you for not believing her, and yes, I believe her over your friend, call me biased."
Not to mention the reason she was crying is because she was just sexually assaulted
"If he doesn’t want to budge on rent, refuse those things.

If he wants to go somewhere expensive, say “there’s no room in my budget for that this month but maybe next time”."
"Yeah, he doesn't want a partner (which *is* someone you can talk sex and politica with, and *should*). He just wants a passive fuckbuddy, a sentient sex doll that rolls over with legs open when he says the word."
"&gt; would cause worry for no reason

Another, more respectful way to deal with this problem is A) just don't do the thing that you think would upset your wife or B) preemptively let her know what's going on so you can communicate openly about it and it doesn't look shady as fuck. Never should option C) *lie about it and hope she doesn't find out* be included in your list of possibilities."
"&gt; and we think it might be really fun to get both our extended families together and publicly embarrass our child in a way that only mothers can to ""officially"" initiate him into the family

If you've never had any prior discussions with him about adopting him formally, I'm not sure I'd make a spectacle out of doing it in front of a bunch of extended family. I feel the same way about marriage proposals in front of a crowd - it puts the proposee in an awfully awkward position if their answer is any more nuanced than yesyesyes. 

As an aside: What legal issue do you think adoption will solve? I wasn't aware that it affected much of anything legally other than intestate inheritance. There's no reason *not* to adopt him if you all three want it, just curious."
"I'm not sure if this would come off well or not, it depends on the personalities of the people involved, but personally I'd try to calculate the exact cost over a few weeks.  Save all your receipts and see what percentage of your total cost covered his portion of the food.  Then see if he's willing to cover that rough percentage going forward.  I'm a fan of hard data though, and other people could see that as weird or petty.   "

"Yup, she may not be an 'addict' in the sense of drug use, but she is clearly addicted to self sabotaging behaviors. People like this are a dime a dozen unfortunately. They won't change until they decide it's time to change. And even then, all it takes is a second to backslide. It's so heartbreaking when innocent children are involved. "
"""Being the cool wife"" is just another ""boys will be boys""... It's a poor excuse for men to justify their shitty actions and shift the blame onto the girls/women in their lives. This is just some misogynistic BS "
"Sorry OP but those really do sounds like break up texts. ""This isn't working for me, I don't think I can do this anymore, I'm sorry."" Your boyfriend was jumping to conclusions about there being someone else but if I received those texts I would absolutely interpret them as it being over. I might have tried to have a conversation about it, but I can't blame your boyfriend for the way he took it. You ask if what you said genuinely implied that you wanted to break up, and the answer is yes. 
"
"When he calls you ""bitch"" and ""b-word"", he's insulting you. To your face. When he calls you by a nickname you don't like, he's disrespecting you. You've told him you don't like these names and he still uses them. That means he doesn't care about you or your feelings. 

What are you going to do with that information?"
"He is 3, he does not need an ensuite... the pool is eye candy, at some point he is going to want to touch... with or without you.  Go safe, feel comfortable with your decision... good luck.  Your child can do like the millions of other kids learning to potty train and run down the hall... where mom and dad can hear and help.  Good luck"
"OP you keep describing your sister as a ""complainer."" This makes me wonder if your sister has been continuously updating your parents on her fears and anxieties, while you've been relatively quiet. 

This may be important in how your mom responded to you. She is intimately familiar with your sister's stresses and anxieties because your sister ""complains"" to her. When you approached your mom with ""why does Laura complain so much,"" she might have found you insensitive to your sister's real anxieties. To be honest, I also wonder if you're discounting your sisters _actual_ fears for ""complaints."" It may seem like her life is great, but everyone is stressed by something or the other. It doesn't mean she's doing it for attention. 

I feel like you need to have a heart to heart with both your sister and your mom. It doesn't sound like you have a bad relationship with your sister or that she even treats you badly. Maybe if you talk to your sister first, she can get a better understanding and you can confront your parents together. "
"“Not sure” *is* an answer - but it’s not the answer you need.

Anything other than a “hell yes!” When it comes to kids should be taken as a “no.” It is too difficult and important an undertaking to be anything less than all-in.

He’s pushing 40. If he’s not a hell-yes by now, he will probably never be."

"&gt; The messages my husband is sending range from apologetic to really aggressive ""you'll regret this"" type messages

If he's already threatening you, then it's a good thing you saved the evidence. Get all your important belongings (like documents) out of the house."
"Yeah, I thought this thread was going to be about his boyfriend grabbing his butt or making out in front of his parents or something, in which case I'd be 100% on his side.

OP, you're totally entitled to your preferences and to have them respected, but at the same time, what your boyfriend expects is all very standard, at least as you've described it. Do you think you could find a compromise that you'd both be okay with?"
"Wait wait wait.. You didn't even use a condom?? Come on you're 19 not 14, you're old enough to know that you should be using a condom. Very irresponsible. "
Given how hypocritical he’s being.
Yeah tbh I was surprised that he had made it as far as he did -- I guess he must've been pretty clever! but yes it did make me feel *much* better to have him checked out by a vet (and get a clean bill of health!! :D )
"The other comments support you, so I thought I might offer an alternative view.

I very rarely actually do drugs myself because they can trigger panic attacks, but I am positive towards them and support legalization.

I feel that there is some resentment that he *can* take drugs while you aren't allowed to, maybe even envy. I disagree that there is a double standard here, the standard is the same - if using a substance leads to negative consequences, don't use it. Doing otherwise will be irresponsible. 

It was a correct and mature decision for you not to drink if you had had 'bad' experience. But he didn't. For him LSD is a pleasant and illuminating, drug use can (and should) be responsible and with proper preparation LSD is one of the safest drugs there are. 

It does sound to me that you're asking him to give it up because you're uncomfortable that he's able to enjoy it without anxiety and negative consequences, while you had to cut off that area of experience from your life. You might even feel it's unfair that you are physically incapable of consuming alcohol or drugs safely because of your mental health issues, and he's just fine. 

Personally, I think that these are 100% *your* issues. In place of drugs could be anything, say extreme sports (far more dangerous) or bar-hopping every weekend. Anything potentially unsafe where he has fun and you don't. It just happens that drugs have a social stigma around them and that adds an air of legitimacy to your discomfort. 

Your messages were not 'perfect'. I mean, 'Maybe he would be better off without me.' This one is manipulative and is certain to ruin his mood. The fact that you sent it *before* him taking LSD and not had a talk after makes it look like you want him to have a bad trip to prove you right and give you power."
"His parents have each other, they don't *need* you. "
He needs to get over this shit. How did he react to you apologizing when you didn't need to? 
"Yeah the sitting in the other room bothered me the most out of all of this. Im iffy when it comes to situations like this but in the moment i go into ""let me help you"" mode "
"Then he needs to get treatment. If he can't or won't then that is just as selfish and unreasonable as if he was doing it ""on purpose.""

If he insists that he's Option B, then you insist that he sees a Doctor by the end of the month and that he keeps you updated on his treatment.

If he won't do that then he's telling you he does not care enough about your feelings to make an effort."
And we all have cancer.

She sounds horrible."
"She can’t, that would be considered an unlawful eviction and he could sue her, if a divorce follows it would look awful on her. She should call the cops and file a police report that her husband left her kids unattended for 8+ hours while she was at hospital with her sister. "
Yes!!! Literally repeat this ridiculous drivel back to him!
"He just prioritizes his convenience over your time and feelings. There's no magic words to make him care about your feelings, either he does or he doesn't. He obviously knows things are uneven but he thinks that's OK because it only affects you, not him. Listening to your nagging is worth it to him as long as he can get those hours cleaning out of you.

I guess there's a possibility of him changing if you make it more difficult for him to shirk his responsibilities than not to, like if you would just not do his dishes or something. However, that would require you to live in a dirty home and that's not very nice for you either. The method also doesn't work when you have kids because allowing him to be lazy about child rearing might harm the kids. I would guess your options are to leave him or to decide that you care more about him than he does about you and that you will continue to mommy him for the remainder of your relationship."
"This is absolutely psychotic behavior. I can't even begin to try and understand what she's thinking by making you do that. It's like if she's suffering she wants you to as well, and that's not healthy. This is terrifying. "

"Dump *him*. Go to uni. Have fun, learn, meet someone who shares your goals. Live happily ever after. "
Hopefully you’re right! But for now I’m working on me and getting myself whole again. Then I know the right person will come along. 
"This is about the optics though.  Student loans or saving for a house = acceptable.   Not wanting to pay twice as much than the meal you ordered = bad with money to others.  

I personally would push for separate checks.  With my coworkers we only get 1 bill when the company is paying, but get separate checks otherwise.  

I would probably say that I hate having to carry cash just for group lunches (unless they are running the same amount on each card which would be really stupid since I assume they make one payment so the server doesn’t have to process 12 credit cards).
ETA:clarification."
"WOW. 

Now you know two things about her: 

1. If something bad happens to you, you are on your own, because she's 'delicate'. That includes phoning for your own ambulance if you have a heart attack or an accident. 

2. She's a total psycho with a serious jealousy and possessiveness streak. Soon you will not be able to work at your workplace, ""because there are women there"", no going out ever, no talking to any female on the street even to tell them the time or directions if they ask.

Drop it like it's hot, seriously. 
"
"&gt; What would you have me do, just say 'I'm a horrible person for ever losing my temper with my boyfriend"" and jump out a window?

Is this another example of how you argue with your boyfriend? Just jumping to the craziest, most dramatic extreme?

Just break up with your boyfriend. You're not happy with him and he's not providing you with what you want."
Definitely a good idea to break up. He's already lying to you and flirting with other women and has shown general disrespect towards you as a partner. I doubt you want to know where this relationship ends up if you continue to see him. 
"Girl, *why* did you quit your job and move out of your apartment for this vacation? Why in hell would that even be necessary?"
"&gt;I don't want to go to court with this because off the expenses.

Small claims court is not very expensive at all... look up small claims in your state, I think here it's like $60 to file, you aren't even allowed a lawyer so there's no cost there, and I think if you win your costs are covered by the defendant.

So I guess that's how I would handle it. The poor kid just wants his bike back. Don't let the shop get away with this crap. "

"Have you had an honest conversation about how his phone usage is affecting you? There's a chance that if he knew how you felt he would cool it off. If I were you, I would talk to him about it in a non-naggy way and then see if anything changes over the next few months, but it really doesn't sound like you should be getting married in six months if you're having issues like this. "
"He's not telling them because it's extremely unusual for a man his age to date a woman your age, and he will be judged for it. I don't know anything about your relationship, but it definitely
gives me pause when I see it. In a lot of cases, the older man is taking advantage of the inexperience or lack of attention to classic red flags that younger women tend to have. That's why, I'll bet the farm on it. Im not passing judgement on you two because you haven't said anything to indicate how he behaves, but it's not uncommon to find young women feeling stuck with angry, abusive, alcoholic, disrespectful, or just mean and unpleasant older men because women their age just know better than to give them the time of day."
"A cease and desist letter won't show up on her background check, like a restraining order would. It's not really legal action itself and is basically a warning before legal action is taken. If it does come to a restraining order, it shows that you clearly asked them to stop contacting you on this date. Honestly, I would be worried if I were you (Andrew Bagby, anyone?), and most people would be worried if the genders were reversed. All I'm saying is... breakups are messy, but your ex is acting very delusional and beyond irrational. The letter might be enough to stop her behavior altogether."
She's 2 years out of work with experience in a different state which has different requirements. Doing well in this job has to be more valuable in the short term than staying at home. 
"You've been seeing him *under a month*?  I wouldn't give him any reason, I'd just say I don't think it's going to work out and leave it at that."
HEY PAUL! You sound like a wanker with no business to be calling anyone insecure. You're not being bullied by  someone pseudonymously asking for help when you hurt their feelings! Grow up a bit before you date again.
"A large part of that is her age.  Hero-worshipping older friends, especially since you're  ""Teenager"" and ""Cool"" is fairly common in the twelve-year-old range.  

You're becoming an adult, she's still very much a child.  

As far as touching you:  the best way is to remove yourself from her presence if she can't be arsed to behave herself.  ""tee hee, I can't help it"" is obviously a copout - she knows what appropriate behavior looks like and is choosing not to do it.  When she grabs your hair or disrespects your space, warn her once, then leave, and tell her that you can't be around her if she can't respect you.  When she calls you names you don't like or refers to you as ""Good girl"", do the same thing.  

But honestly?  If she's really bothering you too much, you might need to encourage her to  go make friends her own age.  3 years is a *massive* gap when you're this young, and it's going to be a long time before she catches up to you maturity-wise.  I mean... she's a little kid.  You're not."
"It wasn't ok for him to berate you, and you don't have to be ok with how his parents responded. They treated this really weirdly and allowed for drama. I'd lower your contact with them dramatically. "
"A few things: 

1. I have heard of people designating ""godparents"" as those people who would take care of a child in the event of death of the legal guardian(s), so you're not alone there. 
2. Has your brother overreacted? God yes. But something to keep in mind? This baby is 3 months old. Your brother is doing it alone (even with family help)- he's probably *exhausted*. He's probably exhausted and emotional. 
3. Your brother wanting ""resources"" for an only child is ridiculous- that's why your brother gets life insurance. That would help send the kiddo to college or whatever. To be fair, that should be the case even if your brother appoints a guardian who *doesn't* have kids.
4. People who are already parents are *usually* a better choice anyway!
5. I know you said the baby's mother isn't in the picture anymore.. Is she **legally** out of the picture? Because if she had the baby and just bolted... she could show up at any time and request custody, visitation, or be the baby's legal guardian if something were to happen to your brother. That's the biggest thing I would get sorted NOW. 


I would tell your brother all of this. You'll be there for brother and for nephew, but there are people who are better suited to actually raise the baby! You do not need to get into your mental/emotional struggles- focus on why your cousin or another sibling or your parents would be the best choice. Remind brother to get life insurance, because the ""resources"" for an 'only child' are usually possible because parents plan for the child and save! You wouldn't be able to give your nephew those resources! If he gets life insurance and ensures that whichever legal guardian he chooses gets access to those funds for your nephew, he will have plenty of 'resources' he's concerned about. "
"&gt; Sasha flatly refuses to send a dollar. He says they are adults, they planned this baby (they actually did, they were trying) and have to accept the consequences of their poor decisions.

100% agree. Your sister has not contacted you in years, and when she does, the first thing she asks is for you to pay her rent. Do you not see the manipulation?

&gt; I don't think the baby needs to suffer because if its parents bad planning.

If you start helping them out, when will the help stop? Your sister will keep telling you sob story after sob story.

Don't ruin your marriage with lies."
Because being an aunt or uncle is fun; you have no responsibility. Now that you are hers she needs to make sure there are rules and boundaries that any responsible parent would do to their child. 
"With parents like yours, lying seems to be the only way.

My parents were exactly the same if not worse. I lied basically my whole life. But not about stupid things, but like “I want to see a movie with my friends and they won’t let me go out alone...at age 20...”

Your parents don’t trust you even though you’re being responsible? That’s bs. Lie. They put this on themselves."
"I'm puzzled how it can be so obnoxious but you don't even notice it not being there.

I hope it was insured.  If not ... well ... that's a lot of money down the drain.  And he's even more hurt because you didn't want it anyway.

You can/should report it to the police so that they can add it to their list of stolen jewelry for local pawn shops to check for."
You’re right.

"To me, it sounds like OP is reaching a breaking point with grandparents that go out of their way to take advantage of everyone else's purchases without trading off once in a while. The same kind of people who mooch off your Netflix and amazon prime, because you don't pay any more and you'd have it anyway and while it makes sense for them it's pretty infuriating to have someone use the things you pay for for free and not return the favor.

This is speculation, but based on the lemonade comment it seems likely."

"Uh huh. So he just expects you to drop everything and provide care *that you are unequivocally not capable of providing* to someone you don’t even know?!

And he dropped this shit on you literally *four days* before your wedding?!?!?

First of all - if he’s “heard horror stories” and won’t put his brother in a home, then he needs to pay for nursing care from qualified and licensed medical providers. You have no idea what the brother needs. Nurses will. It’s their job.

Second of all - he’s had alllllll of your relationship to tell you about his brother but he doesn’t tell you until an argument four days before your wedding? That was on purpose. Because he knew you would feel trapped. If you don’t leave, prepare for a lifetime of manipulation.

Third of all - your his WIFE, not his employee. Why doesn’t your opinion matter? He clearly doesn’t respect you. Is that who you want to be married to? Someone who thinks they can just order you around as they please and you’ll meekly do as they say?

Leave. There is no fixing this. You may be entitled to an annulment (if divorce is something that your religion frowns upon). You may love him, but he obviously doesn’t love you."

"Here's where asserting some healthy boundaries for yourself will help. I don't think you're being unreasonable at all. The hard part of navigating your relationship with your BF and how he copes with the situation. 

I mean, you said this...

&gt;I don’t want her in my life

Which means, your BF needs to know that you want nothing to do with her and you need to assert this wish whenever appropriate. That could mean anything from only engaging with her at social events with multiple people, to never speaking to her at all. It's entirely up to your comfort level.

This really falls on him to navigate - if he wants to maintain a relationship with his mother that's more involved, then he'll have to do it without you. 

My only suggestion for that would be to not make him choose, per se. If he goes off for a week with his mom, then be ok with that. Encourage him, in fact. Don't put him in position to where he has to defend her to you. Just be clear that you find her toxic and want nothing to do with her. 
"
"Okay, I know this is really hard for your self esteem. But please don't ask him that. Guys are under enough pressure to perform during sex as it is from their own minds usually. 

Now let me set YOUR mind at ease:

This is COMPLETELY. 100%. NORMAL. 

Especially starting around his age, guys aren't as full of hormones as we were when we were teens and young dudes. Boners don't pop instantly and stick around forever like they used to. Also, having and keeping an erection is partly mental, and sometimes we can feel self conscious when we know one is expected from us - or if we can detect anxiety from our partners if the little guy is slow to show. 

I'm just like your husband. A lot of the time when I have sex with my partner, my erection comes and goes as we go through foreplay. Often her just touching me lightly or doing certain things doesn't quite do it for me right away, even if it feels good. Usually comes down to it being hard to relax or get out of my own head about not having a boner already. 

Here's the thing: I'm INSANSLY attracted to my partner. Just the sight of her makes me low key horny pretty much any time. When we have sex, in obsessed with how great he looks and how much she turns me on. 

But sometimes I don't get a boner until she goes down on me. 

My advice? Let it go, go down on the poor dude, and enjoy the awesome sex you get to have after. "
"Widower here. I completely understand how you feel. Grief is something that is intensely unique to the individual. I always say, ""There's no template.""

"hey OP,

I'm a girl who's dating a transguy right now, who also hasn't undergone any transitioning and isn't sure if he plans to.

I still identify as more or less straight (I like to call myself heteroflexible :P) and so when I started to have feelings for him, it took a little unpacking too, just to understand what that meant for me. I come from a Catholic family who, even if they're open minded, are still more traditional than not. 

I also decided to give it a shot, and my boyfriend and I have been dating for over 1.5 years now!

it's a tough position to be in. I know it feels like family is absolutely everything, but if they don't love and support you, then how is that fair to you? you deserve to be happy and enjoy life with the people you care about, both friends and significant others, and they should love whoever makes you happy because they love you. please remember that.

just keep associating Alex = boy and in time it'll come more naturally! do you think Alex would look nice in a three piece suit? keep focusing on whatever associations work for you until they become natural to you - using the right pronouns like you are and describing your relationship as a gay relationship is so good already, so keep doing what you're doing!

also, what's helped me with my boyfriend is communication. if I don't understand something about how he identifies, or if I want to know what would make him feel good in a particular situation, I ask. if it's a question you're worried might upset him, tell him the truth - you're still learning, and you want to be as respectful as you can while doing it, since you really like him and want to give this a good shot. talk with him if you're ever worried or unsure, and you'll be able to help each other out along the way.

it sounds like you really care about Alex. I hope you stay strong and keep on learning and keep being happy!"

Unfortunately the things that make them chase-worthy happen to make them unstable partners."
Your girlfriend sounds like a real delight. And by delight I mean asshole. 
"But this isn't just your own problem. It's a couple problem. You both agreed on how you wanted both your names to be presented to the world after marriage (him keeping his own birth name is a decision too).

"Advice? Tell him the truth and say you want to get divorced. 

You say yourself you're not in a happy relationship and are being ""tortured"" from the knowledge you've cheated. You say you'd leave if it weren't for the kids. Kids are going to be happier when they have two separate parents leading fulfilling lives than two people putting on a charade. "
"Fucking thank you. He has a back hair trimmer, all it takes is a few minutes! And wash his darn beard.  Blech!"
"God, just imagine what he'd be like if you actually did gain weight. Sometimes people get sick and that causes them to become overweight. Could you imagine being in your sickbed while he hovers over you with a measuring tape, commenting on your body every day? What about if you have a child with him, is he going to be hounding you to go to the gym constantly while you're pregnant? 

Look he sounds overly-focused on your weight and that's just no way to live. He admits that it's his own problem that he's projecting on to you. That's a seriously, seriously maladaptive coping mechanism. If I were you, I wouldn't bother waiting around to see if he can change. He needs time alone to think about his actions and how he should treat someone he's in a relationship with. "
"They might not have the best grasp of death, but not registering the howls that immediately followed as expressions of pain is pretty ""off"" to me. Harming other children and animals and not feeling empathy is a classic sociopathic trait.

"&gt;Your wife obviously should get into therapy.

Why? His wife is acting completely normally.

"&gt;whether a relationship can survive this. 

Overcoming infidelity like this requires intensive support, deep commitment and lots of therapy. I can't imagine you can do that, being that this relationships is long distance for the foreseeable future.

Nah. Sad. Sucks. Bounce. 30 year old you is looking back in time right now and pleading with you to just end this and move on instead of dragging it out and becoming an anxious, insecure mess for the next x number of years."
You break up with your abuser is what you do.  There are plenty of girls out there who won't hit you.
Unless he only has videos of her over the age of 18 (which sounds doubtful) it isn't just revenge porn - it's child porn. OP should get a lawyer and then report it to the police.
"Look mate, the thing about ""my body, my choice"", is that it's a freedom that comes with *responsibility*. If this woman chooses to abort, as she has every legal right to do, it is *her* choice. If she wanted to keep the baby, if she really felt abortion was sinful, there is NOTHING you could do to convince her to terminate.

If you don't want the child then say so. If she then chooses to abort, give her the courtesy of believing it's because she wanted an abortion. If she tries to pull a guilt trip tell her if she's not adult enough to take responsibility for her own body she's not adult enough for sex.

It is not easy to raise a child as a single parent. It is not easy to raise your affair baby with the man you cheated on. These are reasons enough for her to abort if she wants to, it's not all on you."

"&gt; Why do you even invite him over to your house?

He's OP's father, so she's been exposed to his shit from childhood. She probably hasn't fully internalized how fucked up his behavior is, or realized how little most people would tolerate it.

"Dude you are weirdly paranoid about your wife. She has a friendship with a coworker, she’s been open about this friendship, and she openly speaks of how she admires this coworker’s marriage. You on the other hand do not trust her. You doubt her word. You apply meaning to shit when there is none (she goes in for work early when she needs to make up time and that’s somehow to flirt with this dude?) and in 5 years you’ve never found a scrap of evidence she’s stepped a toe out of line? 

If your paranoia isn’t hurting your marriage now, it will be soon enough. "
"Since she knew how long you would be gone I don't think that's it. You said when you came back she said ""I am not ready for a 3 year old"" toddlers are little balls of energy so I think her saying that just tells us the problem, she was exhausted and didn't realize how much energy a toddler could take out of you since her child is only 8 months. She doesn't even have to be a hellion for this. It could have just been her asking "" Come play with me, come read with me"" a lot and Tammy was exhausted from just splitting her attention between your full of energy toddler and her  little baby who is still extremely dependent on her. I agree with others who said once she realized how much work it was she texted you to ask "" when will you be back?"" as a ""SOS I can't handle your kid AND my kid anymore, please come back soon"" Like others have said, just buy her a gift or take her on a spa day or something to thank her.

&gt; I have explained this to him a million times.

You should've broken up with him after the 3rd time.  A million is too many."
"Lots of kids share rooms growing up. But not at 18 and 16 years old, and most not at 13. Especially not after having their own rooms and losing them. Expect there to be a lot of bitterness if that's the direction you go in. "
"You mentioned that in the past you've used his phone when yours died etc. Why don't you do the same thing and see if he hands it over right away? Then if he's weird about doing that (Takes 15 minutes before he hands it over, or goes into the bathroom with it before doing so), you can use that one thing as a springboard for a conversation to bring the rest up. Sometimes I completely change all my passwords if I worry that someone has had access to it (Office IT guy, for example) and I woudln't think of mentioning it to my girlfriend of 3 years first. "
"&gt;  But she tells me that I'm the one being selfish for not wanting to do **what she wants**. 

You see how backwards this is, right?"
"I'm wondering if there is something about your past trauma that is making you take the blame for everything that is wrong in this relationship.

There is nothing you can do right in this relationship. Someone brought up in candyland would have a hard time relaxing.   He may be attractive, but he doesn't sound like any of these other things: ""He's a fantastic person, attractive. Smart, funny."" 

You are young and you guys aren't compatible. 

&gt;he may need to start considering that.

Don't ask him to make the decision you know you need to make."
"If you do this, though, YOU need to be in control of the money. My boyfriend grew up with 2 irresponsible cocaine addicts for parents who used the ""education funds"" his very wealth uncle gave them for, you guessed it, more cocaine! They would just lie and say boyfriend needed books or clothes or insert educational expense here and his uncle would pay up, thinking he was helping.  
  
If they need school clothes, you take your nibling shopping, you don't send cash. If they need books or school fees, YOU do the purchases directly, you pay the school directly, etc.  
  
I know it's easy to get sucked into this, but your sister sees you as nothing more than an easy paycheck. Don't let her bleed you dry. "
"Yeah, his excuse is extremely suspect.  That and OP mentions short conversations lately on the phone.  I think the boyfriend is cheating. "
"&gt; perhaps not even all of the family there

YOU THINK?!

"
This is the exact opposite of constructive criticism. 
"Look, it is that bad and going to get worse. You would benefit by nipping this in the bud before then.

Organize your housemates. Make sure you’re all on the same page. It may take time, as they probably need to suffer some of the same consequences.

Have a united front on expectations and consequences. I don’t know if there are any intermediate punishments possible, but you should be thinking about what it will take to get him out because it’s either that or likely deal with an unpleasant household instead."
You need to tell your Mom. Tell her alone and tell her everything you know. This is not the thing to shelter her. She deserves to know the truth. Don't tell anyone else until you tell her. Good luck. And obviously reassure her that you will be there no matter what she decides. &lt;3
"Yes all this! In addition, you don’t have an HR department OP, and this would definitely be something to go to HR about. Your boss has to know that they’re the interim HR and this must be dealt with. "
"To tag on to this. Your husband and daughter are your IMMEDIATE family. The rest are just extended family now. Nice to have but not necessary for life. I recommend visiting /r/justnomil and r/ raisedbynarcissists I'm pretty sure those are correct forum names but if not they're pretty close.

Mom and dad need a time out. Till after the first of the year IMO. "
"This is the father of your child.  Slight him and they are slighting the child.

Your parents do not have your families best interests at heart.  Your husband and child are your family now.  Put them first.

And speaking from experience, pushy parents are a nightmare when dealing with childbirth and a new baby.  Even if they are there you will do something else to piss them off, like ask them to wait 10 minutes while you try to breastfeed.  You don't need the additional stress.  Tell them the plan is to have people out for a 1 hour visit a week after the baby is born.  With the child's FATHER in attendance of course, he is your family after all.  You'll thank me later."
You risk your friendships if you give her their numbers. Say no and stay strong. 
Yeah but that doesn't mean they're not hellions.
"Asking for a paternity test right then was a horrible horrible decision .  Then ""explaining"" that you did it because you've ""giving up so much to do the right thing"" was even worse.  You essentially told her that you just wanted to make sure there was no way out of this and that you're sacrificing so much to do the right thing.  I'm gonna be blunt...you aren't sacrificing half as much as she already has.  You put your sperm in her, so this is YOUR responsibility and it's not a noble thing to do to stick around...it's the basic requirement.  She has no choice now...she went through physical and emotional hell to birth your child and you're talking about YOUR sacrifices and how you just want to make sure you have to sacrifice.  God.  No wonder she's shutting you out.

Never ever follow up an apology with an explanation.  Write a letter about how much you fucked up and how wrong you were, and tell her that whatever level of involvement she decides on, you will follow.  I get that you're young, but don't have sex if you aren't prepared for the consequences."
"Is anyone in this family an adult? My god, OP. They all sound terrible.  
Why don't the parents help their useless son? Does he know there is the internet? Are those people allowed to vote?

They all sound really really low and not like any kind of explanation could reach their peanut brains anyway. 
I would go absolutely no contact, people like that do not change and they will suck out of you whatever they can get."
Walk away. The guy has anger problems.

The more comfortable I've gotten with me feelings the less I cry when I discuss them.
"I don't think they need to contact Allison at all to be honest. All of the siblings going no contact, ignoring her calls, not returning any form of communication etc will get the point across that they're pissed at the way she treated their mother. 

I don't agree with the statement about Allison's husband seeing her family turn against her as a sign that her reality is skewered. If anything, it'll give Allison the opportunity to spread more exaggerations/lies about her family and probably skewer his perception of them further. After all, we're talking about a guy that willingly went along with his wife's revenge plan against her sick, fragile mother. He's just as vile as Allison himself. 
But either way, that's not really OPs problem or goal here. The most important thing is keeping their mother away from Allison and her husband. Which, they're clearly going to do. The bonus is that they'll also be rid of Allison once they go no contact. "
"Dude, your mom took your pills.   Sorry."
I can't believe he used your 3rd anniversary to take you to an expensive LA restaurant so he could harass a celebrity. And then I can't believe you essentially paid to watch all of it. Think about it?
"Other common uses of this ploy:

* To get you back into a relationship where she gets herself pregnant ASAP and hopes you don't notice the baby is a month late. ""We don't need to use protection, I'm already pregnant.""

* Tries to extort funds for an abortion from you. Lots of guys are more than happy to pay a few hundred bucks to make a ""problem"" like this go away.

Crazy is crazy. Try to avoid dating crazy people in the future."
"Dude, it's already a shit show. "
"&gt;Me casually drinking past the bday is apparently a sign that I'm gonna be too far gone.

So he's deciding for you. Taking away control.

Sooo any thoughts on the root behavior behind the issue? Like his lack of respect for you and your choices? His lack of respect for your ability to take care of yourself? His need to exert control? His rude, disrespectful manner of handling things like this? The fact that he's shaming you?"
"They're insecure and taking it out on you, that's all there is to this story. It's very common. You need to learn to reflect it back on them or ignore it. Whatever you do don't let them convince you she isn't attractive or feel embarrassed by her. "
Maybe get out of contact again? She let him treat you like that.
"There’s literally a neighborhood cat in my apartment complex that I help take care of. I tried to keep him inside and he HATED it, but if I knew he’d found a loving home? I’d be overjoyed. A little sad to not see my bud anymore, but every pet deserves a good home. "
no its not-this dog bit the OP unprovoked-thats an aggressive dog. The op now understandably displays fear. We have NO idea how the dog would react to the OP holding its food-it may very well lunge at her and even bite her again if it resource guards.
"I agree with a lot of others. You’re looking at this all the wrong way. From your sisters perspective, she’s doing this out of love. If she isn’t talking about death all the time, and constantly losing her mind over dangerous or even possibly dangerous every day things, I (in my non-doctor opinion) would let it go as a quirk. She’s practical. She seems incredibly eccentric and likely fun as hell to be around. Stop panicking and accept her quirk as an integral part of you. Besides, you all might need those things one day. Suppose you’re sleep-deprived from your new baby reacting to an ear infection and not sleeping, and you forget the oatmeal and it catches fire. How lucky, you already have an extinguisher!! Or someone clips you at night on a deserted street and for whatever reason, your doors won’t unlock to let you out. Check it! You have a glass breaker for just such an emergency! She thinks along a different, more practical path than most maybe, and you should all be glad and relieved to have someone in your lives that cares enough to go against social norms and buy you all things that are actually useful and not just only good for collecting dust bunnies. "
"""I'll have two salads, one for now and one to go, thanks!""

When confronted: Well my two salads combined are still less than your steak and wine?"
"You are in a textbook abusive relationship and you have been severly brain washed. 

The fact that you take his word about your ""flaws"" as gospel.

No, the fact that in the very beginning of the relationship your attitude was already subservient, I feel a little shitty about saying so, but when you get out of this shitstorm, I do not think you should go back to your parents.

"
"He has his own rights, up until the point he became dangerous and abusive. You need to protect yourself because he will injure himself and others. Cops, campus security, landlords, etc, all need to get involved if needed. "
"As someone with a family member who has BPD, this is true. They'll understand.

Sometimes consequences like the end of a relationship due to a manic episode helps the person to understand they have an illness that they need to take seriously and manage, especially if she's been in denial about it"
"This is a good idea, but I have a feeling shes going to get upset at you ""upstaging"" her dinner."
"Then call it. It's not worth fighting her to change her mind, and you don't want to quit. There's no progress on that. "
"...and why would he have to call at 3 in the morning to tell his friend immediately, instead of waiting until the next morning when he could calmly and thoroughly explain what he saw? Oh, right, because he's lying and rushed to give OP his story before GF got home.  

"
We know what run your mouth means.
"Maybe hurt ego, maybe something else with that. There is not enough context to the story, but when I've seen other stories of people storming out like that, it's because they want you to console them so they don't have to acknowledge what they did was wrong. Then they just get to continue doing what they did while you feel like the asshole. It's some significant emotional abuse.

It may not be the case here, but I wouldn't rule it out as a possibility either. Need more info to tell."
"Speaking as someone who has cared for people suffering from dementia/Alzheimer's, I honestly would not tell her. If she is capable of understanding in the moment, it will obviously upset her greatly and depending on her age/medical history, could send her into a fit or even a heart attack. Even if she just understood and grieved after you told her, she will still progress into this disease and forget anyway. I really hate to say that because it sounds so harsh, but it's the truth. As for feeling guilty about keeping it from her, think about it from this standpoint. She has limited time with her right mind. She deserves to have as much of those moments of clarity to be filled with the joy of being with her loved ones as possible. I'm so sorry that you and your family have to go through this and I will pray for your sister and your mother. &lt;3"
"Possibly she's being so enthusiastic about your mother's food as an attempt to praise it enough that she doesn't have to take another serving of it? Is that why she eats so much; because she feels that it's being implied that if she doesn't, she doesn't like the food?

Do you have friends who have met your family? If so, might be worth asking them if anything your mom does around food is odd; it can be hard to spot it when you've been raised with it because it's your normal."
"To piggy back off this when my husband and I started dating I was pretty small, I worked out 6 days a week at the time. When I met his parents the first thing we did was go out of eat for a lunch/dinner with his grandparents. 

After I ordered my food(some form of pasta), his mother remarked 'at least she can eat' and then I was immediately self-conscious about both how much I was eating and what I looked like. I couldn't understand where the comment came from, and my husband at the time didn't even notice the comment. I felt like I needed to eat more to gain her approval. Problem is I'm not a big eater - I'm a snacker. I don't eat large portions either. So, it could have been a simple comment OP's mother made that he never noticed or didn't realize how it sounded. "
"If he's buying is not going to be 1 month. It takes longer to find a place, get a bid accepted and close on a place. If you agree to this it has to be with a **definite** time in writing somewhere. He needs to contribute to rent, chores, food, etc. Do not accept if he doesn't want to sign something, even if it is not notarized. "
Of course she shouldn't go through with the wedding.
You and your gf want different things from the relationship. You two are incompatible. Just end it and move on. 
"Only advice needed. Only a professional can determine the true state of what's going on. Reddit throws around ""sociopath"" labels like it's candy.

OP and wife could seriously damage the kid's mental well-being by either overreacting or under-reacting.  Only way to find out how their child _really_ feels is to ask a professional. Anything else is just a stab in the dark and does no one any good."
"After you've got some time under your belt for your pain to subside, let yourself be proud of her too.  She is choosing the harder but better path, not stewing in cringey unrequited love territory but instead taking care of her own needs."
"He’s three- if you make the upstairs bedroom sound awesome and declare the bottom bedroom as a guest room/office/playroom he’ll accept that as “the way things are” though there might be a little bit of crying after hearing the news, but he will eventually move on with no problems. Tell him that he gets to help pick out the paint color(s) and decorations for his brand new bedroom upstairs and get him excited and involved about that whole process. Ask him if he wants a cool theme or one wall painted a different color. Ask him if he wants any family pictures, personal drawings, or posters hung up on the walls. If you distract him with that and start calling the downstairs bedroom something else (like the office or guest room) he’ll stop fixating on it and will be happy upstairs. 

Your wife needs to get on the same page as this is a safety issue. A three year old needs to be closer to their parents at night, especially if there is a potential danger like a pool within easy access of the downstairs bedroom. And what if there was a fire? You want young children to be easy to find if there is an emergency not have to run down the stairs and access the house. She can still do something special for your son in his bedroom upstairs that he will love. 

Also- if the new house doesn’t have it already, an alarm system that beeps when the back door to the pool area (or any outside door) is opened might be a good investment to make sure you know when someone leaving the house. That way if he does get tempted by the pool in the middle of the night then you have a better chance of knowing he’s trying to leave the house before he gets to the pool area. "
"She doesn't sound like a clinger as much as a person who really likes to take advantage of others. 

&gt; Do not justify. Don't defend.

This is exactly the path you should take. Rather than keep making excuses you need to say ""I will not be able to do that"". Keep repeating as necessary. "
It's a bit weird that two girlfriends have drawn the same conclusions about her. 
"Most people when it comes to parents try to find a way not to confront them, but I had this problem more or less and confronted my mom about it kindly and our relationship is so much less stressful now.

I hate unsolicited advice, and she loves to give it. It would cause fights because I would give some kind of excuse as to why it wouldn't work, she would try to find a way around the roadblock instead of accepting it, I got angry she didn't get the hint, she got angry that I wouldn't listen....so one day I leveled with her. I told her that I like her advice but only when I ask for it, because of who I am as a person. She didn't want to fight either, so I gave her an easy out - she's not forcing opinions on me, it's just who I am as a person! We agreed that she could give limited advice but if I said ""okay no more suggestions"", she would take it seriously and stop. And in return, I would be very clear on what I do want advice on and only throw up roadblocks if I want her help knocking them down, not to hint that I was annoyed.

It's worked so well. Highly recommend."
My thought exactly. At this point does it matter why? Could anything be worse than child endangerment and neglect? Nope! 
"That he was at the place an hour before she got there and bribed the host to get a table near where she'd be seated is all hella damning. That's phenomenal luck. Win the lottery luck. 

I think it's way more likely he's actually a stalker. OP needs to cut and run before this escalates. Dude is on his way to restraining order and legal action territory."
"My boyfriend is this way. He insists so much on seeing the good qualities in people that he talks himself into thinking they are better people than they really are. He has horrible intuition with that kind of thing. It's super frustrating because I can see it a mile away.  I think he also does it because it really bums him out when people don't turn out to be the people you thought they were.

There's a lot of guys that I know who are like this."
"It's an important life lesson about not dating self-admitted best friends of misogynists, but what an awful, traumatic way to learn it. "
Perhaps it's working and that's why he asked you out. :)
"Moving in with someone after three weeks dating is *insane*. Getting with someone 30 years older when you're hardly an adult is *insane*. Combine these, and we're left with one obvious conclusion - you're not ready for adulthood. The fact you refused to exercise any good judgment tells as much.

The only good thing to come out of this is that you broke up with him and moved out. *The only good thing.* Make good on that one sensible moment and start fresh. You're 18 and have plenty of time to do better, but start now."
"SO Much this answer.

she's in love with herslef and wants everything. You're the guy shes stringing along in case it all breaks down. You're the ""Fall-back plan"". She checked out of this relationship a long time ago, but doesn't want to seem like the evil narcissist she is.

Divorce her and block all contact as best you can."
"""Honey, I'm concerned that you're relationship with [Her] is crossing a line. Do you realize that you spend more time and energy on her than me, and that she is openly flirting with you. It is creating a rift in our relationship, whether you have noticed or not."""
"""don't fuck with my sleep. ""

YES!   This statement is perfect wisdom."
"Just keep repeating: ""I'm unable to attend your wedding"". Don't bother to keep explaining why, because he knows. Maybe send a gift, but don't at all feel obliged.

Honestly, even if he backs down... Still don't go. I don't know that this situation can be redeemed, due to the total disrespect he has for you and both of your SOs. "
"I don't have children but my experience with dogs is that an increase in the number produces a corresponding exponential increase in energy produced. One dog produces x, two dogs don't produce 2x, they're produce x squared. And so on :)

Does that sound familiar?  "
"&gt; Imagine what will happen if you have kids and he expects you to do 100% childcare as well as all your other chores AND a job?

haha, he will be one of those dads that ""helps"" mom by ""babysitting"" his own kids a few hours a week - then brags about what a good father he is,  won't he?"
"Your wife may be overreacting, but I think I would be slightly put off too.

We think 6 is young. 6 year olds are more tuned into the world than we give them credit for. I definitely understood death as a child, as well as remorse. Maybe your daughter is developing slower than her peers, but she should have some semblance of what happened.

We put my dog down when I was 9 (I understand that there are leaps and bounds between 6 and 9, but my dog's health had started to rapidly decline when I was 6 and I knew where it was headed). Maybe it was because my parents always answered me straight and never really beat around the bush.

I would try to sit your daughter down and explain to her that Fido is dead. Don't sugar coat it. No euphemisms. You didn't take the dog to the farm. He's not asleep and in dream world. He's dead.

If she asks more, you tell her that he was in lots of pain. She might be able to infer from here that it was her actions that caused this.

If she is still not acting as expected, a psychologist may be in order.
"
"Couples therapy is predicated on the idea that both parties need to work on their relationship (in an abusive relationship, this is not true) and often gives abusers space to control the narrative. Even if this is avoided, abusers will most likely stop going to couples therapy if it seems like they are being called out/held to account for their abuse.

**EDIT:** It also tends to place equal priority on the feelings of each party, which is useful in a non-abusive relationship, but in an abusive relationship validates the abuser's idea that their feelings are a priority (rather than their harmful actions). Abusers put a lot of stock in their own feelings as justifying their actions ('She made me furious, I lost control'; 'I'm worried about him, that's why I tracked his phone'; 'It makes me so sad when you're not with me, that's why I don't want you going out with friends on the weekend'), so a space where they are encouraged to talk about their feelings and hold them in a place of importance is really unhelpful. It can also be used as leverage 'I'm doing couples therapy for you babe, how can you say I don't care about you? You always make me out to be the bad guy, but I'm doing all these things for you!'. There's more in 'Why Does He Do That' by Lundy Bancroft if you're interested in reading further!"
"YUP.

This man sounds like an immature jerk. Leave him, he will only get worse with time and you cannot be in full make up 24/7. Its unrealistic and unhealthy.

"
Avoiding telling her to not cause a problem IS intentionally hiding it. 
"Also- if this was right after the conference that ended at what Like 6pm? That’s a typical time. So was OP in this woman’s room for like 12 hours?!? Because that is also absolutely ridiculous. 

But yah you’re totally right. Why was the immediate response- you look sad- let’s go to your room just the two of us! 

The more I think about this the more outrageous I think it is. "
"Believe it or not, other people’s birthdays are about them and not about you. 

I know... it’s outrageous to think people had the audacity to be born without asking how you felt about it first. "
"So don't let him.  If you let him do that, it's 100% *your* fault."
"Literally the only sensible comment here, so I expect you to be downvoted into oblivion. LOL"
"i don't think you're in a position to decide whether her clothes ""personify her."" as a woman who enjoys fashion, it's something that she likely puts a lot of time and energy into and if she didn't enjoy the way she looked in those clothes then she wouldn't wear them. i think the commenter you responded to had a nice way to frame things when you speak to her about this, but please don't try to tell her what her personal style should be, because it's up to her."
"Yeah, I was going to comment how mind-boggling the contradiction is but this is actually so fucking classic"
"Yep.  Legaladvice will give them a single piece of advice, and it is the correct advice: get legal advice from a professional, not the internet."
"Has he been to a doctor for a physical exam? It seems very odd that someone would do a complete 180 like that without some reason (physical or mental). Will he go to couples counseling with you? If not, there's really no hope here, especially since you're no longer on the same page about starting a family. You can compromise on a lot of things, but not kids."
"The nurse tried to reason with your father, but he's too blinded by p**** to see his fault in this. The next step is to escalate. Go to the guidance councelor and ask them to intervene on your behalf. Every adult at your school is a mandatory reporter. They will have to alert CPS or risk losing their job.

You also need to go and get yourself checked out. I know you're trying to look out for your dad and his financial situation, but he is not looking out for you in any capacity. You could lose your leg over this. Infections are not something to slap a bandage on and put out of your mind. Go to the ER, the clinic, wherever. Tell them the circumstances.

Your father needs to get a call from CPS so they can put the fear of God into him."
"Don't try dismiss your feelings because you think it's selfish... its reality.  If you can't adjust to his kids,  don't do it. The resentments will pile up and sabatoge your relationship.

However,  don't let how you think things are ""supposed"" to be sabatoge you either.  You might love being a step parent, you might enjoy having kids that you get to have breaks from and that you get to spoil and enjoy more so than if they were your own.  You never know.  Have you met his kids? How old are they? How did they cope with the divorce? What are their feelings towards you?  Would they be excited if you and their dad had a baby? I would ask these sort of questions and  take take stock of how difficult this appears to really be before you jump the gun. But if those factors don't matter and you still resent them, do yourself,  your partner,  and his kids a favor and just break it off before all of you get stuck in a cycle of misery. "
"""For better or worse,"" means you stay together through tough times caused by factors OUTSIDE your marriage, like money problems, illness, family problems, unemployment, etc. A ""you against the world,"" type situation. It doesn't mean you stay together through his escalating terrible behavior, disrespect, and other fuckery. 

Please leave. You can do it. There is a fulfilling life out there for you. Go get it."
"You aren't paying someone to live with you, you are paying 26M to live with them.  You agreed to this.  If you don't like it I think you should seek a new place.  You aren't on the lease, you don't get to decide what's fair and what's not after you agree to terms.  If you had a problem with it you should have handle it before."
"I will counter with, people stay in poor relationships far too often and for far too long.  There is so much less risk leaving a poor relationship than there is in staying in it. "
"Oh you know I read her post wrong too I was thinking they were doing this every day and going to say just say you can't afford it.

If it's once a month it might be more important to take the hit and socialize and get herself a steak and get it subsidized by her co workers to boot. "
"The issue isn't for the server, it's how OP will look in front of coworkers. "
"Fortunately, rather. Since he sounds like a jerk and there's enough jerk dads in the world already.
"
"He said that you are like a ""brand new car""!!! Please avoid this guy! He is objectifying you. You are not an object that he can test drive. You are a person who should be treated with love and respect. Avoid him! "
"Sis is definitely deflecting blame to OP.

The less she feels responsible, the less she will blame herself and her husband for not fixing the stairs. Grief, especially for a child, tears families apart. Many grieving parents divorce. Sis is probably doing whatever she can to stay afloat.

There is very likely a part of her that knows OP isn't responsible. The problem is she's not ready to own up. The major issue here is that nobody can put a time limit on grief, so everyone is catering."
"I mean, if you're being honest about why you track her location and how often, and once you see she's safely where she told you she would be and just forgot to text, you stop tracking and move on with your day, AND if your wife knows you do this and doesn't have a problem with it, I'd say you're fine."
"I don't think it's *that* evident to see the signs, not only because of the victims but because 

- 1) The guy hides them (obviously). People always blame on victims for dating abusive partners when they *all* know someone abusive. Abusive partners are our friends, siblings, co-workers, etc. Yet people are unable to spot them. Victims are no better than the rest of the people. Even worse, sometimes victims look for help and their peers will say things like ""I've known him/her since ages and she/he would never do that. Are you sure you're not exaggerating a little bit? Maybe it was a bad day, etc."" 
I knew an abusive person, he was the kind to buy food to homeless people. He was always ready to get help (you talk about waitresses and staff, he was the first one to propose his help if something was wrong instead of complaining or shouting). Everyone thought he had a good heart. Some abusive people know exactly how to get the perfect cover. There can be signs but not always. 


2) The guy does not necessarily behave this way at all before because of the nature of the relationship. An abusive partner can be respectful for a very long time and change when the nature of the relationship change. And depending on the person he's with. I have this other example of an abusive guy. He was abusive with his new wife. Nobody would belive her, because he had been married for 12 years with his previous wife, had 2 kids with her, and never got abusive or violent. 

The thing is that his first wife was ""wife material"" in his head, so she *deserved* respect (according to his logic). Almost nobody belived the second wife because he did nothing to the first. But that's because the nature of the relationship was different. Just like an abusive person is not necessarily abusive to friends or won't shout at employees. In line with this, an abusive person can be the perfect gf/bf until they get married, because at this moment the relationship changes.
They have very specific targets and they know how to chose them so they won't be uncovered. 


Really I know what you mean, and having low expectations for relationships won't help, but it's really not the victim's fault or because the victim has faulty relationships templates. 

Abusive people date anyone, they date fagile *and* strong persons, they date actors, champions, waitresses and bosses. Victims go through a very, very long process, that is designed to confuse them. It's brainwashing. 

And you can't know immediately because, when you look behind, yes you can see the pattern. But when you're in it and can't tell what's coming, you cannot tell that it's a pattern. It's small isolated stuffs that regular people can do too. 

If it was that easy to detect them, then they'll all be out. If it was a matter of having healthy relationship patterns then friends of victims would be able to detect them, it wouldn't be so hard as well to find help in general. Unless all policemen, lawyers, psychologists have faulty patterns and low expectations for relationships too, it should be more easy to find help with them too. 

Of course some guys are obvious jerks like Trump for example. But most of them are ""good guys"".

"&gt;  she said she wouldn't have told me

And why not?

&gt; Do you really think I should apologise for shouting at the roommate? I don't feel bad about that

Your gf isn't your property and threatening violence is never okay. I understand that the situation upset you, but this isn't the way to handle arguments.

&gt; The issue seems to be that from my girlfriend's perspective, I'm trying to get between her and her friend and she's chosen her friend's side.

And you're okay with that? In my eyes, the issue goes deeper. Your gf dismisses your feelings and doesn't set healthy boundaries with her friend. Furthermore, she told you in your face that if she had been kissed by a guy, she'd not tell you. How can you trust such a person?

"So she wants you to sacrifice the things you feel are important so she can eat meat, but isn't willing to even try a meat free meal once a week?

My fiance was a vegetarian when we started dating and I joked that I'd have him back eating meat within a year. I didn't push it on him or anything. We went to places that offered us both good food options or I would suck it up and eat veg for a day. It's not that big of a sacrifice once a week.

If she wants you to adjust to her lifestyle but isn't willing to adjust to yours, I'd think about the compatibility there."

"&gt; But at what point should I give up?

Uh, you don't? These are your parents. People who don't respect them don't get to come over to their house or events. Period. Full stop. 

Give your BF a nice shoulder to cry on about having to stand up to his parents for once, and do the normal thing of have separate family events.  This is a solved problem and has been for ages.  You go to 2 4th of July parties, celebrate Christmas Eve with one family and Christmas Day with another, etc.  Expecting everyone to get along for everything is ridiculous. **There is a reason that people don't try to have all their in-laws to everything.**"
"OP's not buying the dog, her parents are.  Honestly, because she's a minor, and her parents seem so unreasonable, it's likely she won't be able to change their mind about buying the dog from the pet store.  What she can try, however, is to convince them to keep the dog they already have and ensure them that it will be *her* dog and *her* responsibility, while her parents can deal with the new puppy."

"Christ, just block these people and stop associating with them.  They sound like total trash.  Get out of your small town as well, if you can."
"LOL in a perfect world maybe. People _sometimes_ lie because they feel they'll be ostracized or lose relationships when their loved ones can't handle the truth. Sad but true. And I hate to go there, but there is a distinct difference in how men are typically treated on this topic than women, so I'm just pointing out that these things cause a woman to doubt whether they should be totally forthright with their partners. "
"I was wondering if the husband was trying to avoid spending one on one time with OP. If this is really the only night out they get to be alone each month, inviting *anyone* along, regardless of gender, seems weird. Especially when OP has said she’s not really wanting a 3rd person to join them. So even if they weren’t calling it ‘date’ night - it’s still the only night a month they can have alone time out - so why would he want to invite anyone else?"

I've never heard someone so young say they should hang them self or have their eyes stabbed. You need to step up. You've worked with kids, you should know this."
"It's not ""just her personality"". She enjoys the validation she gets from him in that another man finds her attractive and is flirting with her. That's why she's flirting back - so he'll keep giving her attention.

This could even be more than that, considering she says she's ""intrigued"" which I take as basically an admission that she likes him romantically or is at least attracted to him. I would have a big problem with this personally. "
"&gt;**but clearly young girls, like just about puberty age**, and just drawings. The recent Tumblr one wasn't like one girl he was following, but a compilation of pictures like teenagers

Nope, nope, NOPE!

This makes me want to barf. You do realize girls go through puberty around 12 and 13.. I don't see how sexualizing girls that young should get a pass -- it's pretty close to pedophillia!

And that fact that is drawings -- well hell, that doesn't make it better! Dudes who look up drawings are just trying to mitigate their risk of getting pulled into a child porn raid. They're imagining the real thing but drawings are ""less risky"" than acquiring photos or video. Yuck!!

None of this is okay. **Why the fuck is he jerking it to the idea of 12 or 13 year old girls?** He's a grown man and this is morally bankrupt and gross.

Can you imagine how you would feel when you have daughter that age? The idea that she and her friends could excite him in any way is highly disturbing.. ultimately you have no control over his thoughts even if he has deleted the porn. He has already crossed lines that he never should have and when the full weight of what he's done sets in you may be unable to ever see him the same way!

I mean, plenty of people have twisted fantasies they never intend to act on but learning their SO indulges in the ""fantasy"" of 12 or 13 year old girls is one that is a dealbreaker for many women!"

You should never corner a parent, it's when they have no avenue of escape that they are most likely to attack you."
"He doesn't just sound like an asshole. He is an asshole. She had PPP. 
Thats some serious fucking shit that has made women kill themselves and their children without realizing what they have done(Andrea Yates, anyone?) or thinking it's better for all of them and he's about to leave her alone in that? 
He expects someone who had PPP to he able to have a baby, come home with said baby, and care for the other child they already had while keeping her shit together. 

He isn't just an asshole. He's negligent and can't take care of his responsibilities.

"When he was 20, you were 6. Think about how that looks."
"There's something wrong with an adult who can make legitimate, cruel comments about kids and babies. You can not want kids without being an asshole about it, normal 26 year old adults do not attend baby showers and talk shit about little children. Not to mention she has absolutely no social filter and thinks nothing about ruining someone else's gathering regardless of the social repercussions for her and for you.

This is seriously disturbing and would be enough to send me running for the hills. This woman is disgusting."
"Thanks. I did give her a specific time frame, but I think I should have been more aware of what the ""when are you back"" text meant. I do tend to take things at face value and when I asked if that was okay, I figured she'd tell me if she needed me sooner."
"He's scared that you'll surpass him in life. At best, he's immature with an incredibly fragile ego; at worst, he's an abuser that is scared of losing control over you.

"If it pisses *you* off, think about how she felt. Now think about how she felt after you berated her and called her ignorant and stuck up for having a problem with your friends' incredibly rude behavior."
"Agreed. OP, don’t be someone’s silver medal. You deserve better."

"You're not a bad guy for not liking something, but this would definitely be a dealbreaker for me."
"She'll be on a list but with a baby, she moves up.  I live in a smaller area where you can only wait a short time.  Think in a big city, it takes longer.  And in some much poorer regions of the US, this could really be a problem.

But you can't do anything unless you try.  You can google resources for families in their living area online.  Look for everything, state aid, county aid, charitable aid.  There are food banks, churches will sometimes help pay rent, there are aid programs for utilities.  You can get WIC for a new baby that provides vouchers for formula, milk, cereal, etc.  Programs can provide car seats.  If you're a working mom in my county and below a certain income level, you can get free or subsidized childcare and education.  No one with a conscience will ever let a baby or child go hungry, no matter what the people holding signs asking for money on the side of the road say.

I'd provide them with a list of everything but be prepared for them to cuss you out.  And be prepared to help them out with formula and diapers and spoiling the baby on its birthday because I know that's what you'll need to do to be okay with yourself.

Yes, they are using you.  But, cut yourself some slack, she is your sister.  Cut your hubby some slack, he doesn't want to see you manipulated and hurt when they tell you to F*off."
"I've been reading other comments here, and I think you might be right about the definition of objectification. It would hurt, since my husband is well aware of what objectification means objectively *and* what using it does to me, but I've been considering it more and more. I've worked in academia, in the humanities, and have published works on objectification &amp; feminist studies. Maybe I'm approaching the word with its actual meaning, but failing to realize that apparently, its ""meaning"" has changed in layman's usage. Thank you for your comment.

Edit: spelling."

"The best advice I can offer is to keep the hurt your father has inflicted on you separate from the hurt he has inflicted on your mother. 

I say this acknowledging that of course you're going to be angry at him for how he's hurt your mother - but let your mother deal with that. Let her navigate her pain and let her come to you if/when she needs help, but don't try to set her course for her. If she chooses to forgive, that's her choice, and you should do everything in your power to support the choice that she makes. The most difficult thing in a time like this is the feeling that one is alone in the world. Make sure that if she ever feels that way, it's not because you weren't there for her.

As far as your own relationship with your father, take some space to feel pain and anger on your own. Consider seeking a counselor, or confiding in a close friend. If you have siblings, they may be a good shoulder to lean on, as well. When you feel that you have a clear head, sit down with him privately and talk to him about why this hurt you and what you need moving forward. Obviously a lot of trust has been violated here, so it's important that you make it clear what you need to see to trust him again."
"Have sex with his brother and then his bro can tell him about how much you enjoyed it /s

Seriously, sit down with him and put it out on the line.

“It’s not sex that’s the problem, it’s the fact that you’re using it to try and make fun of me and make both BIL and me uncomfortable. It’s hard to get in the mood when I know you’ll be bragging like a teenager later. We both want a healthy sex life, but for it to be enjoyable it should be between us, not a stick for you to him me with in front of others."
I would break up with him in a hot second. The man literally still has mom making major life decisions for him.

God I didn't even think about the drink driving aspect. They could have gotten someone killed that night!
Tell her you will kept it a secret if she does 😉 and you’ll refrain from further sex until marriage 😉😉
"You say that you feel lost because the plans you had for your life are gone but, considering you had different ideas on money/responsibility/friendship/children, it doesn't sound like she was going to be the one to bring those plans to fruition with you, anyway. Now you have the opportunity to meet someone else who can give you the future you want. How exciting is that??"
It's time to have the Come to Jesus talk with your husband. Tell him he needs to start shutting her down and ask him how would he feel if you were exchanging texts like these with a younger handsome male friend of yours.
"Just... No. She's trying to be all ""cute"" about disrespecting your boundaries? 

It's bullshit to be waking you up just because she ""misses you"" anyway. Seriously. If I'm being woken up in the middle of my sleep cycle, it had better be my toddler who needs Mommy, or someone had better be dying (toddler sometimes thinks they are dying if Mommy is not readily accessible). "

"Ok yes, OP this is all on you. You have absolutely no spine and are completely incapable of setting boundaries, OR you just don't give a damn about this guys feelings, either way you look at it, you don't look good.

Im also confused as to why you won't go on this trip? Get the four shifts covered, yeah it'll be tough but honestly Im sure you can figure it out. You have been entertaining this for **10 YEARS**, and you made the plans to go see him, you accepted his offer, and you accepted him paying all the expenses for this trip. Go see him, give him the fair shot he deserves and the fair shot you promised him. That way you'll know for sure there is absolutely no way you'd see a future with him, or maybe there is a chance. How in the world would you know if you guys have a future or not, you haven't seen him in 10 years. You were basically babies at 15, a lot, and I mean a lot, can change in 10 years. GO! Then know for sure whether you can close this chapter for good or not"
"So, this is beyond fucked up and unfair, and I'm really sorry that you're going through this. 

That being said, you need to tell your parents about this. These people are, teenagers or not, sexually harassing you. If it was a girl who was being told these things, everyone would be outraged. They should be in this case too.

"Textbook!

Her: ""I'm reluctant because there are some things you just don't understand because of your perspective. Things I would notice, that would fly completely under your radar. Like condescension, othering, dismissing my viewpoint, denying privilege, microagressions... Things you would be clueless about.""

Him: ""No way, I would never do that! Bullshit! People from outside the city don't do that! Wait, why the fuck is she upset? Nothing went wrong. I dunno, I just didn't notice... She doesn't know what she's talking about! Ignorant!"""

This is not a gender thing. My bf does it sometimes and I get pissed. And I don't find it cute in any way
"I feel like he’s either doing something with this chick or is trying to steer things in that direction.  He’s already put friend into “nice woman” category and wife into “nasty woman” category, so it’s not a stretch to think he could have talked a lot of shit about his wife to sweet coworker chick.  She could be just creeped out and not wanting to get involved. 

I know relationships hates “snooping” but if this was my situation I’d be looking at his phone to see if they’re texting.  She could send the other chick a Facebook invite or message as well, and see what reaction she gets.  Something light and innocent like “husband seems to think we’d be friends, hi my name is..”. Give her a private chance to open up."
"It's kind of hard to tell what your actual feelings about those drunk texts are. It seems like that night things got tense, and if someone's response to me was ""fuck you babe"", that would be the end of it for me and that person. I would certainly never hang out with that person outside of work again. Sam is not going to change who he is, though I guarantee he is going to tell you he will. He'll promise to slow down on his drinking if you'll just keep being his friend. This is a lie, and if you have any respect for your relationship with James, you will cut Sam out of the non-professional part of your life, no ifs ands or buts. The rest of my advice will be based on the premise that you are not having any of this shit. If you are having some of that shit, then it won't really apply. For the record, I am not judging either way.

Talk to James first. Essentially you are ""making a deal"" with yourself here, the deal being that you don't want to hurt James and Sam screwed up the friendship thing so Sam is gone and James gets honesty and even a little ego stroking. But in making that deal, you have to express it to both of them. Who you talk to first will color the deal in your mind, so start with your SO. If you start with Sam, he'll try to be manipulative and screw a little bit with where you are taking this. You'll end up with a compromised deal and James will be the one who loses.

So tell James he was right, Sam was definitely flirting, tell him everything, about the texts (since he's going to read them anyway, might as well get ahead of it) and even though your response was glib, you are done with him. And the lyrics too. Just get it all out there. You don't need to apologize, but as James has some jealousy issues that you are sympathetic to, letting him know he was right will make him feel better about things by making him feel like you are on his side. Sam is the bad guy here, not you, and James wants to know that you know that.

And take a hard line with Sam at work. No more after work hanging out. Zero. You don't need to make the workplace hostile, but make him understand that your relationship with James is more important than indulging Sam's alcoholic fantasies. Even if it's just getting ice cream with no chance of drinking being involved, it's not worth it. Because no matter what actually happens, James will hate it, and he'll just be stewing in his anxiety and trust issues the whole time.

You haven't done anything wrong, so don't feel like you have to shy away from the truth at all. Truth always comes out in relationships anyway, so just get in front of it, and hold on to the relationship you want, and dispense with the one you don't. And remember, no matter how much Sam pleads and begs, you will be doing him no favors by giving in. He needs to move on, so you'll only be hurting him by agreeing to give him more chances. Even if he just says ""you were right, I won't ask you to hang out again"" what he's really doing is trying to make it your idea that it might be okay to hang out again. He probably won't even realize this, but everything he is going to say to you in your next conversation will be a manipulation. Every word. So remove the chance to be manipulated by making the conversation one-sided, and making no compromises. It's not about punishment, it really will be the best thing for everyone.

"You could seriously hurt this kid and your relationship with him if you do this to him. I understand not keeping things from your husband is supremely important - especially about his own kid. But you have to consider this kid's feelings here - especially if you want a positive relationship with him in your future together. You're not in a position to only consider you and your husband's needs here. 

I personally would actively create an environment that feels safe for this kid to be whoever he is as he grows. I have a boy that is also exploring his sexuality and he's in his mid teens and still figuring out where he fits along the sexual spectrum. We talk about it a lot. He feels comfortable talking about it because our home has always been sexually open without being inappropriate. Meaning, the media in our home often features gay/bisexual themes and characters and we've discussed them in ways that let him know early on that I was a safe person to be open and out around. When we see gay couples in public, I've made random comments on them being a ""cute couple"" or a ""goofy couple"" - treating them just the same way I'd people-watch a straight couple. I've shared viral videos of gay engagements not because they're of A Gay Engagement but because, ""omg this was too funny - look at how silly happy his parents are here!"" - the gay-ness was never the issue to discus or consider. It was always secondary to ""this is a hilarious engagement video"" or ""look at how silly that couple is walking"" etc etc.  He picked up early on that I didn't care about gay vs. straight at all. 

Stop snooping on his stuff.

I was honestly really struck by you characterizing him using things in his own home as ""stealing"". Like, I couldn't imagine if my son took some glue from the kitchen, accusing him of stealing it. It's his kitchen. The glue is presumably there to use. 

Anyway, Good luck. "

"As a woman my experience with infertility felt more magnified than what my husband went through. Every month when I got my hopes up then got my period I felt actual grief and felt like I'd failed. Plus to top it off I felt physically awful having my period when not on birth control. I'm not saying it isn't hard on men, it is. It's just that he was sort of waiting for a yes instead of the monthly no if that makes any sense. It made me very irritated with him, thinking he didn't care because he didn't seem to feel as miserable as me. In retrospect couples counseling would've really helped. It took us 3 years, and they were very tough years for our relationship but we did have a child."
"&gt;I'm such a hysterical person who doesn't think before she speaks

Maybe you should work on that instead of assuming people will just tolerate whatever flies out of your mouth, you're 22, time to grow up. It's not bad enough you said that to him, you couldn't even respect his wishes for space and called him 50+ times because **your need** to resolve this quickly is somehow more important than his need to take time away from you. Everything you've said makes you sound like an incredibly self-involved person.

In his shoes and judging by your personality I'd be wondering if you were mature enough for marriage. The last thing someone wants to do is commit to a flighty, impulsive person who can't respect boundaries. You need to leave him alone and let him decide how he feels. Whether he leaves you or not, learn from this experience and think about how your behaviour affects others, the world doesn't revolve around you."
"Don't walk, run away from this girl.

Because you are the reason she was there at all. If you're considering staying with this woman, think about the wedge it is going to drive between you and your family that your girlfriend brought a woman to a funeral who gloated about the death of a grieving man's child."
"&gt;i told her to stop but then she tickled me

So she has nobody to blame but herself. 

If ticking is gonna be a big part of your lives, y'all need a ""safe word"" - or she needs to learn that stop means stop"
"Beyond thia, save and document everything that happened. Save his texts confessing. Write down when you left and why you left and save evidence of that too. Write down when you got home and what met you. Then find a lawyer to bury him with."
"My ex husband slept with his teenage cousin...its possible. They like to tell themselves its just them wanting to spend time with a family member and their intentions are pure from the outset. Also, cousins are ""safe"" to spend that kind of time with unlike other women because they are supposedly off limits automatically. Its all really just them being manipulative. The fact that he makes time for them that he doesn't make for you is a red flag. I wouldn't sweep your fears under the rug. "
"&gt; It set the standard for not taking food without asking. Even a French fry.

I had to set this standard with my wife. She and her mother just share food off their plates without asking, but for some reason I can't stand when people just reach over and take food off my plate.

It took some explaining of my feels, but eventually she obliged. I'll say yes 99% of the time, as long as she asks."
"&gt; he thinks its ok for some reason to be that mean to me

Yikes. This is the opposite of what you need in a life partner. They are meant to prioritize and support you not discount you and treat you badly.

It really sounds like he has an attitude problem towards you *because you are his wife* and has some deep-seated issues around marriage ... and/or feels like now he has trapped you he can treat you in a lesser way than he has to treat his other fellow humans.

OP you need to see a therapist *without* this guy and talk through it, so that you are grounded in terms of who you are and what is and isn't acceptable to you in your life."

"About 5 years ago, my best friend of 10 years had a housewarming party. 

Her friend had brought a Tinder reject with her, hoping to foist him off on some random girl. The Tinder reject took a liking to my best friend and sort of followed her around all night making inappropriate remarks. On two separate occasions, I heard her say both ""I'm not interested"" and ""you're not my type.""  Both times, when he was out of earshot, she followed up with the modern equivalent of ""ew, as if"" to me. 

She had invited several people from out of town, so even after most folks had left, there were people all over the place in varying states of sobriety and consciousness. At some point, I took a guy into her upstairs office. 

Eventually, I heard my bestie make an announcement that she was drunk and going to pass out and would see everyone in the morning. Then I heard her convince her dogs to go into the bedroom and close the door behind them. 

A few minutes later, I heard someone with very heavy footsteps come up the stairs. Most of the people left at that point were Asian, and nobody I knew to be present had such a heavy, noisy gait. 

I stopped what I was doing and started making myself presentable. While doing so, I heard her bedroom door open. 

When I got to her room, his silhouette standing over her bed, reaching down to touch her. 

I screamed bloody murder and the guy I had been with came running and flipped on the light. The stranger had already pulled down her sheet and pulled up her pajama top. 

My scream didn't rouse her a bit.  The guy I was with shoved the stranger out the door and down the stairs. We told her everything the next day and she was terrified and wondered if we should call the cops. 

Over the next several weeks, I stalked the guy online and found out that he has been not accused of but charged with sexual assault not once, but twice. 

My bestie got a promotion and had a dinner party which I drove 3 hours to attend. I almost passed out when I walked in and there he sat. It turns out that he was more than just a failed Tinder date - he was the brother of her friend's boss, and her friend felt obligated to include him. 

I pulled my best friend into her kitchen and said ""are you fucking kidding me?  This dude tried to rape you.""

She told me to calm down, so I left. 

Over the next several weeks, I tried to figure out wtf was going on. I asked if she was into him and she said no. I asked if it was something they agreed upon and she said no. I asked if I had misinterpreted the situation and she said no. She just told me to calm down. 

The next time she had a party, I asked if he was going to be there. She said yes. I declined her invitation. I haven't seen her since. 

Sometimes people make bad choices. Find a new book club. "
"Is this a serious post? You're not trolling?

He loves his cat like most people love their pets. This is how literally every other cat/dog/pet owner treats their pet.

You're jealous of a cat. Do you realize that? What happens when you have children and he treats your kids like that? Are you going to be jealous of them having a father that loves them?

You need to really think about why you're feeling this way about a cat."
"I know that it's not logical, but emotionally it would still sting if I were working odd jobs and saving for dates and someone who was sooooo much wealthier than me said asked me to split chinese takeout as they were revealing that they were uber wealthy and lived in an apartment worth several million.

"Please get him microchipped so that if God forbid anyone gives you trouble you have proof you are the legal ""owner"". These people sounds disgruntled and I'd hate for you to get your heart broken. While your at it just double check the laws in your area (but I think if he's microchipped with your info it might be enough legally). Also thanks for doing the right thing and giving this cat a real home, you sound like a wonderful person. :)"
Don't marry him.  Please postpone and have marital counselling.   He has to think long and hard about whether he wants to marry you...

"Approach Matt and tell him that his name came up in a conversation recently and you'd like to speak with him about it. That way you keep things professional and he can choose whether or not he wants to hear you out during lunch or something. If he does, give him the whole truth. Tell him you were mentioning to a friend how glad you were that you two talk more now and you've really come to enjoy working with him and your words were ""misinterpreted"" as something different. Apologise, tell him his name won't come up again and thank him for being decent.

Then promptly stop calling Jenny your close friend. She's a bigmouth who likes to stir the pot and cause drama so she can tell her tales to her circle of girlfriends. People like that will destroy your professional career. Keep it civil but purely professional from now on, no gossip."
"&gt; He says that I am like a brand new car and that I'll remember him forever!

So he's not interested in being a good partner to you, he's interested in what your status as a virgin would mean for *him*. 

If I was to be someone's first partner, I would want to talk to them a lot about what *they* wanted and how I could make the experience great for them. I wouldn't be fetishising the idea like I was conquering their virginity or something. 

You are not a new car or uncharted territory. You are a person. 

Stay away from this guy. If you're going to lose your virginity, it should be with someone whom you care about and who cares about you as a person. Not someone who sees you as some kind of trophy, conquest, or blank piece of paper they can scribble all over. "
"Married guy who loves football, and has a fantasy team.  My wife and i got married 2 weeks prior to the playoffs (which is fantasy football championship and just big overall) and guess what, i didn't watch any football that weekend.  Wife and wedding too precedent.  Last season when my wife was pregnant,  she was due in November i took the year off of fantasy football.  Not only would she need my help prior to the birth, but she'd really need it after, and that again took precedence.  

You begged and pleaded with your hands closed for him to have a date with you, and he couldn't.  He couldn't spend 1 day alone with you, the woman he's supposed to love and cherish above all else in this world.  That should tell you everything you need to know.  "
"Thread over, pack it up lads. "
"It's not ""OK"", but how many times to people come here with posts about how they snooped and discovered cheating? I think James' issue is problematic (he should have asked if he was really concerned since OP wasn't being evasive), yet from his perspective Sam was acting shady and OP was seemingly going along with it."
"It's something you both have to work on if there's a chance to turn this around. It seems really unsexy, but scheduling sex can be a really good way to try and reset this negative cycle. The subreddit /r/deadbedrooms  deals with this and may be able to provide some tips to getting things back on track. If you're both not in it to fix it, it's never going to get better. Sex is a really important glue to any long term relationship. Unfulfillment leads to resentment and eventually pulling away from the relationship."
I love my cats. Love love love my cats. If my little brother was in that position there's no way I could chose my cats over my flesh and blood and if my bfs siblings were in that situation he wouldn't even have to ask me to choose. I understand you love your dog but that's your brother and I honestly don't understand how that is a hard decision. Not saying to throw your dog out but geeze. Find a dog hotel or someone to watch your dog while you take care of your 9 year old brother that has no control over all the shit going on around him.

"9 out of 10 times you go out women walking over to you, insulting your looks, and moving on, is insane. You'd have to live on the planet of the assholes.

If he's disrespectful or embarrassed of you, break up. But some of your statements make it easy to wonder if you are accurately perceiving things.

Have you asked him to take some photos and post them on social media together? Stand up for you when you are insulted? Asked him what he thinks of your looks? Because these are normal things to do.   "
"What you did was shady, especially not telling your wife about it. Did you avoid mentioning it because it didn’t seem significant, or because you were worried how your wife would react? Regardless if nothing happened, you spent the night with another woman who is close to your age and you’ve been out with before, and then you didn’t tell your wife about. That is suspicious and your wife has every right to be upset."
"Dude. No. None of this. 

Talk to your girlfriend beforehand. *Ask* her what would help her be more comfortable during this dinner. Get specific suggestions from her. They may or may not be food-related. You have no idea right now, and flailing around trying to anticipate her desires is likely to end with you eating your foot. Ask her directly, and pay attention to how everyone interacts during this dinner, particularly your mother and your girlfriend. "
"Exactly this.  That woman did not make any vows or promises to you, your husband did.  It's his job to respect your marriage and boundaries and put a stop to things that are inappropriate.  He doesn't get a free pass because an attractive young woman is making eyes at him.  How long has this been going on and have you talked to him about it? You don't mention it at all in your post but I wouldn't be able to NOT talk about it if it were my husband."
"Regardless of if you phrase it like that it will only come across as ""you are ugly"". No reason to get specific here assuming it's not a changeable facet of her (like hygiene or whatever)."
"Then I think you are good and she was just tired.   Your idea for a card and gift is appropriate, assuming you didn't pay her?  Maybe the gift can be aimed at some kind of adult relaxation - gift cert for dinner or a massage?  Maybe alcohol if she's into that?  "

I think he needs something. He wants to rug sweep his abuse and continue to use you. I'm so happy you're waking up to his ways and proceeding accordingly. Good luck and please stay safe. His violence is concerning and im afraid of what he might do when he realizes that you won't be putting up with his b.s. any longer.
"Geez, these comments are toxic.  Perhaps your BF just wants his friend to do this himself, because it isn't something that directly involves him or you.  It bothers him, and he shared with you because he trusts you.  You should take that cheating bothers him as a good sign.

Also, he doesn't want to cause a rift in his friend group.  Perhaps the girl isn't all that great either?  Not saying that's a good reason to cheat, but it isn't your relationship.  Leave it alone.

To everyone saying that there's some big question on morality, I say fuck that.  It's hard to tell someone they're getting cheated on.  It's hard for someone who doesn't see it coming to just trust someone else saying it.  And it's hard to cause shit between your friends when something doesn't affect you.  

You have zero obligation.  Neither does your bf.  Y'all seem fine together, and I know it sucks to get cheated on, but it doesn't mean it's your job to seek out justice for others."
Call the club and see if there was a fight... Are his knuckles messed up?
Oh I bet she'll react total volatility and maybe even call OP names again. 
"Absolutely. Sister sounds so toxic. Boycotting the wedding would probably be the best thing for your wife, and you, in the long run. "
"Tell her if she doesn’t want to be in a relationship then she doesn’t have to be. Honestly, it would be fairly annoying to hear it. She’s not owned by you, you guys don’t share a title of anything, if she wants to explore other options let her, I’d be infuriated if my so said that. And you have every right to tell her where she can shove her comments. "
"Because she's good at crying crocodile tears, as far as I can tell. Breakups are really, really hard - I feel like they're even harder being the person who does the breaking up, because you're beset by indecision and *what-ifs*. But logically, you know this is the right thing to do."

"Yes we have/make enough money that giving $500 a month for a year to his SIL does not affect our standard of living or affect our future savings in any noticeable way. 

Issue is it's not SIL who wants the money, it's husband who wants to give the money to prevent her from living a sadder life and engaging her destructive tendencies. But beyond that, we have all agreed that this is temporary and the assistance stops once she gets a job and gets regular mental help. Husband and I are arguing basically on the matter of principle. I believe that if SIL truly needed $500-1000 a month for unavoidable living expenses, then I'm okay with it. However, I do not believe animals count as unavoidable expenses. This is where husband and I disagree. 

He thinks I'm being petty because we spend way more than this just on drinks/entertainment/etc. a month alone and I don't want to spare a little to help his sister. My argument isn't that we can't afford it, it's that we shouldn't be paying for non-essentials on principle."
Is it really necessary to tag a celebrity when someone's insulting them? Seems mean...
"What I think needs to be addressed is not that he doesn't pass and thinks he does, but that he's bragging that he's hotter than other women, which would be obnoxious behavior from anyone, trans or not, true or not. 

Tell him he doesn't pass is only going to hurt his feelings and won't accomplish anything, addressing his behavior however might. "
"Agreed. And we all keep referring to it as bragging, but he's also teasing OP about her enjoyment of it...it's got negative connotations, that's straight up shaming. Just because he does it with a frat-boy grin doesn't mean it isn't super disturbing. "
"The first friend I made in college was a huge drunk klepto.  Our short friendship ended one night when we went to a frat party.

"You don't need to bait someone into couples therapy to trick them into individual therapy.  Individual therapy and couples therapy are very different processes, and going to a good couples therapist seeking individual therapy might get you a really terrible fit.

The compromise is offering to go along to a first appointment, or making himself available to join her for a session if/when her therapist would be willing to do it.  

OP can be honest with his wife about how her anxieties are impacting him, and that it's important to him that she work on resolving these anxieties, and that he hopes it is also important to her.  If she refuses, then maybe there's a discussion to be had about couples therapy and whether both are willing to do the work needed to make the relationship as strong as it can be."
"Completely ignoring the red-flag of age discrepancy, his immature response to an extremely serious topic of discussion is quite telling. Her fear that he will use his age as a deflection to such an important (and not to mention BASIC) topic in relationships that both parties must be on the same page as, means that he's likely displayed such manipulative behavior before to demean her needs/feelings/perspective/etc, otherwise she wouldn't fear he would do it in the future.   "
She also lied when confronted saying no she did not put tequila in your drink. Why aren't you sticking up for yourself and your unborn baby? Notify your boss and thank that Carl for sticking up for you!
She's insecure and taking it out on you. She's not a friend. 
"I don't think you understand how incredibly, incredibly huge the maturity difference is between 20 and 34. Even 20 to 25 is massive. 

When you are 34 you'll be looking at 20 year old's like children. The age group from 16-21 just melts together into a mush of kids. I personally can't tell the difference between the 16 year olds my mom teaches and the freshers at my university and I'm only 24."
"... which is fine if that's what he's into, but it doesn't sound like it works for you and your needs at all. What are you getting out of this relationship? You're very young and you've been with this guy since high school. It's OK to break up over this."
"And even if you did stay together, I'd bet anything the dynamic would get really weird and unbalanced between you, with you on your best behavior so she can ""remember why she loves you"" and with her in this uncomfortable position of power over you and your future.

"I've been in this situation! It was terrible and I also hated going to work. Headphones, being in video conferences, having my door shut, CONDUCTING AN INTERVIEW - this person would just come into my office and start talking. This is how I handled it:

When my coworker would come ask me an unnecessary question I would reply with ""Oh, did you ask Boss? I think it's best if you ask Boss instead of me for this one."" I'd typically get a similar ""I'll just look it up myself then."" answer. When they came back later to ask me the same question I asked ""Did Boss not know the answer?"" I kept redirecting them to their boss whenever they came to ask me a question that wasn't legitimate. It didn't matter if I blatantly told them (and I did the at the start of the second week) that I wasn't the person to come to for questions because they ignored me.

As far as the coming into your office without knocking? You're going to have to get a little stern with her here, I think. The next time she does that say ""Oh, I didn't hear you knock! Sorry Bernadette, I can't talk right now I am swamped with work. Please close the door on your way out."" Again, each time she does it give her a similar response.  I'd do something similar when wearing headphones. When my coworker would come into my office when my door was shut it would startle me and I would let out a yelp. After a couple yelps and ""You startled me! Please knock before opening my door.""

If you're on the phone and she's standing there waiting for your call to end ask your caller to hold on for a moment, mute the call, and tell Bernadette ""We'll have to talk later I on the phone with a client."" You're going to have to set boundaries with her and it's going to be painful. 

If you've been trying the above methods and they aren't working I suggest speaking with your boss about Bernadette's behavior. Let your boss know you've tried to redirect her to the appropriate people or to find the answers herself without luck. This shows your boss you came to them only after you've put in a good effort to solve the problem yourself, but it isn't working and you need help. Your boss should then speak with Bernadette's boss and get everything squared away. "

"&gt;they are notoriously cheap people. Grandpa is the guy who asks for water with lemon then makes lemonade at the table.

You knew who they were before you got into a financial arrangement with them. All of this should have been expected. This reminds me of the story of The Scorpion and the Frog:

&gt;A scorpion asks a frog to carry it across a river. The frog hesitates, afraid of being stung, but the scorpion argues that if it did so, they would both drown. Considering this, the frog agrees, but midway across the river the scorpion does indeed sting the frog, dooming them both. When the frog asks the scorpion why, the scorpion replies that it was in its nature to do so.

I say you have three options:

1) Put your foot down and fight them on it. This will cause them to be resentful of you.

2) Tell them that they need to go their own way, and take them off the family plan to avoid future fights.  This will cause them to be resentful of you.

3) Eat the cost yourself and drop the matter. This will cause you to be resentful of them.

None of us can tell you what to do here. Somebody is going to suffer here no matter the outcome. It's just a matter of whether you want to be hard hand of justice, or a martyr."

"Eh, he can give way on the cleaning service.  That's *another* good compromise, and would show on his end that he's acknowledging *your* needs as well."
What was the fight about that made you react so strongly ? Were you in the wrong and now turning it around on him? Diverting the actual problem? (Just asking) 
"Ah, okay. I only ask because sometimes abusers will sabotage sleep as a tactic. When you’re trying to control someone, it’s easier if they’re sleep-deprived and running on fumes. It’s also easier to make them feel crazy because the lack of sleep makes them delirious, cranky, and just throws them off. "
"Out of curiosity, because I don’t really know much about teenage boys, why is it likely that he missed the bus on purpose?  Like, he lied to OP about his age before so wouldn't he not want her to know he's in high school, especially since it shows he was either lying or held back once or twice?

His parents might not have been home, and he's had friendly interactions with her before so I can totally understand asking her.  "
"He started dating you at 19 exactly for this reason.


He doesn't need to think this is an issue, you need to think it's an issue. That should be enough. If you're angry about something that should make him care.


Just leave, if after cheating and this you're still staying with him I can only imagine what else he's getting away with.


This is why he's so unconcerned. He figures you're going to stay anyways."
Right. But I don't think it requires a doctor visit to figure out that the guy is masturbating too frequently and/or too forcefully. I've experienced the same chafing that OP is describing...when I was home alone for an entire weekend at 16 years old. Dude has an addiction problem
I think she is an adult woman and can do this if she wants to. It's not that weird and its not harmful.  Drop it
"Probably worse, he would like to be one but it's not happening."
"He has absolutely no business dating a 16 year old teenager, first of all. He **Should** be with girls in university instead of going after high schoolers like some creep. The fact that he'd be pursuing you (going after younger girls is a common trait of scummy ""player"" types who prey on the inexperienced) means his shitty reputation is probably well-earned.

You don't sound like a jealous girlfriend, you sound like yet another teen girl who's being taken advantage of by someone who should know better and probably thinks her relationship is special or different. This sort of thing is posted every second day here, it's unfortunately all too common. There's about a 0.0001% chance he won't hook up with university girls, the culture there promotes that sort of lifestyle. Do what a 16 year old should be doing and date a guy your own age, then tell your parents to give their heads a shake instead of getting cosy with the university guy dating their teen."
"The medical prognosis for someone in your mother's situation is not good. You really ought to consider an ER visit. She's not even medically safe to stop drinking without medical supervision right now. Her liver and brain function could be extremely compromised. I wouldn't have a second thought about calling an ambulance the next time she passes out. 

People are trying to give you nice behavioral suggestions here, but your mother may be on the verge of death. I'm not trying to scare you, but I just want to be very direct and honest here. You may not have much more time to intervene. She needs medical intervention before you have any chance of a real dialogue with her.

"It really doesn't matter what is fair in this situation. You agreed to it, so now you're stuck with it until the end of the lease.

"Yeah, you're probably right, I'll ask her when she gets up in a little bit."
"From what you wrote he sounds like a guy whose personality is quoting a tv show. I personally find that people who do that a lot are pretty boring and cringeworthy. Not to mention he can't bring himself to care what you think about it.

At least it's not nonstop Rick and Morty quotes?"
"&gt; One simple explanation would be that he is getting bored of ""chilling and playing video games"" by himself

Then it sounds like he needs to figure out a new hobby to explore, not ask his girlfriend to stop spending time with her friends.

He already said no to more date nights and he already is saying no to going out every time. If he is unhappy with his decision, sure maybe she could stay home once a month but that isn't really what he asked for and it probably won't solve the problem, if it really is what you're suggesting."
"&gt;Hes trying to make his savings last two more semesters and then he is taking out loans for grad school.

"These are exactly my thoughts! I would never speak to my boyfriend again if he abandoned me after I was assaulted. Also, so sick of men being like my friend is a misogynist but otherwise he's great. They are fine with them disrespecting half the population because they're nice to them. People who are apathetic to mysogynist are mysogynist. "
"It’s wise to step back and think, sure. But if the girlfriend is telling the truth, she was sexually assaulted and when she went to her partner for support, he didn’t believe her and left her alone. Personally, I would rather be with someone who supports and comforts me after I’ve been sexually assaulted. She can’t trust OP to do that. "
I only have half siblings as well. We treat each other like full siblings. I highly doubt your relationship with them will change.
"There's nothing here that *whispers* ""stay together"". "
"I agree with this. There’s a less defensive way to go about this too. If she declines getting her own, ask her if she intends to eat some of yours? At that point, she either commits to not eating yours, or gives you the opportunity to say the above “I intend to eat all of mine, if you want some, I would prefer you get your own.” Now you’re communicating about the issue.

What I found with my wife was that she frequently wants a small amount but not enough to order another serving. That’s fine, but I need to know that beforehand so I can adjust how much I get. I wasn’t upset about sharing, I was upset about the amount of food I intended to eat being infringed on. If we communicate about it beforehand, we can order correctly and everyone is happy. "
What! That's rule #1: when wife gets pregnant do not eat her food. 
"This is such a great tip. I know he really likes this typically expensive sandwich to make (ingredients, mostly), but maybe every so often I could make that for him to take to work instead of the standard stuff he eats. Get him a fancier thing. It's a small gesture but I'd appreciate it in his place. And the experience gifts are good too! I never really considered experience a gift, but now that you put it this way you're absolutely right. Even something small like that surprise picnic. Thank you!!"

Unless there's something else you're not describing, I'm not sure why you're so worried about her, and it does seem that you;ve overreacted slightly about the text message...
"
"&gt;But I feel like if it were up to her she would get on-the-hour updates or more, which seems a little over the top

So instead of *feeling* like what she'd say, perhaps you should ask her.  "
"Bisexual or not, I agree this guy sounds like he should be avoided"
No way. I don’t invite my niece and nephew’s grandparents to events that don’t involve my niece and nephew. It’s not their place. 
"&gt; he started going on about how my culture and certain customs (on religious days) were out dated and misogynistic

lol, you could say all the same things about American culture."
"&gt; We don't fight, we talk and explain things in the most rational way, and we don't agree on something, the person with the most logical/practical solution ""wins"" and the other complies because of the logic and practicality of the suggestion.

I rolled my eyes so hard at this part, I think I need an emergency ophthalmologist now.

Like what are the odds she would remotely agree with this description?"
"You are right. ""but that's not true"" would also work."
"Even if she knows nothing about the new job or gf I wouldn't get back with her. You weren't manly enough for her, you were too goofy, she stopped having feelings for you and stayed out of obligation. Do you really want to be with someone that's said all those things to you?

She tried to find someone and realized she couldn't. Dont think for a second if she had hooked up with some attractive guy that she would be looking your way right now. Don't be her sloppy seconds."
This might be something to take to a couples counselor. You planned this pregnancy? And your husband wanted this baby as much as you? 
"Exactly. And that OP thought it was a good idea to introduce them after dating 2 weeks speaks volumes about his inability to judge appropriate boundaries and ignorance of attachment/bonding for such a small child.

OP, stop introducing your kid to dates so early. You should be dating for about a year before they get to meet your child. The relationship must be very stable and obviously lasting before you risk your child's emotions! What you did is the opposite. You let your child carry the emotional risk so you wouldn't get too attached to the girlfriend if it didn't work out. Ugh. 

You need to talk to your ex-wife calmly and rationally. Discuss qith her exactly what she saw that gave her concern. And LISTEN. 

IF she is wildly off-base and jealous, you can ignore her attempts to control the situation. But if she makes some good points, listen and make changes. 

Ultimately, she cannot control your dating life, and she won't get full custody because you have a girlfriend...but introducing your child to someone you've dated for only 2 weeks is irresponsible and will not endear you to the judge. If, in addition,  your son's mother has serious concerns about what is going on (based off the things outlined by u/Usrname52)...the courts may actually agree with her that your son needs time with you and not the girlfriend."
"By staying neutral, you are taking a side. False accusations are extremely rare, and with the circumstances you describe, there is a very high probability that your sister was molested (let's conservatively call it is 90% chance). Yet, it appears that you think there is a 50/50 chance that it happened."

"You can get some kinds of Gastroenteritis (eg Norovirus) from just touching an infected object and then touching your mouth. In fact people often don't know how they even got it.

Just keep your excuse simple, say you feel terrible with vomiting/diarrhoea, think it's a tummy bug, and are going to the doc if it doesn't get better. 

I'm so sorry this has happened. Kia kaha."
"This is good! Thank you, I'll combine what you said with some stuff from other posters and that should be good. "
"&gt; I was thinking of sending some small gift

Send her a big gift! 

My sister did something similar to me when my niece was a toddler - she was also teething and it was absolute hell. My sister said she would be back the next day and didn't get back till the evening and after a full weekend of my niece screaming at me for her mama I was ready to strangle my sister lol. The difference is I'm family and my sister does so much for me so babysitting is something I am happy to do. 

Tammy is a friend however and I feel like you didn't read the situation too well? If she didn't respond to the return time you suggested you should have clarified it before leaving. Like others have said a full 2 days with a toddler - especially for someone with a new baby - can be daunting! "
"She is more experienced than you and probably negotiated at the time of her appointment.

Don't dig a hole for yourself."
"This is the way I was taking her post too tbh; it seems like she is doing all the compromising and bending over backwards while he remains unwaveringly-stiff. 

Maybe I am reading it wrong, but that is about the only impression I got even after another couple of reads. I mean, it's good to meet your SO in the middle about things like this and make sure they feel loved, I just don't see it happening on his part?"
Bounce. This is an extremely simple problem to solve.
A 16 y/o for EIGHT MONTHS meaning it definitely may have started when she was 15.... barf barf barf
Thanks for the kind words. Gives me a lot to think about.
"Your attempt to Prince and Pauper this will do way more damage in the long run. If a dude acts weird because if this, then just end it and move on. Best to find that out early."
"Direct quote from the OP: ""My gf is way on the small side and doesn't really eat much on a regular basis (trying to save money)"""
I'd dump her in a hot second. What a betrayal. 
"This has nothing to do with whether either of them ""deserve"" their salary, or entitlement. Clearly equality is important to OP, but equality doesn't always mean 50/50.  Plenty of couples split their living expenses to be an equal portion of their income.  If both people agree to this arrangement, there is nothing entitled about it and it's completely fair.  I'd argue that this is actually the only fair way to split living costs in a relationship with a large wage discrepancy, and that splitting costs 50/50 would be unequal and unfair. That's appears to be what /u/lebronzeflamez is proposing - not that OP take advantage of her partner or something like that.

And not that this has anything to do with OP, but plenty of people work exceptionally hard and make great choices, but they're always going to earn less than others.  Unfortunately, ""you get out only what you put in"" is not actually true for a lot of people."
"There are 3 separate issues here:

1: he watches porn that doesn't look like you - eh, let it drop.

2: he looks at other girls when you're around - that is disrespectful! You should talk to him about it!

3: he doesn't answer your nudes - well, ASK him to!"
"Yes, you should have been faithful to him even before dating him. He's just that special!! "
"OP, please give him an adoption certificate rolled into a ceremonial scroll, carried to him on a pillow embroidered with two lovely swans :) (Or, you know, an in-joke from your own family instead of a reddit trope!) I so look forward to reading your update! "
"""Jill - Please leave me alone.  You are not at fault and you need to work on forgiving yourself, but by contacting me again and again you are simply stirring up feelings that I would prefer to leave buried.  Do not reach out to me again.""

Then block her on as many social sites as you can find."

"Be very detailed: 8 servings side salad, 16 dinner rolls, etc, and double what you think you'll need.

"
"Holy shit, this sub. Really? That's your advice? Just dump the guy she agreed to marry. Skip all the communicating, working on things as a team, etc. and go straight to the most drastic option."
This: Parents are not defacto entitled to more hours just because they're parents.
"I mean, does he *want* a shoulder massage when you are doing this?

I think the root of the problem is this: when you are touching him in this way, in your mind it is to show appreciation to him so *you* think it’s for his benefit or both your benefits. 

When you are touching him this way, *he* sees it as for *your* benefit, and doesn’t feel like you consider what he wants for his body or his agency. 

I had an ex like this and that was the crux of our problem. He thought he was being nice, I didn’t really want a shoulder massage so from my POV I was forced to stop what I was doing and just sit there while he poked and prodded at my shoulders (it doesn’t feel like a massage if you’re not into it) which prevented me from doing what I wanted to be doing and made me feel like a doll. 

Imagine if you wanted to be doing else and had to stop what you *wanted* to be doing so someone else could manipulate your body in ways that don’t benefit you, while they are convinced that they are doing you a favor. Now he’s spoken up about it and your reaction has been to reinforce that you’re totally doing it *for him*, but how can it be for him when doesn’t want it? "
Finding new forms of intimacy will likely be welcomed by your wife. It's only going to be creepy if you make it creepy. 
"You keep categorizing this girl as a ""barfly."" That's an absurd exaggeration for someone who goes out literally once a week and drinks a maximum of 3 drinks. "
"I mean, the fact the comment was out of nowhere and he never compliments your face is weird as fuck. That sounds more like his opinion slipped out than a joke. My girlfriend and I make mean jokes like that all the time but it's very clearly just us fucking around and we make sure we also know how attractive we truly find each other. If that wasn't our style of humor and she threw a comment like that at me completely out of left field I'd be pretty upset.

You need to bring up your concerns to him."
"&gt;I also found like 6 nugs at the foot of the bed under the covers. I don't even know what he was doing to get it there

the mind boggles, honestly. that must have been some seriously potent shit"
"Dude called her a whore! He didn't make any reference, he picked insulting ones!

It's been 2 months. You don't educate someone atter 2 months,  you chuck them back. Bad investment. "
"Yeah this is is something I'm afraid of. If I met him and he was actually just trying to interfere then he could ruin my relationship. If she's telling the truth and knew I'd met with her abuser behind her back it would (rightfully) destroy her trust in me. But then if he was the abused party and he reached out to me then I owe him one for taking that risk for me. I really don't know what to do. 

I'm not in the states so I'm not sure if I can see an arrest record for her unfortunately"
"&gt; Basically like the title says does this make me a bad guy or bad BF?

No, you're not a bad guy for not liking oral. However, you need to realise that this might be a dealbreaker for your gf."
"You can open an education fund like a 529 in your name but name their baby the beneficiary. That way the funds are earmarked for baby's education but the parents can't touch them--you are in charge of distributing the funds.  Utah, NY, and CA all run good 529 funds which don't have residency requirements (so for example you can open a NY 529 no matter which state you live in). 

No cash. No gift cards. Honestly, not even easily resell-able goods like a carseat.  Otherwise the baby won't see a bit of benefit from that money. 

-------

Also, and this is awful, but...be careful getting emotionally attached to the kid. I can **easily** see your sister a few years down the line holding your relationship with baby hostage for continued monetary support:

&gt;""Well if you really cared about little John/Jane then you'd give us the $500 we need to pay the electricity bill! Since you won't, then you don't care about him/her-- and I'll just tell them you don't love them anymore and you'll never see them again! Honestly, you were a bad influence anyway, what with your disgusting job and all! ""

Set up an education or savings fund for the baby, but be prepared to only have a real relationship with them when they are +18 and out from your sister's control. 😕


"
When boyfriends/husbands are attracted to another woman and are asked by their girlfriend/wife they over exaggerate to try to cover it up. This guy is a loser 
"Yes, thankfully we have a security guard who can be called 24/7. I've submitted a written complaint about what happened last night so I'm hoping that they'll be hearing from the board early this week."
"&gt;He already is infatuated with several new girls

And let me guess, they're also over 10 years younger than him? That's probably because everyone his age can see how immature and pathetic he is.




This post is just heartbreaking. Girl you have a lot more to offer than you realize, and he was just some creeper looking for impressionable young girls. I guarantee you'll look back on this and realize he was *not* the man he made himself out to be.


Just be thankful you only wasted 6 months on this guy. He's already got your head twisted around this badly, imagine what it could have been like if he strung you along for years. "
I think you should let the owner know. Patrons need to be able to trust they are receiving what they ask for!

"Honestly it isn't just our mom that Allison has issues with. Our mom is just her biggest target right now and currently the only one she's physically bullied. 

Over the years she has also accused me of ""trying to seduce her husband"" and our brother of ""claiming all our parents money"" (what money?) and various family friends of various other injustices against her. 

This is why it's so frustrating. It's exceptionally easy for people to believe her when she tells these stand alone stories but when you've known her her whole life like we have you know how often she lies just to lie. "
"I just left a ten year marriage to a man who didn't love my body. It kills your self-esteem. Seriously, from someone who has been there... don't marry him."
"Can I just suggest don't minor in Spanish just because of your boyfriend and his family. College is expensive and while it is good that you want to learn Spanish not all relationships last forever. 

If you want to learn Spanish because it's a good life skill, because it could help you in future with a career or if it's something you love, go for it! If it's just because of your relationship maybe consider a different subject."
"Being such a stickler over every penny and basically exacerbating the problem you were trying to solve. And, from the gist of your post, it sounds like this is a problem in your head more than it is a problem in your relationship. Your boyfriend seems to be more than understanding about your difference in income and happy to accommodate you. But you can't seem to look past your own neuroticism to actually believe and respect his own thoughts and feelings on this.

Imagine how you'd feel if the situation were reversed. Like, say you know your boyfriend is insecure about X thing and you always do your best to convince him that X thing is a non-issue, but despite how hard you try, he ignores you and instead drives himself crazy jumping through imaginary hoops solve this imaginary problem. Hell, you even knew about X thing when you two started dating and you liked him enough that it didn't matter. You knew exactly what you were signing up for. Wouldn't you find that frustrating? Wouldn't that make you sad? Now realize that this is what you're putting your boyfriend through. 

Also, I don't mean to imply that finances are irrelevant in relationships or anything like that. It would also be a problem if you two never talked discussed this stuff or figured out a practical financial arrangement. But the extreme opposite really isn't any better. The best route of action on just about any issue will usually never be in the extreme of either end, but usually somewhere in the middle.

The other commenters are offering really great advice in terms of paying for things in proportion to your salary, taking turns for dates, and giving gifts equal in thought if not equal in cost.

But you also need to find a way of dealing with your insecurities here unless you intend to find a more lucrative career because otherwise this will always be an issue."
"She said that you were not manly, not elegant, not grown up enough for her. There were **irreconcilable** differences  That was only 8 weeks ago?  What changed??

I would not get back with her at all... She said those things for a reason and she needs longer than 8 weeks to figure it out.


But if you're so in love with her still, why are you dating again already??  Are you going to hurt the new girl  by doing so?
"
"I think before you meet in public you should ask him to send you the screenshots. I don’t get why he has to show you those in person. Make sure you do a reverse image search if he does send them. 

Be extra careful if you do decide to meet him. If he is the abusive one after all he might be luring you to beat you up or worse. "
Yuck!! YUCK!! This guy is gross. Please get away from him. 
"You're right. This has seriously been keeping me up at night. 

The good news is, I haven't been skimming except for a few days and can easily add it back in with my nightly earnings. (I get a cash payout every night).

I didn't grow up with family, aside from my sister, so its hard for me to discern what is ""right"" and what falls under the ""well, its family"" category."
"If she wants proof (which I agree is a good idea), this is *not* the way to approach it.  This runs the risk of alerting Josh that OP is considering telling Anne and would give Josh and Susan time to plan a cover up. 

If she wants proof, she should have a verbal conversation and record it or have a text conversation just “checking in” but without indicating she is against it."
"Have been ghosted (albeit by someone who didn't mean much to me) but here's what I learned:

You might never know why, and it's going to make you feel out of your mind.

But in the end? It doesn't matter why he says he did it, because the truth is? He did it because he is a festering piece of excrement. 

I don't know you, but you sound perfectly lovely, and I am just sick for you. You don't deserve this, so whatever you do, remember that: you deserve WAY better than this.

It's hard as hell right now and it doesn't seem possible but one day you'll look at this and see his actions for what they are: embarrassing, pathetic, and laughable. He couldn't have a conversation so instead he... what? Developed some bizarre, convoluted plan to extract himself from your life? Instead of, you know... saying it wasn't working?

You know it's utterly ridiculous. He is a ridiculous person. This is more of a ramble than any advice because the only advice I could offer is that this guy is a piece of garbage. I am so very sorry. Please consider talking to a therapist to process the abandonment and the loss, and spend time with friends and family (and bask in their unending love) and know that some day you'll be happy and in love with someone who isn't a coward and you'll run into this jerk on the street and he'll run away with his tail between his legs and you'll laugh and laugh. Listen to angry music and write about it and take care of yourself."
"Well yeah, it's obvious that he's toxic. What you want is for her to start to acknowledge that so you can get her out of there."
"This. I think guys often under value the necessary role emotions play when taking on any challenge.  And feeling alone in that endeavor makes it so much harder.

Narrative and language matter a lot because they are the tools we use to figure out meaning. It’s important that your use and conception of “I” is being replaced by “We” if you want her to feel less alone. "
"You're not abandoning your sister's child, because the child isn't your responsibility in the first place, **even if you feel like it is.** I may be being mean here, but I think your sister's reaching out to you because she knows you'll be an easy source of cash. Seriously,, her husband can't find any job? At all? For five years? Flipping burgers, washing cars?

If you want to help the baby, *help the baby.* offer to buy them formula, or clothes, or whatever it needs. Maybe even ask for details about the rent and pay it directly, or some aspect of it. But don't just give them cash. Call me cynical, but your sister has demonstrated herself to not be a nice person already. Who's to say she didn't reach out a few months back purely for the sake of money, nothing to do with family connections? Start offering practical help rather than money and she may well make it clear she's only after quick cash, not actual help.

Either way, be very careful, keep your eyes wide open, and don't lie to your husband about it.

Edit: and yes, as others have said, any help you give her needs to come with a serious conversation attached. Because once the money goes, what's their plan for in a month's time? 6 months? A year? They can't keep taking money off you forever, and if they're got no real plan beyond vague mentions of ""we'll get by"" it shows they're not remotely serious about their circumstances, they're just taking whatever they can get. "
"It really grinds my gears when people excuse shitty behaviour by saying at least they're self-aware and have intentions to do better.

If you know when you're being manipulative, then stop. If you know when you're taking things out on him, then stop. It's really that simple, and it's not that bloody hard - just pause and do the opposite of your instincts.

Sure, this means you need an alternative way to deal with your emotions - and that's a lot harder. But that's what you have a therapist for.

It honestly sounds like your boy is a codependent doormat who feeds into your behaviour. You're probably both better off with other people. Him with someone who doesn't take advantage, and you with someone who will call you on your bullshit."
"I’m in the middle of this now. Just, don’t. "
"Ugh, how gross. He needs a reality check about what life is like as a woman."
This has to be the biggest Red flag ever. Drop that human garbage.
"What he's doing is violating consent. Sex is a private activity, especially when with a long term partner. You deserve and have a right to expect that, if you want it to be private, it will be private. The first time you asked him to stop, he should have. 

It honestly sounds like a kind of abuse and control. He's making your sexual performance a matter of public knowledge. So if you aren't up to his standards, then you'll be held publicly accountable. You aren't allowed the autonomy of deciding who knows about your sex life, you have to accept that it's at your husband's discretion.

He has very seriously violated your trust in him. And when you've tried communicating that, he digs deeper. Insulting you, trying to pressure you into sex, berating you for not giving it to him, etc. 

His goal with that little temper tantrum was to make you feel guilty. He wanted you to try and prove you do find him attractive and give him the sex he wants while shutting up about your ""feelings"" and ""needs"" and all that other crap he doesn't care about. 

Your husband is being a major, major jerk."
"I am about your age and one of my daughters is the age of this girl. I **would not** approve of her seeing someone *my* fucking age. Make no mistake: **SHE IS A CHILD**.


Please don't be that guy who causes turmoil in her life and possibly (probably) in her family. If my daughter insisted on keeping dating someone my age, it would be a difficult situation for my wife and I. The fallout might be catastrophic for both my daughter and her siblings (especially her older and very protective brothers) and ourselves.


I get it. You're getting older, and you're freshly free, and a (very) young girl is giving you attention. You feel young again. You **feel** like a teenager again, *but you're not*. You are in your 40's, and she just got the right to vote last year and isn't old enough to drink alcohol legally.



Also, If I found out this wasn't serious and you are 'just having fun' with my **child** on top of all the other issues, I'd have a hard time keeping my cool... and I am the most laid back guy you could meet.


Please cut this off. She is way too young, still a child. And don't give me the 'so mature' BS. She's not. She was in HS just 2 years ago. Remember being 19?? Think about that. She is not anywhere near mature enough to handle this relationship. End it.

"I wouldn't tell her about the vasectomy, because it's none of her business and she might just use it as ammunition to try to break you and your husband up. 

But I also think it's an absolutely terrible idea to pretend you're trying unsuccessfully.

That is a loving and caring thing to want.  Insisting on exposure to toxic people because it's practical may not be the best decision, and it must frustrate him that that is what you want.

I think you two need counseling.  A safe space to talk through these disconnects.  And stop flirting with the coworker.  Just revert to business only conversation."

"It has often been said on this sub, but in this case it bears repeating: When someone shows you who they are, believe them. Your husband has shown you who he is. He's someone willing to neglect and endanger his own innocent little children and lie to his wife (who was already handling a family emergency) in order to do something he wanted to do. 

Is this really the kind of person you want to be married to? Do you want your kids to be exposed to someone like this day in and day out? Either of them could have gotten hurt or died thanks to his horrific behavior, and you've made it clear this isn't the first time he's massively fucked up. I hope you see a divorce lawyer, file for emergency temporary custody, and document his actions. You and your kids deserve better than this. "
"&gt; she's never lived in a small apartment

Good God, what is wrong with this woman? It's called part of life and growing together as a couple. Before I went off into college, I had never lived in anything less than a big family home with housekeepers, cooks, drivers, etc. When I got married, my now ex husband and I could only afford a tiny apartment obviously with  no help. I didn't even think or feel like I was giving anything up or like I was downgrading or anything like that. I was just so excited to be married to someone I loved and start our lives and future together. We had little but it didn't really matter because we were happy and in love. "
You're not alone. I'm here.
"You might want to reconsider that. 

Before you got in touch with her (and her mouth breather of a partner) you were doing really well, right?

And now a few months of contact with them has sent you into spiral of self doubt and anxiety.

Trust yourself. 

You're good at what you do as a student (your grades speak volumes about that).  You'll be equally good in the workforce. You're nearly done with your studies, so it makes sense to finish them. 

Will you encounter sexism in the workplace? Probably.  So always make sure you have enough money  on hand that you could leave a bad job if you needed to. 

But good jobs also exist.  So get one, learn all you can and stomp all over anyone who tries to hold you back. 

If, after a couple of years, you find that engineering isn't right for you after all, then you can make the switch to a different career. 

The difference is that you'll be making that decision with a couple of years worth of savings in your account, and you'll be making a positive change based on what you want out of life. 

Not a negative change based on fear that a sexist old idiot might be right about you and your prospects (spoiler: he's not)."
Yes I know. My bf is also managing himself well now... well they'll just repeating that they saw some person got blind and some other person got his leg chopped off blablabla. They kinda just won't listen... They're educated and doctors and who am I to argue with them? *sarcasm
"Judging by how OP said he prides himself on watching it unlike other 'shit' shows, yeah, probably hasn't."
"Your girlfriend isnt ""quite protective"" - she is a controlling and jealous psycho who would rather your father died than you spoke to a woman helping him get the care she needed.

You are only 21 so you cant see how fucking awful this relationship is, but once you've left her you will realise and smack yourself for staying with her so long."

"Thanks, it's helpful to hear what others experienced in similar situations!"
"I just meant out of the house for a little while so she’s not there when he gets home. Like I said, go to a diner or something with the kids, and get a chance to collect herself before dealing with her husband. Maybe bring a pad and paper, and start writing down some kind of plan while the kids are calmed with mom’s presence and food. Much better they get some eggs and pancakes than face Mom screaming at Dad after what’s happened, you know? Just to catch her breath."
"I really think you should discuss this with the police. You were sexually abused for years. Your ex is a preditor, there’s no way he stopped abusing people after you.  Even if they can get him for crimes he committed against you, your testimony could start an investigation into him.
He very probably could be got on revenge porn/ child pen laws.

I’m really sorry about your fiancé. He isn’t the man you thought he was.  Give him some space to process. If he doesn’t know the history then write him a lettter.  But don’t wait too long for him.  "

"Your sister is an ADULT. To say she had no other choice than a coked out abusive boyfriend is a lie. At the least, she has you. 

I know this is a hard place to be because you love your sister and you love her kids but the kids are the ones who need the protecting. They are the victims here. They didn't choose any of this. 

You can love her but still hold her responsible for her choices.

"Be very blunt. If it happens again tell her: STOP CONTACTING ME. DO NOT CONTACT ME AGAIN.

Your husband is a lawyer - I would have him send an email (or reply to her last one) on his law firm email account instructing her to cease and desist from contacting you. This should refocus her energy to him if she won't stop. He can escalate the response from his office, away from you. 

Good job that you and husband turned your situation into a positive for foster kids! "

"So you don't want to go cold turkey?  You do realize you are putting Tess' feelings before someone else who did nothing wrong?  Your girlfriend?  

Prioritizing another girls feelings over your girlfriend's feelings is, in my book, cheating.  Pure and simple.  You may not have touched Tess, but you are putting her emotional needs in front of your girlfriends.  

Drop Tess now.  "
"Hey uhh, this sounds paranoid. But ask to see his texts with her. You know they've been talking for months, if older messages are missing that's a pretty big warning sign. Correctly he doesn't act intrusive, creepy, or flirty.

Im pretty sure he has at least a crush on this woman although my guess would be it's one sided. He might resent you for being between them if he wants her but doesn't want to go through a divorce in order to try."
Maybe cute presents too? I'm not saying throwing money at the problem but instead something thoughtful and meaningful to the relationship

"Do you live somewhere where homosexuality is a crime? If so, absolutely do not come out to your parents.  They may not call the police, but there's the risk your father might mention it to someone else who will.  If it's not a crime, then you need to decide if you're prepared to end your relationship with your family, because your parents may decide to cut you out.  I know that's not what you want to hear, but your father apparently has a severe opinion on this issue and his love for you might not be enough to change a deeply held belief.  Things will change if you come out, and you might lose familial and social relationships.  You need to prepare yourself for this emotionally.  If you have any relatives who are more moderate, you might try talking to them first and then having them serve as a peace-keeper with your parents. 

If you decide to come out, you should do something first. Look up the laws in your area and see if you can file for guardianship of your brother, or even share guardianship with your parents.  You can even phrase it to your parents as you wanting to make sure your brother will be taken care of if anything happens to them.   This way, if they try to cut you off, you will legally be able to still see your brother and take care of him. "
"Yea.  These comments are somewhat of an echo chamber.  ""Who cares if she didn't find you attractive, exciting, or sexy?  She's still with you two years later so you MUST be the love of her life!""

It's like they can't imagine wanting a partner who wanted to date me because she thought I was attractive, witty, and interesting, and not because the guys she wanted first kept burning her so ""ok fine he's stable, I'll give him a shot"".

It's like they think all functional 2-year relationships are completely equal, and guaranteed to be blissful in the future.  That NOBODY ever settles, ever.  That losing attraction five, ten, thirty years into a relationship isn't common enough even when you were into each other to start.

These people are trying to be optimistic, which is nice, but optimism is not realism.

"My best friend was nearing the one year mark and she and her husband had decided it wasn't going to happen right then and started plans to move to Africa. (Missionary work.) I was starting to worry she would have issues concieving tbh. The week after they sold all their stuff and quit their jobs they found out she was pregnant.

Happy ending - they got a lot of their stuff back, he got his job back (which was the one with benefits and stuff,) I believe she is a SAHM right now, to a beautiful rolly polly little baby girl who is a barrel of laughs and smiles. I'm so happy for them. 💜 I believe they're going to try to do Africa again when she's a bit older. I told them I'll start calling her Kady if she grows up in Africa. Sincerely hoping she gets her moms red hair for extra mean girls ness"

"Rather than going the petty route (which, honestly, is always appealing), I think you need to try to talk to him again about this issue (preferably when he isn't masturbating in front of you). If he still doesn't change maybe talking with a counselor/professional third party present will help you handle things.

EDIT: This comment is why I think there is some major hurt ego going on with him and that things COULD be sorted, he was just lashing out in anger:

&gt;he got angry and said the real reason I didn't like sex is because I hated sex and didn't find him attractive, then he stormed out."
And there's no fucking way a responsible breeder would *ever* allow their puppies to be sold out of a pet store. 
"If you listen to her more (instead of yourself), you will get it eventually.  But right now, you're delusional..

&gt; I love her. I know I love her, and I want to show her that not everyone is like she thinks. She trusts no one. Not her mom, not the people in her city, not me, not anyone except herself and I know that I can make her happy. I know she makes me happy.

Literally, none of that is true.  You can't truly love someone who you barely know, and you certainly can't make them happy.  It's also not true that she's somehow surviving in a poor, dangerous urban area without trusting anyone but herself."

"LMAO! 

If you believe that it was an accident then you need to let it go and not fuss at her anymore. She's got to be humiliated and feeling so stupid. You will probably do something just as boneheaded at one point and you won't want her to pick on you. "

Set firm limits. No dick pics leave the home. They don't get put in your work papers, they don't get left around your parents' house. Her getting butt-hurt is a smaller price to pay than you getting fired or charged with sexual harassment at work. If she continues to ignore the limits you set she doesn't respect you and thinks nothing of putting you at risk or embarrassing strangers."
"You without a doubt did the right thing. Her lies and (emotional) cheating would have only gotten worse, not better. It sounds like it was hard for you to leave her, but you found the courage, so congrats. 


I strongly encourage you to do some self-exploration on why you fell into this trap for so long. It sounds like she was obviously a problem all along, all your friends+family thought so but you didn't see it. She manipulated you for *years*. You must have a blind spot and I think you need to figure out what exactly it is, otherwise you won't be able to properly vet your S/Os and will ultimately marry the wrong person and live an unhappy life."
"For the record, I don't want to be the physical outlet (vagina stand-in) for my best friend. Hooray, he didn't cheat on his wife. Bravo. Quality human being there. But generally speaking people don't enjoy being vessels for their spouse's passionate lust for another person a room away. That's not flattering, that doesn't feel good, knowing it doesn't instill a lot of confidence or warm feelings, really. It's totally normal to be turned off and bothered by it, and frankly it's weird that her husband doesn't even get why it's hurtful."
"""We barely talk, but can I use your place whilst you're not there and I promise to totally not wreck the place and go through your shit once I eventually awaken from a drink/drug stupor?""

No. No to even one night. He's just a sofa-surfer who clings to friendships because then in his mind you're ""buddies"" and he won't feel awkward about asking because, well, you're bestistist buds!

I'd message him with ""Sorry. You can't stay here. I'd rather you didn't message back and I'd rather not see you again. Thanks for understanding. Hope you enjoy your trip."" He's an adult, he can budget/find somewhere else. If he can't he shouldn't be travelling to visit places and just expecting everyone else to put him up and pay for him/feed him/home him.

&amp;nbsp;

If he's already travelling guess what; his car go also go the other way! Result. They're really nifty like that. He can turn around and bugger off hom until he plans something proper or gets plans to stay with friends cemented more than 48 hours before he turns up. Tell him to grow up."
"I could not be facepalming harder right now.

Come on dude. You're old enough to know better. "
"Don't.  If she is cheating sure the accusatory tone won't matter.  But if she hasn't, framing the question like that would ruin the relationship. Maybe put it like;
""I found these, how come I haven't seen you in them before? They would look sexy on you. ""

Then you have a neutral question that if she has cheated you will be able to continue the questions.  And if she hasn't you get the answer without damaging the relationship further. "
"&gt;  That means OP got home 8 am eastern. Assuming OP is also eastern, the babies were alone from 10 pm to 8 am, which is 10 hours.

If that's true, that's INSANE.  I mean, leaving them alone for 30 minutes isn't okay at all either, but maybe an irresponsible person could think they could run to the store and get away with it."
"I mean this genuinely, not in an argumentative way, but what kind of legal action do you see being taken?


She has no legal rights to the house other than what's owed to her as a tenant by the state, which means 30 day's notice to vacate.


Presumably, it's pretty clear between the two of you what belongs to whom. If you're paying the bills, it's likely that most of the things in the house belong to you.


Since you're not married, I'm assuming you don't have joint bank accounts, but if you do I guess I can see how that would get tricky - but again, there should be clear records showing who deposited what in the account.


Do you think it's likely she'll try and take everything in the house and claim it as her own? 


Even if that were the case, depending on the worth of everything, that seems like it could be settled by suing her in small claims court, which doesn't necessitate a lawyer."

"Sorry to hear you're feeling this way. My best advice for you is to get rid of a physical ""type"" and expand who you're interested in. You'll have a much easier time finding love if you're open to more guys. You're probably being flirted with by more guys than you know but you don't notice because you've already disqualified them because they're not your type. 

It's hard to do, but try and get comfortable being alone and worry less about having a boyfriend because guys can tell when you're desperate for a man and it will turn off the guys you'd want to date. 

It can be an uphill battle being at a predominantly white institution but keep putting yourself out there in social situations and talking to guys. Rejection is hard if you're one of the only black girls at your school but the more you're in social situations (especially parties where people are looking to hook up) the better your chances are. 

Give us an update!"
"What you're saying is totally the truth, but it doesn't help to hear that at the time when you're heartbroken. As a girl, when I had problems like this as a teenager I always found the best way my family dealt with it in the immediate aftermath was just hanging out with me and helping me to forget for the time being. Buy some ice cream and watch her favourite movie, take her out somewhere fun, etc. Once she's over the initial shock of it, the rest of what you're saying will sound more real. Right now, it'll just sound like you're underestimating her pain. 

Also, it can help to hear your parents' own stories. If you have a horrible break up story from when your first love, tell her it, and tell her how it worked out in the end. 

Good luck! "
"So I went through the same situation. My husband and I rented a condo and the condo beneath us was owned by an old Greek lady. She would call in noise complaints over anything, like walking across the floor from bed at 11 pm at night to visit the restroom. She also called the cops on us in the middle of the night. I don't even know what I was doing. We were literally sleeping. 

So, we spoke to the resident manager and told him our side of the story. Wrote out all the times that she complained and the actions that we were doing in the meantime. Also wrote out all of the compromises that we made to her already (no tv or dishwasher running between 10 pm and 8 am, etc...). The resident manager said that he would do what was needed. 

However, the resident manager did nothing and our downstairs neighbour when she wasn't being listened to by the resident manager started physically knocking on her ceiling / our floor. One time, she went to the front door and buzzed us over and over again, causing our phone to ring, non stop for at least 5 minutes until we came downstairs. Then I told her that I was done. That I will not answer the door when she comes. If she buzzes me like this again I will call the cops, then I left. 

She never buzzed me again but kept up knocking on the floor. Honestly, after everything that I did the most effective way to get her to shut up was to knock back, 3 times as many times as she knocked. So if she got the broom and knocked three times, I would grab a pot and slam it down on the floor 9. Honestly, this was the only way for her to stop. If I started get lax and ""let her have her knocks"" they would suddenly increase. 

So basically, I:

* Spoke with the neighbour to try to make compromises

* Spoke with the resident manager. This ended my neighbour's ability to make formal complaints but didn't stop her from making my life hell. 

* Spoke with the police (who could do nothing)

* Finally started ""earning"" my noise complaints. This worked best.

"&gt; I thought you were going to say he was abusing the cat.

Me too I was bracing myself for some awful story, and then get this picture of a guy who won't even move lest he disturb kitty.

OP's BF: Keep the cat, lose the GF. "
"She was the adult eho directed a *minor* to take it. 

She would be charged in the same way people who use their kids to shoplift are charged. "
"Your gf definitely crossed a boundary... but ""squaring up"" and yelling about how you want to hit someone... that is violent/scary. Maybe you guys should just sit in separate corners."
That was my first though. If this was in a bad neighborhood or a good neighborhood. 
"&gt;  1, Your gf is totally amazeballs and your ex feels like her position as your son's number one mom is threatened by her and she wants her gone before he bonds.

While this isn't totally rational, I would have a hard time listening to my ex say ""This woman I've only been dating for a few months has a motherly love for our child, isn't that so great?"" no matter how great the woman actually was. "
"Thiiiss. My ex does this and felt he was justified to do it, even told me that other people think the same way as him. Combined with a bunch of other stuff that I ranted about on r/breakup about, I dumped him 2 weeks ago. I am now single and happy. He still talk shit about me and stalk my reddit account a few days ago. Just solidifies even more that he's scum, really.


OP, good on you girl. No need to continue dating an ass who has so little respect for you and the relationship that he would seek petty relief from talking shit about you to other people."
"A similar thing happened to me, OP. No children involved though. An acquaintance of mine moved into the apartment downstairs from me, after I casually mentioned it was vacant when she brought up in conversation (with a bunch of us) that she was looking to move. I didn't think that she would considering it was across town, but she did. I didn't dislike this person, but I knew her enough to know that she is self-centred and attention seeking.

At first it was kinda nice - we'd go for walks, bump into each other at the supermarket, wave hello, watch movies at each other's place.

But then it got too much. She wanted to see me and hang on almost every day. I started feeling hemmed in. She was also very very needy and every conversation would turn back around to how she felt. The straw that broke the camel's back was how I told her my boyfriend and I just broke up after four years together. She responded by saying how she just started randomly crying in the shower last night and then a monologue about her feelings in general without any mention of what I just told her.

So I started fobbing her off. ""Sorry - I need some alone time."" ""Sorry - I have to study. ""Sorry - that doesn't appeal to me."" ""Sorry - I've got a headache."" She could hear me moving about my apartment through the floorboards, no matter how lightly I stepped. So I couldn't pretend to not be home. 

Then she started making excuses to see me. She'd knock on my door to borrow things, then follow me into the apartment and start chatting and trying to prolong the conversation. It was quite ridiculous because we lived two blocks from a 24 hour supermarket yet here she was literally borrowing sugar! She would knock on my door to ask if I knew the answer to some random question ""Hey what time does the pub open, do you know?"" 

After several months I ended up telling her I will no longer be loaning her stuff because the supermarket is just there. So between that and my general disinterest in her, she got the hint.

*Then* things turned a bit nasty. She would make snide comments about me under her breath, and she also bad mouthed me to the rest of the social group. Neither were a big deal as her core group of friends were different to my core group of friends; we only socialised as a large group occasionally. She'd try to irritate me by smoking constantly on the balcony because in the past I had asked her to not do that; and she'd slam doors in the middle of the night and thump on the ceiling (my floor). Stuff like that. I never responded.

She ended up moving out after about 18 months. 

Anyway, not sure if that helps you any OP, but thought you might be interested to hear of someone else experiencing something similar."
"Not just you, I was getting the vibe that this is malicious. Either that or perhaps she's almost reveling in her 'guilt' in an unhealthy way. I'm think OP should go the more extreme route here to get this woman to back off. "
I bet OP is funding the trip.  
"Oh, boy.  How do you end up with this?  This stinks!

Catering the main meal while employees bring desserts and sides is possibly a happy medium that would fly with your boss.  

Otherwise, or maybe even in addition to the above, you could ask people to sign up to a list of things that are needed.  That way they are making a commitment to ""Yeah, I'll bring a couple dozen cookies""/""I'll bring rolls.""/""I'll be part of the clean up crew.""  

If nothing else, it might be enough to show your boss an empty sign up list.  Then you can explain to him ""Hey, everyone is busy like never before.  The potlucks used to go great, but it seems to be a point of stress to our employees now to make this sort of commitment.  Maybe it would be a larger boost to morale and community if we cater an effortless meal that everyone can sit back, relax, and enjoy with one another.""

Like you said.  These are full grown adults that hopefully remember the mess of last time and will do something to avoid it if given a bit of direction.  Hopefully?

I just know I don't envy you."
Yeah that was super weird. She was crazy and obsessed and I hope her boyfriend is now an ex and rightly terrified of her. 
"&gt; I've also befriended a special needs girl at lunch because no one sits with me or her and she's really cool and funny.

Block out the negativity, focus on this relationship and on others who seem friendly or at least neutral.  I know that's easier said than done. "
"Yea, this seems strange because there is no such thing as tickets to a cruise any longer.  You just check in - like at an airport.  The only  documents you need are the identification documents required - usually either a passport or birth certificate and driver's license for cruises from a USA port.   Perhaps OP had these needed ID documents in their suitcase and just simplified the explanation as ""tickets""."
"That doesn't do anything to discredit the idea that he's in love with you. His current tantrum is because he knows you're no longer available, even in fantasy.

If anything, what you've said increases the chances that this is what's happening."
"A coupla five year relationships? Fella you serious?
I'm thirty and not one relationship has lasted past the year mark. How do you do I it. If my tone seems mocking, it is only because I'm both flabbergasted and at my wits end. I can't make any relationship work beyond a few months and then wait until it kills itself. How do you do it? "
"Buy ""Divorce for Dummies."" Leave it on the counter with copies of the texts printed out. Put a sticky note with ""Should I even bother asking for marriage counseling with such disrespect from the both of you?""

But first make back ups of said texts in 3 locations he doesn't have access to. See if Alienation of Affection/At Fault divorce is in your state, print that information out. Ask him to give them to his side piece."
"They certainly exist, but it can be difficult if OP doesn't live in a large city. In NY, LA, San Francisco, and lots of other large cities we have ""Chinatown"" or ""Little Italy."" I'm not sure what they call the Japanese versions of this."
"Does Sara have vaccination records for the dog? Don't take her word for it, you need to see the records.

I'm really sorry this is happening OP, it's very unfair to you.  I think it's fair for you to request Sara do some training with the dog, and for you to get some help overcoming your fears (like therapy or counselling).  Approaching this as a problem you can all solve together as a family might take some of the conflict out of the situation. "
"Agreed. Most working adults aren't home at 9 a.m., I see no reason to assume he had his choice of people to ask."
He sounds like one of those teenagers who post dramatic song lyrics on their FB page. Is that someone you really want to be with?
He has a right to not want his kids in the company of people that abused you.
"OP, your ""control issue"" isn't your mother's responsibility. It's *your* problem, not hers. Buy and make your own dinners and lunches. For god's sakes, tons of parents make their kids move out at 21, and those who don't still don't provide all the meals like your mother does. 

Make your own food. Learn to discipline yourself and say ""no"" to fatty foods (if you can't learn to do that, then I'm sorry, but you'll never be able to lose the weight and keep it off. Self control and learning how to say no to yourself is a big part of serious dieting). 

If you still can't deal with being around your mother's cooking, then move out.  "
"Addiction is waaaaay more likely,  imo, but it could even be both.

Op, sometime between nailing his ass to the wall and getting a divorce lawyer, get yourself tested for stds. Either possibility puts you at risk."
"He's manipulative, he's gaslighting you, he's lying to you, he's abusing you. This is one of the most terrible ones I've run into on here. You need to break up with him. There is clearly no way to work with him on this. I GUARANTEE you this will happen again. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if he straight up raped you sometime in the future, since it would be OK, since you're in a relationship, and you've changed your mind before. BREAK. UP."
Just be gracious. They sound like lovely people. 
"I definetly believe your girlfriend. You said that she's always been good to you and that Dorian is a player and a misogynist. Of course a drunk player is going to try to make out with a girl even if she's dating someone.

Their stories are so different that it's obvious that he's lying."
"A small club can be better, because it's easier to get into. It's a lot easier to get to know 3 people than it is to get to know 30. Book club is also probably going to be more outsiders as well, so will have more sympathy.  Worth a try.

Loads of people get bullied at school, having 2 or 3 friends will get you through the day.  It'd be better not to get bullied but, well, life doesn't work that way."
"In some groups of guys, teasing and bullshitting -- verbal sparring -- is a common mode of interaction.  They wouldn't do it with a stranger, but once you become part of the group (i.e. become respected enough to be included), you'll become a target (and be expected to fight back, all in good fun).

You don't have to understand that or appreciate it, like I said, I certainly don't, but it's a mode of behavior that many guys enjoy."
"I’m so sorry, OP. He’s 1000% wrong for doing that. 

His thoughts on this are so distorted and deep-rooted I don’t know if talking about it will help much. It’s bad enough he turned it into something to feel guilty about, but the fact that he blamed it all on you is deeply worrying. "
"This is kinda tough for op as he still sees Alex as a woman inside might be why he feels like crap for being attracted to Alex since he is a straight guy. You can't really blame him since Alex does not take hormones, he still obviously fits into the spectrum that op is attracted to. This situation would probably be a lot different if Alex had a beard and op still had the hots for him. 

I see a cycle of attraction and guilt but at the end of the the day op should just be attracted to whoever he is attracted to."

"&gt;so I'm thinking we make a pact. When we are both around 30 - and if we haven't found someone else to marry by then - then we marry each other.

Lol, sure, go ahead and propose that to the dude you left for someone else that you're ""more interested in"". Let your new dude know too, while you're at it.

"Today is the first day of the new me, where I am active in this.

You're right, I have taken a back seat on this.  Not any more though."
I really don't like the idea of telling everyone she cheated on me. I'm not sure what good it will do anyway and makes me look spiteful.  
"&gt;  During the meeting I asked if I could have a cat, the landlord said that cats are no problem and then asked to my roommates if they were ok with that. Roommate A (with whom I have the problem) said that we could try it for 3 months and if it didn't work out, then the cat could go. So we agreed to it.

So you agreed to this, but now don't want to stick to it. Regardless of whatever your roommate did, the truth is you are blackmailing her to get out an agreement you made. It was a bad agreement, animals are not objects to be ""tried out"" for a few months and then discarded, but that doesn't change the earlier facts. 

Imagine this was a post from the other perspective - ""My roommate agreed to get a cat on a trial basis, now that I say it's not working for me, she is blackmailing me to keep it.""

It sounds like you are simply not very compatible with your roommates, and you threatening one of them will not have helped this.  How much longer is your lease? I think it's time for you to explore other options, where you can take your kitty and enjoy your space. "
Thank you! I will look into the non emergency number.
you realize that 7 years old for a cat is not old correct?
"You need to apologise to your brother and his wife for being so disrespectful!

Breastfeeding is perfectly natural, but it can also be something many women struggle to feel comfortable doing in front of others. Comments like yours do not help with that! 

I get that you are young and probably thought it would be funny, but making jokes about wanting to get a closer look at someone's partners boobs, whether they are breastfeeding or not, is probably not going to go down too well for you. When it's your brother's wife, who is in fact breastfeeding..... Well I think you've probably learned a lesson here

"This would annoy me too. She needs to learn to say what she means. If she wants more food she says so when you ask. If you stop giving in she’d get the point.
Don’t be a dick about it, but if you give in without at least saying hey next time can you please just get more when I asked, she won’t fix her behavior.

P.S. the whole men are more logical than women thing is bullshit and saying she’s “like a guy” when she acts logical is insulting. "
"I get it, and I'm sorry if my comment was combative. However, your comments make it clear that you are looking for the magic combination of words to make him understand and stop. And there is no magic combination. I understand that you are emotionally invested, and are trying really hard to find a way to believe you can make him understand and stop. However, since he won't stop, then... you know, I was trying to understand what the situation actually will be, not what you hope it will be. I'm sorry if I did it in an insulting manner."
"Wait, do you have shared finances? This cash... did he earn all of it or is he using your money as well?"
"The argue happened at the end of August.

I understand what you mean, I can be immature myself.

But at some point (and I'm not telling that this is the case) it's important to check the balance between immaturity and and antipathy.

Immaturity and childish behavior can ruin a couple. Having zero empathy for your partner is not acceptable (jackpot is when the partner has both). "

"Oh, honey. Of course *you* want her to put it behind her. Well, start taking ownership of your actions and start making it up to her. Couples counseling might be a good option for you."
"I don't see how you could have been more clear than saying you weren't interested before he even tried. I'm sure he didn't threaten you unknowingly...

Seriously, it wasn't your fault. "
"Sure, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it can be a duck.

But sometimes when you hear hoofbeats it's a zebra, not a horse.

Or I guess in Alex's case a unicorn. 

If you're not attracted to more masculine looking men and your attraction to Alex would change should he decide to pursue hormonal or even surgical treatment, then I think it's fair to discuss these things with him so neither of you are blindsided."
She might be getting passive aggressive stuff from your family that you aren't picking up on. Listen closely when they talk to each other. 
"It's normal to feel that way, it's probably a mix of both being annoyed that he ""gets"" to be happy despite how bad he was in your relationship, and also feeling curious why he didn't ask you to marry him. 

You'll get over it in a week or two, especially if you don't look at his social media again. 

It's odd how we feel a certain possessiveness over some of our exes, even the crappy ones! I'm the same way. "
"Even if your wife shows no signs of cheating, you still need to ask her about this. Otherwise, it will slowly eat away at your peace of mind and trust in your wife . "
"Amen. This line of thinking is maddening. It’s super great that OP can live in such an idealistic, transcending race and background world but unfortunately 95% of people and society isn’t that way. The presumptuousness is as impressive as it is asinine. "
"You actually suggested he euthanize his cat to save money? What. The. Fuck. Last month me and my girlfriend had to put down our 17 year old dog and it was honestly one of the most emotionally draining experiences I've had in my life. 

If you were a dog, you would not be a very good boy."
"You missed major anniversary plans with your BF because you were out partying too late, and you thin kit is somehow his fault for being irritated and short with you for it?  

Be happy he is still even considering staying with you, as if it were me, and you completely disregarded and disrespected our anniversary plans like that, there would be no more ""our"".

Grow up."
"Vom. That's even worse, somehow. "
"I mean, I wouldn't even describe her as your girlfriend at this point. She clearly has no interest in you or the relationship.

&gt;I should mention that my 21st birthday is on Friday and she's invited. 

I'd recommend you break up with her before then and uninvite her from the party so that you can celebrate without having to worry about her being there (though tbh I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't show up), or having the imminent break-up in the back of your mind.

I think give her a general ""Girlfriend, it's clear to me that you have no interest in maintaining our relationship; in fact, this hasn't felt like a relationship for many months now. I think we should make the break-up official and I would appreciate it if you skipped my birthday party on Friday."""
"Whenever we go out to get fast food, I like to order a soda while my boyfriend doesn't because he pretends he doesn't really like soda that much. Of course this ends with him drinking half of whatever I get.  Or that one time I wanted a chocolate McDonald's shake and he spent the whole time leading up to it shit talking maraschino cherries only to IMMEDIATELY eat it off the top before passing it to me. 

Whew ok what I'm saying is, I feel your pain, but I'm sure I have little things that annoy him too! I've basically combatted this issue by always ordering large drinks and shaming him relentlessly for his cherry-stealing ways. I think in general, sharing food/picking off each other's plates is fine and it sounds like you guys DO share most of your food. I think it's ok to be like ""sorry girl, these are MY special pretzels! Get your thieving hands off them!"" "
This relationship is completely inappropriate. He is the adult and he is not acting like it. Please please distance yourself from him. This is not a good thing. 
"TLDR should read; I ignored my girlfriend for a week, fucked off on my anniversary, and was generally a huge asshole to the woman that I’m supposed to love. Validate me! "

"Whether or not something wasn’t right, it’s not normal to write up details of people’s personal lives as some kind of reason for a project going south. 

Venting to coworkers on a break does not mean that personal problems are causing a problem with the work they are doing (if there even is one like you say), and acting like it is was a very sloppy and intrusive thing for the consultant to do. "
"The issue though is that my husband and all his siblings don't really see it as ""hoarding"" yet. Their argument is that they grew up on a farm and having 3-5 dogs isn't crazy considering the amount of space they had. Also most of the cats are outdoor cats that are basically half feral, so SIL would say they're not technically ""all hers."" 

I just think having 6 dogs while lacking the ability to pay your own bills is ridiculous. Dogs are not a necessity like food or electricity. Husband and his siblings disagree though, and think their sister's animals are just as important to her emotional well-being as everything else. "
Seriously. He's Mr. Budget but has no problem drinking the good stuff.
"Ah yes. The goo ole ""it will all work out"" when the reality is you've been the one making it work. Best cure for that is setting them up for failure and not doing the ""working itself out"" part for them. 

Though, if that doesn't work, you've got a deeper problem."
"&gt; he's done some hard to forgive things before

What sort of things?"
"SO scary to imagine that he's maybe done this before and OP didn't realize it. I would never be able to trust him with the kids as sole caregiver ever again. Even if he wasn't going to leave them alone, there's I wouldn't trust his judgment at all."
"I’m been in your situation and honestly a talk with HR about him is needed. The fact that everyone knows that he is pushing your boundaries and being inappropriate, but not speaking up to management confuses me. In my situation, HR had a chat with the older guy who wouldn’t take the hint and he stopped. It made the workplace more comforting because I didn’t have to feel guilty about rejecting him or anticipating a future rejection. 

Regarding him being a snobby jerk, I think it would be better for someone to make a formal complaint instead of this high school like behavior. It doesn’t really change anything. For example, instead of having talk to him about how his interactions are affecting his coworkers negatively, (so he can change it in the future) they are joking about him in public and private. If he ever catches on or learns the extent of these jokes, I’m sure he can put in some report to HR as well. It’s very messy and people have made reports for less. 

All in all, I say don’t take part in these little jokes/pranks because they might come back to bite you. Don’t feel guilty about his feelings due to your rejection. Draw clearer boundaries and make a formal complaint to HR if he persists. "
"Really need to second the other replies saying that if you give them money it's not going to stop there.  You don't have a relationship now, and you won't if you give them money.  You'll be their bank account, nothing more.  And the SECOND that you try to stop giving them money, even if it's trying to change to helping in other ways (like your reply below about trying to help find them job leads), she will immediately go back to calling you names, claiming you're selfish, etc etc.

She doesn't want a relationship with you, she wants your money, nothing more."
"Therapy for your wife, couples councilling for both of  you, and going no or low contact with her ghastly sister for starters. Your wife knew, I'm sure, her sister was going to ruin the day. She has probably ruined much of your wife's life and letting go (or at least learning to live with it) is something your wife needs to work on.

And then, plan a vows renewal and party once you're in a better place as a couple. And have time and money to plan it. Don't get divorced first, that's madness, but do it to celebrate 1st or 2nd anniversary. And of course don't invite the sister. "
"These are all great ideas. I know it seems like she's going overboard, but a lot of people spend their lives looking forward to their wedding day. For it to go *so* wrong can be downright traumatic. Plus, she has to deal with coming to terms with the fact that her sister is a piece of shit. That's a tough pill to swallow."
It sucks finding out someone that you always looked up to isn't the person you thought they were. Just make sure that you always have your fiance's back.

"I'm not a huge fan of pda either, but my boyfriend would be hurt if I didn't show some loving every once and a while. I really thought it was because I just didn't like it, but I ended up really digging deep, and it's because of my own insecurities and society's norms/expectations. If you're not on the same page, you're not on the same page. But maybe you should really think about why you don't like pda, and maybe you can come up with a compromise. I had to take baby steps with my boyfriend in order to get comfortable with pda, and I don't regret it."
"I know it’s not a big help but it’s typically over use of alcohol and drugs that cause the issues not just one time. So consistent drunk ness.

"You're not that well-matched if you can't have an important conversation with him.

"This will seem like a weird question, but I promise there's a good reason to ask it:  did the thought of him getting an STD test (as a requirement for you getting back together) even cross your mind yet?  If not, you need to turn down your emotions real quick.

&gt; He also cited the pressure of being away from me, his hard schooling and my family as the reason he was pushed overboard

Awww big tough navy boy has to betray his woman because he's stressed out with life.  Gimme a break.  I don't need to repeat what everyone else here is going to tell you, but c'mon.  Have some self respect and find a man who can handle life and who can find his own hand before he goes out and cheats."
"Hmm... he's trying to out stubborn you.  Stubborn him back.  I know he'll definitely pay attention if he suddenly has no clean laundry. Eating out gets really expensive too, so he won't be able to keep that up forever. 

Or even if you have a friend you can crash for awhile,  try that.  Make him realize somehow that he's an adult now,  and you're his adult partner,  not his mommy. 

I'm wondering what's going to happen if y'all have kids? Because I've done the whole ""we both work but childcare and housework is 100% on you"", and its a nightmare. "
"Dude. 

She said she didn't want to see you or talk to you again.

If you can't even respect this single, simple, clearly expressed preference of hers, why the fuck SHOULD she take you back? Nobody wants to date someone who 'knows better' what they feel than they do themselves.


Sorry, but if you contact her again it's not ""fighting for my woman"" it's *stalking.* This is OVER.  You blew it, lessons have been learned, move on.

TLDR: RL ≠ Hollywood."
"Keep in mind you were privileged to grow up in the environment you did. No doubt your friend lacks self-awareness, but you guys are young and she grew up with several disadvantages. Just have all that info at the front of your mind if you’re intent on maintaining this friendship. 

You’re not obligated to stay friends with her, just know that she’s had fewer resources than you. "
"This is the kind of thing people in healthy relationships discuss ahead of time, not after the fact. He should have let you know up front. "
"If you want respect, then don't give time to people who disrespect you. Take yourself out of the running as a place for her to crash. "
"I don't think it was him getting turned on that was the problem. I think it's the fact that he said ""that's because you're not my wife.""

My wife and I are very open communicators and think nothing of telling the other that a particular person is ""hot,"" ""attractive,"" etc. We can even say that about people we know. But we don't use those remarks in a comparative way and don't say anything that would hurt one another. So, no harm no foul. 

I don't think your husband finding that situation hot means he's more likely to cheat. But he needs to work on a communication style that you both can live with. "
"All of this. Maybe your wife thinks you don't want kids because you've completely checked out of the child bearing process, which is now starting to look like it's going to involve more than you both anticipated. "
"Good for you for quitting your job and realizing that you had your priorities way out of whack. But, unfortunately, it seems like the damage to your marriage is just done. 

She was *obviously* trying to fix things for such a long time, and you blew her off repeatedly. Honestly, I'm surprised that *you* were surprised by the divorce papers. 

I would honestly just tell her everything you told us about how you know now that you were being a shitty husband and you never want to do that again. Apologize, and then let her go. It seems like she's done and even a true turn around on your part right now may not change her mind. But on the off chance that she does change her mind, it won't be because you begged and made promises when you realized she was going to leave you. It'll be because you apologized and then actually turned your life around for real and maintain it and not just as a show to make her stay."
"In regards to the ""no details"", maybe say he's under contract with the government and you legally can't divulge any details about it."

"He was like “saying you’re sorry doesn’t change the fact it happened” he also added how I should have thought of the consequences of my actions might have on my future. It was so dumb, like dude not even you knew we’d be together one day. "
"Seriously, this problem obviously extends a LOT deeper than this one Christmas. Seems like she either 'can't' empathize with his feelings or is just too ignorant to realize she isn't."
"I wonder, how can people just pack up and leave? I let my (ex-)partner know for months that I'm dissatisfied, gave him a thousand chances to start caring about me and acting like a decent boyfriend and only after ignoring me for months, with all the hints that I'm going to break up, I broke up.

I don't get it how can you just lose your SO over the night with no hints that anything is wrong? They pretend that everything is okay and then, one day, they just go? What the hell is that?"
"Assuming for a second it's not mental health so much as self-indulgence, do you really want to date someone who doesnt work, has no hobbies, doesnt make time for you or for friends and is generally completely one-dimensional and self-absorbed?"
"I'm sorry you have so much anxiety,  you should be getting help for that. Basically what is happening is that your brain is stuck on danger mode,  and it keeps seeing threats to you everywhere and keeps trying to flash a warning loop in your mind. Its extremely debilitating even for adults.  I would suggest reading up on anxiety and trauma, and then using that information to ask your grandmother for options in helping you manage it.  Its not a problem that's just going to go away on its own,  like a cold.  If your grandmother isn't receptive,  try approaching the school counselor. 

But you definitely need professional help for this from somewhere because you don't have to live in fear and anxiety all the time. "

"&gt; How can I stop my mom from making an ass out of herself? She and Laura aren't seeing eye-to-eye on things recently, especially after my nephew was born and I feel like my mom is just looking for an excuse to chastise Laura and make her the enemy.

You can't stop your mom making an ass out of herself, unfortunately. This isn't really about you at all- it's all about your mother's feelings about Laura. She's using what happened as proof for her own prejudices the same way a person latches onto a headline as justification for racism or homophobia. Her beliefs are already set- she's just using this as 'proof' she's right. 

What you can do is be proactive with your brother and your sister-in-law. Make it clear to them that you don't blame your SIL at all for what happened and that you think your mother is out of line. Then, as difficult as it is, all you really *can* do is sit back and let your mother make a fool out of herself."

Please come over and give me life advice on how to solve all my conflicts. I hope OP listens to you. :)
"If 5 dogs plus all the other animals aren't enough to keep her at peace, how is one more going to help? At what point do you stop enabling her? "
That's extreme. She must have other issues besides that. 
"I would wager a fair amount of money that your girlfriend has already picked up on the fact that Donna likes you and that's why she jokes about it.

""Hey, I'm really sorry I didn't tell you this sooner but I kinda panicked.  Donna kissed me the other night at a party while she was very drunk.  I quickly stepped back and asked her not to do that again, and asked her why she did it, and she said she liked me.   
 She was incredibly, incredibly drunk, so she ended up crashing on Dan's couch that night, and I slept in the bedroom.  My current plan is to explain to her that I don't want to be friends anymore and don't wish to hang out with her again, but I wanted to just talk it through with you first - if you'd rather I just block her and ghost the friendship, I can do that instead.""

If I were her, I'd be incredibly, incredibly upset, not that you kissed her, but that you then slept in the same apartment as her afterward, and then didn't tell me about it for a few days.  This is going to take some time to rebuild trust.  But yeah, you're definitely going to have to end your friendship with Donna."
"Hm, I may do this, a pointed rsvp with choices of ""main dish, side dish, dessert"" and examples of each.  We had a guy show up thanksgiving with a single serve, from the vending machine bag of chips last year.  If it wasn't someone I knew I'd say it was passive aggressive, but no.  He thought that was cool."
I honestly had to do the same thing. I can't comphrend why OPs husband is acting like a 15 year old who finally got a girl to touch his weiner.
Just because you can doesn't always mean you should. 
"&gt; Given the situation, I don't understand how I would appear as crossing lines or not respecting healthy boundaries. What is it here that makes me out of line?

Oh, just the part where you're financially supporting another woman and her family. You say it's like she's your ex-wife and you're supporting your kids, but she's NOT your ex wife and those AREN'T your kids. So it's not like that at all.

You can do what you want with your money, but by doing this, you are showing your current girlfriend that you are emotionally and financially committed to your ex. And of course she isn't ok with that."
"Don't you think not remembering that it was your anniversary together in the first place hurt her feelings? You don't think that could make it feel to her that she wasn't as important? 

I don't think making excuses will help you in this situation. You want her to feel important to you, do something about it. "
"Always choose carbs. Fries before guys, OP. "
"I'm a former drunk myself, and I think you're doing the right thing.  There's no reason you should subsidize his self-destruction."
"Yeah, bud. I hate that it came to this, but your mom is going to let this get out sooner or later because she wants it so bad. She wants to place some type of blame on your SIL, so she's going to do it. This is the best advice I've seen. Call your brother and SIL to tell them what's going on and how you've tried to cool things down. Hell, I might even tell other family members what really happened. As for your mom, she's going to have to work through this on her own...whatever it is that is causing her to dislike Laura."
"Yeah, sorry. My parents were the type that wouldn't let me and my first bf sleep in the same room. If this guy was my bf and he told me he was going to smoke, I would be like ""Are you serious? You've been here how many times? Damn, you are fucking dumb."" 4 years.... this guy should have really known better.

Spoiler alert: my first bf pissed out of my window and my parents caught him and would you look at that.. we're definitely not getting married. I look back at that moment and I'm really surprised I just didn't end it sooner."
I bet it will be pretty embarrassing for her when she has to explain to people why you broke up.
"THIS is why women don’t report sexual abuse. THIS. You immediately jump to “why didn’t she tell us first”, instead of “I need to get my brother away from her and get my sister help ASAP.”
Stop. Just stop. Your brother most likely sexually abused your sister. Believe her. "
"&gt;but says that from his perspective it's my insecurities that won't allow me to get past this

LOL. No, it was the MULTIPLE sexting betrayals that caused the trust issues. Not your insecurities. What an asshat.

What has he done besides counseling to attempt to restore trust? Did he open his phone and computer to you for a period of time?

Honestly, I think you may be right about leaving the relationship. The fact that he still takes zero responsibility for his role in the trust problem and spins it around to be solely your issue is just disgusting and means that he likely will do it again (if he isn't already)."
"Unfortunately I think you are correct. And good point. Who knows what else went on behind my back.

Edit- OP posted below that she does think this is the case.  
  
It's your journey to decide whether you want to stay with someone long-term who is likely to always struggle with this.  Protect your own health first.  If you start to feel bad about yourself (as opposed to just being annoyed at him) you HAVE TO break up.  There's no other option.  
   
But while you work on this, therapy needs to be an ultimatum.  And literally every single comment about your weight or health needs to be met with ""have you made that therapy appointment yet?""  No engagement, no arguing, just total dismissal of the idea that he gets to say this shit."
"You are leaving the door open for him to come back and try to win you back with a big gesture.

At this point you are being a drama queen. You are politely threatening to break up with him in an attempt to open his eyes. Spoiler alert: they are already open. This is the maximum level of effort he will ever put in and he thinks it's okay.

You are right about everything though, he isn't trying, puts it all on you and doesn't appreciate your effort, but by being all ""woe be me I am exhausted and done, now it's his turn"", you aren't fixing the problem.

You have one choice to make. It's never an easy one, except in hindsight and from the outside it seems obvious. Do you want to be in this relationship or not? Yes? Then you have to accept that this is it, this is what it will be like, because he isn't putting in any effort and he isn't going to change. No? Then you need to commit to it and don't use uncertain and conditional phrasing. 

Text him once more ""This isn't working out for me. We are not compatible. I am breaking up with you. I will get my things later."" Then stick to that. No more dramatic ""he will win me back"" bullshit, because he won't. No more second chances, no more trying this again tomorrow. Done.

After you get your things, go no contact and work on yourself. Yes, being single can be scary at first, but it beats this relationship by a thousand miles. 

Good luck. "
