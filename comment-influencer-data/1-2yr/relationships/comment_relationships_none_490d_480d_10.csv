"You shouldn't apologize for 'going there.' 14 year olds should not be having sex with adults, and 16 year olds should not be having sex with 6th graders,"
"Yo - 

Over the last two years, I’ve gone through similar (though I’m in my late 20’s), I’ve experienced much of the same. I decided I was done living in my poor mental and physical health space. I got a lot of counseling, started hitting the gym before work, went back to school, and quit smoking (as much) weed. I never really cared what my friends did and would mostly babysit them to begin with, but the moment I started saying no to smoking or drinking with them (or saying no to “just one more”), they stopped calling to hang out. I made my attempts to get together with them and was met with the cold shoulder. 

I had to learn this, and sadly, it sounds like you do too: people grow and change at different times. You are growing up and maturing at a faster rate then your friends and they are probably jealous and not yet ready to do the same. Something my therapist taught me was having two types of friends: ones that help you grow, and others who you help grow. Find a group of people that help you be a better person. I found that hanging out with my senior co-workers and spending time with people who were better students then I helped me continue on my path. Ie find people who will help build you up. On the other hand, help others in their path when they want it. Your current group doesn’t seem to be there yet, and it seems like you outgrew them. It’s time to stretch a little more and get to know some new people. "
"I have depression and anxiety. I admittedly have days where something in brain doesn't work and I'm a mess. But I'm working on it. My husband is supportive on my bad days but I can't imagine subjecting him to a whole year of ""bad days"" while only taking meds. I lean on him but I don't ask him to carry me. That's not his job. 

I take meds, go to therapy, and implement action plans to help me overcome certain difficulties. I understand you wanting to be sympathetic to his mental illness but there comes a point where you have to look out for yourself. He's not being a good partner and that's on him not the anxiety and depression. "
Sometimes the trash takes itself out.  Enjoy your new home.
"Your wife needs to go to her doctor about all of those UTIs. 

Is she seeing someone about that, or is she just telling you that to get you off of her?

"Mid-20's is kind of the point in your life where you figure out who you are; it's normal that people change a lot in their earlier 20's, which is why lots of relationships entered into at that point in life fail as partners grow in different ways.

You are still crazy young. "
"I feel like the ""European""excuse gets thrown into American faces whenever someone wants to try and manipulate us.

One guy, months ago, invited himself and his toddler to a poster's adults only weekend. He then proceeded to get pissy and talk about how ""Europeans"" involve the whole family and blah blah blah. Like, whatever dude,Europeans use babysitters sometimes, same as we do. They were all Americans, btw.

I have seen the European thing come out several times in the most obnoxious ways,but after living in Europe myself,I can safely attest that these sort of people who try to play that card are just being ridiculous."
Nothing hotter than a 31 year old who has an online presence of an arrogant 13 year old.
"&gt;...but the main one that is standing in the way of us rebuilding and starting over is her stated lack of attraction to me or any desire to be with me.

She doesn;t want to be with you.  Sorry this is really tough, but you need to move out and try to move on.

She can be all these wonderful things and can have all these attractive personality elements, but she treat you like shit and doesn't want you.

leave her. look for happiness instead."
"I'm sorry, you're being disinvited from your own things - you have brunch with your husband and another friend, and she not only invites herself along, but also asks for you not to be there? Like that's okay?
And you have plans, but then can't come to dinners you were going to be part of, because she's now choosing to come?
Go to the brunches. Go to teh dinners. Her problems with you are her things to deal with. She can arrange brunches and meals and invite who she likes-- it's not even remotely okay to disinvite someone because someone else wants to go. Whoever was invited and says yes first has priority! Always! Because it's being a lousy person and a lousy friend to disinvite someone, and it's saying that they value you, not just less than the other person, but that they don't care about it!"
"&gt; What she doesn't realize is that he knows he's hurting her, he just doesn't care. 

I agree with you, but my own opinion actually goes a step further. I believe that people like this know that they are hurting their romantic partner *and that's why they are doing it.* Like it's beyond not caring, you do care about hurting them in the sense that it's your goal. "
"Because putting up with bad behavior for the sake of not rocking the boat usually just causes resentment.  

That resentment boils over to the point where people explode or it keeps coming out in small ways. Snide remarks, passive aggressive behavior etc. Or expresses itself as general unhappiness. 

There's people who truly don't have many boundaries and can forgive and forget quite easily, but they are rare and in my experience tend to get taken advantage of (even if they themselves don't feel taken advantage of) 

Boundaries are good. Communicating your boundaries is also good. Pretending everything is good when it's not is bad. If your partner can't listen to your concerns and work with you, that doesn't really lead to a happy relationship. 

From my observations, the unhappiest people are those who put up with bad behavior and never assert their boundaries. Why? Because they martyr themselves and end up feeling used and abused, complaining and feeling like victims because they're too afraid to create conflict. 

Being agreeable is different. Agreeable is letting someone choose the music for the road trip or pretending you like your aunts cooking.

"If his dad had settled down more, he wouldn't have felt that dating his son's girlfriend one month after they broke up was an option. 

 Why would the baby have two loving mothers?  OP's mom is not married to OP's dad or even with him anymore, and regardless of what she thinks, she has no claim to her ex's girlfriend's kid and ""Alice"" is going to be writing in to /r/JUSTNOMIL if she tries to get involved.  

Also Alice is doing drugs while pregnant, so... if I was OP I'd be calling CPS to alert them that they need to be testing the baby and mom when it is born.  

And if you can't see how awkward it is that OP's ex is going to be the mother of his new sibling, wowzers."
"&gt; No one ever warned us that this happens.

If you can say that and mean it, then you have not done the least bit of research on her (your!) birth control method. Heightened arousal and attractiveness is mentioned in every single site and document I’ve run across, and covered in the classes the church offers."
I'm scared for OP and it is not based on the question she's asking. Sweetie you were 14 being taken advantage of by a 40 year old man. He is very sick to fill your head with his ideologies

"Greed does terrible things to people. I have seen a formerly happy and cohesive family turn against each other over just five thousand dollars. When someone has money and someone else feels entitled to it, it will get ugly. Greed is ugly. They don't respect your uncle enough to follow through on his wishes, because his wishes deny them some money. How silly and selfish can you get?

I'm sorry, OP, that the cost is so high. And I'm sorry you had to find out your family is like this. They are making a poor choice."
Your wife might have interstitial cystitis. She needs to see a uro either way. It's not normal.

"I have three best friends who are no\-context bridesmaids for me and are all each other's best friends... the one is getting married soon and her bridal party is entirely her family members plus her maid of honour \(my other bridesmaid\) \(third friend is my maid of honour\) and she was stressing so much about telling us that we weren't in the wedding despite being her best friends, and it basically just came up and me and my maid of honour were like, ""Okay, yeah, you have a lot of family members you're close to, deciding who should be in the wedding party must be hard"" and she goes, ""yeah, I wish \(fiance\) had more friends so I could include you two!"" and we went, ""Yeah, but what can you do.""

"Ugh. This is nothing more than a bullshit line that men use to excuse their jealousy and controlling behavior and manipulate women into putting up with said behavior. 

First of all, why doesn’t OP’s boyfriend trust other men? What is he worried they’ll do? Rape or sexually assault his girlfriend? Maybe, but I doubt it, because the steps women take to protect ourselves from being attacked look nothing like what OP’s boyfriend wants her to do/the changes he wants her to make. So let’s not pretend that he’s trying to control the way she dresses for her benefit, or out of genuine (if misguided) concern for her safety, because it doesn’t benefit her in any way, shape or form, and it doesn’t mitigate the possibility of her getting raped. 

So if not rape or sexual assault, then what is OP’s boyfriend so worried about? I think we all know that he’s worried about other guys noticing “his woman”, checking her out, thinking she’s hot and that they want to bang her (I know “bang” is kind of a crude way to put it, but I used a crude term on purpose), hitting on her, etc. You know what I say to that concern? Grow up. 

There is nothing we can do to predict, control or change the behavior of random men or the fact that they find us attractive and sometimes act on that attraction. Yet the fact that OP’s boyfriend might claim that his issue is with other men and not his girlfriend, he’s still blaming her for causing the issue and holding her responsible for fixing it by completely changing the way she dresses. So the woman gets punished for a random man’s boorish behavior, while the man is absolved because, idk, men turn into sex crazed zombies at the sight of cleavage? 

Women are going to be checked out, judged, rated, flirted with, treated like nothing but sex objects, hit on, harassed by and much worse by men. It’s a fact of life for women and a reality we have to deal with every day, regardless of what clothes we are wearing or our relationship status.  
Yet people like OP’s boyfriend don’t take even one second to consider how this treatment and behavior effects women or makes them feel, beyond maybe assuming that women “like the attention”. They act like the other guy is trespassing into his marked domain and tying to steal things that are his. 

But we are not things that are owned by one man but can easily be stolen by another. We have agency! If a guy is checking out a woman, she can ignore him. If he’s flirting with her, she can walk away. If he’s hitting on her, she can decline his advances. But the whole “I trust you, I just don’t trust other guys,” mindset is based on the assumption that a woman is powerless against a man’s advances and that, at the first hint of interest, she will rip her clothes off and fuck the guy right then and there, fidelity be damned, because apparently women have roughly the same level of brain development as an amoeba. 

So, I’m going to have to disagree with your assessment of OP’s boyfriend and say that it’s pretty clear who he does and doesn’t trust.

"Yeah.  He blamed the door?! What, did the door decide to open and stay that way on its own accord?"
"OP, a few questions:

1. Why aren't you or other spouses tagging along to these big weekend group outings where the moms/kids get together? Have you never asked if you can come along or has someone specifically said, ""Partners are not welcome""?

2. What kind of daily routines and rituals do you have with the eight-month-old baby and the two-year-old? How are you reinforcing yourself as a familiar and constant presence in their daily lives?

3. When did you notice your wife shifting her support/brainstorming discussions from you to her mom-friends? And what are some examples of problems she took to her friend group instead of you?

"She actually isn't aging faster than you since you're older than her. Any time you start to feel down about her age, just remember if she were following your lead she'd be the more technically correct party. You also probably aren't aging the way you think you are, sorry, we don't see changes in ourselves the same way other people do. You're getting older even faster than she is. Time to come to terms with it. "
"People age, man. It's a fact of life. We're all allowed our preferences but this isn't exactly something she can change. Either you suck it up and appreciate her for who she is and what good qualities she has, or you leave. You're in control of that. "

"I wasn't aware breaking your ankle was considered bridesmaid treason. /s       

So she'd prefer to have her nose bent out of shape about you having a bad accident during her bachelorette and remove you from the wedding party, rather than risk sharing a few instants of the spotlight she'll be basking in the entire day long? Classy.      

It sounds like the wedding is just bringing some of her character flaws to the forefront. Definitely decline her insincere invitation -- I love /u/DiTrastevere's suggested wording for doing so. I would probably let the friendship fade after this, but if you think she's worth it, you could reach out to her after all the wedding fuss is over and she's had time to come back down to reality. I'm sorry you had to find out what she's made of this way, and I hope your ankle gets better quickly.      "
"I agree. It is hard to be in a healthy relationship with someone who is so uncomfortable with their self. That doesn't mean that OP should cut and run, but it does mean that this is something that he should spend some time and energy on improving before the relationship progresses. Which will mean getting to the root of the insecurity, and figuring out what to do to improve the situation."

When my mom got diabetes it took 7 months to get an initial appointment with an endocrinologist. Even her ideally every-three-months follow up appointments can be six months apart. The times I've had to switch PCPs it took me up to a year to get my first appointment with them. Is it generally longer in Canada?"

At this point he needs to stand up for his wife too. She has obviously been abused her entire life by them and is still living in fear. This is insane. Kick them out.
"I'm unclear whether 

a) Mom lied to the police that the dad hit her, and he subsequently went to jail for 2 years, or
b) Dad went to jail for 2 years for ""something"", but mom lied to the children about the reason (saying it was for hitting her)

Tbh I find the first option to be extremely improbable. It's hard enough to get convictions for people who are actual domestic abusers - it would be pretty rare for someone to get convicted on no evidence besides false testimony. It does happen, but I think (b) is more probable. In which case OP needs to find out what his dad actually went to jail for."
"&gt; When I asked him if she knew we were still together, he mentioned she had asked, ""wouldn't i_chug_butter be upset?""


This blows my mind. OP is using it as proof that the ex knew she existed and didn't care... but seems to completely ignore how her boyfriend might have responded to that question.




Hint, OP- a good boyfriend, when asked that question, would say, ""Yes, she would care. And I care about her, so you need to get off my lap.""




Honestly, the most likely context for that question I see is if it was HIS suggestion she get on his lap. Which seems more likely: 


1) She sits on his lap, starts kissing him, and then decides, out of the blue, to remind him about his girlfriend, by saying *""wouldn't OP be upset?""*



OR




2) He pulls her onto his lap, holding her and flirting. She says, ""Wouldn't OP be upset?""  *in response* to his behaviour, and he says no/who cares.. and THEN she starts kissing him."
"You aren't *wrong*, and your boyfriend seems to be overreacting/exaggerating, but I don't think it was handled in the best way possible.  It sounds like you already had plans with your boyfriend, which you informed him were now cancelled/rescheduled, correct?  In general I think it's polite to check with someone before changing plans on them whenever possible.  So instead of ""don't come over, my friend will be here"" it's ""hey, remember friend X I was telling you about?  She wants to come over and do Y with me.  I know we had plans to hang out, but I haven't seen her in months and don't know when my next chance will be, would it be okay if we rescheduled?""  Giving him input would make him feel more valued, and it sounds like his core problem here is not feeling like he matters.  Again, he seems to be taking it to an extreme, but I can definitely understand him being hurt/disappointed."
"If you want to keep your brother, you better dump your bf."
"I apologize if I used stigmatizing language, I was under the impression that identifying yourself as deaf fell under the category of a disability, but TIL.

"You are entitled to tell as much or as little about yourself as *you* want. Believe him when he says he’s fine and happy with what happened. Keep checking in, but remember that you don’t owe him anything, he isn’t entitled to any part of you, physically or emotionally, and if at some point what you’re ok with giving him is different from what he says he needs, it’s ok to say your goodbyes. You aren’t tricking him, lying to him, or doing anything under false pretenses. You are communicating your needs clearly, and one of those needs is for some privacy. Enjoy your relationship with him, keep being honest with him and yourself. You deserve love, affection, and kindness. "
"I really recommend the book “Not Just Friends” by Shirley Glass. It talks in depth about what it means for partners to be willing to draw boundaries in their relationships with other friends. One idea that stuck with me is that if your partner has a friend of the opposite sex (or same sex), that person needs to be a “friend of the marriage.” Like, you’re included on communications and invited to events. And you build trust with your husband by having him enforce those boundaries, not you. I’d be pretty miffed if I had to take another woman’s hands off my husband’s face at a party, because he should have done it himself. "
"Having an opinion is not ""very controlling"". He didn't say anything to her, and he's even asking for advice on what to do and what to think. Don't make him feel guilty for having an opinion and asking whether he's right or wrong."

"He is very argumentative with his close friends, but as far as I know people at work really like him. His friends usually will just cut it short and say sorry so they don't have to argue but I took it too far this time. "
"I agree completely. I think there are legitimate arguments on both sides of the ""should he tell the wife?"" question. I personally lean towards telling her, but I can understand the other side and it wouldn't automatically make me think someone is 100&amp;#37; okay with cheating or whatever if they didn't think it was their place to tell their cheating friend's spouse.

Hanging out with his friend and the mistress takes it to a different level, though. Spending time with them as a couple tacitly condones and legitimizes the relationship. It also seems more like a personal betrayal of the OP's husband against the wife, because I'm guessing that they sometimes all spend time together, since that's the norm in most friendships I've had. It's one thing to know your buddy is cheating and not speak up, but it's a different thing to hang out with the mistress one evening and then have a BBQ with the wife and family a few weeks later.

I think this warrants further conversation once the OP has time to gather her thoughts. I would be uncomfortable knowing that my partner was seemingly okay with this and want to talk it through."
This is exactly the reason I rarely see my sister anymore and have significantly cut down on contact with my mom.
"Holly is enabling her family to be lazy, unemployed and irresponsible. As long as she continues to support them they will take advantage of her. She is making a choice to stay in their cycle of poverty. There is not much you can do. She and her family are happy enough with the set-up.

"It's the end of discussion because you're not contributing anything, right? That's what you meant? "
"I don’t really see how this is your fault. You made a mistake, but she left $3000 sunglasses in a car. "
"&gt; After those three days, I call my girlfriend to see how she is doing and how it was with her friend.

This is the part that concerns me. In a healthy relationship each partner communicates openly with the other. That does *not* mean you are asking each others permission, but it *does* mean that you each transparent about what's happening and how you each feel about it BEFORE IT HAPPENS. 

None of us know what really happened during those 3 days, but if you were feeling uncomfortable with the arrangement you had every right to voice that concern and be heard. She still had every right to make her own decisions, but there's a conversation there that should have taken place and didn't. 

Now that you're on the other side of it, try to ask yourself why you feel uncomfortable. Is it because you weren't given all of the information beforehand? Is it because she's acted (now or in the past) in a way that harbors distrust? Because society tells us the lie that males and females can't be platonic friends, *especially* when one or both are in a monogamous relationship? Because you have some insecurities that need work? It could be one or all of these things... it could be something entirely different, but at the end of the day you need to find out why you feel the way you feel right now and open a dialogue with her to discuss it. Lack of communication and lack of trust will murder a relationship and it sounds like you're well on your way to both.

Good luck, I hope you come to a peaceful resolution. "
You're working on yourself? There is absolutely nothing wrong with you. Get rid of her. 
"&gt;I'm frustrated, he's being short with me, should I apologize?    


I actually think you're both in the wrong here, frankly.  


Yes, a 27 year old man who can't get his ass to work in time and then tries to make it your problem is pathetic. I would be annoyed too.  

But, the lunch thing is just weird and I can't help but feel you created that tension. It sounds like you were pouting (refusing to eat, even at the place YOU suggested to go to) as a means to cause drama. You were mad at him about his journey to work, and basically used passive-aggressiveness to make a scene.  

Is this type of exchange typical for you guys?

"Even if they're not red flags, why would you continue dating something that clearly has much different expectations from the relationship than you do? He wants something serious, you don't. That's reason alone to end it"
"He's almost definitely nervous about it.  It's not something he is into, and you have made it clear it's important to you.  That's more than a little bit of pressure.  It's definitely something you should try to ease him into if possible.  

Baby steps."
"She has tried talking to him. Before just going to not eating the food, I think she should try one more time ""I don't like when my food has burn marks in it, and I don't like xx. If the food turns out like this again, I will not be eating it."" or ""don't cook food for me anymore, I will make my own when you are done."""
Good idea!
"I hope Nancy excels at generosity and kindness, as well as she does everything else.. "
You kind of sound quite picky with her. Who cares how she eats dumplings? And you may think she’s going to walk in to traffic but she has survived this long without you to protect her. I feel bad that she has a boyfriend who obviously thinks she’s a twit. Move on for both your sakes.
"Have you asked her how she is feeling at the moment? Is there are reason behind her behaviour?

Sometimes teenagers are really short sighted and don't think about how a lack of education might impact their future. Can you have a discussion with her in a calm way about your fears. Maybe if she understands why you want her to get an education she'll take it a bit more seriously?"
This. We need some details. Might provide some insight into why the ex is the way she is. 
"Hello there, I honestly feel genuinely bad after reading this, since a similar situation led to the break up of my first relationship, I can assure you that her behavior is not okay and you won't able to come on top unless this woman REALLY loves and cares for you.

For her to get mad/sad when she misses out on these goings out is a MAJOR red flag and the talking with co-worker until sunrise is just a blatant spit in your face, there's absolutely no reality in which this is okay for a married woman, sorry man. That is indeed the start of an affair, an emotional one so far and it will most likely progress in to a sexual one, speaking from pure experience here. Just sit her ass down, tell her how you feel and that this is so not cool and if she wants to keep you in her life she seriously needs to re-evaluate her relationship with these people. This isn't jealousy, honestly if you aren't jealous from this behavior then you don't give two shits about her. And another thing, she is your WIFE, not your girlfriend, why she thinks this behavior is acceptable in any shape or form is beyond me, she shouldn't be risking her marriage for fresh male attention, and she should be over that period of her life in my opinion at that age..

So to summarize you have to act fast and tell her how this makes you feel, that it's not okay and that you aren't a blind idiot and that she's gone way past the comfort zone."
"Don't feed her attention whoring. Like for real, I can't I'm busy is a great excuse and then turn off notifications. 


I wonder what the odds of her blowing up the first time you refuse to mow her lawn or favor. She is a woman, but she can mow her own grass. Don't be a doormat, she's taking advantage of you. You can also say ""I think this friendship is hindering me having a girlfriend and I need a week of radio silence.""



Set some boundaries, read The Gift of Fear, or google healthy friendship boundaries, and whatever you do **do not date this woman or stick yo dick in crazy**"
"I agree with you- I think I am going to need to suck it up and go talk to his parents and ask them to give some sort of explanation to him. I don't know if they would freak out if I gave him a gray-area response, just because I've never really had any confrontation with them.

I just don't think that it will go over well in the long run if someone doesn't come clean to him- I think he would be extremely hurt to know that he was worrying about finances and working his ass off for many years, while I and his parents were sitting there carefree knowing that an inheritance was coming his way. I'm worried that he would resent me and that he would resent his parents."

Even if their needs really are all accounted for there's nothing to stop them from deciding tomorrow to bequeath it all to a bunch of cats.
"I don't think she intended to make plans with him. He kept pushing until she caved to please him because he was upset.

I used to do the same thing. I was a jealous wreck, and when my girlfriend went out, I would try to meet with her after her night out as some sort of relief. Frankly, it was immature and I regret it, but I do understand his POV."

"Lol, he sounds like a fucking loser. Being ""logical and rational and looking at the facts"" includes the *facts* that:

- You've told him what you need and he isn't listening 

- His feelings, not his fact gathering skills, are leading to him hearing $100 a pop rather than what you actually say, which is ""quality time""

- His feelings are his priority over your needs in the relationship

I'm sure it sounds pretty condescending and there's nothing wrong with your age gap in and of itself, but as someone who has dated with age gaps before (and currently has a big one), you really need to ask why he's with someone so much younger than he is - and face the reality of that, pleasant or unpleasant. Do you think perhaps it's because he doesn't have the emotional maturity for someone his age to put up with his shit? If so, do you think you might be tolerating shit from him that no sane person in your position would be putting up with if you were a couple years' older and wiser when you met?

You both have flaws. Yours will improve. You're young. He's probably never going to change and that means, from what you've said, he will be a selfish asshole forever. Why not just leave now?"
"Eek, fuck there's a lot of misinformation here.

1. False positives are a thing.

2. Transmission rates for female to male are way lower than the other way around. It's not impossible that in 30 instances of unprotected sex, OP didn't pick it up.

3. It's also possible that OP or his girlfriend at various times had the infection, took antibiotics, cleared up the infection, transmitted it to each other again (or not) and any number of other permutations of that.   It's often silent, so you wouldn't know if that was happening. For all we know, OP had it to begin with then took other antibiotics and cured it, and his girlfriend is the one who has been left with it and hasn't yet reinfected him.  Or there has been some oral to genital movement over time as the infection can live in both places.

To be quite honest if OP doesn't trust her enough to be satisfied that she didn't cheat, that's just the end of the relationship. There are possibilities, even if they're less likely than her cheating, that would explain this. Personally I would hope not to be dating someone who I didn't trust enough to believe the less likely scenario, but the one that meant they were actually the person of integrity I believed they were.

But ""going in hard"" could end the relationship - that isn't nothing to lose. She might not have cheated. But if OP won't be satisfied with anything other than an admission she did cheat, it's over anyway."
"Your boyfriend is being rude and inconsiderate. Tell him, firmly and without room for argument, that he needs to respect when you aren’t interested in sex and he isn’t allowed to touch you sexually while you sleep. You guys have sex plenty. If he wants more, he has a hand. "

"That's not really a fair expectation. Lots of people commute an hour -- do you have any public transportation options available that would mean less time behind the wheel? Although, you'll only become a more experienced driver with practice. 

&gt;Being that I have literally no internships/co-op/work experience in my major,

Even if you have no experience in your field, don't devalue the work experience you have. Some of those skills have got to be transferable. I lived on my own and worked a variety of service industry and retail jobs in my twenties while going to school. When I moved out of my mom's house I think I was making $7.50/hr, which was around a buck over minimum wage. Less at the restaurants where I waited tables. Sometimes I worked two part-time jobs. I rented a 10x10 room in a co-worker's apartment, and my next place was a 475 sq. ft. studio. It was not glamorous, but it was what I could afford. I eventually moved to a 9 to 5 desk job, started as a receptionist and worked my way up to a position where I'm utilizing my degree. Have you looked for entry level positions in the field you want to go into, or even within the industry itself?

"OMG Are you me? Besides having a child, I am also a Canadian immigrant in a very hispanic neighborhood in NYC. It has it's issues because everytime you apologize they take it as admission of guilt. There are plenty of men catcalling everyday here and I said to one ""Sorry, but im not interested could you stop please?"" and obviously they laughed at me and kept going. This hispanic woman came to me and was like ""Why did you say sorry to him? You did nothing wrong! They'll never stop if you keep apologizing!!"" So yeah. Cultural differences. You need to be firmer with people around here. It's hard but it works! I'd just go up to the woman and ask her point blank if she has a reason to dislike you and your ONE YEAR OLD CHILD, or if she has a reason she doesn't want her kid playing with yours..

No one should stay together just for the kids and you shouldn’t stay with him just to have one. You have time and are worthy of someone who wouldn’t do this to you."
"&gt; I don't want another guy touching her like that 

""I don't want"" isn't the right approach. Nor is ""that pisses me off"", or ""it made me so mad"". You can tell her you don't like it, of course, but approach it as if she's doing something objectively wrong or hurtful and she'll likely get defensive and it'll become more confrontational than it needs to be. You don't like it? Absolutely your right. But it's her right to interact with her friends how she wants. What matters is whether you can both discuss it constructively and either find a middle ground you're both happy with, or realise you're incompatible and break up."
"Yeah... was engaged for like two years before realizing it was a way to get me to shut up about marriage. We planned a courthouse wedding, but, my SO at the time freaked out when it started becoming real and we backed down (like telling parents to cancel plane tickets back down). 

Took a couple years of rockiness before we broke up. But the social and intra-relationship pressure to march forward towards engagement and marriage is strong and it’s very hard to fight against it for many people. Now, older, hopefully wiser, with a better outlook on relationships. 

I think some very open and honest communication is warranted with all feelings on the table. 

Giving the benefit of the doubt - if it was a sincere proposal, OP should mention that she feels this is supposed to be a once in a lifetime event for her, and it’s important for her to feel like that is the case, that’s perfectly okay. An engagement ring is expensive, it is something to save up for, still buy within your means, but expect to take a few months to save for it. The proposal is out there already, but it would be important to mention that an engagement to her means planning the next step, marriage. If he’s not ready for that, it’s awesome that he’s committed to the relationship, but it’s okay to have more time to mentally prepare and then go all in on planning that marriage and having that be the important “engagement date,” when everyone’s ready for that step. "
"Yeah, there was a post on this sub a while ago about a guy who got a ring for his girlfriend for her birthday but last minute realized his mistake and was worried it would be construed as an engagement because he wasn’t ready yet. 

Imo, it’s very possible this was a thoughtless gift and he didn’t know how to deal with the fallout. 

OP, I highly recommend some counseling either together or individually. It doesn’t sound like he can communicate very well and if you’re actually going to be married, it’s a good thing to do anyway. If it turns out it wasn’t an engagement, it’s a good step to help you figure out what to do next. "

"Your mom is not entitled to your money. You are not entitled to your boyfriend's money either.

It sounds like you need to work on your boundaries, especially with your family. You are very kind and generous to help your family, but perhaps, you can also help yourself since you state you have student loans that you want to pay off, aren't able to afford $5 uber, etc. Help yourself first with paying off your debt, eventually obtaining a better job or more education, although $18/hr is not bad for a first job\-\-good for you, we all gotta start somewhere, and then afterwards when you are financially stable, you can help out your family more if that is your desire.

I would recommend reading about boundaries from reddit, websites, books, or setting up appointments with an actual counselor to help you with boundaries. Perhaps though, you'd also like someone who would financially support you more than your current boyfriend is, and if that's your desire, that's ok too. Just be honest with yourself about what you want in life."
"You're going to feel so stupid once you actually have anal sex and realise it's pretty meh. 


That said, you're saying you're definitely a 100% going to do this. She's already said no.

"How about we don't and we start taking pedophilia a little more seriously.

"This was such a preventable tragedy and unfortunately only because OP lost soemthing so dear to her he’s now willing to listen. I would completely understand breaking up. Ultimately only she can decide but either option are valid, and time to grieve and process is important. Grief counceling may help. "
"This is a perfect example of “different strokes for different folks.” I would be so incredibly pissed if I was the “last to know” about my impending engagement. But, my husband proposed in the bath tub spontaneously, after previous discussions about what would need to happen before we got engaged, etc. He also did it without a ring. We picked out my ring together after the proposal because I have very specific taste and my husband is smart enough to know I would want input on the most expensive piece of jewelry I would own/anything I would be wearing daily. We have been married for more than a decade now and have the kind of relationship where his single friends say they would like a marriage like we have. 

I think this poor dude just sounds a clueless, but, as someone else said, the situation continues to snowball. OP needs to clearly articulate to her fiancé what’s would make this better. Ultimately, therapy will help her figure out whether it was just poor/clueless execution, or a sign that he, for some reason, proposed, but doesn’t actually want to be married. "
"Same thing happened to my friend after she was gang-raped by a coworker and his friend.

"Is your Mom paying for the wedding? If not, tell her to shut it. This is YOUR wedding and it is YOUR prerogative to invite whomever you'd like.


Even if she is paying, return the money and say it's your wedding.


Your wedding is no place for a family hashout. He has had plenty of time to reach out to you and apologize. He hasn't done any of this plus he hasn't been a great guy your entire life! Why does he deserve an invitation to one of the happiest days of your life when he hasn't earned it?


Tell your Mom that she needs to stop bugging you about this or you will rescind her invitation. Her rugsweeping of his issues has to stop now!"
"Has your wife been dreaming of being a mother for a longer time? 

I ask this because I can understand her frustration, she was ready and then got injured and had to wait. And now you want to wait even longer in terms of trying. 1.5 years for a wait to try to have kids, is really 2 to 2.5 years before becoming a mother. 

And that’s assuming you’re both healthy, and have no complications along the way. For someone that might feel that sure and ready that’s a really long time to ask of them, especially if there’s a underlying fear of you potentially moving the goal posts once time is up

I think it’s fixable situation, its just down to you and your wife having a heart to heart and compromising on time tables. "
"The argument doesn't excuse his behavior, but it may help to explain or understand it, which will likely impact how they move forward. Everybody is different, and nobody gets to say how he should be affected by his impending fatherhood, or how his panic about the situation may manifest itself.

While parenthood is a wonderful experience for a couple, there are certainly downsides to it. Your life completely changes and takes on a new level of commitment and responsibility. I can see how something like panicking over the loss of his youth and independence may have led to him drunkenly pretending for a minute that he was still a carefree bachelor without the heavy consequence of a family weighing on his mind. It was still completely shitty of him to do and these are feelings he should be talking out with OP, but I think the distinction between ""I was trying to fuck your cousin"" and ""I'm panicked and feeling like I have to always be strong and I wished I could turn my real life off for a minute and be young and independent again so I said something stupid"" may be useful for their communication."
This is awful and you should break up with her 
Do it. She might listen to you more than a parent.
By the time people have become engaged to their soulmate they generally don't keep naked pictures of their ex. 
"I think you tell her that if she doesn't change that you're going to leave her.  It should be about you and your resolve that you will no longer live in filth. You can ask her if she would like help in talking about ideas for how to change, and suggest that she think about getting professional help. But whether she changes by pulling herself together or by getting therapy, change she must. She must believe it if there is to be any chance. Don't threaten if you don't mean it, but carefully consider if you're willing for this to be your life now."
A man who prefers to look at porn while he has a real woman literally naked and riding him has major issues. You cannot fix him. You can only leave him and date someone who only wants to look at you while you have sex. That isn't too much to expect. That should be your bare minimum.
"Yes, you are right. Of course mostly everyone checks out others as a fleeting thought, but it was moreso the fact that it was on his mind so much that he had to talk about how fine these girls were and failed to mention anything else good about that day. It shocked me a bit that he has objectifying ideas of women- I found out that day too that him and his friend together talk very crassly about women in general. 

I think he was crying because he was really worried about losing me, though I was not about to breakup over this. I don't normally get too angry at all."
"“I still feel somewhat betrayed that she could have sex with someone that she kbew she wasn’t happy with”

Hold the phone.

You feel BETRAYED?! Bro, you weren’t even in the picture when she had sex with him and who are YOU to say she wasn’t happy then? Get over it! You’re acting like a 5 stage clinger and it’s anything but cute.

Grow UP. EVERYONE has a sexual past and you’re not allowed to feel
betrayed by it, you really aren’t."
You have already put in far too much time to someone who doesn't think you are good enough for them.

Well, you must be quite a peach in a relationship.

Look. In a relationship, you can place yourself ""winning"" and being ""right"" and getting your own individual way as your main priority. Which your comment suggests is your approach.

"Let me be honest:

I don't doubt that you love this guy. But I think many of your reasons for marrying him are questionable. I think you see marriage as a solution for ~~feeling~~ being unloved by your parents and wanting to leave the state. Naturally, you want to shed your old life and move on to happier days, which you seem certain will come with marriage. 

Your boyfriend will not marry you. He's not even open to the idea. But you can change your name without him (what if you took your professor's last name, if they were okay with it? Since they seem like the closest thing to family you've got?) and you can leave the state without him. And I promise you will be happy without marrying him. He is not the end all, be all.

I think you should get therapy and seize happiness for yourself. Don't rely on your boyfriend to give you happiness, because he's not the ultimate source of your state of well-being. Only you are. "
"Sorry, me too.  OP may stay with him but it will never get better and she'll have wasted xx number of years of her life.  He doesn't respect her as a person.

Sorry, I am making a lot if assumptions here but, is she jealous of other women?"

"Yes! Marriage is becoming less and less respected within our society. I’m spiritual, so I take my marriage philosophy further. But I totally agree with you. I believe marriage means something, and I want to be with someone who is willing to take that risk with me. It’s officially building a new family together."

"Seconding this. ""It's not appropriate for her to work here"" is REALLY not a good reason to fire someone. Would he have kept her on if she was performing poorly but neither of you were dating her?

"You’ve talked about studies, but not the ones that support divorce. Children raised by two happy parents is always best, whether those parents are together or separate.

"Out of respect for your roommate, you should have taken his key away. Still do that. But he probably made a spare so I’d get new locks. Oh by the way don’t date someone who has so little respect for you and for those around you."
You’ve posted numerous times over the years expressing how your boyfriend is an abusive paedophile but blaming everything on porn because you’re delusional and in denial. What do you want us to say at this point?

"Sigh. I dated an actor for many years, even married him. And it was the same story, except he was black and the roles were being given to white actors. He made GREAT money, when he worked. Which was few and far between. I found myself slowly “covering” expenses until it literally felt like I paid for everything. 

I’m glad I got out of that relationship. Unfortunately I didn’t wise up for years. The thing is, they make you feel like you’re being unreasonable, but if y’all aren’t a team, then life is too short and move the fuck on. Seriously. 

I can’t believe how much time, energy and money I wasted in that relationship. And he was just as petty as your guy. Ugh I’m so triggered right now. 

But! At least I left. Thank god for that"
Could be great? Is there a relationship shortage or something? Wouldn't you rather have a relationship that's already great?
"&gt; My questions for you to consider are: when you do get together, why do the couples need to split up based on gender? Why not hang out the four of you, all together? Why can't John and his fiance hang out with your husband, the three of them, without you being obligated to join? Why is there an implication here that the men and women in this group can't be friends? This could help your husband realize that this woman is unpleasant to be around and it's unfair to force you to hang out with her.

And it sounds like the crux of John's problem is, why isn't he allowed to hang out with his friends wihout his fiance? Trying to share interests and friends with your partner is one thing, but becoming attached at the hip and 'not allowed' to hang out with others without her presence is super unhealthy. It's important to be able to have a safe space away from each other every now and then

I know this is coming to a boiling point for OP and her husband, but this comes down to a problem with John and his fiance. "
"He clearly has never had any intention of being faithful to you. When someone breaks your trust, gets it back, and then just chooses to break it again, they are too selfish to be in a healthy relationship with.

Also, considering the earlier evidence of him trying to cheat and the fact that you had to find out about his cheating by snooping, I don't see any reason to assume that he only cheated once."
"So what do you want her? For her to give up her dream of being married for you? Or for her to wait indefinitely in a relationship she's unhappy in in the hopes that you'll change your mind, maybe ruining any chance she'll have at having kids?"

"It kind of sounds like ""controlling"" means expecting your husband to share household responsibilities. I don't think you did anything wrong OP. You were responsible for your personal budget (which was very modest and reasonable) and he agreed to be responsible for the rest (after complaining that you were controlling). If he had a problem doing that, he should have told you! Not literally not say anything while you make plans with the money until you find the entire account drained. Wtf.

"Yes to all of this. You need to have this addressed. You need to bring it to your boss and save not only your reputation, but restore their faith in your abilities and work ethic"
I second this about making absolutely sure not to get pregnant. He's clearly trying to limit her ability to leave so he can continue to do whatever he pleases. A baby would make it that much harder to exit this abusive relationship.
"&gt; Are you sure he didn't put that thought into your head?

I was thinking the same thing. He probably also convinced her that she's bad with money so she should let him handle it all. He must be an amazing liar. 

Just because she has to wait a year to officially divorce is no reason to stay with this guy for a year. Physically separate and open your own bank account. Get a part-time job if you have to. She should get the hell out of there and have him talk to her lawyer if he needs to communicate with her."
"I think it says a lot about him that he not only thought it was okay to use Tinder while he has a gf of 3 years but that he also thought it was perfectly okay - and even funny! - that his married friends did it. 

I wouldn't trust a man who actively participated and found humor in his buddies' marital infidelity. You deserve a man who would be appalled if his married friend told him he was chatting up other women on a dating app. That's a standard, and people who have standards don't endorse this shit and they certainly don't join in on all the fun. 

To add insult to injury he was too ""busy"" to devote more than quick messages to you yet was able to spend weeks talking to other women. Even if this was 100% platonic communication (which is doubtful at best), he was still actively choosing to spend more of his time on building other relationships/friendships rather than making you a priority.

Honestly though, you gotta talk to your mom dude, her unwillingness to explain things that could help your borther(how you and your dad should act, what is his diagnoses- if an emergency happens and she's not available, what will happen, ect). I really don't wanna make you paranoid but the way she acts is kinda fishy...

We cried about halfway through because we were starting to understand what people mean when they say your love should make you a better person.

Things like this are what make you seem intense. Regardless, he doesn't sound like a great guy. Why would he even tell you what his friends said about you? The only reasons I can think of are to make you feel bad, or because he wanted ""backup"" in his argument that you are intense, like ""see, we all voted, and my friends think you're intense, too,"" which, WTF? If he can't discuss relationship issues with you without bringing in his friends' statements as ""evidence,"" he's not ready for a mature relationship. And keep in mind you don't even know if his friends said those things. He just says they said them.

Part of partnering with somebody is learning to give them things that they actually enjoy. 

But that doesn’t excuse girlfriend being such a brat about it.  Frankly, it doesn’t sound like she’s interested in dating somebody who is broke.  Which doesn’t speak highly of her character, and also basically means that they should both cut their losses.  "
"&gt; But I don't have any workout partners.

But you do.  The people at the dance class and the trainer you know at work.   The dance class was not a bust for you.  You liked it.   Keep going!  Your husband is just going to have to deal with you exercising with other people, some of whom are men.   I second the suggestion to go to counseling.

Edit:  Forgot to say congrats on your weight loss!  Losing 50 lbs is an amazing accomplishment."
"And then you go on to state that she should go and find a ""more evolved"" guy, which I take to mean someone who has learned to ignore his feelings in situations where those other brutes might feel or, heaven forbid, express that their pride has been hurt and it makes them feel insecure or like they need validation from their partner. What a healthy set of expectations to put on her boyfriend. "
"This. Boyfriend is absolutely right that having nude pictures of you leaked and shared against your will is a risk you take when making or allowing to be made, those pictures.

If you share them maliciously or without permission, then getting hemmed up for the various revenge porn laws across the nation - to include when doing so falls under distribution of child pornography - is a risk you take.

Both are dumb, ignorant decisions, but only one is a deliberately malicious act and has the potential for significant consequences and damage to the victim."
they don't want to eat ? their problem
I think you guys probably need a counselor. 
"Did you skip the part where op went over the health issues theyve noticed in their friend? If they were 400 lbs and werent having issues with their legs and breathing and general health, i dont think op would have changed a thing considering how long the friendship was and how much they valued it."
"He's not the only one in this situation, though. Like, I have sympathy for the guy but his girlfriend is under no obligation to be OK with this or force herself to be with a guy she's grossed out by."
"Not having a clear will that all parties understand and are aware of is how you get ugly disputes, though. These things are sticky, sure, but we’ve got to be adults about it and not pretend about something this important.

Take it from experience ... an unclear will can result in a tremendous amount of emotional, financial, and familial difficulty and distress in an already awful time."
"&gt; but truth is i came out ok 

um, no you didn't if you think your GF, the woman you claim to love, should just sit back and take abuse to keep the peace. "
Holy fuck!!! That is horrific.
"""the question you must ask is what is worse? groping or taking money for sexual favors?""

Groping. Groping is worse. Are you fucking serious?"
"&gt; He said, ""I understand, but don't you think I deserve an explanation of why you won't talk to me?""

“I understand, I just don’t care and I’m gonna keep trying to guilt you into a relationship.” 

Yikes. 

OP, you don’t owe them a red cent, and you won’t be completely free of them until you stop accepting their money. You need to talk to your advisor and tell them you’re in need of some financial counseling so you can continue your studies uninterrupted. Once you’re financially independent, whatever relationship you have with them is completely optional and can be on your terms. Until then, they’ll just keep up the bullshit and blame you for being upset by it."
"He should see a dietician who has experience with these cases. Many dieticians are great at being able to modify their advice based on the person's specific issues and limitations. They can offer creative tricks to help ease him into a healthier diet in a way that feels achievable to him.

I have a lot of sympathy for picky eaters, but if he cares so little about his health that he won't even give this a shot, that's a dealbreaker IMO. "
"Moral support. Giving birth can be scary, she'll likely be there to support her. 

Toss in complications, it can be life and death, its nice to have someone familiar to rely on. Her husband can provide that, but you'd be surprised how many still want their mother too at times like that. 

Contrast that to a wedding where nothing major (of relative consequence) can go wrong. Especially if you're 36 yrs old, not a wide eyed younger person in their mid 20s. 

The mother is making the right choice. "
Also occupational therapy and recreational therapy to help husband be as independent as possible and to  find ways to get back to loved activities as well as explore new activities that he could find a passion for. There are tons of ways to be engaged in physical activity while being wheelchair bound. 
"""No, thanks. I'm going to watch the game/movie until it's over. You're welcome to use the kitchen or not as you wish.""

And then do it. Ignore her or make her leave but do not give in anymore. Your problem will fix itself shortly. "
"&gt;he said it was because he knew I'd get angry

Uhh this is not a good excuse. Assuming you're a rational person (and it seems like you are), either A) He was doing something he shouldn't, otherwise why would you get mad? or (B) He knows you prefer different boundaries than he does, and he'd rather just do what he wants instead of actually having a real conversation about it, because that would be more difficult. You know, that whole ""it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission"" thing. 

Honestly, if you've talked about it before and he admitted to not being completely truthful, and now you're finding out he's *still* not being truthful even after talking about it before, you just have to decide if you really think you can trust him. I mean you can talk to him about it again, but will you believe anything he says?  "
Agreed....this is all upsetting behavior. I feel genuinely sorry for this boy. 
"God, I'm loving these responses. 


After being called an abuser for asking a partner to be more aware of bad teeth brushing habits, chewing with mouth open, smacking, mouth breathing, and asking inane comments in a whisper in public like, ""Do you think I'm hot right now?""


All I knew was his perspective on it so I've been living thinking I personally ruined this dude's self-esteem, but Christ am I glad to see other people would also have an issue with it. 


I don't think the girlfriend is in the wrong, I've diagnosed myself with misophonia and some of the things OP described can be *unbearable* and infuriating when it continues and it becomes glaringly obvious how your partner lacks self-awareness. It can make you despise them for not even caring how they act or look in public. "
"I'm moving to the US and I'm going to start one. I'm shit with money and I'm used to living super large one month and off ramen and shit domestic beer the next one, but we have our evil socialist health care over here so I never had to worry about this. It'd be really shitty to have to drag an unwanted pregnancy on for a month making the the termination almost necessarily surgical instead of medical because you don't have the cash on you."
You poor girl. Where is your mom? You are so naive
Holy hell young lady. You're getting yourself into a mess here.
"A lot of the stuff you described doing in your post remind me of an ex I had with mild Asperger's, maybe you should get checked out for something like this.  Doctors and therapists can give you some coping strategies or medication that can help you with the ticks.  My ex got most of his completely under control and you would never be able to guess that he had anything going on unless he told you"

"Did you, by any chance, spend the weekend making posts about her being a stalker, etc? And/or are you enjoying your creative writing experiment. "
"Dude food is necessary to live. If you don't have self control and make your self actually sick when you cheat on your diet once or twice, you're one step away from a full blown eating disorder. "
"Healthy, proper dieting isn't just about losing weight.  It's also about long-term maintenance of one's weight.  The diet you are on right now is great for one of these things, but are you going to keep this up forever?  When you hit your ""ideal weight"", what happens then?  Do you go back to eating whatever and begin re-gaining the weight, or do you stay on this diet until you die?  Do you think it is a long-term sustainable way of life for you? For your relationship?  Will you get bitter at ANY SO you have going forward that drinks beer or eats pizza?

If you're just using the diet to lose pounds, you're probably gonna be disappointed when you stop.  Recent scientific publications (and even the show the Biggest Loser) have shown us that Quick-dieting  has the HIGHEST chance of weight relapse of any kind of weight loss.  People that lose the weight over the course of years through minor lifestyle changes are MUCH more likely to stay at their ideal weight long-term.

And AGAIN with the ""buts"".  ""But we live together!!!! *sadface emoji*""  But fucking nothing.  He is in his OWN home, and you're treating him like a monster for doing something for himself.  If he is trying to force you to eat junk food, you have a leg to stand on.  If you want the junk food in locked shelves, you could be on the road to a compromise.  Getting shitty and going ""but"" fixes nothing and justifies really nasty behavior long-term.

If you don't like his current weight, maybe comment on it constructively (he already opened that floodgate with his poorly worded remarks)!  People like to feel wanted by their SO's!  If there is something he could be doing to be more attractive to you, find a good way to word it (the shit-sandwich approach generally works well) and bring it up.  If his eating habits just make you jealous, that is a different, more you-centered issue."
"Wow really, she can’t reasonably expect her husband to step up the cleaning and cooking? What if their budget doesn’t accommodate that with a baby on the way?"
"&gt; Maybe you should send this to the person who got butt hurt that you didn't come to their wedding, instead of internet strangers. 

Yeah, this is just a passive agressive facebook rant.

edit: If you look at OPs comment history, you can see the thread that rustled her baby jimmies."
The assumptions you’re making are really what speak volumes about you.
... do you like her? Do you feel like you two are a good match? Compatible?
"Dude, your parents are fucked up.

Really internalise that. There is NOTHING wrong with you. They're fucked up. 

You need to save up and move out on your own. No good can come from living with such toxic, terrible people who clearly want their daughter to be annorexic if theyre shaming someone with such a normal healthy weight. "
"I plan on just sitting him down and telling him he has to go and seeing what he says.  If he doesn't fight me on it, then that's the best outcome.  He can keep his kids home from school so they can all pack and go.  I know he has family here he can crash with until he finds a place.  The kids can probably stay with their mother but it's his year to have them.  It's an odd arrangement they have.  But she is a lovely woman, so I can't see there being any resistance. 

It's going to be a rough morning.  Hopefully, it will be taken care of by 2:50 PM when my son comes out of school.  I know that's reaching, but it's a goal, and the one I'll be reaching for."
You had an emotional affair less than a year ago and you expect things to already be normal again!? You really don’t deserve the self pity party you are throwing yourself. You betrayed your spouse in a profound way. 
"girl,  you guys aren't even a package yet and he's asking you to make dinner and put on a show.  I have korean friends and even they're not this whipped when they are in a relationship with a guy or vice-versa."
"Kinda seems like your husband is an alcoholic to me. He can't stop drinking once he starts, says he ""needs"" it with every meal, and seems to be consistently drunk enough to not be able to drive. I would have a serious talk with him right now. 

I am saying this as a recovering alcoholic. These all seem like pretty big signs he's moving towards alcohol dependence. "
"&gt; When they moved in, I'm not sure if they knew I had a strict rule that my dad isn't present in my home ever, but they should have. 

That was my favorite part.
"
"If everything is fine in person, then who cares? Texting is a convenience, not a necessity in a relationship."
"It shouldn't be surprising that a rule implemented almost a decade ago and then never used should have some need for further discussion when used for the first time. 

In my opinion (I hate vetos with a burning passion, but I'm poly not open so this situation is different) a veto should be, they will respect your veto and accept that sleeping with that person is classified as cheating unless the veto is removed, not, they're not allowed to have feelings or need to process the veto. "
"You don't have to break up with her, because right now, you're not in a relationship with her. She left the relationship, but for whatever reason, has declined to tell you.

Give her some space and see what happens. Life is too short to spend it pining for someone that doesn't want to spend it with you."
omg is he the guy who believes girls have gold glittery eyelids naturally and that makeup is tricking him because i’ve never seen one irl 
"You can literally say *anything*. 

You’ve already acknowledged each other so it’s a short leap to “Which lectures are you otherwise attending?” or “Could you help me with [aspect of lectures you understand but him “helping” means you spend time together]?” or “I need you to ravish (!) me. Right now. Let’s go!”"
"I don't understand, no matter how I do the math, if she's been doing 2-4 classes a semester for 4 years, she should still be graduating with an associates. That's only a 2 year degree going full time (4 classes a semester) "
"I hate to say it, bit it's already over. She isn't happy with monogamy, and you aren't happy with opening it up. She has made it clear that this is what she wants and she doesn't care if it's not what you want. 

If you give her that ultimatum, she will either:

1. Decide to end the marriage
2. Agree to it, stay monogamous, amd be unhappy and resentful
3. Agree to it, but ignore it and cheat on you. 

In all 3 scenarios, the marriage ends. "
"I don't even want to pay my own parents' retirement, let alone someone else's. I refuse to be seen as a mere old-age investment. For me, it is an absolute dealbreaker and I will also lose a healthy amount of respect towards such immature parents. "
I think the point is that OP doesn't want to dedicate time and energy to helping someone's kids do these things.
"If your eyes (with makeup or without) are like the girl in the video you are gorgeous! The eyeliner doesn't change the shape of the lids, just makes it look ""made up"" and colorful. That guy is stupid if that's the only thing he concentrated on, not conversation, personality or overall looks. What does he think, you will wear make up 24/7?"
She forgot to apologize.  Just went straight into what she wants. You don't know the kid. Heather does. Let her take care of him. 
"Yeah, the fact that she has confided in her best friend doesn't really make a difference. You didn't ask her not to tell anyone - she asked you. You broke that promise and then lied to her about it. You say you're ""still an honest person"", but really, why should she believe that? I empathize with you, but breaking someone's trust like that when they're feeling so raw and vulnerable is huge. 

I don't know if I have advice for you, other than ask her what she needs from you right now. Be there for her. Don't keep insisting that you're an honest person - you're not, at least in her view right now. Ask what steps you can take to fix the relationship, and if it really is over with her, accept it. "
It's gonna be rough when her kid gets old enough to start asking for expensive toys.
Perhaps they have a gas leak 
It's unbelievable!  I don't know how people concoct these fanciful stories!
"I think that it's dangerous for you to assume that he doesn't understand what he's doing. Maybe be doesn't...but he's already said he won't go to counseling. If he genuinely thought you had a problem with firting and cheating, wouldn't he want YOU to get help at least? 

The fact he's so against counseling when he ought to want to fix this as a team suggest that maybe this isn't about what he says it is at all.

Not everyone is a good person. Sometimes people do bad things not because they're ignorant of the effects of their actions, but because they don't *care* about the side effects as long as they get what they want. Your fiance's controlling behaviors are getting him an isolated, dependent partner who he can easily control. Why in the world would he improve himself if he could convince you to back down and continue this sweet deal?

It's ok to mourn the loss of the good parts of your relationship. But do try to keep in mind that you can't define it through a selective window. Would you eat a sandwich if you knew it ""only"" had a little bit of shit in it?"
"I know I'm not exactly giving you advice on the situation at hand here, but holy shit you should have given everyone these details in the OP. With all of this specific context in mind, it's much easier to see why your feelings are justified here. But you completely left this stuff buried down here in the comments after needing to be smacked around by a forum of people making assumptions about why you're so weird about this. 

Given that you stated all of this stuff to your girlfriend and she's still acting naive about everything is kind of a weird flag, especially weeks later. Hope the best for you."
"I don't know man, she might be pissed that OP vetoed her sleeping with someone with no good reason. She might feel like he doesn't trust her as the other guy is ok, they're friends, he knows how their relationship is, ect. In terms of safety she's pretty ok so... 

Honestly, this is very very one sided part of the story, The problem with reddit is that important things are missing like, how did he phrase that, how was his tone, did he sleep with his own women friends(whom the relationship looks similar as te wife)? There's way too many variables..."
I had to scroll up and look at the ages again and was expecting you guys to be in your late teens/early 20's. You need to cut off the engagement that is absolutely ridiculous that you would even consider putting up with this kind of behavior. 
"And what kind of future is there with a guy who lets the people he loves down because he’s anxious about not having been to the gym in a while? Can’t count on him. Can’t have kids with him. You can’t really do much with someone who prioritizes gym anxiety above all else. 

It’s her birthday and the ten-year anniversary of her friend’s death. "
I agree. I haven't been much more mad at him than I was after that meal. 
Well she has roommates and they might not have been comfortable sneaking around their apartment while not trying to wake up a stranger (to them). I think since it's a shared space I can understand this set up 
"Exactly. And just imagine if she does end up with his children? His parents may treat them okay because they are his children as well, but what if they don't treat them right? And imagine if they grow up watching his parents treat her like dirt? Just a cycle of disrespect and poor relationships. 
"
"Another possibility - how long has he had this couch and did he get it new? I know I've found some stuff in my couch that must have been there for months, even though I checked it during those months."
She'll have plenty of time to mull that over while being unemployed.
"As I was discussing this with another commenter, I had a thought..

What if this is husband, in a way, ""teaching OP a lesson""? Like, not in a spiteful, mean way. But in a ""You need to understand the consequences of not having a backbone.""

He stood up to her at first, but then backed down when she fought him on it. And he's fought her along the way, too, or at least expressed his displeasure.

I wonder if this is a grand ""you've made your bed"" plan to get OP to realize she *really, really* needs to grow a spine?

Because this is definitely a situation she'll never forget! And I think it's been a hell of a wake\-up call for her... or I hope so anyways.."
"Your feelings are valid, and you can continue to push back with her politely when she is rude, but it is *crucial* that you do not allow her to draw you into an actual argument/fight. Because she's 12, and fighting with a 12 year old is *beyond* pointless. And because you've said she seems to find a way to turn it into giant drama and blame it all on you (again, 12).

edit: find a way to lock up the stuff that you don't want her to borrow/touch, as well."
"Thank you. 

The irony is I too struggle with insomnia and most nights only fall asleep around 3am with a 7.30am start, yet I know my partner gets a good 8 hours sleep a night, every night. I wish that was the reason but I feel something else is up."
"Let me clear your confusion: it's not about whether your girlfriend is good enough for you but it's about the fact that you're not good enough for your girlfriend. Obviously you shouldn't be in a relationship because your girlfriend deserves someone who is able to look beyond her partying, drinking, and previous hookups and see her for her personality and values. You are deeply hypocritical and misogynistic, thinking that it is ""worse"" for women to be hooking up than it is for men to do the same. Instead of going out and hooking up with random girls with no emotional attachment, why don't you actually address this insecurity of yours and reflect? "
"No man alive \(or woman, or other person, for that matter\) is worth an eating disorder, and let me tell you, you're treading an awfully dangerous line with feeling guilty and sick after eating. 

Dump this loser. He's treating you like a sum of pieces, some kind of lego person where he can put your head on a better body. You're a human being, you're more than the sum of your parts, you deserve to be accepted as healthy and whole \- the right person will love you for that. He's not the one. He doesn't deserve you. 

&gt; he is willing to look past them. 

There's a person out there that won't have to ""look past"" your body, but will love every inch of it. You should get to meet them! Fuck this guy! "
"Children in a single-parent home and and disabled children are at disproportionately higher risk, yes.  

It has less to do with having a non-parent male in the home and more to do with other issues that come up in those scenarios. 

-Poverty is a huge factor, mostly because poorer parents often have to outsource their babysitting in a less ideal fashion due to low income and little access to sick days at work. (Single parents and parents of disabled children tend to be lower income).

-Being overwhelmed is another factor. When you are barely hanging in there because your kid is sick or you are doing it on your own, you miss warning signs about people and your kids more easily. This isn’t a critique of single parents, but a reality of anyone who has too much on their plate. 

Lastly, all of the former offenders I worked with would tell you that if a parent seemed curt or standoffish with them, that they didn’t even bother pursuing that child because they knew that the parents paid too close of attention and would scrutinize their behavior. This is why boundaries are important as a parent. They don’t just protect your kid in the moment, but they also send a subtle signal to others that you pay attention and don’t back down from social pressure. 

We have been conditioned socially to ignore warning signs in others because it seems judgmental or rude, women in particular are encouraged to be nice to people despite their discomfort. But sometimes your discomfort is communicating something important to you, and it’s best to not ignore it, even if it means you seem cold or rude.

You know, like when a neighbor invites himself on your vacation. That’s a great example of a time when you should be rude if necessary, lol.

"If Max doesn't want you to say anything, you're friends with Max, so support him. Your friendship with Jane is already on life support and you already had to pull away to protect *yourself*, let alone her victims of domestic abuse.

Put yourself in Max's shoes. Imagine someone you considered a friend knowing your ex punched you in the face and still actively pursuing a friendship with him.

You could consider asking this friend:

&gt;I ran into a friend of mine who also knows Jane. She told me that a good friend of hers is dating Jane’s ex from four years ago. She said Jane was physically abusive to him.

as well about confronting Jane, but as of right now you have two friends who say Jane has physically abused two people *who are important to you and your friends*.

Follow their lead, because their safety &gt; your friendship with a recovering alcoholic, no matter how sincere her recovery is.

Of course you could also consider attempting to keep the door open for her while keeping their secrets and hope she eventually comes clean to you or apologizes to them but that'll take some strength in faking it.

ETA: Jane's violence against her exes is not yours to share. Consider it like two friends coming out to you as trans and being friends with a transphobe. You can't say to that transphobe ""our mutual friends *x* and *y* are trans so change your mind about your bigotry"" because outing people puts their lives at risk. If you do not get permission from either party to discuss their abuse with Jane, you don't have permission and cannot discuss it with her. You definitely cannot discuss the other ex without his permission especially because you therefore also cannot warn him."
"I don't understand all the comments saying ""you're still her child"". 

Yes, you'll always be her kid but her attitude and negativity is very unhealthy. You shouldn't be going to your mom's every day at lunch if you want to create some healthy distance in your relationship.

She needs to pick up hobbies and stop depending on you for 24/7 entertainment. You need to have a CLEAR conversation of what you want the relationship to be like, in a respectful way, she will more than likely be hurt but if she's mature she will be understanding."
"My family has NEVER done group photos, and any even candid snap shots are far between.  So I do feel you here.

BUT that is a norm for a lot of people.  Talk to her.  Because the consensus here seems to be that you have not gotten her a present at all, but rather a normal family thing.  Do something to celebrate her as a person."
"Woman here, it will make it worse if you cancel it. As long as you get her a do-over gift and explain that the photoshoot is not a gift, but something you recognise she needs she wont remember it poorly. Cancelling is going to come across as childish and petty no matter the intention "
"It’s more than a joke dude, it’s dehumanizing. "
Even my dog knows when family members pass away
"&gt;He is kind and caring and protective

He is none of the above.

* Sent private photos of you to his friends without your permission.
* Got upset with you for invading his privacy \(???\)
* Assaulted you as a result

Girl, what is you doing? You would not be throwing away 6 years together, you would be getting yourself out of an abusive and dangerous situation before it gets worse."
"My husband is being protective of me right now. I hurt my back, and he just wants to make sure I don't hurt my back again. It's not always a bad thing"
"Nobody is entitled to free childcare; I don't think anybody, including OP, is saying otherwise. But when someone agrees to do something, it's not a good thing to back out like that - and I feel like the bigger the favor, the worse it is to back out. Like, nobody's entitled to have a friend help them move, but if your friend says they'll be there on Saturday and then calls up and says he's going to the zoo instead... you'd be irritated! You were *counting* on that help - only because he agreed to give it already - and it's not a nice way to treat people to change your mind."
"OP, I'm going to leave this number for you in case you ever need it: (800) 799-7233. That's the number for the national domestic violence hotline in the US. They also have an online chat option at TheHotline.org (sorry, we can't link on this sub). They'll listen to you, talk with you about your relationship to whatever degree you're comfortable with, and can help you plan out how to do whatever you decide to do next most safely.        

Please, take care of yourself.       "
"If it makes you feel better, I was completely naked after a shower when my fiancé proposed. His proposal was, “so we’ve had a great day so far (I had flown to Europe to meet him on a deployment leave and it was our first full day together) and the only thing that would make it better is if you married me.”

To which, I responded, “what the f—k is that?” because I didn’t expect him to propose. 

His grand plan was to surprise me with a trip to Paris and propose there, but he couldn’t wait any longer. 

If he wants to be with you and marry you, forgive his proposal. In the grand scheme of things, it’s just one moment in a lifetime. If you’re upset that the ring turned your finger blue, it could be your own body chemistry. My skin turns green with anything less than 18k gold. "
"I wonder if she was worried about something going wrong with the pregnancy, considering her age, and didn't want to saying anything for fear of ""jinxing"" it.  Do you know if she's told anyone else or is she just keeping it from everyone?  Not that that's an excuse, but maybe an explanation."

"This is just part of being a parent.  Your kids grow up and become their own person, and it's not about your wants and needs as a parent.

And OP is **17**.  That's well past the point where any parent ought to expect to get constant physical affection.

If he wants that, he should get a dog.  "
"Also, don’t know where they live, but since he’s smoking at home and not out of it I’m guessing it’s not completely legal there.  If they’re living together, she has illegal substances in her home that she didn’t know about or consent to.  How would OP feel if he came home and she was cleaning her illegally-obtained gun that she keeps hidden in the home.  Hey, having it around makes her feel safe, so she’s able to do XYZ better within the relationship, so that makes it all ok.  "
"The friend clearly had no idea he was crashing date night, because the husband refused to communicate with anyone during this mess. He never told his friend not to come over. You're worried about making him look ""pussywhipped"" by OP saying anything before he gets there, but don't think it looks aggressive and controlling as hell for OP to wait until he drives the half hour to get there and then tells him to ""fuck off?"""
"I definitely don't think you are overreacting here. That's a shitty attempt at an excuse. And considering the random girls story, it sounds like a lie. Totally violated the boundaries. Especially considering the distance factor. Sounds like he's trying to walk both sides of the fence and got caught. "
"&gt; I honestly don't see how you could spin it any other way, unless I'm crazy!

Well if you're crazy, then I'm also crazy. Because dumping you for a better offer is exactly what he did. The only ""other ways"" to explain it involve using milder words that mean the same thing. 

I would love it if you would come back and let me know what pile of bullshit he tries to tell you though, because I'm sure it will be a spectacular display of pretzel-twisting logic. "
"Me, an intellectual: I don’t know whether to downvote or upvote this "

He hugged a woman until she became uncomfortable.

&gt; the guy realized his mistake in split second

The second after she turned him down and told him he was disgusting.
"
"Go to your boyfriend. Live a great life and forget this woman exists. She does not deserve to be part of your life.

While you're at it you should take those presents back to wherever you bought them from and get a refund. Use the money to buy yourself something nice, a ""getting the fuck away from the crazy"" present to yourself if you will.

You've dealt with this woman for a long time, you are strong enough to deal with it for another month, but if you can, move up your flights. You'd be surprised how much better you'll feel once you're away"
"I think a lot of Americans are going to see this and talk about the legality so you might want to add that you're in the UK (I assume, since you mention London) and that 16 is legal for sex - gay or straight - and there is no law about age gaps etc. so *in the eyes of the law* he is absolutely doing nothing wrong.

I personally think you need to take gay/straight out of the equation and just focus on the fact that your brother is cheating on his girlfriend with one of her family members, and talk to him about how even if he wants to be in a relationship with her dad, it's NOT okay to cheat on people and lie and that he is hurting innocent people here. Maybe reinforce how this is going to make Jane feel and how this is going to damage her relationship with her father, and possibly cause serious trust issues for her down the line, talk about the importance of honesty and trust.

That's step one. Since everything is legal, there is not much you can do to stop him seeing an older man, but the fact he trusts you enough to tell you about it I guess is a start.

Is there a fear that your parents will be angry to the point of being physical or that they will kick him out? If you think your parents are not going to go nuclear I really think that they should be informed but in an ideal situation you guys could all sit down and talk about this together."
"They all recognize it, but does that mean you can't sue for a ""fault"" divorce (or whatever it's called), when one person commits adultery?"
"Yeah, hounding someone with unwanted messages is a great way to get them to want a relationship with you... not."
"ok i need you to back up a little from this situation and think about exactly what kind of guy you are dealing with here. 

&gt; He said he had no interest in her at all, and that he only wanted her  around as a backup plan in case our relationship went sour. 

if we go with the premise that this statement is true, what you're indicating here is that he's so desperate to be in a relationship, ANY relationship, that he is the kind of person who is willing to let someone believe he has genuine feelings for them \*when he does not\* just to make sure he has a backup relationship to go to if you and he don't work out? do you really not see the 93998558343475 ways that is problematic? He is stringing \*one\* of you along with false feelings, and even if it's \*not\* you HE'S THE KIND OF PERSON WHO WOULD TREAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE THAT, and that's the BEST case scenario. why is that ok with you?"
I thought you were too intense until “fuck you scott” then I decided we could be best friends no matter how much you talk. 
How outrageous to assert that a woman shouldn't be under pressure to engage in a sexual act that is painful for her! What will these crazy feminazis think of next?!
"This is precisely what I was thinking. Presenting something like this as a “gift” not only is unexciting because she sees it as a baseline function, but also sets the precedent that you’re ONLY going to do this as a gift and neglect photo taking in the future (something she seems to care about)."
"This is creepy AF. You feel disrespected because he's disrespecting you. Please be careful, OP. It's easy to say he's being ""pathetic,"" but he knows what he's doing. He's an adult trying to wear you down, to guilt you in having sex, and that's a huge red flag for trying to break down other boundaries or break down this one is other, more aggressive ways. "
"&gt; there's a line. A couple comments communicates ""Hey, I think you're sexy and I want you"". A half hour and 20 one liners makes me feel like I'm dealing with a 7th grader.

I'd say it just like that. Then tell him since he doesn't get the hint very well from now on you'll just stop responding after a few messages like that, and that'll be his queue that the convo is over."
"Go get a divorce attorney right now. Give them the proof and it's possible they can put you in touch with a PI to gather hard evidence to use in court. In the meantime open a new bank account and work out how to protect yourself financially. Do a credit freeze. If needed tell him one of your cards was hacked, so he's not suspicious of any changing or canceling of cards. If your name is on anything jointly with him get if off ASAP. This is so he can't open lines of credit or drain bank accounts etc. This is important and I cannot stress it enough, even if you don't think he would do this. You also didn't think he would cheat on you with a friend, so make sure you have a place your paychecks go and any monies that are yours. 

Do not drain the accounts completely or take anything other than what is yours rightfully since you can get into trouble potentially for that, but make sure you are financially protected before you do any confrontations at all.

In the meantime as hard as it's going to be keep a cool head, act like nothing is wrong. Line up a place to stay or an eviction notice to get him out or whatever arrangements you have to make living\-wise and with any housing or mutual property. Again, with your attorney.

Once you have these things in place then you serve him papers, let him know the P.I. has plenty of dirt, tell your friends and family why you are ending things and move the hell on. And I say this last, because too many times one partner usually thinks, ""I won't say anything and I'll protect their reputation,"" only to find \(surprise!\) the offending partner immediately runs out and trashes them to friends and family. 

I'm sorry this is happening, and it's easy to blow up in the heat of things, but in the long run you will be far better off if you plan this out and take steps to make sure he doesn't blow back on you or hurt you financially. "
"Oh, good of you to notice! I forgot to mention this part of the situation.

Both B and C have talked to me at length about it, and they've given the ok for me to reveal what they've told them. I mean, sometimes I wish that they themselves could tell A instead of me, but I think that A's emotional displays (and/or lack thereof, it's a bit unpredictable) are intimidating. High emotion situations regarding A are hard for B and C to understand and deal with.

As B and C also are not in a good place, the reason they gave me for the phase out in contact is that they are worried about being too cruel and harsh in revealing how they feel. They do care about her and pity her, I think. It's kind of sad.

So it's sort of left to me, the Avatar, the bridge between the Autistic and Neurotypical realms. I just need to gather up my courage and break it to A."
"Wait though, I’m confused.  You say you pay $800 a month in child support, and then your ex pays you $750 a month to rent the house.  You also say neither daughter has a job, and then say, “The exwife has never done anything in ten years to figure out how to make up for my missing payments, like i was just going to pay her for the rest of my life. ”

Does your ex have a job?  I assume she’s not supporting two kids on $50 a month...so, the characterization of her expecting you to take care of her is confusing, to me, with the numbers given here.  Is it just that she can’t make up the theoretically-missing $750 a month from her current income?  Because if you paid each daughter $400 a month and allowed them to stay in the same house and pay rent, how is that realistically different from the current setup? Do you expect the daughters to possibly just take over the rent but ask their mom to leave the home?"
"You were able to trace a source of the issue, which is great. Unfortunately it sounds like a mental health issue, which is probably going to take some time and help to work through. Have you found a therapist?"
"OP, I'm commenting you to tell you that you are not alone in this, in my case it is my father, he is a chronic slurper and has a habit of burping and farting a few minutes after finishing his meal, there is a huge chance that the gas problem is actually caused by his constant slurping of foods, and believe me, he can slurp ANYTHING, we are not talking soup or spaghetti here, no, this is a person that literally slurps lettuce from his salad.

It makes me hate having meals with him because of the constant gross noises and the sheer lack of consideration for others, and same with your grandmother, my dad is EXTREMELY sensitive and reacts really poorly when there is any sort of criticism directed to him.

Anyways, I may not have a solution for your problem (when I find it I will tell you) but I know how it feels and I know that it isn't funny (as many redditors seem to imply here) and it can seriously jeopardize a relationship with someone since everything you can think about when you see the person is the gross table manners."
"Oh, and me, don't forget me!"
I’m very sure it was not porn...especially considering my brother was there and you could here the actual movement of sex 
"You’re making this entirely about you. 
“She said she thinks it’s work related stress. She is a teacher, so I am not sure I totally buy that” wow that’s messed up how you instantly invalidate her feelings. 

My advice? Stop being so self centered and judgmental. Your poor wife. Let her get therapy or whatever she thinks will help and give this more time to sort out."
"Fuck you really hit her? Fuck.

OP. Send her to her dad. See deserves a better parent. She deserves someone who actually cares and helps her with her issues instead of an adult who acts like a violent bully.

She needs help and you abuse her. "
"Do you...LIKE your wife? I mean, as a human being?"
The engagement at such a young age and the toxicity/jealousy are not unrelated. They come from the same place.
"&gt; Why did you even get married and have kids if you were going to gladly ignore them for the vast majority of their lives?

Lifescript, probably. Gotta check them boxes.

"
"This is what I was thinking as soon as I read they wanted her to split the money after selling the house. I’m surprised I haven’t seen more comments mentioning this! These people clearly don’t understand how wills work; they aren’t entitled to anything that wasn’t left to them. 

"
"You never met his parents in 3 years? Are you sure his ""ex"" was ever really his ex?

Edited to say that it would probably be best to consult an attorney now rather than later."
"They did talk about it,she said she agreed to it"
"seriously, his complaints are so immature as to be insulting."
"He added you knowing what was on his profile. There's a reason prospective employers often snoop onto peoples' social media pages. It's how he chooses to present himself online. 

What does that say about him? "
"I mean, he could do that, but OP is an adult now and he doesn’t seem interested in having another dad at 24. Medical history has nominal value but if he’s content with the father he grew up with, what difference will it make?  Especially if it will lead to more stress for OP and his dad. That’s all up to OP tho. "
"&gt; homeboy doesn't clean or cook but will 'help' if given specific tasks that he will 'try' to do between cigs every 10 minutes. I wish I was exaggerating

&gt; His mother was not to ask me anymore questions about his dick size. Yes, really

&gt; I would not be involved with an addict. He is to follow his scripts. No more, no less. (his prescription has 'wiggle' room of 5mg/day)

Look OP. You feel free to live your life however you want to live it. There's a lot going on in your post that people could dissect. But what the fuck are you doing with this guy? And I mean that in the nicest way possible. "
"So first, apparently you kissing this guy while you were both single is equivalent to this woman having sex with your fiance. Nope.

Second, why still talk with her. You don't need this drama. Just cut them out. If C is a good friend he will figure his shit out but you don't need this woman's drama in your life. "
"&gt; He went and broke a door as a response after telling me how I need to be more open and accepting and putting me down.

File already and get this dangerous loser out of your life."
"Your original comment was much more blunt and honest. Haha. But I disagreed with that one comment about not being able to perform bridesmaid duties. I could still perform most of the bridesmaid duties, but yeah, I’m not going to bother even going or being friends. "
"I could have written this! When I was with my ex, I got pregnant at 20 years old and thought that's what I wanted. I ended up miscarrying late and we broke up a few years later. Now I'm 30 and I don't ever want to have kids. I'm not necessarily saying you should break up, your husband's argument that he wants to have kids before 30 is a valid one. I knew someone growing up whose dad was in his 60's and basically couldn't relate to him at all, so not wanting to have a huge generational gap makes sense. But you definitely shouldn't have kids now if you don't 100% want to. "
"Mother’s Day doesn’t equal woman’s day. You can be a woman without being a mother. OP clearly does not see “having one more female parent than she thought” the same as “having one more mother than she thought.” OP already sees this parent in a different role. You can’t just start thinking of someone as your mother just because they change sex. This, I think, is the source of OPs confused feelings. "
"Well my friend texted me not too long ago saying she heard what happened and she’s probably going to drop out of the wedding because she’s super pissed. Karma, I guess. "
"Yep, and it sounds like family tried desperately to talk her out of it, but it’s hard to explain to an 18yo the impact decisions like this can have."
"Yeah, this is a messed up way of thinking. "
Binge eating is a distinct period of eating huge quantities of food. It's absolutely not always done daily. Same with purging. And clearly your wife is lacking in control. 
"Gotta say, that's a somewhat unusual kind of rehearsal... "
"I mean, to each their own, but I would consider this weird IF my partner just started asking me to do these things without consulting me and having a conversation about consent and boundaries first. If there's not even an, ""hey, that may have been odd of me, was that okay?"" or a debrief about it, then yes I would say this has the potential to be problematic. sounds like he's just really into porn moans or whatever. I would ask for a conversation about it and see where it goes."
"OP, maybe consider a session or two of counseling just for yourself, to help you process everything you are going through right now. I know you want to be strong for your daughter, but it's like being on an airplane when the oxygen masks drop -- you have to fix your own mask before you can help others. "
"Why are you dating someone you don’t trust at all?  It’s pretty clear you resent her not being comfortable, you think she’s lying about your dick, you think she’s had a bunch of sex, etc.
 

Why be with someone you mistrust so much?"
"I was told by my doctor it is much less likely for men to catch chlamydia from a female partner than the other way around; when I tested positive for chlamydia, a man I had had unprotected sex with very recently tested negative and apparently this is not uncommon. "
"Bingo! That'll do it. Religion is one hell of a motivator. If this is the case, then talking to her will only make it worse. There's no getting through to these evangelicals. I feel bad for her son whose being unfairly disciplined. Like the other poster said, don't change your routine. It's not fair to your son or the other kids. If she continues to give you problems then unfortunately you have choices to make. Your son doesn't need to witness her actions. Play elsewhere, maybe a park, or if you're renting, consider moving when your lease is up. "
"Why are you trying to accommodate the needs of a crazy lady with obscene gestures? She may prohibit her own kid from playing with your son, but she has no say at what other kids do or where you play."
"You should maybe consider how your wife's behavior is going to affect your daughter long-term. Look up narcissistic personality disorder, that's what it sounds like. "
"I once had a neighbour who'd had a bad experience with the people who'd lived in my flat before. She *knew* we were different people, and we were nothing but friendly and polite. She was rude and kept talking about the last tenants and saying we'd be the same. We were quite young and she was elderly, so that may have been a factor, but it's not too off base to think she's deemed your place the ""trouble apartment"" with zero sane reason to do so.

Most likely she's just rude and a bit nuts though, really. Occam's Razor and all that. Even with the racial element to the issue, if she *is* worried about you hassling her kids etc., she's going entirely the wrong way about trying to prevent that."
"Find a place to live, then find a job close enough to where that place is to walk to. 

Life will not be glamorous, but you won’t be abused anymore. If your mom is trying to pump money out of you, she wants to make sure you *never* get out. You need buckle down, accept that things will be hard and suck for a bit, but ultimately do what’s best for you "
"Because she has three other roommates who might not want to tiptoe around someone sleeping in the couch. 

They slept in the same room, not the same bed."
This is terrible advice. Do not listen to this advice specifically.
"OP was told the ashes were scattered when he died. 
When she found out the truth, that her fathers ashes were sitting in a shed, she repeatedly asked her mother for them but her mother refused. 
Her mother wanted to walk up a mountain and spread the ashes but OP had just miscarried and couldn’t walk that far. 
So OPs mom decided to toss the ashes over a bridge. After OP asked her to wait to do anything. 

This was most certainly not the mother asking repeatedly for 11 years. 
And even if it was, it doesn’t give the mother the right to do this. "
"I agree with your first paragraph. I wouldn't apologize, personally. I would say ""If I hadn't talked to her the only difference is she would be pregnant now"". "
"&gt; I don't feel like this should be my financial responsibility

This is totally fair. But this means having a less ""hands on"" presence in her life (if only to keep them from guilt tripping you)"
"Seriously op if your manager found his behavior unacceptable, it’s his own damn fault for being innapropriate in the workplace. "
"It's funny, because most of the people I encounter like this suddenly change their ways when confronted with consequences. Sometimes they don't/can't, but usually it's just a matter of what they're able to get away with.

We hired a doctor at our practice who, despite interviewing very well and having good references, seemed to have zero bedside manner. We were losing patients who had come to us for decades. I suspect that some of it was classism/racism on his part, but the rest seemed like he was doing a Dr. House cosplay or something. When I and his other boss sat him down and basically said, 'You have 30 days to resolve this issue or you're fired' he magically changed his tune.

"
"Even if my comment is wrong and he’s not trying to make you jealous, it’s still manipulative behavior and at the very least super gross toward the waitstaff. Even if the service wasn’t great those kinds of pet names are demeaning. You’ve known him for three weeks and he’s trying to get it in without a condom. That’s alarming. "
"Oh, we absolutely get angry answers (depending on the context). It's just about priorities.

If it's something that is just upsetting me personally, I can decide for myself if it's worth the hassle of confrontation. *But* if my sister is upsetting someone else I care about/treating them poorly, especially if it's a kid, then she can throw all the temper tantrums she wants but I'm going to call her out on her crappy behaviour.

I'd just flat out ask her if she has a problem with your youngest and if she asks why/acts shocked you would even ask, then explain and tell her if she's going to leave one out then you'd rather she didn't buy gifts for any of them (if she doesn't see your issue, dumb it down for her -- ask her how she'd feel if you did the same with her kids, playing favourites and leaving one out)."
I am failing to get the logic of why you opened your home and family up to this guy.  He didn't respect you from day one and you continue to patronize him.  You must have a halo around your head!
"Totally agree with this comment - apologize to the parents if need be (even tell them that you were hoping that the info about STIs and pregnancy might scare her off the idea and the condoms were to make her think about the reality of it all) but the fact of the matter is that clearly your cousin was going to have sex - whether you had the conversation or not. At least this way, she was hopefully safe and informed.)

Another thought to bear in mind - do they know she definitely had sex? Teenage girls can feel just as much pressure as teenage boys to be seen as sexual and, therefore, 'adult'. Is it possible she maybe just said this to her friend in an attempt to be impressive? It's beside the point now really but I'd say smooth any ruffled feathers as best you can and feel confidence in that at least she now has the information.  "
"Agree with all of the above and piling on to add -- this happened to me and to a friend of mine. Physical abuse often starts this way. It can take a while to escalate, but it will. And you will be so desensitized to it that it will be harder to help yourself. Plus, this behavior is abusive in and of itself. I remember thinking ""ok, if he hits me, that will be a clear line I cannot cross and I will leave."" But what kind of life is that‽ Waiting for someone to hit you‽ You can love him dearly and get all the therapy you want -- it still isn't the right relationship."
"If you can't afford the bachelorette trip on your own, don't go. 

You would be putting the rest of the bridal party in an awkward position, this is supposed to be a girls' trip. 

It is also odd that your bf wants to go on a trip alone just to save you money. Would that really be the vacation he'd choose to go on in other circumstances? If you go through with this he could end up (rightfully) resenting you for it."
"You know what?  I misread the OP's statement.  I read it as ""I told her repeatedly **I** didn't want to do anything"". 

That does change things quite a bit."
She dumped them off a bridge in secret.
"Wow you’re immature as hell.

You do realize that even though you and Isha are “closer” this doesn’t fix your original problem of wanting to raise future children under your own religion right? 
The smart thing to do when you first broke up would have been to stop talking to Isha....but you’ve made a mess.
I don’t know what you think you owe to Susan but you really don’t owe her anything. If you MUST exacerbate this situation by maintaining contact then be honest and say that your relationship with isha grew when you didn’t expect it to.
Then stop talking to Susan. 

Good grief"
"Personally, I go by the “do onto others and you’d like done onto yourself.” So if you were in the girls position, what would you want the other woman to do? I would message her (if I had solid proof) and just say, “hey, just found out the guy I’m FWB with is actually your boyfriend. I’ve deleted/blocked his number but I thought you should know” and then include any proof. If she decides not to believe you, that’s her own choice. I wouldn’t be able to live with the fact that I didn’t tell...but obviously that’s your personal decision. "
"Don't marry somebody in your early 20s if you guys aren't even on the same page about what *type* of relationship you want to have. You shouldn't even be dating if you want to be poly and she doesn't. This is a bad fit, and I would not even think about wedding planning stuff until this is all settled with both parties 100% satisfied. If you can't both get to 100% satisfied, then you should move on."
"Exactly. I love cooking, but sometimes, certain foods have darker spots. If somebody said “don’t burn my food” I’d be like sick, I’ve got you dawg. But then I’d prob serve something with darker spots on it. Dark =/= burnt. Calling it burnt is just going to frustrate or confuse him. "
Can I ask what has stopped you from asking him directly? Eg: ‘how do you see our relationship at the moment?’
"Head over to r/momforaminute. I mom over there sometimes, it's rewarding :)"
"First of all, have you actually sorted out what YOU want to do? Because it sounds like your family is very (overly?) involved in making decisions for you, and giving you a lot of input, and you feel like you ""should"" do certain things because they are ""better,"" but what do you really want?  So take away the family suggestions and the ""shoulds,"" and decide what YOUR ideal (but realistic) life looks like - where you live, who you're with, where you're working, etc, and plan accordingly. 

Also, you don't even have this money yet, right? And there's no reason it needs to be spent right away. If it makes more sense, you could stay put for a couple of years, long enough so it looks like you have a stable job history (and your BF's, too, if he's part of your life plan), let the money earn some interest, THEN relocate.  And if you decide you do want to move soon-ish, make plans to do that, invite your BF to join if you want him to, but don't tell him how to handle his assets - it's not your call whether he should sell or rent out his house. Just be clear about your commitment level in that case - if you want to hopefully get engaged, tell him that so you can start cautiously making plans as partners (I say cautiously because it can get messy to mingle your finances or jointly own property before marriage), or if you enjoy dating him but aren't sure about a timeline for marriage, tell him that so he can make a fully informed decision about how much to sacrifice (career progress, liquidating real estate)."
"If your wife had posted this, I would tell her that more than a MIL problem, she has s husband problem."
"This is not learned helplessness. Learned helplessness is when an animal experiences repeated and unavoidable aversives until they get to a point where they stop trying to avoid it. They learn that the pain or whatever is unavoidable and give up. 

He is feigning helplessness. Pretending to be incompetent so that somebody else will come do his work for him.  "
"LAWYER FIRST. LAWYER FIRST. In a situation like this you need to see the lawyer the very first thing. You don't have to initiate a divorce just because you see a lawyer. You don't need to even take the advice you get. But a lawyer will help you figure out what your options are, and what the relevant laws are. THIS IS INFORMATION YOU NEED TO HAVE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR YOUR KIDS.

I also recommend seeing a counselor, just for yourself. "
"You need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend. He needs to respect you and your boundaries.

Luckily, this girl is moving away, there aren't many other girls like her out there that would so openly do this shit, sounds like a real loser to me, so at the very least you don't have to worry for long.

At the same time, this is a deeper issue with his respect for you, in my opinion. Just because the problem is going to solve itself doesn't mean you shouldn't try to fix it yourself, because a similar issue may happen in future."
"You are 25 years old. You moved to another continent to further your education and you are independent.

Your parents want you to go ""home"", but you feel that where you are now is your home. Make a decision based on what you want, what you planned and what you have.

They probably will be upset, so what ? You don't live to please them, you live your own life. I understand that you don't want them to be upset, but come on, you are an adult and you need to live your own life by your own terms, focusing on your happiness, carrer and future.

Talk to them and explain why you don't want to go back to USA, tell them your plans and, if possible, make a schedule to visit them/they visit you! You will not ""lose"" your family just because you are thousand miles away, especially because you are pursuing a better future for you, nor your parent will ""lose"" their daughter because she lives in another country.

(Sorry about bad english, it's isn't my first language)"
"&gt;  I'm 25 and I made the decision to no longer talk to my father last year when he forgot my birthday for about the fifth time

Wow.  That's 20% of all your birthdays to date.  Your dad sucks.  "
"Wow. This response literally made me cry, and I’m not even in the situation. 

OP, I have no idea if this will make you feel any better.... but as a wife, if I died, I would be thankful if my husband was able to be happy again and re-marry. I would be thankful to the other woman for taking care of my husband and being with him while I could not. I empathize with you and your feelings of never having been able to have these experiences/children with your first wife, but I’m sure wherever she is, she would still love to see you be happy."
"Definitely got some hoarding delusions starting here, she's awfully concerned about her ""stuff."" Thinking it's better for the environment to not throw things away means she probably has the delusion that she will use the things later no matter how worthless or unsanitary they are. Also with the shopping, buying more things than she needs.

Hoarding usually gets worse after a significant traumatic event, has anything bad happened to her lately? This will absolutely not get better without professional intervention/will likely get worse. Hoarders are often very resistant to the label, obviously it's not flattering, and she may consider herself a champion for the environment or a collector or some such instead.

You need to sit her down and discuss getting her help, tell her how her avoiding the issue is bothering you, and ask her why she feels the need to keep useless items, it's all rooted in anxiety. I wouldn't be surprised if she has relatives who hoard."
THIS. You need therapy. Your first wife would be devastated to find out the memory of her is impeding your joy of parenthood. You need to work through this before you destroy your second marriage. 
"What I really don't like about your boyfriend's reaction is that he only wants to take his own views into consideration. This is one of those things where there's two different valid arguments (objectively speaking, yours is the one that makes sense, your bf feels the way he does because he is close with Mike) and the conclusion needs to take both of you into account. Also, he's not actually being a good friend to Mike by enabling his childish behavior. When your close friends are acting stupid because of high emotions you have to tell them the voice of reason. He should grow up and attend social things, yes it's awkward and not the most relaxing but that's just part of being an adult. And if he really can't handle it then HE declines the invitation."
Great advice! Please don’t make a snap decision in the heat of the moment! 
"Not saying you're wrong, but if it was a joke, it was the stupidest joke he could have possibly done"
"Nice, I’m glad someone else said it already!"
"Op, there are a mix of responses here. I hope my opinion can help you decide what to do.
Your fiancée is completely entitled to her dream wedding, and you are also entitled to have your niece present, as priority guests are a real thing. Would she still marry you if you didn’t care that her priority guests weren’t able to attend because they were disabled? Would you disregard their feelings and hurt like your fiancée is doing towards you and your niece? 
If you absolutely want you niece present at your wedding, and she refuses to compromise, that’s a big red flag for the future. People matter more than venues.
There are tons of gorgeous venues out there. Your niece is the only girl on this planet who is your niece, and she sounds like a sweetheart to be your favorite!
If your fiancée can not compromise her dream venue, don’t take it from her. But she’ll have to walk down the isle with someone else. Or, you’ll have to break it your niece. I’m sure she might even be a good sport about it. But chances are she’ll be crushed. More importantly, even if you niece is ok with it, will you be? It seems like you won’t, because you know what matters in life, and it’s more valuable than some fancy dream venue."
So. Do you get any input in her wedding or do you just get to show up and stand next to her?
"When it comes to engagement rings? Yes. 

Nobody is saying OP's boyfriend had to sell an arm and a leg to pay for the ring. But there's a difference between a pretty, affordable engagement ring with a lot of thought behind it....and cheap second-hand junk jewelry. Unfortunately, OP's boyfriend bought the latter. "
"I think this is a really good idea. I do want him to propose again. however, he gets overwhelmed with emotion easily (he kind of stonewall's, but not maliciously) and he might feel too ""pressured"" if I ask him to propose again. maybe we can talk about it and then do something fun and sweet together after. I do want to marry him."
"I got really sick last summer and my husband had to do everything. From helping me in and out of bed/helping me get dressed to driving me to doctor's appointments, taking care of our dog, etc. I would take a nap and wake up and he'd have the whole house cleaned (he hates to clean and I'm really picky about how it's done, so normally I clean and he does the floors -- so this was big). I know I can count on him. Hell, a couple weeks ago I was swamped at work and since my mom doesn't drive and he had the day off he took her to an appointment for me. That's somebody I know I can trust and I know he's got my back. I'm doing much better now and he knows how grateful I am that I could count on him.

This guy couldn't even be bothered to clean up blood smears (I mean, really?) and he completely neglected helpless animals. What a piece of crap."
"My bf used to do this. We live together. It drove me crazy and we don’t even pay for the water bill (it’s included in the rent). But still. There’s no reason to be in there for more than 15 minutes max. We live in Southern California and just got out of a huge drought. I keep my showers around 10 minutes tops. He isn’t pooping or masturbating because he will keep the doors open. I hated how it made the whole upstairs steamy and musty/swamp like as well. 

I finally had a talk with him about it. He told me he stands under the hot water because it loosens up his back muscles. Fair enough I guess. But still, that can be limited to 15 minutes. 

You’re not crazy for bringing it up! It’s your place, your rules. "
"Also with friends: jokingly refer to gf as ""cougar"". Take the sting out of their barbs by owning the situation."
"If he's mentally 15 as an adult, he needs help before he can healthily get involved in a romantic relationship"
"You're leaving out a lot of details here. Part of the reason you're not going, I'm assuming, is because of your work? If so, as others have said, jumping right to divorce for this isn't the right solution. First see if you can get some care &amp; compassionate leave from your work, or a short term leave, and go down and help your husband get settled, see how it goes for that week (or however long you can manage). Be supportive and just see what he needs that you can help.

And talk. Talk about your concerns, talk with him about his concerns/fears, and what baby steps you can do moving forward. Then go home and go back to work when you have to, see how things go for a month or two and see if you can manage to fly down for a weekend and see how that goes. By then both of you may have a better idea of what you see happening down the road, you'll see how he's adjusted and doing with his siblings, and you'll be able to make a more sound and educated decision instead of one based on What Ifs."
"Would it be helpful for him to do something special to remember his mom tomorrow?

After my brother died, I remembered his birthday every year by baking a cake. I can’t explain it, but it helps me to do something as a small tribute to his memory on special days. 

Something simple, like buying her favorite flowers and putting them in a vase on the table at dinner. 

It also might help your son to know that you and your wife won’t try to replace his mom or forget her. 

But, I understand that your son might not be ready for that. It’s just a thought. "
She doesnt even feel remorse for slapping him. There really is not a lot to forgive when the person doesnt want forgiveness.
"Wtf - I mean sure. But you have peach fuzz too, it is literally the little hairs that cover your entire body. Do you shave your entire body? This is the kind of hair you are making an issue over."
"Not right now, but when you're ready. Your wife should read it, too.

I wish you the best possible outcome. Reach to family and friends in your time of need. They're more than happy to offer support right now while you sort things out."
I thought it was because they weren't married yet but this makes way more sense. 
[removed]
This is very valid. I have conversations with my friends about myself and my SO that I wouldn’t necessarily want them to see even if I’m not doing anything wrong or dishonest. I would definitely word things differently if I thought my SO was going to see all of my text messages. 
"This is exactly how I feel about my own devices. I'm not hiding anything, but there are some conversations that are too personal for me to share or let anybody look at. "
"Yo. Dude. I sympathize with you regarding the fights. That's really rough that she pulls out this hurtful stuff.

BUT GET IT TOGETHER. MARRY HER OR BREAK UP.

You can never know how your relationship is going to go. There's never a guarantee that your partner is gonna stay the same or change like you want them. 

Marry her and start a family. And if you're still not ready break up. You're dragging this woman along and I swear her behavior is not getting better. 

If you break up, don't let her talk you into anything. Break up. No seconds chance, not guilt, just fucking do it because it will be better for her in the long term. "
The affair was over 10 years ago. You have stayed with her for 10 years after the cheating occurred. You actually planned to manipulate her and catch her off guard so you could get 'the truth.' She doesn't remember all of the details you want this far past the event. I'm sure she remembers the significant parts of the affair but even if you do force her to give you a play-by-play she'll end up filling some of it in. It would be very unusual if she actually remembered every detail of what happened. Her cheating was awful and you have every right to end the marriage. If you keep bringing it up and trying to trick her and manipulate her then you will likely get the end of the marriage anyway so you might as well just get a divorce. If you haven't moved past it in 10 years you aren't going to. Are you going to bring it up again when you are both 60?
"Yeah agree. When there's a group of 5 or more people, they can be adults about it. She said she doesn't mind. So invite her.
I wouldnt punish her because her ex cant handle his feelings. "
"\&gt; I'm struggling with this because it isn't a very clear\-cut dealbreaker situation. 

That's only because of how you are framing it. He is an alcoholic, failure to address that is absolutely a deal breaker for most. 

People become dependent on drinking for a variety of reasons. One common one is that when they drink themselves into a stupor they get to be 'rescued' by someone. In this case it seems he likes to have you coddle him because he chooses to be drunk and inevitably take advantage of you over attempting to be reasonable. He likes being weak and having you mother him. 

The problem is that you are unwittingly becoming an enabler. Not consciously, but by picking up for him and constantly giving him the positive reinforcement of being there he has become addicted to this behaviour loop. You say you have to clean up after him but the second you do he has proven it is okay to do what he is doing. 

It's also about how he acts when sober. Why are you cleaning up? Does he refuse to clean up? He'll replace food \[which he knows he will eat\] but how does he make up for your labor, is it acknowledged at all? Honestly, this is an issue in and of itself that you could end the relationship over, not being acknowledged for what you do is absolutely a deal breaker. 

Quitting drinking is hard, no doubt. I was the same as him, heck, I had friends who would buy me drinks then update online the next day about how great they were for looking after me. But I was still taking advantage of them and, ultimately, was constantly exposing but avoiding truly facing the clear deeper issues I was suffering from. He can only expose his weakness while inebriated, I don't think ADHD is the problem where much deeper and more problematic anxieties keeping peeking out. "
"uh...he didn't come to her. She came to him when she got the OK to start trying to conceive, and then he dropped this news on her. he was being really cowardly about that piece, at least."
"It's 250 steps up, then 100 down. So no, we can't just carry her. "
"She is saying that now because she knows it won't happen. 

At this point, nothing matters more than a venue. In my opinion, that's stupid. Yeah, a wedding is about you two, but it's also sharing it with family otherwise you would just do a courthouse wedding with you both and not invite a soul. 

This is about her. Her choice, her plan, her wedding. She has had this planned since she was a kid. How much input do you really think you will get to have? 

The marriage is important, not the wedding and at this point she can't even show you that she is willing to compromise. Bridezilla incoming, dude. "
"I am just blown away. She’s not trying to exclude drunk uncle Frank from the wedding; she wants to exclude the *disabled child*. Like, it’s skin crawly."
"These people are all crazy. They’re telling you to dump him over a stupid fight about your hair. Not everyone is perfect, *people make mistakes.* You don’t dump someone over a petty argument like this. If you’re one of those people you have a problem.
Don’t drop him just because he doesn’t like your hair.
I do agree that he should respect your decisions as long as you’re not hurting anyone or yourself and that he should stop acting controlling in that way
I think you need to communicate with him! 
Definitely communicate with him on your concerns. Wait until he’s ready. If he keeps acting controlling and like a child/doesn’t get over it with time then THAT would be a red flag."
"Yeah, this is definitely something most people would end a relationship over. Sorry your boyfriend is a dishonest liar, OP. It's not even as if his issues were asymptomatic, he was directly, willfully exposing you. On the plus side you found out before you got in any deeper and wasted any more of your time - so don't trick yourself into thinking you might as well forgive him because you've already invested into him. Four months is nothing. 

Also, not for nothing, but this also explains why this relationship progressed faster than normal for you. People with abandonment issues - in this case, his knowledge that if you knew he had genital warts you would probably leave - ""love bomb"" to pull the person in deeply, quickly. "
"You can have an opinion, but it's going to be humiliating anyway. It just is. She probably already knows and just hopes you'll ignore it forever. Which you probably should because there is no polite way to say it and there is not good time. She will probably start shaving it but she'll feel super insecure around you most likely. For instance she probably won't want you close to her face for awhile or every time your eyes go to her lip area she will want to turn away."
"There are three of you in this relationship, and his mother is the #1 woman in his life. She probably always will be if he hasn't already learned to set up proper boundaries. You deserve so much more respect than this. You are not overreacting. I'm so glad you said no. He needs a wakeup call."
"Are you actually attracted to anyone? Male or female? Do you want to be in a relationship? 
If you’re happy the way you are then don’t worry about it. 
It’s okay to be aromantic or asexual.
If you do want to be in a relationship, maybe there’s a few things you can do to make yourself more appealing? Not just physical things like dressing better and such, but also working on yourself as a person. Pick up some interesting hobbies, try new things with new people, travel. 
I have a friend that I really like that meets your description of being “weird” and having almost solely female friends. I know she gets the same kind of pressure, but honestly she’s awesome and I know that as soon as she gains some confidence (which often comes with age) and meets some new people, she won’t have any problems. "
"You’ve fallen back into the cycle of abuse, and it’s only a matter of time. Please be careful, be aware. You deserve better than this man even if he says he’s “changed.” It doesn’t undo what he did 4 years ago. 

He constantly tried to reach out to you to fix this over be years. Over and over he wanted to reconnect to bring you back into his life because you’re comfortable and familiar, and possibly easy to manipulate. 

Please think about what other people are saying on this forum and look objectively at your situation. 

How is your therapist not warning you about this? I don’t understand. Everything about this should be red flags to a therapist. "

"You’re young. Lack of respect will eventually manifest itself in other ways. If you’re on this sub very much you will see the number of roommates who are mad that their roommate gave out a key and allows their significant other a key. It is considered rude and in poor etiquette, especially if he isn’t respecting the house. Your roommate deserves to be able to run from one room to the next In her underwear if she knows you’re at work without fear of a random guy walking in. She deserves to be able to have her own space. Be a good roommate and take care of this issue."
"He can be from judgmental to the biggest asshole of all time,at least he gets to keep his sanity."
This post is a waste of time. Totally agree with your comment 
"It’s not just breathing and stuttering though, it’s stuff like snoring and slurping. I’m one of those people who finds those tics insurmountable. I can’t even stand to be in the room with someone doing that. 

I have tremendous respect for OP’s girlfriend for trying to help him get over his nervous tics and being patient for so long. I couldn’t have done it. "
"This is so shocking I’m sorry for your family. I can’t say I’ve been in the exact same place but I have 2 step kids who when I met them had 50/50 custody but over time their mom only has them 1 day a week. This was extremely hard for me as I never pictured being a full time step mother, which is what you will be doing but with an extreme situation. The only thing I can think of to say is obviously therapy. The other thing which I know sounds bad is the relief that you can now focus on your family without the chaos she was creating. You no longer have to deal with all that you are physically and legally free to make whatever choices you want unfortunately mentally is a different story. I can’t even imagine how this would feel. Good luck to you and your family I wish you the best. "
That's pretty bad... Men only really do this when they dont respect t the woman.  If we do respect her... no way!  I'd probably leave my partner if they did this. gross. violating.

This is an incredibly naive comment. There are plenty of racists who are bigoted against one race but not another.

"Its not hard to get clean if you're not fully an addict. OP said he did it 10-12 times in 3 years. That's not an addiction, and much easier to just stop doing. "
You have to end this friendship. This is so fucked up. How could you ever trust him again?
"My parents were and are amazing people. They raised my brothers and I to be caring and eempathetic. My Dad had the biggest heart and was a father figure to many of our friends who had absent fathers... Growing up, all of our friends knew that they could call our Dad for advice or help or a place to stay or even just a good meal if they were ever in need. Many of them even called him ""Pops"" because that's who he was to them.

The loss of my Dad has left a massive hole in all of our lives that can never be filled. Some days are harder than others, but I keep limping along because life keeps moving whether I fall apart or not. As cliche as it sounds, I choose to be the kind of person he would want for me to be... In that way, he's never really gone, because his legacy of caring for people goes on in myself, my brothers and all of our friends who consoder him to be their Dad, too."
"I'd leave him too. That is a staggering breach of trust, and not one I think I could overcome... and I've been able to heal the betrayal of my SO cheating on me. This however is to me even worse than cheating."
"If you are ticing it’s important for her to understand this isn’t something you do to annoy her. It’s more than that. Asking you to stop ticing is more than asking you to stop a bad habit. So this may be something to explore.

I can see what that poster means. But it’s still up to you to decide if the description is accurate and also if it’s something you want to change.

Bottom line I think is if you see an issue with these things. If you think you need to change, change. If you’re fine the way you are, find a new girlfriend."
A tale as old as time...
"I think you're right, and the thing he was talking about is somewhat normal and natural.

That doesn't change the fact, however, that it was extremely disrespectful to her and their relationship for him to share that story with his friends in the way it was described here. He was literally bragging about how distracted he was by other women on their *anniversary*. It makes her look like a fool. Like she was just sitting there mooning over him while he pulled the old waistband tuck because of the chick over her left shoulder. The punch line wasn't ""and it was so awkward and the worst!"" It was ""lol and I didn't give a shit cuz hott chicks."" I'd be super hurt if I heard my husband talk so dismissively about what I thought had been a special day to both of us."
"Well then OP, guess you have your answer then. You're allowed to be friends with people your parents have issues with. The only person stopping you from having a relationship with your sister is you right now.

"&gt;Not that half ass “I’m sorry BUT” apology.

Because he doesn't nspire those intense feelings of lust in her.
I think it’s pretty obvious that she’s trying to force you to grow up a little and move out and move forward with life. She’s “punishing” you because she thinks (and for good reason) it’s ridiculous you don’t move out. Not sure why at 24 you’re not ready to do so. She’s going to push you down and down until there’s nothing left and she can move on to somebody who’s more ready for I dunno.. real life? Obviously don’t do anything you don’t want to. But if you don’t want to move out of your parents house at 24.. she has every right to be upset and downgrade your relationship. 
"Well since she's dating you husband, I definitely understand why she feels anything you say is an attack."
I’m sort of surprised no one has asked about what he’s stolen when you say he goes through your things when not directly observed. Has he ever taken your underwear? Because to be real - it sounds like he is escalating as he learns what behaviour his family will tolerate. 
"No, it's none of your business."
"Discuss the fact that you need to get high in order to properly clean the household. Your buddy knows that but your girlfriend doesn't? 

Also, you weren't out with your friends. You were home alone in your SHARED house smoking pot. Either you didn't care to know how she felt about it, or you knew she doesn't like drugs and decided to do them while she's away.

Either way, it definitely seems to her that you were hiding it. Regardless of if you were or not. Try to understand where she's coming from. She probably thinks she doesn't know you as well as she thought."
"Even after his edit I am still put off by this characterization. My girlfriend's parents take me out to eat and to sporting events regularly but I like to think it's because they are fun people who enjoy my company as well as their own daughters and they just generally at the very least don't mind facilitating everyone having a good time. 

Trying to lock you down sounds like you think very highly of yourself and not very highly of them. Also pretty paranoid..."

I think you can get DNA from poop. The perfect crime would be to leave someone else's poop in the tank. Preferably the guy she cheated with although it may be awkward trying to acquire some of his poop.
“Old Russian literature” this is a totally uneccesary detail. You have a crush on your main character in this narrative- yourself. 
"Even if it’s not anything big, teenagers are full of hormones, and sometimes unpredictable. Ask Tyler *how* she’s been asking to meet you. If he describes her as really eager and excited, go for it! If she’s just as excited as you she would find it a sweet gesture! If it’s any less that I would wait. She may *want* to like you, and making an effort to, but you’re a fairly significant new female figure in her life and this is entirely new territory. I’m only 19 and I would have felt completely overwhelmed with that right away (from 14+), even after wanting to meet her! Meet up with her as soon as you can, evaluate the environment, and perhaps bring it in! Or even wait until you’ve spent some time with her and gift it a few meetings later. Either way it’s an incredibly nice action. Just take your time, like you said - it’s new territory, so I would wait until you have a bit more insight into how your relationship with her is going.

Edit: Just reread your post would like to add be especially cautious because she JUST got kicked out by her moms bf... She’ll be internally blaming the “newcomer” and missing her mom. Which in both cases makes her more likely to be wary of you "

You get that this is the exact opposite of what he needs from you, right? 


He can take a break for the rest of his twenties and wake up ten years from now in a shit job he hates, wishing that he had put in some effort when he had the chance.


That's what happens as we transition to adulthood. No one's looking over your shoulder anymore. If he decides to drop out, the world will let him. No one's going to bend themselves over backwards to make sure he puts in max effort. 


I'm not saying it *has* to be college. It's not for everyone, and there are other avenues, like learning a trade. But he doesn't seem to be suggesting anything other than something ""easier and faster.""


I hope this doesn't sound too harsh, it's just scary for someone to be so cavalier about big decisions that affect their future."

"...have you tried asking him? 

I mean, from what you've said, it just seems like you're both too gunshy to make the first move toward a relationship even though you've **made out**, **gone on dates**, and *probably made enough goo goo eyes* at each other to make your friends sick.

So just ask him. Before someone else does."
Only real reason to do something like that at his age is if he needed a down payment to buy a house. You would be trading your 401k savings for equity in a home and hoping that it appreciated. To take out a 401 Loan for consumables is......stupid. To say the least.
"I stopped reading halfway through. Dude break up with this guy he’s incredibly disrespectful of your relationship, is cheating on you, and is in love with his cousin. Anyone can do better than this."
"&gt;  If I meant anything to him, surely he would want to make the effort with me and not just because I’m conveniently near him.

^^ You sound like you have an extremely sound head on your shoulders. I think you already know what's best for you emotionally, but it's being blockaded by your love for him. If he really loved you and wanted to be with you, he would have at least /tried/ for a LD relationship. He didn't even put forth an ounce of effort in that direction. It sounds like a relationship with you is a matter of convenience for him, and not something he's actually invested in. 

Don't sell yourself short. You're starting a new job, you're going to be meeting incredible and new people! Please think about your own emotional investment before you decide that getting back together is what's best for you, because as an outsider it definitely reads that this guy only wants to be with you because it's easy if you're closer to him. 

&gt;  I can’t keep my life on hold until he’s ready/ if he’s ever ready because that’s not fair on me but I don’t know if this is a case of bad timing or if he just doesn’t love me as much as I would like him to.

Exactly! It isn't fair to you! Be proud of yourself for being so insightful even though you're still in an emotional upset about this. I firmly believe you're going to be okay and I think you may need to distance yourself from him a bit, to be truly on the 'moving on' train. 

&gt; I also feel kind of disappointed in myself. I know he finds me attractive but is that all I am to him? I’m good enough to have sex with but not good enough for a relationship?

Him not wanting to be in a relationship with you is not EVER a reflection of who you are as a person, and is instead a reflection of himself. He doesn't want to be with you for whatever reasoning/logic he's content with in his own mind. You were together for 3 years, which is an incredibly long time for someone to be invested in another person. If he hasn't found whatever he's looking for in a relationship in that time, it isn't your fault. It's whatever HE thinks he's looking for. You're an incredible person and wonderfully insightful about your own emotional state, you're going to be just fine.

I don't think he's worth the time or effort sis, and I promise you as soon as you start to see it too, all your new experiences and the people who come along with it will change your life!"
"&gt; Just because he didn’t defer to her 

A framework of relationship in which taking the other person's perspectives, needs, desires into account is seen as ""deferring"" to them is a relationship framework that is *not* about working together as a team.

"I kind of understand where she is coming from.  I mean, I get that you work really hard to be able to do the things you want, but you have to meet her half way.  Part of being in a relationship is being able to explore things together.  Yes, there will be moments where you’ll have/want to do things alone which is fine, but I feel like being gone for 6 months to backpack in a place where she’d like to go as well is a little messed up.

Also, asking her to quit her job and finding a new one is a little selfish.  You wouldn’t change your job for so why should she?  Maybe if you were willing to support her financially it would be different.  I mean it sounds like you have the means to do so, why not do it so she can join you?  Just a thought.  "

I’m no expert but this guy doesn’t seem to like your personality. My ex husband was this way. Whenever I would be chatty with a cashier about their day he would stand there and roll his eyes.

"I read this really sad article a while back, about how when women die, there are rarely many photos of them, no where near as many as photos of their husband \+ kids.. and why is that? Because the women took the time and effort to capture these images ...dad \+ kid napping, messy meal times, opening gifts on xmas morning etc etc. basic every day things that many take for granted.

The article was written from the view point of the husband, who realized upon his wife death, he had only a handful of photos of her, and non in recent years. And by then it was too late. The article was a tear jerker, and a plea to other men to not make the same mistake. 

I bet that husband was like OP when she was alive. "

"I would absolutely appreciate it, but that's one of those every day things. Why wait until a gift giving holiday? Because normally you wouldn't care enough to? Yes these 3 or 4 times per year I will do a good deed for my partner, but not a day sooner. "

"Dunno, OP, but it would drive me crazy. :-/

Good luck. "
"Much cheaper than a mini-fridge: a fridge locker, which is basket/box thing that you put in the fridge, takes up part of a shelf, and it locks. Probably $15-$30, depending on what size you get.  But if they want, they could just throw out the whole thing, if they're that bad. BTW, did they reimburse you for the meat they BBQed?

Do you have a timeline to move out? Even just renting a room in someone's house, or a share house, or getting an apartment with roommates would be better than feeling sabotaged in your own home.

Maybe tell them you don't want to hear any comments about your body, your eating, or your exercise, and you're not going to entertain these comments anymore. When they say something again, just get up and walk away. Don't even argue back anymore. Just get up and leave."
"She most likely has depression. 

If she had sex with you before being ready, than I can see why she has maybe been put off now. There is a lot of pressure on women to keep quiet about the physical effects of birth - many don’t even realise about the tearing and being cut open to their anus, until its happening. So keeping quiet that perhaps the sex was painful isn’t a huge leap. She may have done the sex to please you, but it hurt  her, and now she resents you. 

What do her friends and family think? 
Can you send the kids to their grandparents or whatever for a day so you can have a full day off together? 

If there is a way to see a therapist that might help also. Most people with depression will not think they are depressed. "
"Any gift that’s a change to yourself is a crappy gift. Like, ‘Hey honey, I know you love me in a suit so I wore a suit today! Happy Mother’s Day!’ is a crappy gift. If my boyfriend preferred blondes, I wouldn’t bleach my hair as a gift haha. It’s just self indulgent."
She got a scholarship to college. Full ride. 
"I can't imagine waiting a week for people to check up on me. When I have surgery/medical procedure/appointment with an uncertain outcome, as soon as I have results or I'm conscious enough to text I tell my closest friends how it went. I don't expect people to keep track of my appointments or know what to say so I inform them. Hell, I even tell/show people when I get a haircut, and let me tell you I am NEVER disappointed that nobody noticed. "
"This is like proposals as presents. Honey, you're the one who wants to marry me, now it's Christmas day and you haven't got me a present."
"My husband shaves so *I* wont get beard burn on my sensitive bits while his face is down there. When he has a full beard, it's no problem (he randomly grows it out to full lumberjack-burly-man beard length), just the in-between times.  


In-laws visited (from afar) during a 'tween time, by happenstance, right after he shaved.


My mother-in-law saw his smooth face and gleefully exclaimed, 
&gt;""Oh, Son! You shaved your face! Oh, you look so handsome!  Did you shave for meee?!  [Husband] shaved for me too!""


I was *thisclose* to correcting her with the absolute truth."
This! Its amazing to me how people are hung up on the cash value of the thing! It was a FREE thing! He gave it away! It cost him nothing and was a super nice thing to do and people are calling him irresponsible? I'm agog! I really am!
"good lord.  If people could just realize that you get decide what goes into your own butthole, and not anyone elses, we would live in a much better world.  There is no implied buttsex reciprocity treaty."
"You need to take control of your life. You are free to share any of your life news with your family (immediate and extended), regardless of your parents opinions. 

Don't leave this up to your parents. If you want to invite your family to your upcomming wedding, you need to inform everyone ASAP that a) you're divorced, b) you've BEEN divorced/separated for 3 years now, and c) you've been in a new relationship for a while, and are getting married soon. It will take people time to process this information, and there will likely be more than one person who is far from pleased that this information has been hidden from them. 

Another thought I'm having...how close could you possibly be to any of your family if none of them know that you're divorced and have been for several years? From your family's perspective its going to come across as rather odd, and potentially greedy, if suddenly, after 3 years you give them this news and immediately invite them to your wedding. It comes across as ""hey, we're not close enough for you to actually know about basic and important things in my life (and at this point you've been lied to for 3ish years), but please come to my wedding (where social niceties would dictate that you bring a gift), thanks!"""
"And just make sure you never get sick or hurt, no matter how old you are.  "
"Well, what I can say is, your body, your choice. I struggled with body image(still do, as a matter of fact), and that is the crux of the problem, not the weight. Congratulations on your weight loss, but you need to realise that food is your friend in this, not your enemy. Your bf seems odd in his brutally honest suggestion, especially given that you mentioned you know each other for a while, and since before you started losing weight. Maybe in his head this was meant as encouragement. At the same time, if trying to fit into his expectations is giving you anxiety and eating disorders, I don't think you're a good fit for one another. He needs to understand that the only person who can have expectations of you is you"
Making you feel like you did the wrong thing after a completely innocuous decision?
"This is terrible advice. 

If a man chooses to wear tight pants - he can wear tight pants. It's not up to other people to ensure I'm comfortable in public - it's up to me. I'd never expect anyone to change themselves to conform to MY standards. 

If someone wants to sexualize my nipple, that's on THEM. Not me. I wear a bra for my comfort, not that comfort of other people.

"One perspective: he’s a mentor.

After I graduated high school, I stayed in touch with an old teacher. I’m now graduated college and we grab lunch, we went to a hockey game, he brought me small birthday present. He’s single and my dad’s age, but he’s helped me in my career and as a person. "

"... Even women/couples who *want* to get pregnant wait for ultrasounds before telling the world they're having a baby. She may very well be pregnant, but this whole situation is something else.

This is legitimately someone taking advantage of a 20 yr old. At this point, the OP doesn't need to be on Reddit, he needs to get a clear response from her on expectations and go from there. I don't know what kind of legal action you can take (if any) in this case, but free consultation services exist if you're below a certain income bracket. Find one and give them a call - I used one when I had an issue over my car being stolen last year, they're actually very helpful."
"I just wanted to say that I'm sorry you have to deal with this. This is NOT normal. By ANY means. This is insane. You need to take a deep breath and think about what YOU want. Not your mother, but you. 

Your parents seem to think you are their property. An object they can have full control over. You are an adult human being. As such, you have the basic right to privacy. What they are doing was crazy when you were in 6th grade, and down right psycho at this point in time.

Get help. Be it from relatives, friends, or anyone you think might support you. Explain your situation, and be honest. Do not try to lay the blame on your own shortcomings.

"Honestly you might not want it now but in a few years you're going to realise what an absolute creep this guy is and be glad of the distance.

If you start your post about your boyfriend like this and then the rest of the story goes downhill from there, odds are you are in a crappy relationship.

"Sorry to hear that you're dealing with the same kind of thing...I know how hard it is to talk about it, because the social stigma is huge!

When I was younger I didn't experience bladder issues at all so my problem is a bit different, but nevertheless your story echoes mine. Apparently the cause of my issue is an unclear immune disease, but fortunately I don't have any other symptoms. Concerning the treatments, pelvic floor therapy or so wouldn't help but I've tried various medications called ""antichollinergics"".

I hope that you'll find a solution soon :)"
"I know you said in your update that you have a pattern of not doing what you’ve said you do, and I get that is a contributing factor. 

However, my husband has a long history of meddling in the kitchen (my kitchen, essentially; he doesn’t even know where things go and can’t make anything more complex than spaghetti). I get frustrated at least twice a month because he’s fucked with something and ruined it or thrown it out because he didn’t know. 

Yesterday I was hungover and grumpy and came out to find that he’d opened jam I had canned the day before and didn’t even register if it had sealed properly so that I could trust the other jar. 

I was beyond exasperated and annoyed, as this is a long pattern, but honestly I kept my temper and reminded myself it was just a mistake and not the end of the world. I was visibly annoyed, but I didn’t have a total meltdown temper tantrum like your fiancé did in your situation. 

It would have been fine for them to be like, “Look, I’m super annoyed because this ALWAYS happens and we need to discuss this.” It’s not fine to get halfway to the restaurant, demand you go home, and then throw a tantrum that you made their original requested dinner instead of the takeaway you offered and they turned down but then secretly wanted you to get anyway. 

That’s not okay. It’s not reasonable. And the silent treatment is NEVER acceptable. "
Your husband hates your parents because they were horrible to the person he loves. 
"Therapy, that's what you do."
Even just diatrimetrous earth for goodness sake.

"&gt; If he gets angry/defensive, you know he's lying.

It was good advice, until this. I get angry and defensive, even when I'm telling the truth.

EDIT: I worded that a bit funny, but you know what i mean: Anger and defensiveness are not signs of guilt. "
"Dumb question... But when your parents abused you...did they say ""we are only doing this because we love/care about you"".  I'm not an expert, but it possible that deep down you might see your husband support as opposite of your parents and your subconscious is saying he doesn't love/care about me.  Just my thoughts"
"&gt;Is it normal for guys in good relationships to want to jerk off?

Yes.  Very normal.  

As long as you are sexually satisfied, I don't think it's a problem.  As to the porn, maybe you should have a conversation with him about what you are comfortable with and what you aren't.  It's very common for ""camgirl"" type sites to be considered taboo because of the possibility of interaction, but that's up to each individual couple.

The more important thing to note here is that his masturbation likely has very little to do with you.  He's not doing it because there is a problem in the relationship, he's just letting off some steam."
"I don't know, they've been together for 10 years so they must be decently happy together and happy with the arrangement. But still, like you say, the reason why they opened it might be very telling. "

"This guy is a piece of trash. Doesn’t bother to put in any effort or affection to your relationship.

Kick him to the curb."
"Him saying it's bullshit is not necessary. But he's also not obliged to be interested in it. 

I don't know - I guess if someone isn't interested in what I want to talk about, that's ok. There are plenty of people to talk to those things about, they don't have to be your partner. "
"All I can say is what I would do/feel. I would think about how much worse I would feel after she's gone that I had the chance to do these things and I didn't. I personally bought one of those ""Conversations with my mother"" books. Its really great. It has things you ask your mom and as the conversations go along, you record them in this book. Before she's unable to hear you, or before she's gone, I would encourage this. Maybe it'll be less like ""hey I want to talk before you can't talk to me"" and more like "" hey I found this fun project we can do together."""
"Even the strongest, most positive people out there have bad days. If he truly loves you hell be there to support you on those bad days :)"
"There are a couple of possible explanations:

1. He’s embarrassed that you’re much younger and he’s somewhat dependent on you.

2. His family includes a wife or partner that you don’t know about

3. His family have serious issues that he doesn’t want you to know about.

How active is he on social media? Is he on it at all? If so, is he hiding your relationship? Is he linked to a lot of family members? Check on Facebook and see if you can find anything.

Whatever the reason, him completely stonewalling you over it is not okay, and if he does this over one issue he might do it over another. You need to sit down with him and point out that not even acknowledging your comments is worrying, and that he needs to actually address what you’re saying."
"If your kid is young enough, then it's not just about a babysitter, it's about the first time your kid has been with a person that isn't you and your partner.  It's whether your toddler will be petrified and shrieking all evening etc etc.

I've seen a few weddings where to handle the small children problem (i.e. parents can't sit down cause kids are running everywhere), they hired a bunch of nannies/babysitters specialising in young children (so the type of professionals who work in day care businesses) and set up a room for childcare.  

That way the parents can duck in and out to make sure their children are okay, the children are fine because their parents are literally in the next room or within eye sight plus they get to watch movies and play and eat food they enjoy, and the parents can attend a grown up event.

It was a good balance between an event that children would disrupt and having guests who would be in a tough spot because their children are too young to dependably leave alone all evening (or longer if it was a trip requiring overnight stays).

I'd also note, if your wedding requires people to fly in and is child free, you aren't just asking for your guests to find a babysitter, you're asking for your guests to let their small kids spend 2+ days with somebody (potentially somebody they don't know).  It's not surprising if guests with small kids bow out because that's a pretty big deal.  Talk to a parent and ask how old their kids were before they were allowed to go on camp or spend the night or weekend with other family members let alone a babysitter."
Ugh I feel the need to bathe.
"I think his response was perfectly appropriate to you being massively selfish and snide. He’s spent his weekends looking for YOUR apartment, at YOUR friend’s wedding and YOUR graduation. Led the poor bloke have a weekend off, and stop making snotty comments about how much he works (which sounds like a lot)  "
I grew up in a dysfunctional family and I thought possessiveness/jealousy was a gesture of love. This behavior is straight up maniacal. I know he’s young and is full of emotions and hormones but it’s not an excuse. This is straight up wrong. Huge red flag. 
"&gt; she then admits that shes been seeing someone else, and that she loves him more, has sex with him, wants to be with him. **The only reason she never did those things with me, is because she feels like that's where the line of cheating is.** Not the other stuff we did, kissing, talking about moving in with each other, not sleeping with each other, or talking about how we love each other, none of that was cheating in her eyes, but sex was...

If I got this part right, then dude, you need to wake up. Sounds like you were not in a relationship with her, the other guy was. She comes to you saying she draws the line at cheating **him** by having sex with you.

You were always the second guy in her relationship."

"You have lost a lot of your leverage by being okay with the first thing offered. You should have looked up your salary requirements before the interview.

"I'm not sure how honest OP is being but if she is going to try to pull off a lie in person she needs to work on her story. She left that little bit in about 'retaking classes' for her 4 year degree. People don't retake classes due to finances. They retake classes they failed, unless OP's school is very different. I would be livid if I was her mother. It sounds like OP failed out then tried to cover by getting into community college before her mom found out."
"&gt;H. is really mad at me for the circumstances surrounding my allowing N. to join us on the trip so we keep fighting in private.

"This has to be fake, right?  Please tell me you're actually a screenwriter using this subreddit as a focus group for your idea for a zany family comedy."
"I don't entirely agree with all the other posters here. You wanted to do a completely normal thing that normal people do: have a couple beers in your friend's back yard. You would like your wife to be able to just ignore or laugh off her parents' nonsense. She is not there yet though.

Maybe not poking the bear is the right move in the short term. But you're not out of line or selfish for thinking that the way to deal with controlling weirdos is to ignore them. You're not crazy for thinking that appeasing them only exacerbates the problem."
"Some of the stuff is a lot more strenuous than I might have made it sound like, and also we often drink on camping trips.

I do state it upfront, but he tends to argue about whether the event is appropriate for kids"
I think it's pretty clear that no one quite  considers you a mom yet since the kid is still cooking. 
That was my thought! I’d be afraid to get a card because it would be an awful reminder if something unspeakably sad happened.
OP in no way suggests that his wife has changed her attitude in their bedroom so if she’s exploring her wilder side then her Instagram followers are the only ones reaping the benefits 
"No, you got it because you applied for and fought for the scholarship. You earned it. You’re not living “rent free.” You’re paying your rent through means which you sought and secured. Stop feeling guilty about this. And yeah, your finances are none of her business."
"People often leave information out on the subreddit in order to ""lead the narrative"" towards whatever conclusion they are drawing.  Your original post includes a lot of vague-ries and summarizations of CLEARLY more complex issues.  

While you may think ""this is enough for people to get it!"" others will think ""Why isn't he explaining that?  What detail is he hiding?"".  When you provided ALL of the context above, it brought to light an important fact you had glossed over.  This friend KNEW she was married, did NOT know she was in an Open relationship, and tried to get with her anyways.  That is all you would have needed to say for the ""OP is an asshole"" stuff to stop."
"For most relationships this would be considered completely inappropriate. This sort of situation should absolutely be mentioned in the beginning of a relationship. Otherwise at the very least it’s lying my omission. If I was doing this I know my boyfriend would consider this cheating and I can’t say I’d blame him. To each their own I guess though. 
Ultimately OP gets to decide how he feels about it, and if he’s genuinely mad then I don’t think he’s in the wrong for that. I don’t think not being judgements applies to this situation. "
I can predict his response now: he will claim you disrespected him by talking badly about him behind his back; we're only siding with you because we only have your side of the story.
"I'm your daughter's age and I just want you to know that I would be proud to have a woman like you as my mom. You made the best life you could for the two of you. If she can't see that, she has some problems."

"Thank you! 

I plan on discussing it more deeply on here in the future, most likely in r/raisedbynarcissists or a similar sub, but basically I don't consider my adoptive mother to be my ""real"" mother because of my upbringing.

I told my ""real"" mother (the woman who I emotionally consider my mother, who has been there for me my entire adulthood, who my child(ren) will call ""grandma"") about my pregnancy a few weeks ago and she is very excited. 

Unfortunately, my birth mother didn't make the selfless choice to put me and my siblings up for adoption; I was nearly 10 years old when we were put into foster care and she had no choice in the matter. Due to my age when it happened I saw a lot of bad things as a child, and have some bad memories/emotions tied to them that I am still dealing with. 

I didn't ""chase her down"" as you put it; she found me on social media in my early 20s and reached out to me, and I decided/realized that forgiveness was the next step for us both to have closure. She made mistakes, but wasn't inherently a bad person, so the punishment for those mistakes (losing us to foster care, not being allowed to raise us) fit the crime in my opinion. 

As far as reconnecting with bio parents, I feel like that is a personal choice for every adopted individual to make only for themselves, even if they *do* have wonderful adoptive parents. "
It does make sense. It definitely sounds like she gets a sense of fulfillment from having kids around and doing favors for others. I hope she is able to set some boundaries without getting upset. Good luck!
Call the police and report your stolen medication. 
"And I think you are 100% correct about everything you've posted about this guy. I'm sure she's okay and loves her son and everything, but it's harder to divorce a mama's boy than to break up with him and it's even harder yet to change a mama's boy. "
"Yes, I agree.  I am very lucky that I came from a household where finances were tracked, monitored, and discussed.  My own dad taught me well and I've been comfortable for most of my adult life.  I manage all of our finances now, to the point where I even open his bills \(since he has a tendency to just ignore them, likely stemming from childhood\).  Perhaps getting an outside perspective will resonate more with him and feel less like I'm ""mothering' him.  "

"Like Zap said, you’ve got the “correct” take on the situation, but you went about it all wrong. Yeah he does sound like a mama’s boy. He does sound like he lets her baby him and he does what his mother wants. But the grief is very fresh, the anger very fresh as well. Now it’s easier to direct that anger at you being “critical” of his family dynamic than at his mother. 

I would apologize for bringing it up that way. Let him know you are willing to listen to him vent about this situation, but you’re also there to help him improve it if he would like. Unless this reaction is making you wonder if you want to continue the relationship? What would your ideal outcome be for this situation?"
"Others have asked this, but you haven’t answered: exactly how far in advance would he have to plan in order for you not to feel hurt (Or in order for you to feel like he put in enough effort)? Because while he might have called the restaurant and made a reservation the night before your birthday, that doesn’t mean he wasn’t researching, etc. beforehand, you know? 

If money honestly doesn’t matter, then be clear about that. “Effort to me means the thought behind the gift, not its cost.” The best gifts I’ve gotten from my fiancé have been love letters because I know he had to put effort into writing them. 

Be clear about what you want your boyfriend to do. Saying something vague like “my birthday is important to me” isn’t enough. To some (like me), that means they want their birthday acknowledged but don’t need a huge celebration or anything fancy. For others, it means a week of celebrating. 

“Boyfriend, my birthday is really important to me, and the following is a list of things that make me feel super loved up on my birthday.” Give him examples, and then be open to how he follows through. It might not look exactly like you imagined, but according to you, it’s the effort (thought) that really matters, so that shouldn’t be a problem. 

TL;DR - be clear and direct about what you expect your boyfriend to do. Don’t expect him to read your mind or assume that what you want is obvious. "
"If you read the post you can see the concerns are legitimate ,and not out of malice or ill intent."
"Dude's gross. Who meets someone at a party and then frantically Google's them for spank bank material? 

&gt;At various points in the relationship he's talked about how ""if he wasn't dating me he'd want to date an 18 year old."" because ""he wants the novelty of having sex with a teenager"". He reactivated his tinder account ""looking for threesomes"" without telling me, and was messaging exclusively teenage girls. He tried to get me to hookup with his ex girlfriend so we could have a threesome, part of that was my fault because I said I might want to have a threesome one day. He met up with his ex for lunch without telling me (he doesn't need permission to get lunch with someone, but he actively hid it from me.). He used to tell me I was big boned all the time before I asked him to stop. (I'm 5'11 and weigh 135 pounds).

Holy. Fuck. This guy is *disgusting*. "
"So she can spend nine months creating a child for you and you can't be bothered to spend an evening putting on decent clothes and going to a decent restaurant or a party?

His mom is a jerk. So is his sister tbh. This destination wedding is a little more complicated and harder to find replacement childcare for than help with a ballet recital. Regardless of any communications misunderstandings when this conflict came to light his mom should have cancelled on the sister and the sister should have insisted his mom help out her brother and found someone else to assist with the recital. 
I guess I didn't really see it this way but you're right.
"I'm getting the ""maybe if I tell her I want kids but keep putting her off she'll give up"" vibe."
"It’s more about boundaries and a pattern of behavior OP.  In those stories the issue is that the MIL totally lacks them and is used to crapping all over the DIL.  One of the scarier stories on there is about a MIL who refused to believe that her grandchild was allergic to bananas and tree nuts.  She eventually just fed the kid a cookie with banana and nuts in it to “show the DIL that allergies aren’t real” and nearly killed her grand daughter.  
That lack of respect and boundary stomping will build over time.  The situation didn’t start with grandma making a cookie, it started with treating her DIL like shit and worked up from there.  
Look you may not see yourself marrying your GF (I mean you don’t care enough about her to stand up for her) but someday you might find someone that you would like to marry or even have kids with.  And when your mom is shitty to them, you going to be ok with that too?  "

You seem too self focused to be in a long term relationship.  Your admitted resentment illustrates why you should be single and playing the field.  You need to tell her you lifestyle is more important to you than she is.
"yeah it was so disturbing to see that all the top comments were basically doing to OP exactly what her mom does. people are way way too invested in makeup. I don't wear it, even on 'special occasions'. it is possible and perfectly normal and healthy."
"You are not overreacting.  They clearly still have feelings for each other.  They didn't break up because of a fight, or infidelity, or being incompatible.  They broke up because of distance.  Now that distance is gone and they are hanging out again.  It doesn't seem like he is willing to set boundaries with her, nor is he making you a priority over her.  My guess is that he isn't completely over her yet.  "

"&gt; She took a bunch of tests YESTERDAY and has already posted to Facebook? I know people are different, but jesus, I didn’t announce my pregnancy until I was almost five months along.

How dopey is she, making a pregnancy announcement that early, when the miscarriage risk is really high?"
"Girl, you are never going to have a lasting relationship like this. I can't begin to count the ways you are shooting yourself in the foot."
"Do you love him, though? Your title suggests it, but I think your writing provides some doubt. 

Honestly, after reading everything you had to say, the first thing that comes to mind is that it sounds like you two aren’t a great match. I know it might be hard to hear, but based on your post, it sounds like deep down, you believe that as well."
"I don't think you overreacted but you did have an inappropriate reaction. Breaking things and such. Then again I think I would have probably been genuinely freaked out and may have reacted inappropriately as well, just from being freaked out and anxious. 

It's up to you if you want to break up with her, obviously, but definitely make sure you are able to be somewhat calm when you talk to her either way. I think, for me, a lot of it would depend on what her reaction was when you bring it up to her. Is she apologetic? Does she understand you don't want her to EVER do something like that again? ETC. If she can show genuine remorse and show the change, I might give her another chance, but it really comes down to whether you can feel you can trust her. "
He needs to apply for jobs in a city he plans on living in and if you're only going to be there 1 more year and don't plan on living in that city then... there is no reason for him to apply there.  It would be silly to land an awesome job there and have to quit 1 year into it
"Some tough love here..
Dump her..move on, many woman in the world so don't worry about her"
"Oh you are TOTALLY reasonable. The two positions I laid out in the comment above, where an unreasonable guy could call you crazy, were both reasonable positions.

He just doesn't want to admit that his decisions have emotional consequences for you."
"This.  I work in a field where everyone knows everyone at similar places around a large metro area.  Luckily, I've managed to keep good relationships with people, but know a girl I worked with at one place had a horrible reputation for being difficult to work with and for constantly making mistakes, and three years later, me and my former coworkers still get calls from people when she applies at positions at  various places, asking what she's like, and my old manager never hesitates to tell people exactly what he thought of being her manager."
"I think your wife was justified, and even if she went too far, your sister had no business making remarks about your guys life. She wants to constantly poke fun at your guys lifestyle, money ?, Well then your sister can work harder on the life she has instead of poking at your guys hard work ."
I love how you just brush aside how he has a full time job and then on top of that is also taking care of the children and the household when he comes home.

"&gt;We forced him to come out of his room for 1/2 hr per night after a while.

Could you talk more about the way you talk to your son?"
"There probably isn't anything you can do. He has no way of knowing for sure whether your preferences really shifted so dramatically or you are just not turned on by him or interested in pleasing him. And even if he does believe it, it still sort of sucks to know that someone else got the more exciting and adventurous version of you.

Many people who post here are going to tell you that your boyfriend is an awful person for feeling this way, but most of those people are massive hypocrites who would tell you to dump your boyfriend immediately if you posted here about your boyfriend not going down on you."
"No, OP thinks shaving his beard is a gift. "
"So, here's a pretty telling sign: you've already humanized the pregnancy. It's ""the baby "" not ""the pregnancy"" in your post.


You need to have another frank discussion with your partner. If you do terminate, its not an infinite window, so you dont get the luxury of waiting for a better time. Be honest with your feelings; dont say things just to make him feel better. He needs to have a real sense of if you can handle a pregnancy or an abortion. Resentment can be a real thing, but so is being able to provide for a child. This means taking an honest look at your emotions.

On the flipside, you need to know where you will stand with him. If you go ahead with the pregnancy, you need to know if its on your own.  That's a huge part of this decision.

You guys have talked, but I dont think the conversation's over. If you want to continue the relationship, this is one issue where you have to be on the same page. It will likely not survive a decision where one side pressures the other."
How many times have you taken it up the ass?
"&gt; You've been dating a 40 year old man that disrespects you, belittles you, ~~drives drunk risking lives~~, acts like a child, cannot be trusted and you already resent. In 3 months. But tell me again how perfect you are for each other and how in love you are.

"
"So personally I'm with everyone else on the 'no, just no' camp, but if you're looking for a different line of argument that might get your wife to think about things:

It sounds like this brother needs to go stay back with the part of his family that has all the guns, a willingness to use them, and therefore can protect his ass. If that part of the family isn't taking him in there is likely a **very good reason**. Why the hell is he trying to involve his dentist sister an hour and a half away, especially if these people *already know where you live* and have proven that by breaking in once? 

You're not a safe place for this guy to stay and he's involving you in shit that is way over your ability to handle."
"&gt; Our relationship has suffered a bit recently from lack of time - he works a lot, I've been very busy and sleep deprived, and sex hasn't really been on weekly basis anymore, yet I'm not super worried about this, because I know we will get back on track with that.

This is where commitment comes in. You're clearly sliding out of love with all what that entails, and it takes time and effort to get to a better place. At this rate, you'll feel ready to break up in two years. Take the time to figure out how to come back to spending both more high-quality and medium-quality time with him. High quality could be a date night, medium-quality is small talk about what's on your mind and what you're engaged in that day. "
"I'll put my two cents in with regards to his flirting. When it happens ""in the wild"" \(unsolicited, in person, in public\) I have no problem with it. My BF is a sexy, tall drink of water and I well remember working up the nerve to talk to him myself\- good on those poor girls that don't get to take him home. Usually my SO doesn't even realize a girl is making eyes and trying to chat him up. I thank strangers that pay me compliments at bars and stuff. That's normal, but it goes no further. That absolutely is a nice ego boost.

But giving someone who lives far away \(how did he meet her?\) access to his phone number on a personal device is an entirely different ballgame. As well as encouraging it. That's crossing into emotional cheating territory. He's stopped putting in effort with you and instead is spending time at least saying nice things to other women. He's a magician, doing a magic trick to convince you that you're the problem and it's bullcrap."
OP this was in your own damn house. Talk to a lawyer for sure but I don't see it any differently than having cameras in your home as people often do.

Jumping on the beard train! :p
This isn't petty. This should be be a dealbreaker. 
"a good lesson I thankfully learned when I was younger is that you're under no obligation to go out of your way just because someone is family. Some people are just total pieces of human debris, and you can't change that. "
"You two are horribly mismatched. I could not imagine being pressured for sex all day every day.  She is simply going to need to find someone with a matching libido. Her libido is unusually  high, yours is not. There is nothing wrong with either of these things until one partner starts to pressure the other over their own bodily autonomy. You need out of this relationship. "
"See?  Even this sentence is fun!

I'm gonna go to London and try to learn your ways by going from airport to pub to pub to pub to pub to pub to airport :)"
"Because if you're going into a new relationship with someone you barely know and writing off anything you don't like as ""them just not knowing better"" your dynamic is already fucked. You're either taking on the role of teacher/mother and trying to change them, or ignoring glaring red flags as them ""not really being like that.""

People are generally on their best behavior at the beginning. If you're already seeing awful stuff a couple of *days* in, why on *earth* would you already be looking to make excuses for them?! Because she enjoyed her time in person? Guess what, *that* was his ""best behavior."" The history of posts is the real him."
"Yeah no, the dad is an active addict. Please fuck off with your hippie shit"
"i'm not trying to be mean but...she might find you to be a bit of a downer. i think you should either make the shift to be more lighthearted, fun and casual when you message her, or just accept that you two are growing apart"
"I put it onto the ""and stuff"" category. Mental illnesses make relationships more difficult the same way flaws do, but there are limits to what you can reasonably expect a partner to deal with.  We get people posting in this subreddit all the time about SOs with depression who do *literally nothing* to maintain the household, and that is not something a partner should have to deal with if such a person refuses to try to change."
"The bit that gets me is that you were making calls to your sister and friend for financial help rather than being able to rely on your boyfriend in the first instance - it comes across as that it  wasn’t because he didn’t have enough money available to help but more so because you instantly had to start thinking through all the possible options you had which didn’t include him.

I might be reaching here but it kinda sounds like you’re in a situation where you’re not able to put responsibility on him because he doesn’t assume responsibility for the things he should do. And not just the whole situation with the dog but maybe in a more general sense? 

Seems like he’s not the person you can rely on to help you out when you really need it. Maybe because you might offend him or annoy him or something along those lines.
How did he react when you asked him how much money he had on hand? 

Again I’m reaching and could be way off but that was how it reads to me.

"
"""at the expense of my own feelings sometimes. It's a problem, I know.""

Sounds pretty inauthentic to me. "
"Since this is the only method of birth control she agrees to use (and it’s a rubbish one) you have every right to rely on *her* to take responsibility for it. If she were on the pill, you wouldn’t be expected to remind her to take it each day. If you wore condones, it would be your responsibility to put them on. I hope you realise that your only options if you don’t want 5 more kids after this one is a) don’t sleep with her anymore b) get a vasectomy or c) insist you will wear condoms or see (a) above! "
"Seconding this, it's the lifestyle that makes addicts look so rough, not the drug itself"
"It was a white tie affair. She wore a designer gown. Even OP said it was tasteful and appropriate for the occasion. To say that her sister is some sort of brat who never thinks of anyone but herself because she dressed appropriately for the occasion is completely ridiculous.

OP is jealous of how her sister looked. Period."
Husband is the issue.
I'm not offended. I'm just not wasting my time on someone who admits to trolling. 
"I 100% know how you feel. My fiancé’s mom is religious/conservative and even though she knows he isn’t and never has been, I get this nagging feeling she blames me for his tattoos, our life of sin, and him not spending more time with her. It’s something that has been eating at me for a couple years but I’m now realizing that her misconceptions about her son and our relationship are her problem, not mine. If she even has them because I’m obvi just imagining it all and ruminating to torture myself!"
"&gt; you have nothing 


Nothing except for money, which he thinks should be enough to earn him exactly the kind of wife he imagines in his head *barf*"
"You’re getting a lot of advice to stop doing this. As someone who frequently risks health and emotional sanity for others, I won’t tell you that. If you’re anything like me, your life wouldn’t be satisfying if you knew there was something you could do and didn’t.

But. Establish your boundaries. For us, those boundaries are: (1) nothing that risks our careers, (2) nothing that makes it so we can’t go to the gym, (3) no violence toward self, others, or animals in our home.

We’ve taken in foster kids and refugees and a slew of misfit animals. But once a situation risks one of the above, we are out. Set your boundaries with this friend and stick to them. That doesn’t mean you have to stop helping, especially if it’s fulfilling. Just be honest with yourself about whether it is."
"Girl this is all on you. You’re allowing yourself to be used by him and doing favors for him on your own. My recommendation - if you can’t establish firm friends only boundaries, then it’s better to cut contact with him completely. If you want to remain friends, then you need to do a better job saying no. "
"What exactly is the rush for you two to be engaged and presumably married soon at your age of only 19?  What exactly do you need to be married for right now?  I doubt you are going to be buying a house soon, and please don't have any children as well."
"Please OP print this comment and read it to yourself every morning for the next year, it will change your life for the better."
This OP! You’re teaching your daughter that is okay to marry an abusive person. She will likely act like you if she ends up marrying an abusive husband!
"If Really Evil Me were one of the other bridesmaids, she'd arrange to have OP brought into the ceremony/reception in a sedan chair carried by four shirtless Noel Fielding lookalikes."
"Mate, oral sex and having hair follicles forcibly ripped from your arsehole aren’t really comparable are they?"
"How do you spend the time when the kids are at home?

Are there kid-routines that are your job? Do you do dinner/playtime/bath time/putting to bed?"
"&gt; Sometimes irrational people force you to lie to them

No, they don't. You are responsible for your own choices, always. Lying is not okay just because you decided that you didn't want them to get mad at you. "
"I mean, anything to do with pregnancy and childbirth IS a man vs. woman thing. The woman is the one who bears them and if the relationship goes to shit, is the custodial parent in the vast majority of cases. Once a woman has a baby... that's it for her. That's the focus. Men go on to flit around more often than not in case of divorce."
"She lived with her brother and I heard her talk about her brother the same way.  Her parents bought them a house to live in that they shared, and her brother didn't want me to move in so we found our own place.  I thought maybe her brother was just lazy, but seems like she might be the problem."
"&gt;call the cops and file a harassment report

Is this something that you've done or know someone personally who has done it? Seriously asking, not just to you but to the people who say this. 

When I went to the police when my ex was harassing me and acting like a lunatic and would not leave me alone(emails, texts, phone calls, voicemail, letters at my door), when I was genuinely afraid, they said my only option was to file for a temporary restraining order. So it would only last 30 days and then he could do whatever he wanted again. And I couldn't just keep requesting the temporary restraining order to try and extend the time either. They said unless he threatens my life or physically harmed me, there's nothing they could do and said I didn't have enough for an actual restraining order.

There was nothing for them to write down and ""file"" to have this stuff ""on record"" either, which is another thing people say. Maybe this is a state thing? I live in California.
"
"And that is not 100% true, you could have sex with a female who is positive for Chlamydia and still not contract it. "
"&gt; Please go to the police and report her threats.

Seconding this. OP's GF has literally threatened, in all seriousness, to kill him. If that doesn't merit a police report I don't think any threat ever would."
"I mean she hasn't brought up the idea of me calling the kid's parents, and I don't think she would object, but I would worry that she'd expect me to apologize or be sympathetic to David or something given her reaction. That's not going to stop me from doing it though. "
"Hell, it'll exacerbate it."
"Do it for your wife, your child, and for the memory of your first wife. They all deserve you at your best.  "
"I’m also a musician - not in the same vein, but a musician nonetheless. I’m currently getting a degree where my major instrument is classical voice, and I can honestly say this kind of behavior is exactly why I have never dated another musician. It gets grating after awhile, even when you are part of that world, so don’t feel badly about not being into it! "
"Would you rather be the ex-wife that divorced him and took his kids? It doesn't matter what you do, as long as you aren't making yourself happy, this isn't going to work. You can't set yourself on fire to keep him warm. If he really is the kind of person who would paint you with that brush for standing up for yourself and telling him what you need, is he really someone you want to be with?

You need to start recognizing that living the way you are is bad for him, it's bad for your kids, but most of all it's miserable for you. Start saying no and standing up for yourself.

You should sit him down and have a serious talk with him. Don't let him bulldoze you. Tell him that you are seriously reconsidering your marriage. You need to let him know how serious this is."
Really love your response to that stupid comment. &lt;3
But this boy wished for whatever happened on your daughter before to happen again and told her it was her fault... and your wife doesn't think that's really that bad?
"This is actually such a nice response to see in this thread.

I'm the youngest in my family, we're all very confident and outgoing, but my oldest sister will always dominate the conversation - now as a 30-year-old, it's still a fight/struggle to get a word in at family dinners.

Please, please, PLEASE, make a point of asking your son how his day was, what he got up to etc, we've all been in situations where someone has interrupted our conversation or talked over us, and it's frustrating - he has 4 siblings to compete with!! 

It doesn't have to be a case of you cutting off your other kids, but it could be a quiet moment before bed or whatever.

And for the love of god, find out what his hobbies are or could be and get him hanging out with kids who have the same/similar hobbies - THAT'S how he's gonna make friends and learn how to not depend on his sister."
"OP, please do not do this immature, passive-aggressive ""eye-for-an-eye"" bullshit. If this bothers you, talk to your girlfriend."
"Can you guys go to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch said sporting event?  That way it will be so loud that you wouldn't really have to talk to her.  And you will have drinks and wings to keep you in a good mood. :\)

I totally get it and have a low tolerance for niceties as well!"
I wouldn't even give him that long. 
"Does he know her other roommates? I crash in my friends rooms when I go to visit them, all of my friends, including the male ones. When I lived with roommates and had friends visit who were staying over, they slept in my room. Why would I have made my friends sleep on a couch in a house with people they aren't close with? In mutual spaces where they aren't going to get the best sleep they possibly could?

If they had shared a bed I think I'd be a lot more understanding of your feelings but, and I would like to say it's totally fine that you have boundaries and if this is a boundary for you you need to talk to her about it, but I personally think it's silly to be worrying about this. She was super communicative, kept you looped in, and (I assume) just wanted to make sure her friend was comfortable and had a little of his own space while visiting. As a slight introvert myself, staying in the living room of someone else's house can get really exhausting as you really never get a moment to yourself, especially if any of the roommates have pets that come in and out of that area. 

If this is an issue for you, just let her know and move forward. I think it sounds like you have nothing to be worried about when it comes to what's already happened. "
"A pound a week is only an excess of 500 calories a day.  That could be either not exercising 45 minutes a day or drinking three beers a day.  Both those lifestyle changes are significant but probably wouldn't register as a big change to others.

Absolutely mindless eating is a possibility.
"
The Dude won't abide
"She's been going to appointments, and I've also wondered if someone would step in, but it doesn't appear that this has happened.  I'm not sure who I would get in touch with to report this situation (although someone did mention adult protective services in addition to CPS, both of which I plan to look into).

"&gt;in February she told me that she will soon have a guy friend over

Should she have given him a text week notice? **Asked permission**? 

Please. He's her boyfriend, not her fucking father, and if he wants to act like her fucking father, he can step off cause that's not how real relationships work.

It's not healthy, it's not fair, and it's not okay for him to try to control her at all.

Having friends over isn't controlling. 

Edit: unnecessary words"
"You can’t really say that they definitively won’t kick her out. Unfortunately when you live with your parents, you have to follow their rules if you want to continue to live there. "
You said it was 15-30 minutes after work. Minimum 1:15-2:30 hours plus the dinners. How often are those? Plus informal after work meetings? Track your time. See how much free labor you are giving. 
Their cousin pizzicato is much better with rhythm.
Run far far away dude. This is coming from a chick. She is bad news! 
"Hey, are you doing okay?"
"You don't understand that statement. That's fine. Wearing glasses isn't not an inconvenience to you. Your experience is not everyone's experience. 

I know people who have made huge financial sacrifices to get lasik. Much larger than what you're talking about, and they are very happy with it. 

No one is calling it a disability or a life saving procedure. Think of it as like a breast reduction to help with back pain, or a vein treatment to help with varicose veins, or braces. 

If she wanted braces to straighten her teeth, would you let her get them? No one NEEDS straight teeth to live. It's technically cosmetic. But still, many people get them, even at great financial sacrifice. "
"Tell him to watch the documentary ‘Hitler’s Children’. It really helped me to work out my feelings about being my father’s daughter. My father isn’t nearly as bad as any of the Nazi’s featured in the documentary, or your husband’s family. But I feel like the concept of ‘I have their blood, so what does that say about me?’ Is the same.

The documentary is about the ways in which descendants of Nazis such as Himmler, Göring, and Höss have dealt with knowing what their relatives did. Parts of it are very inspiring. I remember there’s one woman, a grandchild of one of he aforementioned (can’t remember which), and she goes around giving speeches about her family history, doing anti-Nazi activism and things like that. But she hadn’t even changed her surname from her relative’s surname. When asked, she said that it was important to her to change her family’s legacy into something positive. She has fully come to terms with the horror that her family took part in, and is now determined to prove that it says nothing about the person she is able to be, and the life she is able to live. She wears the surname proudly, as a reminder of the fact that her ancestry doesn’t have a hold over who she is as a person. Her surname is her surname, not her relative’s. Her blood and DNA is her blood and DNA, not her relative’s. "
So it would have been better if she gets pregnant and ruins her life? (which happens to kids with stupid parents like hers who use religion as an excuse to not prepare their kids for the world) 
"No way - you didn't take it too far. You handled things like a rational adult! He's the one hiding behind his ""engineering"" bs to try to come off as the rational one, when his behavior is obviously abusive. 

I'd cut him loose. He's not demonstrating ANY desire to change, improve, take responsibility for his abusive behavior. It's only going to get worse from here.

Start telling your friends and family what he's doing - don't protect him, protect yourself. "
Not for you! For us it was! For some people it is! Men and women can have intimate friendships that remain extremely platonic and we are far from the only people I know who have that kind of relationship. 
"Hello.  I'm sorry you're having to face this.  My mom had dementia and my dad was her sole carer throughout.  He never told me the depth of my mom's illness and never asked for help from anyone and that's what I'd like to caution against.

My mom went from forgetful, to violent, to paranoid, to unintentionally self-harming (she'd forget to take her medicine some days and others, she'd forget that she'd taken it and take double or triple the dose).  My dad was watching her 24/7 except for 4 hours when his housekeeper came to clean and sit with mom when he'd run errands and buy food.  He looked like a skeleton when mom finally passed.

So my advice is to look for support groups, charities, family members, etc. to help you, give you time to rest, eat and live.  Don't do what my father did and shut out your children in some effort to spare them (it sounds like you're all involved and this is good).

Also, develop a plan for eventualities **now.**  My dad was so exhausted from caring that he didn't think to lock up her meds.  So we bought a safe and solved that problem.  Install locks, control all keys, and consider a monitor in case she leaves the house and gets lost.

Finally, to answer your question about how to cope emotionally, look for the moments you'll have when she is still there.  My mom was herself a few times a day for brief moments right until the end.  Take joy in those and never take what she might say or do as if it was being said by your wife.  The last will be hard to do but it helped me compartmentalize who my mom had been with the other person she had become."
"Girl your mom/parents are abusive/controlling. Apply to school elsewhere, move there. Or use your loans for off campus housing. I wouldn't be surprised if they just ""force you"" to work less. They're trying to keep you dependent and under their control. Get out."
"&gt;  I mostly think about my grandparents when going to random churches and lighting candles.

I did this for my grandparents before they passed (both within hte last 4 months, sadly, but they were 92!) and will continue doing it. I travel a fair amount and each time I travel I'll visit a local church and will light a candle for them (I haven't done it since they passed as I haven't been away since Sept. of last year, but am traveling to Portugal in August and to Morocco in October, so will have two more countries on my list where candles were lit for them!). I would take a photo of me lighting the candle, then my mom would send it along to my grandparents to show them (they lived in another province). Now it's just a tradition that I will continue. I'm not religious by any means but my grandmother was. I don't even care what kind of church it is - it's just a nice way to connect with them. My grandmother always loved that I traveled the world and loved seeing the photos of different, old churches. Of course now we won't be able to tell her/show her, but I know she knows :) "
"To the first point, 100% agree.  To the second, I think that is going a bit far.  I can see a scenario where the mom thought OP didn't really care one way or the other

&gt;I had no interest or desire in walking up a fucking mountain with her, and I told her repeatedly I didn't want her to do anything."
Yes i did. As i said earlier in the comments i had just miscarried and was unable to walk for long distances. 
"Ugh, this is so manipulative. Don't mortgage your future for this dude's mom just because you're currently in a relationship with him. Your boyfriend is **not entitled** to *your* resources. He should be appreciative that you're financially supporting him, but instead he's looking for even more and trying to guilt you into draining yourself dry to also support his relatives. Huge red flag, OP. 

And, for context, this is coming from someone who put an SO through school and supported him financially for many years, and was happy to do it. My SO was very appreciative of what I did for him and never demanded more. Putting myself in your shoes, if my SO had done this to me while I was supporting him, I would have been horrified. It would have left me feel totally disrespected and deflated, like he had no gratitude for what I was doing for him and just saw me as a sugar mama. 

Also, comparing you to a *fucking Trump supporter* because you have healthy boundaries? This guy is not a good partner."
"Listen to your instincts. Pay attention to that weird, icky feeling. 

For whatever reason, we are taught our whole lives to ignore these feelings. It isn't *nice*, we might *hurt someone's feeeeeeelings*, look how much this other person ""cares"" about us - why are we being so MEAN?? 

Nah. That's bullshit. You're feeling the way you are because he is completely ignoring your needs. He doesn't care what you want, he only cares about what HE wants. He isn't listening to you. 

I feel like you're probably trying to be ""nice"" about telling him no. Yet another thing we are taught to do that causes more harm than good - You HAVE to use the word NO. Be firm and direct about your needs and your life. When he flips out, because he **will**, you'll know how big a bullet you're dodging. 

That's the difference between ""nice"" and ""kind"". One tells someone what they *want to hear*, and the other tells the **truth**. "
"But he would have done if she had let him.

Are you sure you want to give this guy another chance?"
I lost mine at 22 as a man. This dude is spot on. Aside from religious people (which I'm not) it's something very stigmatized. It was something my first partner found out AFTER it happened.
"Whether or not you favor your son that's how she feels, that is the truth she feels."
"So if I understand this correctly, he dumped you because he really wanted to be with his wife, but then when that didn't work out he came crawling back and now has the audacity to be mad at you for sleeping with someone else after he dumped you to get back with his wife?

Just think about that for a second. 

First, the hypocrisy is unreal. He literally left you to pursue another woman but is mad that you might pursue another man?

Second, it seems abundantly clear that you are his back up plan. How do you feel being the second place prize? He really wanted his wife, but that didn't work so here he is.

Third, do you really want to be with a man who is mad at you because after *he dumped you* you didn't just sit around and wait for him to come back? And he is **making you feel guilty about that?**

This whole situation is so toxic. Why on earth you think you can (or should) work this out is beyond me. He's a total loser


**Edit:**

&gt;Yes, we did have an affair, on and off mostly,

Ahhh, it all makes sense now. Maybe my advice doesn't apply. You two sound like you deserve each other"
"You’re not obligated to stay , I think she had some issues in the past of sleeping with men too soon , getting attached and it not working out or being used for sex. I did the same thing, slowed down and waited when I met someone I really liked and if he wanted to not wait , fine he could leave. So no you are not wrong. But I wouldn’t compare you to her other relationships. We all grow and learn as we age and experience relationships , she wanted to wait due to a previous experience and you should respect that rather then say “well you didn’t wait this long with so and so!” Like a little kid but if you want to leave totally fine, but don’t hang it over her head to try and get back with her and guilt her into sleeping with you , good luck! "
"""Doesn't know how to eat stuff correctly"" is a super petty complaint, and it makes you sound like kind of a jerk, tbh.

It's common for people with high verbal IQ to not be as good at math.

"Google the cycle of abuse. People like him start off being charming, and when they believe that their partner won’t easily up and leave them, they start showing their true, cruel side. When they go too far and push their partners to breaking point, abusers go back to acting sweet and kind to reel their partner back in. You thought he ‘changed’ from a nice man to a cruel one, so it’s understandable that you would think he could change back.

He never changed. He was always this cruel, abusive cheater. He just hid that from you until the honeymoon period was over.

Breaking up with him the way you did was not cowardly, it was smart. You knew he would just manipulate you back into being with him, and you took steps to prevent that. Good. Stay strong."
"He isn't ""forgetting"".   He is choosing not to remember.   If he can manage to make less-cooked food for a few days, then stops, that's a deliberate choice, not an accident.  

People make dietary changes for relationships all the time.  That's part of respecting each other's feelings and preferences.  ""I'll cook X food every now and again, because I know it's your favorite.""  ""We can still eat Thai, I'll just stop putting in hot peppers.""

If your boyfriend were trying to make you enjoy his food, he'd be compromising.  ""Okay, you don't like charred meat, why don't I try braising it.""   ""You hate boiled vegetables and I hate stir-fry, let's try a sauté.""   Instead he's making food he knows you dislike and framing it as a romantic gesture.  It's like giving your girlfriend crotchless panties as a Valentine's gift.

It is okay for anything to be a dealbreaker, if it's making you substantially unhappy.  Let us suppose that your boyfriend keeps making charred meat and boiled vegetables for the next twenty years, while you eat stirfry and stews only if you're in a restaurant.   How much is that going to take away from your enjoyment of everyday life?  The answer may be ""very little"", which is fine.  But if it's ""a lot"", then you're entitled to decide not to settle."

"Something very very very wrong with his wife. Honestly if someone treated my child like this I would consider leaving, a normal healthy parent cannot honestly think that they're better at providing mental health services than a professional is, or that the child wouldn't ever need it because they're SO good at being a parent. Such a narcissistic mindset."
"IDK, OP, as in a previous comment, your wife’s reactions seem to be straight out of /r/raisedbynarcissists "
"&gt;Second of all, when I say that we were a bit harsh, I didn't mean that we did anything abusive. There were a lot of days where she skipped classes and her grades were really low. My wife and I thought she was just rebelling and punished her accordingly (taking her computer away for a day, grounding her, forcing her to go to tutoring, etc.)

I mean, your intentions don't change the effects of your actions. You literally punished your daughter for having symptoms of mental illness. You may not think that's abusive, but the effect on her may nonetheless have been catastrophic. 

It sounds like you're more wrapped up in how you perceive yourself as a parent than how you're actually doing as a parent.

Have you considered therapy for yourself so that you communicate with your daughter more constructively? She has a mental illness and there are going to be things you can do to improve your parenting and communication styles so that you can better work with her, and be less likely to inadvertently do shitty things that lead to her lashing out at you. 

For now, I'd talk to her therapist. Maybe one day you'll be in a place where talking to her is a possibility."

"A lot of us can't give advice if we aren't aware of it. What's stopping you two from becoming more than friends?  

I think you jumped the gun saying ""I'm going to take some time away."" She very well could have the same feelings for you. I think you should both sit down and talk about it in person.   

Tell her something like ""I don't want to beat around the bush with you. I like you. After all this time I have developed feelings and I just wanted you to know where I stand. I'm not expecting you to feel the same. If you don't feel the same way about me, I completely understand. But please understand that for me to get through these feelings I will need to take some time away. This isn't to punish you for not feeling the same as me or anything at all. You're great and have been nothing but amazing to me. This is for my own sanity. I want us to be close, but the feelings I have for you are getting in the way of that. I really hope you understand my side of this.""   


Obviously depending on how she feels about you, change it up. That's just a general way of putting things that can help her understand your side of things."
"There's nothing unhealthy about wanting sex from a partner after a fight.  Fights create a feeling of distance and sex creates a feeling of closeness, it can be very healing.

However, if you are pushing your partner into sex he doesn't want, that's unhealthy.  And if you can't cope with post\-fight stress and anxiety without sex, that's also unhealthy.  "
"&gt; Later that day, she asked the extent to which we should go in accommodating our guests compared to **doing what we want for ourselves**.

"Omg THIS guy. I wear dark distinctive lipsticks and this creepy colleague comes to me and says ""I always tell women they look better without lipsticks and other makeup stuff"" and my first instant response was ""That's such a bullshit.""

"as a once lost, insanely confused 8 year old, your whole post made me choke up.

you and your wife just keep doing exactly what you're doing. the very best feeling as a child is safety. safe to cry, safe to question, safe to doubt, to be aloof, to have outbursts and even to be angry. showing the bad stuff when you're a kid and just being accepted for it--it's home. it feels like coming home. knowing that you can show everything and just get it out of your head without guilt or fear of ""hurting"" your parent. knowing it's gonna be okay. knowing you're not judged and that you're loved, outbursts and all.

he'll warm up to his step mom. just gotta give him time and I admire her very much for letting him go it at his own pace. love is patient. trust takes time.

"&gt;we've talked about the proposal a few times, and he says he was just nervous and didn't know what to say. he's assured me over and over that he wants to marry me, but I can't get it out of my mind. what do I do?

and

&gt;I don't think he entirely knows how to ""do"" things like that, which is fine. that's what he's said in a nutshell. but it still bums me out because like

Don't really jive. You can't get over his mistake and obviously keep bringing it up even though you know it was just a dumb mistake and he's told you the same thing. Maybe he told you it was a ""soft"" engagement because he was worried you wouldn't say yes otherwise.

&gt;how hard is it to save up some money, do some research and pick out a nice ring?

This is just all kinds of not cool. A guy who is nervous about the proposal probably didn't feel comfortable picking out a ring. Why not choose a wedding ring for yourself that is a large band with a diamond that will serve as both and treat this ring as temporary? 

I think you need to just decide if this is the person you want to be with forever and then move forward without rehashing this over and over again.

Gender absolutely is not context. The context is she physically assaulted him. It's wrong and abusive. Is she an abusive person? Maybe not all the time but she was in that moment and it's wrong at the exact same level as a man being physically abusive with his wife. Period.

"&gt;My best friend Danielle came over to hang out with me tonight to watch a movie. She has a very loud personality that can sometimes annoy people but she never means any harm. Harry and Danielle have know each other for about 8 years. When Danielle gets to my apartment she got in a little petty argument with my roommate Harry. This usually happens every time she comes over. I usually ignore all of this banter though, because she sends me screenshots of Harry in her DMs implying that he wants to sleep with her.

Mmm, okay.  This might be off-base, but this sounds just like what people kind of said about a person in my friend group that was insanely toxic.  He was fine to the person that he knew the best, but would carefully insult about 3/4 of the friend group the entire time we hung out.  It's a bit of a gamer culture, so he'd drop a semi-joking ""You suck, you should just kill yourself"" and people would sort of dismiss it, but he was very clearly doing it to bother people.  Anyway, the situation finally came to a head when people gathered up information about the horrible things he was saying/doing and essentially evicted him from the group. 

What exactly was the argument?  I've known people who would be like ""Lol that Danielle, razzing Harry about how his small dick broke up his relationship"" and think it was no big deal.  

&gt;I try to go back to calm Harry down and he pulls up his phone to show me messages of him texting someone about him being suicidal. He tells me he can’t deal with this right now and I’m stunned. We have been really good friends for 12 years and nothing like this has ever come up, we have been living together for about 2 years and have had our fair share of arguments but nothing like this has ever come up. I walk away from the door and tell Danielle we are leaving. I text Harry to tell him that I love him 

He asked for support and time in his own home, and your immediate action was to disengage from him entirely and go back to your friend.   Showing you the information about self harm was personal - he wanted you to help him.  Instead, you left the conversation with your friend and gave him the equivalent of ""deal with it, we'll be back when you're over it"". 


&gt;I texted him I told him I care about him.

You should have been able to tell him this in person, because you should have stayed talking to him in person.  

 &gt;I start sobbing and shaking because I am so scared for Harry. Danielle reads the text messages because I can’t calm down and goes to knock on his door again. I try to stop her but she closes the door behind her. Danielle has had a tough life and had many struggles with anxiety, depression and suicide thoughts. We both thought we could talk to him and see if he wanted to get him some help.

Literally the worst possible thing you could have done.  He confides in you that he's having a really hard time, and that having Danielle there is going through the roof.  You decide to share personal information with Danielle, she inserts herself into a closed room with the person who very, very much doesn't want to see her or have her know his personal business.  The equivalent of someone retreating into a room from a fear of spiders, then you throwing a bag of 'em into the room and closing the door.  I think the best summary is ""WTF?""


Basically, your roommate is having a hard time, and wanted Danielle to butt out.  Instead, you let her get even farther into his business.  He lashed out physically (which is unacceptable).  My recommendation is to realize that a bunch of stuff was treated absolutely incorrectly in this case, and that you might need to take a step back and look at the long standing dynamic between the two of them.

"File a police report for what happened to your son so that it is documented and not swept the rug/inadmissible should you later go to Family Court determining custody.

Also document that your wife hit you. If you have her admitting to it in writing (text/email) then keep a copy. If it's not too late, take a picture of the redness of your face.

Consult a lawyer. Your wife is belligerent and crossed a line. She could easily fight dirty in court and prevent you from seeing your kids, so it's important that you document incidents of violence and neglect."
"I know everyone is saying postpone and think about it\-\- and I agree, think about it before you decide\-\- but honestly, imagining myself in this scenario, I would not be able to marry someone who did that. This wasn't a freak accident, this was him deliberately doing something you told him was dangerous to himself and others and killing your beloved pet in doing so. I'm childfree, but I know I would never feel comfortable having kids with someone who's done this despite warnings. If children are in your future, it's very understandable to seriously reconsider. Not because I necessarily think he'll recklessly drive again and hit them, but because you know he won't listen to you saying something he likes is too dangerous until after someone gets hurt and wouldn't want to put kids in that risky scenario. This also shows he doesn't respect your opinion in general, which is something I'd never want in a life partner, especially not one who I'd be raising kids with. 

And beyond whether it's risky to live with them in the future or not, you need to figure out if you still love him or if your feelings have turned sour. Don't marry someone who you can't trust, don't marry someone you don't wholeheartedly still love. 

Postpone the wedding. Personally, I'd be taking off the engagement ring too. Tell your parents that they can have their party and you won't be offended, but you don't know if the wedding to him will ever happen at all. Breath, and take some space for yourself. After that, decide you think this relationship is worth saving, and if you think you can move forward. And then, once you've decided, either separate or get couple's counselling for leaving and staying respectively. After couple's counselling, if you feel you love him and you can trust him and that he respects you, then start talking about marriage again and ""get engaged"" again. If you put in all that work and still aren't sure, don't get all sunk costs fallacy. If this process doesn't work for you, you can walk out at any point and move on then. 

Your parents aren't likely going to pay for a ""second"" wedding, be prepared for that. But honestly, don't go through with getting married to someone you don't know if you have a future with anymore just because you want to have this wedding. One day is not more important than your entire future. Save for a wedding on your own dollar if you decide it's back on later, or just have a small intimate and cheaper wedding on your own dollar. Again, tell your parents they're free to have their party but you aren't marrying someone who you aren't sure you even want to be with anymore. "
"&gt; I want to believe that he was honestly just stressed about my visit to the hospital and lashing out

No no no no no no no no no no. 

Let's go through the list:

* He didn't take care of your pets. At all. For five days. 

* He lied, and told you everything was fine every time you asked for an update. For FIVE days.

* You came home and saw evidence of both his lying and neglect. He lied AGAIN, and then said *you* are the jerk.

This is already break up and never see him again territory, but let's go on:

* He didn't clean the mess that sent you to *hospital*. He didn't clean spilled coffee or smeared *blood*. It was there a week!

* When you asked him to help you, he had the gall to storm off. 

* He will lie to try to emotionally manipulate you. That letter was just an attempt to get you to come home. He honestly doesn't think he's done anything wrong.

And the most concerning red flag of all: 

* Your fiance's attitude and behaviour is so destructive that your friends recognised it a mile away, and had an escape plan ready for you. 

Sit down with your friends and ask them why they dislike your fiance, and *really* listen to what they have to say. They are looking out for you. Your fiance is not. He would have let your animals starve to death, and then would have blamed you for inconveniencing him. He made you clean your own blood off the wall. 

Do not ever go back to him. "
"I think as big an issue as the slap is the relationship priorities. Imo a relationship with someone who puts their family of origin before their SO and kids is no relationship at all. The mom sounds nuts and underserving of respect. I'd say run fast, but since your first priority now should be the kids, good luck with the counseling."
"From a third person's perspective it doesnt look like hes settling for you, hes just not using the right words at the right time to express how he feels about you

Let him know that when you open up to him about how your feeling that you appreciate a more positive response from him rather than a realist one, because he really does sound like he means well, he just isnt using the right approach for you.

Something you could ask him to do is maybe both of you take a week to observe each other and really think about what it is that makes you love each othother and jot them down on a paper or your phones notepad then compare. Something else like this that I've seen is having a jar that you drop notes in about how you feel about each other and why you love each other and you bust it open on your anniversary or something

"&gt; So you're saying Cindy is the one acting like an adult, but it sounds like Cindy was the one who hurt Mike, not the other way around.

"Not gonna lie, I wouldn't even entertain the idea of dating someone whose wife died seven months ago. I wouldn't feel comfortable maybe stepping into an emotional minefield of fresh grief like that.

That said, lots of people do it, and men are particularly likely to start dating again soon after a partner's death. You and he are the only ones who can decide whether you're ready to take that step, but if you do keep in mind that you're building a new relationship parallel to him letting go of the one he had with his wife."
Absolutely!  Thanks! :)
"The man who loves her - doesn't get her, at all.  He is supposed to know her more than anyone else, why on earth would he disregard such strong preferences?  Even if he loves her, he is showing her how little he understands her, and honestly it's appalling considering how open she has been.  It's like he wants her around but doesn't pay attention to who she is as a person.  Who wants to marry into that?  

Communication and compatibility is crucial.  As nice as OP's bf may be, to have given her such a rock shows he has the comprehension of one."

I would ask her instead of what a Christian would do how she would want to be treated if she was in FIL's shoes... Because I bet she would expect you to drop everything to cater to her. Her complete narcissism over demanding you not spend Mother's day with FIL because ""they don't even have a mom!"" is super shitty."

"I have zero idea how they test purity, I would assume they do though. 

I forgot the drugs name, but it started with a N so I assume it is naloxone. They seem extremely experience with this. 

He owns a restaurant, so no, it wouldn't affect his job. He's his own boss. 

He apparently does small amounts, or just enough for the 'spiritual' part of it or whatever he was talking about. He gave a bunch of weird dosage numbers but I had no idea if they were small or large numbers, but yes, he uses the same amount. 

The thing is, I would be *much, much MUCH* more worried if this was something he just started like 8 months ago or some shit. But its been over 10 years apparently. At that point I feel like its reasonable to assume he wouldn't turn to it as an everyday thing if hes been good about his usage for this long. And hes been through some intensely tough times in the past 10 years, he was in desperate poverty, his parents died one after the other (he inherited the restaurant), had an abusive relationship before he met me, and still never turned to using it every day. 

I know it probably just sounds like I am trying extra hard to rationalize this, but these are all factors that make me *slightly* less worried. If it was anything worse, or if he just started using, I wouldn't stand for it. "
No. You accept his help now. Last minute tickets are more expensive plus there is no guarantee you will get a ticket.
"&gt; Also, he;s been lying by omission by not telling you about this part of his life. If he hasn't shared this with you, and you are married, this is a HUGE RED FLAG.

Agreed - to me, this is the crux of the issue.

There's a lot of debate in the comments about whether the husband's ""technically addicted"" to heroine or not, or how bad his habit actually is, etc - and of course, OP definitely will need to reconcile her thoughts on hard drug use with this current situation.

That said, to me it's *much* more worrying that her husband has hidden such a huge part of his life from her.

He's been doing this with his sister for *ten years*. It's a ""transcendental"", ""spiritual"" experience for him. He has an alternate FB account, where he has long chats with strangers about it. This is a major part of who he is.

Yet, he hid this *entire facet of his life* from OP, for *3 years*. This wasn't just something he failed to mention; it takes real work to hide such a major part of your life from your partner. And to then try to justify to himself/others that he lied ""because he doesn't want to hurt her"", is some grade A selfish bullsh*t.

"It's because neglecting animals is depiscable, but you get the logic (if not condone) that ""well he doesn't care about her animals"". But not cleaning up the coffee and blood shows that he doesn't even care about *her*. Which is like - wtf are you even doing in this relationship? Are you a legit sociopath?"
I don't feel so good...
"It sounds like you're more hurt that this girl isn't into you than anything else. The bullying claim is a little thin, and it seems like you want us to come up with a way to get HR to slap her for you."
The issues you have are whatever let you accept that beyond the first time. 
"This feeling you have, where you're no longer actually a child and adults or older kids don't recognise that, this feeling is normal. It's frustrating. But, right now, your brain is reforming and your judgement really isn't as good as you think it is. So those who are older are going to treat you like a kid. They've been through it too.

However, they could be treating you *too* much like a kid. Those at 15 and 17 are further along than you, but not that much further. If in doubt, check with the oldest and with adults for a 'common sense' check. And see what others your age are allowed to do. Find out what's normal. 

Also, ask them what *they* were allowed to do or had done for them when they were 13. 

I'm afraid this struggle is going to continue for some time. It's one of the very unpleasant parts of growing up - that not-a-child-not-yet-an-adult in-betweenness. "

"Yes, if you don't realize how humiliating it would be to hear from a new love interest that you have this mustache (in case you somehow hadn't noticed) and really need to shave it to be considered more attractive...well, you probably ought to study up on human emotions and empathy before attempting a relationship with anyone."
"Also it's shady af to be someone's caretaker--which is a power-holding position--and also want to bone them.  Ethics no-no for sure.

That stood up to me too. I pity the husband. 
You shouldn’t have hid the fact that you smoke sometimes. I’d be furious that you’d managed to hide this so well from me. I learned the hard way what happens when you tell your SO that you smoke sometimes. If you enjoy an occasion smoke session she may not be the one for you. 
You wouldn't be concerned if she drinking secretly though?

What reasons went into that decision are nobody else's business, and there's no magical reason that she can give that'll make OP suddenly content with the breakup. Every possible explanation is just going to provoke follow-up questions that eat away at OP until he wakes up one morning and realizes he's spent a decade of his life obsessing over a relationship that already ended and a baby that doesn't exist. 

OP needs to let it go and move on. "
"Normally, I'd agree. Bringing up issues only when a break-up is imminent is not a mature or efficient way to relate.

However, I do think that OP, despite perhaps loving her a lot, shouldn't have to ask for something that's supposed to be a given, especially at the 1.5 years mark. :/ Like someone else said ITT, he deserves a girlfriend who is crazy about him, not lukewarm."
"I second double-checking with Tyler before buying her anything.  Buying a makeup bag is a really sweet gesture, but some people do not like getting presents from people they don't know--it could make the whole first interaction awkward.  Her father might have a better sense of how well a present would be received.

My instinct is that it might be better to hold off on gift-giving until after meeting the daughter at least once, since that would avoid some of the concerns other posters have raised.  On the other hand, it's possible that opening with this sort of gesture would help to form a great relationship."
"She STILL puts less effort into the relationship. 

Don't let that stop you from thinking that you know better than OP and that his girlfriend is actually crazy in love with him, even though he's ""somewhat"" closer to the situation than you.

Edit - sorry, this was too harsh, you are just throwing something out there. "
"You're forgetting that the normal bills were supposed to come out of his paycheck. He said he'd be able to support them. 

So minus the 750 for tires and the humidifier and maybe 2k for meals, *if* he spent the rest of her 8k on bills, where'd his paychecks for those months end up?"
I'm confused as it sounds like you are talking about dating but then say you aren't interested in a romantic/sexual partner. Perhaps your approach displays this same confusion and that's why people disappear. 
I forgot to say that he doesn’t use social media at all (I also tried finding him online). I was at his place but I didn’t look inside closets or bathrooms and I was not on “the lookout” for any signs of female presence.

"I’ve dated guys with excess skin and did not care at all. I respected the journey they had taken. 

Second my partner was a 28 year old kissless virgin when we started dating and I found it endearing. 

You shouldn’t assume how people are going to react. The worst is they say no and you find someone who won’t, because they’re out there. "
"Don't take it to your coworker. Take it to your boss (maybe e-mail, so they actually read it, versus in person they might zone out and assume you're just trying to defend yourself). And not just to prove your innocence, but to show your boss that there needs to be a new workflow with checks and balances, to prevent this from happening again. If any random person can submit an invoice to be paid, that is a huge problem. So present it to you boss that way - start by saying you don't want anything like this to happen again, so you investigated and found the invoice was submitted by Random Coworker, and you have no idea why, and that to prevent future incidents, you thought if the workflow for paying invoices was changed in X, Y and Z ways (make the relevant specific suggestions - maybe certain accounts are only paid if the invoice is submitted by certain people? etc), that could prevent it from happening again.  This way it doesn't look like you're just trying to cover your ass - you're trying to help the company save money by improving workflows to prevent future mistakes."
"Does he bring them home once he has opened them? Or could you drive to his mother's place and read them now?

There is no way that eating out occasionally and a couple of big purchases should have eaten up all that money, so you need to find out where on earth it's gone.

Also you need to keep responsibility for your own finances in future. Letting your husband take care of that is just giving him extra work to do (that he apparently isn't capable of), and the sort of man who would find the gesture flattering in an ""ooh she's giving me all this *power*"" sort of way is probably not the sort of man you will be able to have a healthy relationship with. Did you discuss with your husband exactly what you expected of him regarding the money? Did you lay out that you wanted him to make a budget and keep track of spending? Because if you didn't, and you just said ""you're in charge of the money"" then... you've learnt an expensive lesson."
"It was for several months and they weren't dating. By that point she had gotten to know me well enough that she could make an accurate assessment of who she wanted to get with more. So she dating me as leverage to try to get with the other guy, we weren't serious so she didn't cheat but when I was actively in the picture and she knew me she chose someone else."
Oh my god...also excellent advice. This is getting more and more complicated
"They aren't eating out every day, only 3x per week maximum.  Over 6 months that is 78 times, which would translate to $102 per meal to burn through $8K."
"&gt; I still haven't heard back from her. I sent the text around 8pm last night. I want to figure out what I did wrong.  

Relax. Everyone's capable of forgetting to reply, or replying late. Assuming you must have done something ""wrong"" is bizarre. Assume she's not around, hit her up again sometime soon. Don't make a ""thing"" about it \- most likely you'll hear back soon enough saying something like ""sorry, forgot to reply, let's do \[whatever\]"". Whereas if you start chasing her up or jumping to conclusions she may well get defensive and tension is introduced when there's no need for it. Assume she's not around and enjoy your Friday."
"&gt;Hopefully as she matures, she will realize her dad was just being practical.

He wasn't being practical.

That's the important lesson that OP and her husband need to take from this disaster."
"Happiness seems silly and false? Like...always? 

Because yeah, that would make you kind of a bummer to be around. I like me some dry pessimism but only to a point. And not being interested in friendship kinda indicates that you won’t be all that attentive in a relationship either - relationships require even *more* maintenance, after all. If you can’t handle seeing friends on a regular basis, what makes you think you actually want a partner? "
"Thanks for saying this. I'm not saying his ex wife isn't a piece of work, but it sounds like his concern for his kids is mostly connected to his wallet. I wonder if his new family (aka his new wife) is resentful of his other kids and the money they are getting that could be going to the new family. Don't really feel sorry for the two adults in this situation, just their kids who likely grew up in a Cluster f-k."
Because they’re for memories for the whole family and not just for his wife. I bet you that down the line OP will look at these photos and will actually be glad they got taken. His son too. Professional pictures are completely different to normal snapshot photos we take.

"I would be really annoyed if someone told me how to dress for something like this.

It comes across as really patronizing if you tell someone how to dress."

"Am i your girlfriend? JK my mom would never say ""she might not be able to have kids."" like my boyfriend my mother just ignored the fact that i dont want to give birth to children. I have a fear of my body changing and something growing inside of me like a parasite. You're girlfriend likes control why would she want to give up control of her own body for some other thing inside her. GROSS

"Cut her out of your life. It's not your job or business to fix people, especially if they're abusive towards you."
"Some of the best times I’ve had with my husband are when we were newly dating and going to the state fair together. I know it’s not the same as a festival but we still got drunk, went to the concerts every day, bought the food, took cheesy pics, it was a freakin blast. 

What she wants is to flirt and appear single so that other guys and girls flirt and get grabby with her. That’s a hard no for me. If I were you, id still go to the festival. Enjoy yourself. Be affectionate towards her if that’s what you want, and judge her reactions. Judge the crap out of her. If she’s an affectionate and loving girlfriend, stay with her. If she pushes you away, gets annoyed, openly flirts with others in front of you and allows other people to grab/flirt/touch her in front of you - well you have your answer. She isn’t worth your time if that’s the kind of person she is. "
I'd never assume close friends wouldn't want to hear from me after surgery. I'd want to know how the procedure went and whether I could visit.
We’re going to need a lot more detail and specifics.
"A partner that can't hear a no and whines about the end result (Of *course* you 'get upset' its' a direct consequence of his shitty behaviour) isn't really mature enough to have sex with anyway.  What if he starts willfully ignoring your no in person?  *Nobody* hears 'Stop.  Please' and thinks it's just a pun on ""pls blindfold me"".  A guy that found out he was accidentally putting the pressure on would go ""oshit sorry"" and change his behaviour, he's not doing that.  He's trying to push for sex then whining when he doesn't get it, aka more pushing/pressure to have sex.  I'd tell him bluntly that after the first no he's got to drop it but tbh if it was me I'd dump him, the ""bby pls /whine"" would have killed the mood re: them a lot."
I agree with this. Really depends on how the finances are handled as a couple
"Nothing he's said she did/said directly seems untactful though is the thing. He says she didn't yell. She didn't namecall. She was surprised/shocked at first and asked if it was a joke (that could have been a sincere question - it seems like it when he recounts it) and then said she didn't like them, then proceeded to be hurt and disappointed. He meanwhile did nothing to apologize or say, ""Oh, man, how can I fix this?"" but instead got immediately defensive, which probably made her more sad and is why the sadness dragged on. (I remember that from other relationships - When I'm disappointed by something my partner has done, and he makes it about him, it makes me double sad because now it's not even about my disappointment anymore. It's about him again.) 

I can't find a comment of something he's saying she actually did/said that was untactful, just that he took it that way, but he seems to take any criticism on here really harshly too so is that her reaction or his perception? 

He even said he wanted her to say she appreciated it, so it sounds to me like any reaction that's not a lie would be too harsh for him. He's getting ""beat about the head"" because he doesn't reflect on his own. At the first sign of his wife's disappointment, he could have thought, ""Wow, bummer, I messed up"" and said, ""Oh, honey, I want to fix this, I'm really sorry I messed up the gifts, I was hoping to make you really happy"" and they probably would have sorted it by now. Even that might have been enough of a fix for the gift! But instead he's defensive - with her and here - about how his gift is super great. "
"So you pay $800 in child support and she pays you $750 in rent? That comes out to a net of $50 from you to her, monthly. 

Is the rent well below market rate or something? I'm struggling to see how she's freeloading on you otherwise - not for $50. 

As for the new payments, talk directly to your daughters to figure out a fair monthly stipend. "

"That was my biggest WTF about this whole situation too. ""Oh, you've had miscarriages but you aren't a mother, so you can't come to mother's day brunch"". It goes beyond heartless to abject cruelty."
"Wear a bra when you go out with your mom. This isn't a big deal, especially for Mother's Day.."
"I agree with your wife on waiting to say something until 18/20 weeks.
The real issue to me here is why in the world you aren’t included in Mother’s Day brunch with your family?!?! She’s your mom regardless of your child status. That’s the real issue here.

I know you’re excited (and you should be!) but I also understand your wife being cautious. Losing a child is so devastating, it’s hard not to be scared. Being conservative about telling people isn’t a bad thing. 

I’m sorry you weren’t included in the brunch! If you’re anywhere near Philly, I’ll take you to Mother’s Day brunch 😊"
"The comments would be agreeing with him. 

No one is siding with her because she’s a woman. They’re siding with her because she’s terrified of yet another miscarriage. The poor woman probably feels like she failed as a woman already and the OP bringing up that the OP’s family places a lot of emphasis on being a mom isn’t helping.

But she’s not saying she has more of a right, she’s saying she has just as much right. If a guy said that in those words everyone would be siding with him.

This isn’t about controlling someone’s body - I have no clue where you even got that idea other than you’re very misinformed about what body autonomy is. This is something they’re going through together and are equals in."
"I agree that there is some manipulation. I don’t think it’s malicious (ie she wants me to be unhappy) as much as it is selfish and avoidant (she wants to avoid the talk), but it’s still not good. When she was regularly medicated, she would stop herself and own up to this stuff being manipulative and sort it out, but now she doesn’t do that. 

I don’t believe she is a tortured soul in particular, or at least no more than anyone else. Maybe because of my own issues but I have very little tolerance for mental health issues manifesting as abuse; someone with my issues can easily pass off abuse as meltdowns, etc, so I’m more aware than this post makes me seem. I think a lot of my resentment comes from that. I feel a bit like I’m being played. All that being said, I don’t think she intends harm as much as she sucks, quite frankly, at confronting her issues.

But thank you so much for this reply, because you are right and I need to be very cognizant that this behaviour is not acceptable and is, ultimately, manipulative. Love can certainly blind us, and I have to make sure that doesn’t happen."

"Look up Paul Gilmartin. He does a podcast (mental illness happy hour) that discusses all sorts of topics about mental health and relationships, etc. He describes a very similar situation with his mom growing up. Took him years to identify that what she did was sexual abuse.

"It's pretty common for bisexuals to have a preference one way or another - I'm bisexual but mostly attracted to men/masculinity. It's common for women to talk about their sex lives with their friends. She also has good points about the abilities of men to give head better than women, and women to perform cunnilingus better than men - it makes logical sense for the most part. 

It was very rude of her friends to say something like that in front of you, but Emma handled it properly, as far as I can tell. I don't think she's slagging your sex life to her friends.

&gt;And it also hurts to hear she generally gets off multiple times in one go, having sex with another girl, when she doesn't always get off at all with me.

Talk to her about this part, and how you guys can improve the sex you're having.

"When you have a partner who has not consented to parenting a child, to the point that y'all have an *abortion fund* in case of accidental pregnancy, and you haven't even taken a blood test and exam yet to make sure it's a viable pregnancy, yet you go running immediately to Facebook to grab control of the public narrative... yeah, sorry, that's fucking psycho."
"1) never bang cousins. and im not being puritanical or kink shaming, it's just one way to end up in an awkward fucking situation (no pun intended)

2) she's being abusive. the control she's exerting is manipulation and will never stop. 

3) idk if part of the issue is your family freaking out if they knew, but you probably should tell someone *if* this gets worse

4) it may be enough to tell her you will tell your parents etc and will get a restraining order if she doesn't stop. I know that sounds extreme, and it may be for her behavior at the moment but if it escalates you need to try and find a way to dissuade her from continuing

5) don't bang family members. For all the other reasons why, it seems like an incredible way to complicate your life"
"Did she actually leave a public comment on the Facebook photo? How embarrassing for her. If so, I'd go one of two ways: wordlessly delete the comment (pretty sure you can delete any comment you'd like on the photo) or reply in a way that makes her feel like a real jerk-- something like, ""How sad for you that you'd focus on something so shallow in such a fantastic photo."" Or something like that.

More broadly,  your fiance is being a real jerk by not already putting a stop to this stuff. HE should have been the one to reply to the snarky comment sticking up for you. Where's his fucking loyalty? Ain't nobody gonna spit anything but sunshine and rainbows out of their ass on an engagement photo of my new fiance without hearing from me. What's wrong with him?"
"Just ignore it. He's acting like a child who can't handle the hurt the break-up has caused you, so he dismisses you as crazy to make himself feel better. It's macho posturing, and no-one who knows you will be fooled. If they don't know you, it doesn't matter.

If he's prepared to act like an immature idiot, let him. It just shows you're better off without him.

Block him and stay out of contact with him. If you're not contacting him, then you're not doing anything to support his idiotic claims. It'll blow over. That's how you control the story. Not by fighting back, but by maintaining a dignified silence and getting on with your life, and letting him carry on making himself look foolish."

Even if he's on the same page with OP and is willing to tell his hypothetical future children no, just by modeling his poor eating habits, that would be a terrible influence on them. And if his separate, junky food supply exists in the house, they'll be breaking into it at every opportunity."

"It's just life, man. You realize that there really are not endless choices. Sometimes when a door shuts, it shuts for good. 

So what you have to do is focus on the doors that you can and want to open. Try as best you can to direct your life as you go along to keep creating experiences and fostering friendships that are fulfilling to you. 

It's ok to mourn the loss of something that will never be, but don't get stuck there. Put your energy into the hope and happiness of things yet to come, and wish that also for those that you care about, including your old friend. This is probably a very happy and exciting, maybe even a little scary, time in her life. I'm sure you wish her well, and it's probably better to focus on the positive of wishing her well than it is to focus on the negative of feeling sorrow that you didn't get to have something that at one point in time you thought you wanted. 

It's just life, it will be alright, everything's ok. "

"Not wanting to be touched is not ""cold and distant"", it's just a different way of showing affection. I am a hugger, and I have family members who very much are not, including a parent. I've never even considered them cold or distant, they have their own ways of showing they care. "

"You move on without him. I understand why he's upset but birth control fails a lot more than people realize and he should had taken some steps of his own to prevent pregnancy on his end if he was extremely against having a child.

People need to stop with blaming women, it takes two to tango. He shoulda wrapped it and pulled out too.

The people blaming you are ignorant. Get off social media.

Don't bother with him anymore. If he wants to see his child then he knows where to find you, but he is still responsible for the child unless you skip putting him on the birth certificate I believe. Which I probably would skip it if he's not going to be involved at all. It's up to you though if you want his financial help.

Good luck with your pregnancy 💜"

"You might want to cross post to polyamory or nonmonogamy subreddit for more nuanced responses.

This is why veto rules can cause such friction. There's a certain element of trust one has to have in their partner that they won't abuse it. Also I read your reason down below and I think it's a very insecure reason that pushed you to veto. Because he is pursuing her? Not the other way around? If it was because he seemed off, or had said nasty things about you or her, or had a history of being a shitty person then I'd understand the veto. But this is pandering to your insecurities rather than you working through them. 

Your wife is upset because you brought up a veto for the first time ever. She probably didn't understand why this was the time that made you so she asked. She got your response which wasn't about how your relationship would be affected, but that things are happening in a different way than her usual pursue and reassurance. Why does that upset you? What about it is really worrying you?

And I think it would be best to take the focus off the guy. I doubt it's this particular guy she is upset about. More just for the first time the open aspect suddenly has a fence that's come up and she sees she's not quite as free as she thought she was. She's also allowed to feel put out or down about the veto. It's a type of rejection after all, even if it came from you and not the other person.  

While it's not best for her to retaliate, she could be building insecurity of her own. Y'all need to sit down and talk it out. Open and honest. Obviously be kind and don't say hurtful things but you both need to get out how you feel about how this went down or was handled. How to handle it in the future. If the veto boundary can still work, but maybe need to have more discussion about it rather than a no reason why. It's considered bad form to tell children ""just because"" or ""because I said so"" when they want to know something, I think it wise to take that mentality and apply it to open relationships so everything is fully on the table. Yes, a veto does deserve discussion.  "

This line makes me think you are mad insecure here. You had no reason to bring up his looks and using normal as an insult makes you seem arrogant. 

You clearly don't trust your GF, and nothing she is doing seems strange if that guy is really her best friend. 

If it's really causing this much tension for you, you should probably break up and date someone who isn't in the college age range, where stuff like this is exceedingly common.

"It’s not. Your makeup is fine. You wear it because you like it, not to impress some dumb jagoff. He doesn’t sound very intelligent. Who gives a rip what he thinks - you’ll never see him again. Seek validation from within - focus on self love and appreciation."
"Reading your replies in the comments shows a very different situation than one might get from your main OP. You were very nice in glossing over how selfish your wife is and the miserable attitude of her parents. It doesn't mattter what country people are in, an attitude of looking down on everyone else is just not going to win any friends. I think you should do whatever you want. Take your children with your family, ont he whole vacation, and you do anything you want with your kids and family. Tell her she is free to do the same as you will not be attending the vacation with her sisters. Your wife sounds very selfish and spoiled. maybe she should see what living like the rest of us who plan around and care for our partners is like then learn from it."
"I haven't seen two larger doormats and spineless creatures together mashed into one in my whole life.

Here is a hint: Tell N to fuck off.

*Sorry cannot resist. The whole OP reads like it's from a bad Twilight Zone episode*. Maybe *N* is a mind controlling robot or a body snatching alien has invaded N's body and has killed the original N. 

This whole thing is so hilarious and delusional that I sincerely don't have much useful and practical advice for this couple in the story. I guess both of them were raised in bubble wraps and overprotected as children. The damage is done. A good parenting tip though: Don't do this to your son."
"Good for her mother for helping her and respecting Jane’s boundaries concerning you and her father. You both made an egregious mistake and are now reaping those consequences. Neither of you have apologized for the lack of support and it’s not as if you’re saddled with any debt. Jane made her own way and deserves to have only the people who loved and supported her decisions at her side for her big celebration day.

You missed that boat. Better start planning on how to apologize and make it up to her. Next thing you know you won’t be invited to other major life events. And it’ll be entirely your fault."
"I mean realistically your solution is to train Albus not to do these things. You brought him when he had barely left puppydom to this house and this is what he learned. It's not surprising that he didn't have all these certain behaviors before, he was a puppy and didn't have any of his behaviors solidified. Now that he's adopted some bad habits, you should be training him not to. And you should have been training him over the past year. Maybe it's missing from your post but you didn't write anywhere whether you've been trying to train him out of that. Yes, other dogs can influence him but he should ultimately listen to you. If you haven't been training your dog and just complaining that he's poorly trained over the last year, I think that's your problem. I don't think it's your roommates job to train his dogs so that they'll influence Albus by osmosis. He agreed to be your roommate, not to train up doggy role models so that you don't have to correct your own dog's behavior"
"YES, 100% AGREED! But I worry that there's no hotels anywhere near them if they live on a farm, depending on how rural the area is. That could be an issue. "
"Leave her alone. He chose not to support her even after the decision was made.

If I were Jane it would piss me off immensely that this guy who didn't believe in me and wouldn't support my decision is now trying to show up and act like a proud dad."
"You: So N we are going here, you can join us if you like. 

N: I don’t like that we should go here instead. 

You: sorry no we are going where we want but we understand if you don’t want to join us. 

You to husband: if you don’t like the way I am handling this feel free to step up and talk to N about this yourself. 

You: I’m taking a spa day away from everyone. N clean up your shite, seriously we have bent over backwards for you on this god forsaken trip, Husband, I love you have fun with S in the Park. "
"It’s baffling to me that your wife specifically told you not to do something but you did it anyways because....you knew better? Knew better than her how *her* abusive family would react? That’s so wildly disrespectful. And the fact that you want her to have this huge fight and “fuck you” attitude just because you want to have drinks with her cousin? This is just unbelievable. 

Just in case you haven’t gotten it yet, you are 100% wrong in this situation. Yes her family’s out of their minds but that’s the family she’s interacting with and you follow her lead in this situation. Next time she tells you not to do something because she doesn’t want to deal with “the troublesome stress” from her family, *listen to her*. "
"You sure you have those ages right? 

If so then your dad was a very young parent and likely had to grow up too fast. He can date whoever he likes. I personally am weirded out by this age gap but that’s just me.

What’s gross here is that she’s your friend. That’s kind of heinous. Your dad is being gross and so is your friend! I would personally go no contact until they break up (which they will). And I personally would not be friends with this person again."
"Since you appear to be Christians, could I suggest attending one of Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace classes together?  Or just getting his audiobooks and listening to them when you drive out together.  Or his podcast.

He has been very helpful in getting my husband and me to address out financial situation together as a team, and we're not even religious.  You never know, it might work for you and your wife too.

"
"&gt; personally its a pretty rude thing for this person to suggest

I think that too"
"""I actually had _______ in mind for this month's meeting. Maybe you can show the documentary when its your turn to host!"""
"He's not being ""secretive"", they're not dating and she has no right to see his messages.

Maybe at first he was more open about it, but he probably realized she was far more into him than he was into her and he stepped back from it all which is when the ""secretive"" stuff began. He simply began to maintain regular levels of privacy between two people who aren't dating."
"&gt; Everything she says its as though she is convincing me to think it is my idea - it's genuinely manipulation but I am unsure whether it's intentional. 

Can you explain this more?  I didn't really see it come into play in the rest of the post so I want to make sure we have the full picture to judge the email.

Beyond that... forgiving is not forgetting.  You and your fiance can determine some sort of penalty that does not involve cutting her out of your lives entirely.  
"
I think now that maybe a do-over gift would be a good idea. I am certainly going to think about it more. 
"I don't think you want to hear anyone's advice on here, you seem to only want to hear she was wrong and you were right. "

"A quick browse through your comment history shows you are somewhat of a whack-job and probably a compulsive liar.

You’re anecdotes aren’t important here and for all we are considered, are lies. 

“Insert fictionalized story that no one can verify here to argue my point”

Everyone on this thread agrees you’re wrong. As I mentioned earlier, no one should be taking advice from a college student who is in debt and doesn’t have a job. Sorry! 💁‍♀️"
"His family \(who is kind to you\) airs legitimate concerns about their son marrying you in a calm, seemingly kind and respectful way to him in a private way and you want to go nuclear and make him cut his family off? Yes, you're being batshit."
"&gt; I get self concious when trying to flirt. I do not know how to flirt. People think I'm joking when I'm serious because I joke around too much. Help me out!

Yeah I’m just gonna park it right here and wait for answers because I’m pretty sure everyone is terrible at this. "
"&gt; Am I insane for sticking around this long?

No. But I think you're insane for sticking around any longer. He promised to change a couple months ago. Now it's shit or get off the pot time. Either he comes to you with a plan for independence, or you continue not talking to him."
I was set to say she was being unreasonable until you told us what the action is. 
"It’s not just that the wife won’t communicate, OP said he was so mad he didn’t even want to talk to her and wanted to basically stew in his anger for a few days before talking to her lol"
Don't even need to. Just read OP's comments in this thread. Very obvious where her fiance's family is coming from here!
"Exactly, this guy is a douche bag."
"also in theory a dad should want photos of his family just as much for his wife, no? saying that family portraits are a gift, for her, for a special occasion suggests that this isnt also a gift for himself, which suggests a kind of imbalance there. the implication is either ""for mothers day i got you this gift that is also for myself"" or if you're cynical ""i dont care enough about these portraits to do this on november 13th, but i'll do it to fulfill a gift quota""."
"You've posted this comment several times, and I'm wondering why that would matter. It's not okay to flake on someone like that, full stop. If it's because she's upset that OP doesn't call enough or something, that's a separate conversation she needed to have, or she at least should have just declined in the first place."
What if you do stay with him and have kids and then one of those kids does something that really ticks him off and he pushes them? 
"I mean, it is. That's just statistics. Getting married later in life is a *lot* more common now and I think it's a great idea, but it's definitely late in life."
"First off, was she upset that you had two one\-night stands when you weren't exclusive? If the answer is no, you need to realize you're setting a double standard and being such a hypocrite. It's not okay. Why was it okay for you to sleep with other people, but not her? Also why are you snooping through her phone? Do you not trust your girlfriend? If she's so open with texts, why did you feel the need to search something specific? It doesn't sound like you do trust your girlfriend. 

You know you don't have a right to be angry or upset, so what's the issue? "
I second this. I would hope someone I love would love him as much as I did and care for my husband as well as I have.

"The lesson the kid is learning is about being doormat and never speaking up for yourself. 

OP: What do I do?

Learn to say no. "
"Well it clearly wasn’t “exceptional” if the school she went to was #1 in her field and she was smart and capable enough to get a scholarship to it!

She knew what decision she wanted to make. Your husband could have respected her and her autonomy, he could have discussed it with her, tried to convince her that his suggestion was better, but when he was his heart was set on the university she’d chosen, he could have still be gracious and supportive and respectful. Instead he basically threw an adult tantrum, was angry and Jane and her mom, irreversibility damaged their relationship, pointedly refused to provide any financial help at all because she dared to make a decision different than the one he wanted. And it’s clear that you still don’t understand this and presumably he doesn’t either and probably never will. And so his relationship with his daughter is now seriously damaged if not destroyed due 100% to his own actions and lack of insight and inability to even offer a genuine apology. That’s sad."
Did you maybe steal a bunch together for shits and giggles. Just trying to get the creative juices flowing.
"Seems like an inside joke you've forgotten - did you ever make a reference to pregnancy being like jelly in some way? Because that is the only reason I can think of that makes your girlfriend's reaction understandable (obviously she should be being more mature about it, but if she's full of hormones and it's such an important life event then a bit of irrationality is part of the package really).

You're just going to have to wait until she's calmed down a bit and then ask her, I think."
Seriously!  I thought of this as well.  OP is the person who gives in and buys the iTunes gift cards when the IRS scammer says they're calling the police.  
"He is more committed to his men folk and that will not change. He's 36 and had plenty time to create his own life. Most people do not stay financially responsible for their parents and grandparents once they start their own life.

You can either join him in supporting his family or move on and support your own."

"I’m confused why you even sought her out if she’s not your type? 
Anyways don’t pursue this, too early to be unattracted to a partner"
"this.....this is what i would do.  when she acts up, ask her GENTLEY if you've done something to upset her.  would do that privately tho.....not sure how you would do this if it happens in front of others or in a meeting?"
My mom can still say “no”
"Oh! My confusion was the ""falling""...I've never heard it phrased that way."
"I agree with this mostly, but I'm just gonna add...

OP, you could send a screenshot of your call history to people he's lied to. That'd prove you haven't contacted him since the breakup. I'm not sure this is the right call - it might just add fuel to the fire - but it is an option."
I'm kind of surprised at how *enthusiastic* she is though. It'd be one thing if she changed her mind about the abortion but she's swung from enthusiastically agreeing to an abortion to enthusiastically jumping to celebrate being a mom. It seems really abrupt and drastic.
"Wow. Yeah, she never comes over again."
"She does want to go see a lawyer first, before deciding whether to make a police report.

Thanks for bringing that up, if she ends up going through with this, I'll make sure she talks about whether that would apply to her, with a lawyer"
"It's fine if you want to make this a deal breaker, a lot of people would have a problem with it. "
I always assumed it would be past employers words over mine (no matter how batshit insane the past employer is). I'm so affected by this job I have a mini panic attack every time I see a bitter looking old Asian woman who looks like my boss! Thank you for your comment! x
"I don’t like to rush to the worst case scenario, and if I were in your shoes I would want to believe him and rationalize this somehow...but there is no version of this where this isn’t your cue to leave. I just cant imagine a reality in which this isn’t a huge red flag that he doesn’t respect or value you. You don’t have kids, so if you stay you will only be hurting yourself and thats a choice you’re allowed to make — but please, please create an exit strategy. For if/ when you’re ready. If you never use it, fine, but don’t trap yourself in this. "
That's an extreme assumption
"I don't try to initiate sex as much, so he doesn't feel pressured. We try to have sex at least once a week, with him initiating when he feels comfortable. He is much more physically affectionate now, in exchange. He's always touching and cuddling and groping me, which makes me feel more attractive and intimate with him. Once he knew that I didn't expect physical affection to lead to sex all the time, he started to really enjoy it and even does it way more frequently than we originally discussed.

It's not perfect - I get too horny sometimes and have to spend some time alone with my magic wand - but it's solved 95% of the problem.

"
"JFC I can't believe the number of people here who think they are entitled to friendship. Friendship is two way. If it isn't mutually rewarding and beneficial, it isn't a friendship. Nowhere does it say that OP's ""friend"" tries to be a friend in any way that reasonates as friendship for OP, she's offering things OP actively doesn't want. And she certainly hasn't made any visible effort to limit her leaning on OP, or to understand the dynamic OP is seeking in friendship. OP is doing nothing wrong in refusing to be an emotional sponge for someone just because they're in her orbit. "
"it's not hilarious. she says the ex is currently 48. there's a lot of other stuff going on her.
"
"I agree with almost everything you've said, except the ""refuse politely"" part. If she offers to do an activity with him and he doesn't want to he can politely decline, but if she gives him a reasonable command like to turn off the light or pick up his toys or take out the trash, then he doesn't get to refuse, politely or otherwise. He needs to respect OP's girlfriend as an adult and an authority figure (if not as a replacement mother) and as an adult in the family that he needs to obey."
"The problem isn't your communication. Your communication is fine. Your boyfriend is pushy as hell and doesn't know how to take no, and is trying to coerce you into letting your boundaries down. The problem is him, not you, and I would look very carefully at how much longer you're willing to put up with his bullshit."
"You've listed several things that would be relationship\-breakers to me; not because one or the other of you is ""wrong,"" but because it's such a basic incompatibility that I don't think a long\-term relationship would be possible. To list them out:

* You have different values and views about sex
* You are not on the same page regarding when you want to get married or have children.
* You have different religious views and are both fairly serious about them.
* The nature of your work means he cannot be involved with that part of your life.
* The nature of his work means that you cannot ever be more important than that part of his life.

Like... any one of these would be an incompatibility that would end a relationship. I think you're probably two people who get along well and like each other a whole lot, but you want completely different things out of life. Love and respect for each other are necessary for a healthy relationship, but not sufficient to have one. It sounds like both of you think the other person is great \- but not great for them. It's why you both keep thinking that the other would be better suited with someone more of their speed. Eventually you both need to accept that this isn't the relationship you want long\-term, and agree to end things."

"I’m not saying this to be cruel, but to point out the one thing you’re missing. In your post you never actually say anything was your fault.  

You seem to believe that your older son isn’t justified in ghosting you from your words “whatever he’s had to tell himself”.

Has it occurred to you that you actually have wronged him?  It doesn’t sound like it from your writing."
"Your company should get an air purifier to keep in the restrooms - small/portable ones are under $50, so this is a total cost of ~150 to the company. That is an incredibly reasonable accommodation to make. Talk to your manager or HR about this, without pointing fingers. "
"But you are not someone, you are her husband and she should be able to share her (understandable) emotional response with you. Especially when she is hurt"
"No. You didn't. You said that he whispers to your boss. That's it. I doubt your job has an official policy regarding dB of your voice. Maybe they are talking about prostate health or both embarrassed that they like pineapple on pizza.


And that he only talks to you about work...which is okay, because he is a coworker. 


Am I missing something in the post?"
Te fact that you find this weird and disturbing and that you are pushy about it would make me trust you *even less*. You are basically strangers still. Some guy I’ve gone on a few dates with being in a snit and saying “nothing will happen” would through up SO MANY red flags... 
Shaving his face is not a gift *for her*. Getting family photos is not a gift *for her*. 
"Next time he says it, give him what he is asking for, a divorce.  "
"He doesn't actually care that it is painful to her. He is simply trying to manipulate her into getting what he wants. He would be perfectly happy if she just sucked it up and put up with the pain for him. Women need to stop putting up with torture in order to please men. All that will happen in this situation is that he is going to constantly hound her, she will continue to give in a little, and then one day she will finally snap as she has had enough and leave. She will realize that her ""relationship"" is not enjoyable to her at all, but instead a constant nagging to put up with pain. He will move on to the next woman who will suffer sexually in order to ""please"" him. "
"Yes, I told him that I would prefer to stay in the area, but if I get accepted there and not here, I’m going there."
"&gt; kind gift

It isn't kind of, it is real money, and you don't give away thousands of dollars without telling your spouse. Those funds belong to the family. "
I think it depends on the marriage. If my husband won a vacation to Hawaii and gifted it to someone else without asking me then I wouldn't particularly care. Especially if it was going to someone who really deserved it.
"You think this 40 year Dad is going to tell his nanny bestie that his wife thinks he is the one being inappropriate?  Of course not!

I think it much more likely the mom told the dad to knock off flirting with the nanny.   He just put the blame on the nanny to...oh, I don't know?  Maybe get OP to feel like it is her and him against Evil Troll Wife who just Doesn't Understand Platonic Friendships?   Hmmm?"

"Many people (especially if you’re not in a deeply religious/conservative area like the Deep South), including myself, think that’s just way too young to be getting married. Most people in their early to mid twenties still have a lot of growing and changing to do as people, so the person you’re compatible with now may not be the person you’re compatible with as a middle aged adult. Unless you started dating as children (in which case there’s a whole other issue of lack of dating experience), a relationship in your early-mid twenties probably hasn’t been long enough to truly know each other, and know that you’re compatible in the long haul through various ups and downs. 

Sure, it works out for some people, but for a lot of people it’s a mistake, and I don’t see where the rush is- if you’re so sure your relationship is going to last at 25, then clearly you’ll still be together to get married at 30 with a lot more life experience and a stronger relationship. 

So when you say that you’re 25 and unmarried, my reaction is “good!” You still have TONS of time, and you won’t be one of the many people getting their first divorce in their late twenties/early thirties. "

"It's not her ""not understanding"". She understands just fine \- she's been living with it daily, whatever the diagnosis was. She's been through this cycle so many times that of course she can't trust you, because she has no idea whether today might be a day you dump her and quit your job, regardless of how well you've been doing lately. Instead of expecting her to understand, and bemoaning her building a ""wall"", how about you try to understand **her**? Recognise how hard this has been on her, acknowledge that it may take a long time for that trust to be rebuilt, and work with her to rebuild it, on a schedule that suits** he**r. You can't expect her to just magically be OK with what's happened in the past, just because you think it won't happen again."
"Yeah, I have run into a lot of entrepreneurs in my professional life as well as my dating life and there are a lot of people using that term incorrectly. 

You can successfully start your own business later in life but most entrepreneurs have always had an innate desire to poke and prod and are totally unable to leave a good idea alone. They don't take 2 months off - they rarely take vacations at all. They also don't look for scapegoats when problems come up... 

Although I suppose it's admirable he's securing the scapegoat before even launching the business/failing. By golly, he's got foresight!"
"Having to move and giving up the dog are just two examples of you asking exactly that, my guess is there are more."
"So. This whole ""desperate and clingy"" thing. You have to let that go. Do it. Let it go. Do not beat yourself up for wanting your SO to show you love, affection, and attention without being prompted. It's NORMAL to want attention from your loved ones, and you're NOT clingy for being tired of being the only one to reach out. 

People will do what is important to them. He's important to you, so you reach out. But...he won't reach out to you on his own. And when you communicated this to him, that you feel like you're doing all of the work...his solution was that you should continue to do the work.

You have emotional needs. They are not being met. He flat out told you that he doesn't intend to meet them. So your options are to continue doing all of the emotional labor in your relationship, going the distance and exhausting yourself for the smallest shreds of affection...or, you can leave the person who doesn't treat you like an important partner.

It doesn't make you clingy to want you SO to fucking participate in the relationship. It does, however, make you foolish to sacrifice your feelings and needs on the altar of being the ""cool girl."" You're not being treated like you're important, and your concern is that you're being clingy because you want the person who's supposed to love you to message you first occasionally. I mean...really? Don't you think you deserve better than that? Don't you think you deserve to feel secure and respected?

Do you want to be the cool girl? Or do you want to be happy? Because somewhere out there is a partner that actually wants to contact you first. Who cares about your day. I suggest you go find that one. 

Yeah. It's doomed. And it SHOULD be. You can do better."
"If I was you I would cut your dad out of my life completely he seems like a toxic narcissist.

 If you’re feeling generous you can reach out to your ex and explain to her what kind of a “father” he was growing up so she should either abort it or start getting her shit together now because your dad is not going to be a stable presence in the kid life. (Not recommended if you still have strong feelings for her)

Or you can have your mom explain to Alice the realities of living with your dad.
This is more for your future half sibling benefit than anything else.

But afterwards I would wash my hands of it, live my life and strive to be a better man than my dad was"
You have said that your only goal in life is to find a soulmate.  This tells me that you don't have much relationship experience and are not very mature yet.  Which is fine btw!  Everyone's gotta start somewhere

"This seems like a non-issue to me if everyone involved is reasonable.

You should ask the parents to speak to their son and take responsibility for your silence on the matter.  You are a 3rd party and any discussion between your husband and his parents about their will should be done between them, not through you.

Parents:  Son, as you know we asked your wife to look over our will.  We have told her under no circumstances is she to disclose the information within as we consider it private.

She intends to honor our wishes on this matter.  We expect you to act accordingly and not bring it up with her.  Is that clear?

--------------

If my parents said that to me, I'd say ""sure no problem"" and that would be the end of it."
"It is only a matter of time before your wife turns on your daughter. I think we both know that. 

Your daughter won't even really remember your wife if you leave now compared to the damage it will do later.

Start documenting. **TAKE PICTURES**, keep notes, go see a divorce lawyer and get an exit strategy setup. 

Leave all in one day. 

Honestly go look in the mirror and ask yourself what you actually need your wife for? What does she actually do? And are those things something you can't find elsewhere?

Take a few days and read the posts young people put on here about their suffering later in life because of an abusive parent. I bet your mind will be made up."
"You did legal work for them by reviewing their Will when they asked you to. I don't know where you live, but in my jurisdiction, that's probably enough to give rise to an attorney-client relationship. And they specifically asked you not to speak to your husband, their son, about the contents of the Will. Regardless of the relationship issues you're caught in, you may be ethically bound to keep their confidence on pain of your license to practice law. Many state Bars have legal ethics hotlines you can call to talk to another lawyer about an issue like this one.

You *might* be able to CYA in the relationship department by telling your husband they've asked you not to speak to any of the family about their Will. He should understand."
Especially if the parents are financially savvy (which they certainly seem to be) and aren't flashy with their money. 
I think it's way more weird to just let it slide that your partner has been deceiving you for years while you lived under the same roof than it is to have the normal reaction of being concerned about what else your partner may be lying about. 
"I like to sneak upstairs where my boyfriend is sitting while wearing a sheet mask just to say, ""Hi! It's me! Your friend Voldemort!""  Then leave immediately."
"You need to get out. She threw coffee on you FFS. Time to find a lawyer and for the love of god go for full custody of your daughter. If you won't leave for yourself, LEAVE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER. By staying you are telling her its ok to stay and be abused. You are telling her its ok to BE abusive to get what she wants.

She's 3 of course she loves her mother. That's not an excuse because she is old enough to start picking up on things and it will be continue.

What are you gonna do when this goes beyond hot coffee? When she decides to abuse you when you are holding your daughter."

Drama can only let it happen if you let it happen and choose to be embroiled in it. Have A go to the post office and make the report. THEY will determine what is illegal, and I can tell you that from your description,  what C did is absolutely illegal."
"This isn't to say that your frustration isn't valid, but I would guess that she probably feels like her bare face would be unattractive, and you acting like you've never seen her real face means you suspect that she really is, and would zero in and overanalyze her flaws if she let you see them.

I'm not as bad as your girlfriend is about this stuff \(I can't imagine sleeping with a face of foundation!\), but it did take me a while to let my boyfriend see my bare face. As a teenager, my mom used to criticize my looks when I wasn't wearing makeup, so it made me feel like it was something I needed to do to not feel ashamed of my appearance.

I have a much healthier relationship with makeup now, but some of that insecurity is still there. I NEVER go out without it, unless I'm going swimming, and even then I don't really like doing it.

However, he never gave me a hard time about it, and eventually I just gravitated towards being less anxious about always having to look 100&amp;#37; around him. I began to realize that he really was serious about me, and loved me for who I was, so I didn't have to worry he'd be making the types of comments my mom did. I've accepted that I really don't look that much different when my face is bare \- maybe pale and splotchier, but not the enormously hideous change my own critical eye sees.

Obviously, that's different than your case, where she's refused to budge an inch. But making her feel like something she's clearly already insecure about is a big hurdle is probably just going to make her feel worse.

It's understandable that you feel like her guarded personality makes her someone you couldn't marry, but from her perspective, it's probably closer to ""I look bad without makeup, he can tell I do, and now he's trying to catch me and prove how bad I look"".

If you're actually serious about this girl and want to move past this, I would make it clear to her that it's not about judging her appearance or thinking she's fake for trying so hard. This isn't like those guys who wanna take their new girl swimming because they think she's hiding something. You just want to feel like you know her, and for her to not be afraid to open up around you, but you understand that it's something she's not comfortable with, and don't want to push her. 

For a lot of women, myself included, makeup DOES feel like part of ""being yourself"", so it's probably hard for her to think of this as a barrier. But it sounds like it's making her come off as distant, and going out of her way to avoid it smudging off around you. I highly doubt she sleeps with her makeup on when it's just her at home."

"That was done day-of. I don't think either Kacie or I would class this as an emergency. My wife is only leaning on me about Kacie calling him at this point, and for the last maybe 24 hours it has died down for Kacie.

"&gt;Things went back to normal, but the other day while we were texting, he sent me a screenshot of a conversation he was having with this girl at work and told me that she had a thing for him.

""Great! I hope you two are very happy together. BYE.""

He's hurting your feelings on purpose to give himself an ego boost. You gotta throw the whole boyfriend out."
"The problem is that she's put so much stock in this idea of her being the 'perfect mother' that her daughter having to go to counselling (even after sexual assault/ harassment!) threatens a huge part of her identity and self worth. Read: Narcissism. This is why she'd prefer to brush everything under the carpet. 

If your wife doesn't disassociate negative things with Kacie and her self worth, I see Kacie being a frequenter of r/justnomil in the future."

"He's not cheating, because you aren't exclusive.  You see him as your boyfriend, but he doesn't see you that way.  You've even talked about being exclusive, yet you aren't.  I feel like you have two choices: 1\) Stop giving him exclusivity and start dating around...if he wants you to himself, he'll give you the exclusivity you want \(and you may find a guy who actually sees you as a prize\) or 2\)  Cut off sleeping around with him/dating/etc if he refuses to be exclusive.  "
"Sounds like in this scenario you'd prefer your daughter to get pregnant. Withholding life changing information from your teenage child is a far worse offense than someone stepping in and providing information that will help her make the best decision. Don't blame this kid, blame the parents for making it necessary.  

&gt;If it was my 16 year old daughter you did that to, you would never be allowed near her or my family again.

In this scenario it's two years from being out of your control. Sounds like you'd rather cling to control of your children than empower them to make good decisions. I hope you don't have kids"
"Good god. She's SIXTEEN. All he did was give her FACTS, RESOURCES and OPTIONS. As far as his description of it there was no personal opinion, no encouragement, said nothing against her parents' values.

Why are you acting like she's an actual child and as if OP is a totally removed stranger? "

I'm sorry. But I don't think you should accept this ""break"" idea. I think you walk away. Because he's destroyed your trust, and the relationship is over. "
"This is absurd. 

The parents don't love their daughter enough to make sure she's educated and safe when it comes to sex. They're okay with her ruining her life or having to go through getting an abortion (which would probably be traumatising for someone raised religious).  They deserved to have OP ""overstep""  for being shitty people and shitty parents. 
"
"The initial coffee ""meetup"" wasn't a meetup at all.  She framed it as such with you, but let's call it what it was: a date.

Dump her. Move on with your life.  Find someone who loves you, respects you, and appreciates your affection... and doesn't seek it out elsewhere.  Trust me.  That person is out there."
"I've also encountered this situation a bunch, both in prior relationships and with my now husband. My husband now avoids the gender segregation and everyone hangs out as a group. Or, when his friends have kinda shitty SOs, the SO will usually stay home or do something else while my husband and his friend and I go out to do what we like to do. 
In past relationships, one in particular is sticking out in my mind, it was not so nice. I'm not from where I live now and I was dating someone who is. All his friends were long term friends, in long term relationships, so they all knew eachother. I was the outsider to the group, and none of the women had any interest in getting to know me, but all the guys were cool. It ended up being that when we got together I'd join my former BF and the guys, which was okay because I'm a huge tomboy, albeit kinda weird and I'm sure that made the women talk shit even more. 
OP- in your situation it sucks if you have to be 1 on 1 with John's fiance. I'd tell your husband sure, they can come, but it's not your job to entertain her while he hangs out with John, so it's all or nothing. And don't let your husband convince you this is a YOU thing. We've all been through it, and he can't expect you to click with this random girl in the same way you do with your actual friends."
"Look, I'm not Muslim or even remotely religious but I would never post a topless picture of myself on Instagram.

It's a cast iron guarantee that your family will see it, and you'll be judged for it. It's not a strictly Muslim thing. 

It's a ridiculously stupid thing to do. "
"The problem is that it doesn't sound like this is going to be a ""one time"" thing. OP says this dude can't go ANYWHERE without bringing his wife along, and he's really close friends with OP's husband. So my worry is that if she sucks it up this one time then it's going to become a regular thing and now OP is stuck in a situation where she needs to regularly entertain someone she has no interest in befriending. And it's much harder to get out of that situation once you've established a precedent for it than if you just nip it in the bud, ya know?"
"He can’t get upset with you for not offering. You are not a mind reader. Now you’re making him feel bad about being a moocher and he’s trying to say “oh no, I don’t actually want your help! It’s that you didn’t offer that upsets me!” It’s like the equivalent of the stereotype of the woman being upset her bf didn’t read her mind to know why she was upset. The “it’s that you even have to ask why I am upset!” Statement.

Anyway, him trying to say you’re just like a trump supporter or something is another part of the manipulation. 

You guys must work on a budget and your communication."
"It's pretty uncomfortable for a guest to sleep on a couch in a common area, when they don't know the other housemates. Its awkward having to stress yourself out to wake up early because you don't want random walking into the living room and seeing you sleep \(it makes me very uncomfortable anyway\). Also, it's inconvenient for the other roommates. Say your girlfriend's friend wanted to sleep at 11pm, but her roommate wants to stay up late and watch a film in the living room. Do you expect the friend to kick the roommate out of their own living room? Is he supposed to stay there tired for hours? Especially given that your girlfriend has three roommates, it's so much easier for everyone for him to sleep in her room.

If you were uncomfortable with it, you should have said. She seems like she's been upfront and honest and very reasonable. I think this is down to your miscommunication than anything."
"i mean your marriage is probably done either way, but I'd say no. Maybe even take the kids out if you're feeling mischievous. "
That's what OP's saying
Its not faking it. It is perfectly normal for libido to be higher early on in a relationship and for it to slow down after a while. 
"The stereotypes of male virgins, especially past age 20 or so, are not generally positive.  That might be at least part of why he didn't want to tell you.

That's rude. If this woman didn't care about the child people would be saying that she should not take the role of a stepmother if she does not intend to be involved in her life. You can't say they don't mean anything to each other no matter what boundaries she should respect.
"The little girl has had many surgeries with more to come.   The mother does not the added stress of dealing with OP.   That is the trade off OP made by having an affair (or at the very best - getting in deep very quickly with a very, very newly separated man).  There is a stink of infidelity will always be attached to her and her husband.  And the mom doesn't have to deal with it at her daughters hospital bed.
"
"I know how dumb I'm going to sound, but I just never considered that until today.

I don't really consider heavy flirting cheating, and I know he's a big flirt and I haven't minded in the past. But I think with everything else going on this was a bit too much, particularly with the kiss."
The boyfriend had multiple opportunities to realize what he was doing was wrong.  He staked out the bar to make sure he could get to the brother alone.  He only feels sorry because he has some repercussions to his bad acts and he's not being hailed as a hero by his hopefully-soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend.
"I think perhaps you're right. I mean it was a massive industry, nuns sold thousands of illegitimate children to adopting parents in America and none of these mothers (my aunt included) were allowed to know where or who they are. There are graves all over the country where they threw these babies when they died because they weren't baptised, they found a lot of them when Ireland began to build high ways.The nuns were horribly abusive physically too. She probably saw how having sex affected her sister and her mind is still in that place. But I just wished she trusted me more and realised it's not like that now "

"I am really unsure of what vibe i would be giving off that say's that. I am just generally pretty quiet and take everything in at times.

"Sounds like you do mind doing it. If you don’t then it’s not a problem imo. If you do mind, tell him. If he continues to do it after you tell him to stop then it becomes problematic."
"Why would you accuse your wife of being unfaithful? Like what evidence did you actually have as evidence for you to really accuse your wife, who is a new mother for gods sake, of full on cheating? Or were you just paranoid?

I never understand partners who do this. Like they must know they are full of shit the moment it comes out of their mouth because if they ACTUALLY thought the other partner was cheating, they’d be out the door that instant. 

Anyway it sounds like you both hurt each other, but I do stick to this unfaithful accusation because it was particularly spiteful and suggests that you were beginning to really hate, or at least resent, you wife long ago. A separation will be SO GOOD for both of you. Get some space and breathe a bit."

"The mother sounds incredibly neglectful, an IUD would cost money and depo requires being taken in every 3 months.  This does not sound like the kind of mother who would do that."
"I don't know...to me, it sounds like his next paycheck came, but instead of paying OP back (like OP was counting on), he told her he couldn't pay.

&gt; So a couple of weeks ago, my boyfriend found himself in a tight spot and I loaned him $300 to get through. We agreed he would pay me back when he got his next paycheck.

Most pay periods are either twice weekly, bi-monthly, or end-of-the-month, right? In any of those cases, one would expect that he'd have received a paycheck between now and when the loan was given (unless she loaned him money like, immediately after a previous payday).

&gt; I cried today when my boyfriend told me he didn't have the money to pay me back. I was counting on that money to at least pay my credit card bills and buy me some groceries

It'd be a little odd for her to ""count on that money"" if she knew he hadn't been paid yet.

&gt; He kept telling me it was his own fault and that he's a bad person and he made a mistake

Sure, he might just feel guilty for needing a loan in the first place, but it makes more sense if he's received and spent the paycheck he promised her.

His immature communication is obviously a big problem, but it sounds to me like he also flaked on the payment date he promised, which (if true) is also a major issue, since it demonstrates a lack of responsibility and reliability."
"Dang, I just read your other post and was gonna say it sounds a lot like my past experience. I was really touchy with my SO because I wanted her to touch me like that, I just didn’t want to ask.

Good on you for having the conversation and good luck!"
"I think what he was trying to say is that nobody’s perfect and that everyone has their own flaws, which is what makes each of us unique in our own ways - and that is the beauty in it. 

He’s accepting the good and bad in you just as how you’ve accepted the best and worst parts of him and that is what love is about. "
"Thank god someone else said it lol. The whole time I was like this is so fucking cringe. Sure, believe in girls and respect them. Wonderful. But tweeting about it all the time and talking to rando girls and then thinking so0o0o highly of yourself?? God, get a grip. The real respect is shown by smaller actions you don't applaud yourself for. Dump this cringe machine."
"Relationships are about looking out for each other, but at 7 months in I would be leery of anyone who is getting upset with me because I'm not giving them money for things like rides to work and lunches. Yes it would be really nice if he offered go help out here and there, but he is definitely not obligated to and it sounds like he has fairly normal boundaries for this level of a relationship. Maybe he could go about communicating that better, but you shouldn't be expecting him to help you support yourself."
"You're going to ruin the entire relationship with your fixation on having anal sex with someone that doesn't.  Then your only option is to find someone else to do it with, with her consent.  After 5 months you already want to have sex with another person?  Just break up and  be up front with a girl that if she is not into this you don't want to pursuit things with her.  Save yourself and her a lot of trouble"
Keep doing what your doing and NEVER BACK DOWN. Even if you split up (hope not) make sure you continue with vacs and such. Courts will side with you 100% if she decided to fight you on it.
"Yeah, the lack of remorse is pretty chilling. I could forgive a single slap. But, it would have to be accompanied by a lot of remorse."
"Maybe she didn’t like the food enough to want another meal or two out of it. Maybe she’s dieting and didn’t want the temptation of having so much restaurant food in the house. Maybe she was traumatized be being fed only old food by an abusive parent as a kid, or was so poor that eating leftovers was the only way and she gets bad memories about it.  Another poster already mentioned that maybe she wasn’t going straight home and the food would be left I un refrigerated for too long.  Maybe her fridge is full!. Could be a million reasons why she didn’t want to take the food. "

"I doubt she *suddenly* became mentally ill. Maybe whatever it is started before they got married and OP didn’t notice because it was gradual. 

But living with vermin and getting upset when your spouse tries to throw out garbage isn’t a sign of general laziness or the mentally healthy.

In fact, the seemingly sudden change is more of a flag for mental illness isn’t it? Whenever someone starts acting weird and unhealthy out of the blue it’s usually a good idea to direct them to a doctor.

Anecdotally, I lived in similar conditions on top of bedbugs for a year.  When I described it to a therapist after the fact she said the only people she knew who would tolerate those conditions for that long were either addicts or severely depressed. Bingo bango, my SO at the time was an alcoholic and I was suicidal. 

My worry in OP’s case is that she could have to hit a kind of “bottom” to be convinced to get professional help. If she’s in denial about the roaches and mice and ants, plus freaks out when he tries to clean up, it might take more than a conversation to get her to recognize there’s a problem."
I mean if you don't agree on doing something usually you stick to the status quo.  In this case that's no tree.  If she wanted to remove a tree that was already there and he didn't he would win because removal would be a change from the status quo.

"&gt; I know I should be more direct but I kind of feel like I shouldn't have to

Your partner is clearly focused on his own needs in the moment and you need to be more direct to get what you want. If you're worried about it killing the mood then just tell him now, when you're not trying to get in the mood for sex that you need a little more TLC and don't like to just drop straight into the bone zone.

"Your wife is intentionally keeping you isolated so that all you have is her. That's why she wanted you to cut off your family, that's why she doesn't want you talking to any other women, and that's why she doesn't want you to advance your career. 

Your family was right. Your wife is not a good person. You were a depressed teenager when she found you and as a 31 year old woman she had no business pursuing you, but did so anyway. Ignore her insistence that you maintain no-contact with your family. Go talk to them. Listen to them. It sounds to me like they just wanted to protect you from an unhealthy relationship, but unfortunately you've ended up in one. "

I would insist that husband leave the house. "
"OP is behaving like that because her bf has serious anger issues and is abusive.

OP, I will be very upfront with you: your boyfriend is manipulative, abusive, angry and have zero respect for you.

Manipulative - he says that is how things works in relationship you have to abide because he had several while you had none.

Abusive - he physically harmed you. There was bruises and scratches all over your body.

Angry - he shouts, self harm and breaks things when angry. Also a way to manipulate, it's his way to tell you that he is angry enough to smash his stuff and can easily smash you down if you confront him.

No respect - he didn't cared about your safety while you were in an alley alone and drunk, instead he had an angry jealous fit. He doesn't care that he is hurting you through sex. He doesn't care that your aren't being satisfied, heck he doesn't care if you are feeling pleasure or not. He doesn't care about you at all because his only concern is using you for his self pleasure.

He doesn't want to change. He doesn't want to work on his anger issues. You know why? Because he says he's sorry after he abuses and hurts you and you accept it.

He is not good for your mental health at all. He is alienating you, he is little by little destroying you. Do you know what's healthy? Love yourself, respect yourself and say that you are a human being who  needs to be treated better, something he will never do to you. 

GET OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP!! There's plenty of good men out there who will love you and treat you with love and respect. Please OP, love yourself and give yourself a chance to be happy with someone who is truly good and caring and loving."

"I live in a town where we have a ton of huge pine trees around our property.  The first year we moved in, the area was struck by a hurricane and two trees in our yard came down.  The first one missed our shed by less than a foot and the second hit our neighbors house.  While we were working with the insurance companies the neighbor tried to paint us as negligent people who were letting a tree rot in our yard (a tree expert had to come out and verify that the tree was healthy when it fell).  So yeah a tree can be a big deal.  
Also, she pointed out that the placement wasn’t good because of where the tree would be in the winter.  Some trees don’t grow fast and it could get killed by snow over the winter or at the least be affected by road salt and other chemicals that are in the street.  
This post reminds me of the one where the husband was doing things wrong/the super hard way rather than watch a YouTube tutorial with his wife.  When my husband wants to add something to his garden, he researches the species, how much sunlight and water are needed and how compatible they are with other plants.  Some stuff is easy like mystery bulbs from the Lowe’s clearance rack but the tree and shrub he planted took a lot of time and he still babies them a little several years on.  "

BTW your girlfriend is pretty trash. "
"This all said, a likely outcome will be for him to take it down since he already fucked up by getting one without her agreement."
"&gt;If you are just open, honest, and yourself from the get-go, not only will you deter men who would otherwise see you as a ""challenge"" for being so aloof, but you eliminate this feeling of wait what did I do wrong, JUST when I was finally opening up and letting myself fall for him, he isn't into me??? disappointment that you're feeling right now.

Well shit, this just clarified *a lot* in my relationship history..."

"Slave masters regularly fucked their slaves, my guy. Cross-racial forced sex is like...the number one thing invading hordes used to do. 

It’s not anecdotal. At all. "
"and your big sisters are coming by to check on you and you’re upset over that? 

Dude. 15 years ago I (f) was about your age with 2 older brothers who didn’t give a shit to watch over me and regularly got picked on and beat up at school. They are showing up to show the damn bullies that you have people. Again count your blessing, be thankful for the rides and they are willing to help with your homework. 

If you wanna be a big big, grow up and learn to not get pissy at the hands that help you. "
"Even “I find my own opinion to be fact, and hers to be just an opinion”"
"Are you that blind or are you purposely trolling? The DAUGHTER has issues because she thinks that her dad doesn't treat her equally. What, now the daughter isn't allowed to have feelings about her father? ""Stop crying over spilled milk, he only conceived you and then proceeds to play clear favorites against you"".

Read the fucking post again. Even if you take money out of it, it seems pretty clear that the daughter is well aware of the favoritism her dad is showing. This has absolutely fuck all to do with OP."
"Naw I wouldn't say anything, but I'm Canadian and we generally all hate confrontation and just avoid people we don't like. 

She sounds like a classic narcissist. If you tell a narcissist they can't be the center of attention that situation will implode quickly. 

It comes down to weighing the value of her friendship with the effort it'd take to keep her friendship. 

Either way you should make sure everyone involved is on the same page. "
"why would you want to forgive someone who chose deliberately to risk your health?
"
"Because he wants her to babysit this woman, while they have guy time."
"Dude this alone should have been a red flag. Abusive, crazy tendencies aside, he’s still a jackass"
"His friend didn't even know he was invading on their date night- it's not asking too much to call back and say ""dude, I'm spending time with my wife. I'm not hanging out with anyone else tonight"". Or for OP to pick up the phone herself and call him.

There's nothing humiliating about wanting your husband to make things right. "
If he didn't want something like that to happen he should have used a condom.

Exactly this. Sounds like she's asking for validation. 
"What? He's got NOTHING to do with that. These half\-siblings are from a family he did not grown up in. Also, he can't control what his relatives do. His choice would be to accept it and keep them in his life, or to reject it and perhaps lose all family ties. I personally would also go for the former."
Then what’s the issue?
"Especially with this girlfriend referring to the dog as ""their shit"". The poor thing is an accessory to them, not a companion. "
"I love this response. OP, you cannot limit your life for one person, and it's unfair for Stace to put all of the burden on one person."
"Messages and meet-ups are one thing (if they are that close, and are friends) but SEXTING is definitely not. Sorry OP, I agree with the other posters here that your relationship is over. Don’t wake her up or make a big deal, I agree with Vearpentine here about leaving a note and discussing it later. Although I doubt she’d be able to explain her way out."
"This is a very good comment. Please share this with your wife. She is being irrational.

Edit: I am Jewish and my grandfather was a rabbi. I am familiar with the psychology of being part of a persecuted but very special people."
"No-one ""has"" to do anything. All that matters is what you want and what he wants. Chances are those won't align perfectly, and then you talk about it and find a middle ground you're both happy with. If you can't, you're incompatible and split up. "
"Great comment. OP, you sound like a very good and responsible partner who may be a bit blinded by love or naive. You’re better than than your boyfriend, you deserve someone that will love and trust like you do. "
you sleep in the bed you made. own up to it to her 
"It's no ones fault for wanting to go through life as a trusting person, unfortunately you found out the hard way why people say it's ultimately best to have a suspicious mind or at the very least always known what's going on. But I think it's still a good thing to try and give people the benefit of the doubt (within reason), it's at least how I want to go through life. 

I agree with you about OP's guy - I don't think she's as happy as she's trying to pretend to be."
"&gt;  Banning him from our house is off limits.

It's totally ok for you to move out while your brother is staying in your house.  ""It's him or me""  Ultimatums are scary things and you shouldn't make them if you aren't prepared to follow through on them.  But this is a hill that I think is worth dying on. "
"I’m a woman your same age. Amused you think I’m being sexist. I’m pointing out the fact that a female mechanic is a very common male fantasy. Or maybe it is your fantasy to appeal to males. Who knows. This is fake — at LEAST half fake. Congrats if you’re a real engineer, kudos, great job, wonderful. "
"I wouldn’t say it’s ok, it’s a very childish thing, assuming that’s the reasoning"
"Good point. Paying for medical expenses is a common way for people to take responsibility in situations like this. The fact that he didn’t offer to cover all of it shows that he really, genuinely doesn’t think it’s his fault. "
"I had a similar experience. It sounds like the guys at work are just comfortable with you and trust you enough to joke with. As long as you're comfortable with it and they respect your boundaries then there isn't a problem. 

When my bf, now husband, said something about not liking me going out to have a drink with the guys at work I shut that down hard. I reminded him that out of all these guys I am around he is the one I am dating and he only needs to trust me. Trust that I know how to take care of myself and trust my judgement. I never heard another peep out of him about my coworkers/friends. "
"Then don’t. Do what you can. And you really need to start telling people things like “this isn’t up for discussion” and “no thanks” and “I’ll proceed whichever way is best for me”. 

You can’t fix him. And they think that hearing that shit from you will fix him. It won’t. So just do what you need to do for yourself. "
"The thing is, you should do exactly what feels right to you. YOU have been assaulted, insulted, and disrespected. You family cannot wish that away. They cannot ask you to give your brother a second (third, fourth...) chance just because they are. 
You are well within your right to go no-contact with him, and to tell your family that if they can’t respect that they will lose you too."
"Maybe spend the next 6 weeks going to premarital counselling? 

Tbh it can be pretty rude to just chalk up all negative emotions to someone's mental health issues. As someone who has them, I also just feel bad some times and it is not because of my depression. I understand where you think you are coming from, but if she is telling you she is unhappy in the relationship and you are writing it off as part of a pre-existing problem rather than addressing it as it's own issue you are probably making it worse. 

Find out why she is saying it. Listen, actively listen don't listen to just respond. "
