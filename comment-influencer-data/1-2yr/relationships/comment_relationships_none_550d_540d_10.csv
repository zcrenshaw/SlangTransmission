"You've given this 8.5 years.  And nothing has gotten better.  And you deserve better.

It's time to tell the Ex that you're done.  He needs to go.  "

"All I can say is that I'm a woman in my 50's and I still have sex with my husband. I can't imagine that I'm the only woman over 45 that still enjoys sex. Am I in the minority? I don't know, but a life without sex sounds pretty miserable to me.

As for advice, has your wife ever spoken to her OB/Gyn about her lack of libido? Menopause can play havoc on a woman's hormonal system. She could explore medical fixes for those hormonal issues. If she is unwilling to talk to her doctor, then only you can decide if you are happy with the status quo. If not, there are certainly ways you can get your needs fulfilled outside of your marriage. Only you can decide if that is the route you want to take.

"
"&gt; It is incredibly tiring and heartbreaking when every account you give is taken as a lie until proven otherwise, and someone who you would hope has your back snoops through your things and seems to have a passion to find inconsistencies in whatever you say. Why even bother telling and showing how you really feel when your spouse is only trying to find things to use against you in whatever you say? He probably does feel the same about that side job opportunity, as if only your opinion counts.

Except, this is a trust *he broke*. He's apparently lied a lot, including about some major things. And now she's found that he lied about something major again. OP didn't out of the blue start treating her husband as a liar - this is a title he's worked to earn.

&gt; It sure sounded like you put your foot down, and it wasn't quite a discussion.

She pointed that this free side work was too much on top of his other job + family responsibilities. Instead of discussing it like an adult, he just lied to her face and agreed with her. So from her POV, they were on the same page and shared the same opinion - only now she's found they're not, and that he would rather betray her trust and lie to her face, while continuing to overwork himself, than actually articulate his feelings.

It seems irresponsibly naive to flip back around on OP and say it's her fault for treating her husband like a liar, when he's the one still choosing to continue with that behavior.

There's no question couple's therapy is needed here (if OP wants to keep trying with their marriage), to get some healthy communication going again. But the husband should also consider individual therapy, to work through why he defaults to lies with the one person on earth he should be *the most* honest with."
"I know; that's one of the things that really gets me about this whole post. 

If he were out with his friends riding his dune buggy, and her attitude was like ""Wow, I really screwed up. I'm worried that he's not around for me to apologize so we can get on with things, what should I say to make him see that I know I was awful""

But no. She actually says she's ""still upset"" because the joke was ""totally inappropriate"". I mean, ffs. (Also, joke was hilarious, but that's beside the point.) Never mind about a private booth dining experience and a planned trip to Hawaii...she didn't like the stupid joke (which was hilarious). 

What an insufferable cry baby. "
If it wasn‚Äôt for the internet I wouldn‚Äôt believe that narcissists like you exist in real life. 
"Yes, there is a gmail setting that will automatically copy/send/forward emails to another email address if it's set up this way. 

Google automatic forwarding on gmail to figure out how to turn it off. 

Also you should leave him."
Or he has the ex's account set to forward all her email to him. 
You also don't seem to make a habit of being a mature adult about situations. He said it was your *first* gift. Did you not hear him or did you just want to act out?
"My aunt had a retirement baby hoping she‚Äôd have a second boy after an eldest boy and 3 girls close in age. 

Guess who just turned 10? My youngest female cousin. My cousins always say they feel as if they weren‚Äôt fully wanted. It sucks"

Divorce. She's not sorry so don't tolerate that.

"She's enabling her behavior. Even in business situations, once you say yes to a situation like this, the other party will expect this kind of behavior from you in the future. It's a terrible precedent moving forward. You might defuse the situation now, but it'll only lead to something worse down the line. Better now with 100$ than later with who knows how much."
Except it makes it come off like you didn't even bother to read the post in the first place. 
"Honestly, a lot of problems in your life sounds like they're stemming from your wife. She won't ""allow"" this. She can't do this. She won't ""allow"" that. 

I know she's severely sick, but she should be doing and allowing everything to help you with your workload, both at work and at home. "
As someone who has transferred schools many times I also agree with a mid year transition. Another bonus of that would be that your kids will have made some friends to hang out with during the summer months 
"&gt; she has full mobility still.

She is basically a SAH, not a SAHM. Because she does no housework and doesn't help with the kids and doesn't work. What does she do? There are 24 hours in a day and she has full movement, what exactly does she do with all this time? "
She said the contract is up next year in May to June. I mean for someone just happily living life that is not a long period of time but if you are this unhappy and unfree in your day to day life this can seem like an eternity. 
"Ummm does she realize how selfish and disrespectful she's being? This definitely warrants a HUGE discussion and, honestly, this would be a very bright red flag to me..

Try sitting her down and laying it all on the table. If she still has a problem with it, I would definitely postpone until a compromise can be met. If she truly doesn't get it, it might be a bit of a deal breaker. To have her be so selfish as to say that she basically doesn't want your dad to be able to see you get married, how far is she willing to go? Most normal people getting married would see the flaws in actions such as this."
Probably because he knows what growing up fatherless is like. 
Right? I think it's only men who buy underwear for their side pieces : )
He is married now. You need to let him go. It's not respectful to him or his wife to get in the middle of that.
"Yikes. There's a lot going on here. Let's start with the current situation - your brother says he wants nothing to do with your family and your parents are devastated. There is nothing you can or should do about this. It's not your place, for one, and you also sound far from the right person to try to talk to him anyway. Maybe one of your ""more empathetic"" siblings would have a better shot but it's not their place either. Your parents are adults and need to deal with their feelings without a bunch of flying monkeys descending on your brother to force him to get back in line. 

As far as your brother's weight - your parents stocked the house with unhealthy food but pushed sports. That worked for 5/6 siblings. When your parents noticed that their elementary school aged child was ""extremely obese"", what did they do about it? Did they encourage healthier food choices? Look into other ways besides team sports for him to get some exercise? Talk to him about portion size and educate him about why he was gaining weight? You seriously think a child of 7 years should just automatically know that if he chooses not to move his body, he should somehow procure healthier foods for himself or choose smaller portions? Then, when he finally figures out how he can lose weight and feel better and makes progress and you decide that because he rejects your offers to ""help"", he's immature? Where were you when he actually needed help, like in high school or college? Oh yeah, judging him for his interest in computers. "
Hmmm seems like you are behaving like r/niceguys she's not a princess.. shes a person... treat her as such. No one needs to be worshiped on a pedestal. Your realtionship so far is codependent and she sees that now and is trying to escape from it. It's okay to spend time apart and realize your partner isn't a perfect queen
"I agree! My husband is exactly one year younger than me and teases me about how he like older women. 38, and 37 respectfully. "

She could be meaning dark brown.....
"I been to multiple stores that have card/ board game nights and participated in them. I‚Äôve made friends there, like you said, but hasn‚Äôt gone further.I also play at friends houses and they‚Äôll invite new people over sometimes and I‚Äôll meet them. (I‚Äôm actually going to a friend‚Äôs tonight!) 
I‚Äôm not some recluse."
"A normal 21 year old man would not even care a little bit about a 14 year old kid changing. Unless they're absolute weirdos, you can rest assured they aren't having any thoughts about you and probably will only be as awkward about it as you are. Don't worry about it, sports bras cover quite a bit anyway. Just don't bring it up and it'll be cool."
"Also who gives a fuck what an ex liked? That means nothing. If you had an ex who enjoyed being pegged would you blindfold him, strap a dildo on, and surprise him? Hell no! 

He has touched you sexually without your permission on multiple occasions, and at least twice has disregarded your feelings on birth control, resulting in you having to take plan b. I'm pretty sure this all qualifies as sexual abuse! "
"Thank you so much for giving me this advice. It really helps me. I switched schools a lot as a kid and I feel like I did fine, but of course when it's your own kids it's hard to know what's right for each situation. 

Thanks a million :)"
"Apparently from OP's comments, his GF was given the father's mobile number and communicated his role in the arrangement and the father agreed. They got the mother's number after everything was confirmed (or so they thought) and they started babysitting. This was a multi-day gig. So to them, there was no need to reiterate the arrangements because they had already been cleared with a parent. To be honest, now that I've thought some more about it, it seems like it was the husband's responsibility to let his wife know because he *made a decision* when he agreed to let OP join his GF on the baby sitting gig. OP dropped the ball when he responded to the wife's abuse with abuse of his own. He should have just walked out of there and let the husband explain to his angry wife why a random dude was standing in their kitchen cooking. When OP abused the woman, he lost moral ground and that was when everything went belly up. "
Thank you
Or it‚Äôs actually Death in human form... OP has to protect Grandma‚Äôs soul at all costs.
"It's awful that you are shaming OP for not being 'helpful' enough. She literally is a stranger to OP, and she's trying to do right by her. You should be ashamed of yourself honestly "
She's asked a total stranger to put her up for the night. OP has the right to be a bit wary.
"He sounds very controlling.
He's literally making you jump through hoops over and over again and then getting mad at you for not jumping through them correctly... 

Also you should not stay with someone that shames your sexuality. 
@buttchick is right, this all smells of PUA to me, and you don't want to be with a guy like that."
Based off your responses I think you did the right thing by taking the day off. Hope everything gets sorted out.
Masturbating is normal and healthy in a relationship. It‚Äôs like if  he suggested you can‚Äôt eat without him because it‚Äôs selfish and makes him feel like you don‚Äôt like eating with him around. Grow up dude. 
"By trying to jump between them when they were fighting, as far as I understand OP. That's a pretty stupid thing to do and has little to do with either brother losing control. As far as I am cencerned, if they were going to fight, it's better to do so by some kind of rules. Was it a stupid idea to try to solve the problem with fists? Damn sure it was. But they're teenagers, this is such a typically teenage thing to do. If they are serious about boxing, they probably know enough about safety.

To me all of this sounds like it's being blown off out of proportion. I understand OP's  gf's concerns, but at no point while reading about what happened did it seem to me like he is in any danger of losing control just because he is a boxer. Boxing, serious boxing, has rules. Not everyone who engages in competitive sports, or even those deemed ""violent""  (I don't see people decrying karate, or rugby, or what have you) is a fist lashing waiting to snap.

It looks to me like OP's sister got very emotional about the whole thing and ended up getting heard by accident, and OP's gf is mistaking that for purpose or inevitability. Moral of the story: don't jump between two boys who know how to fight.

Edit: not a boxer myself by any stretch, but I understand the mentality of wanting to engage in a ""heavier"" kind of sport/exercise."
"&gt; The ""couldn't you call"" part was really rude of her to say, especially since it's so obvious why she was unable to get through
      
This isn't rude... I get that some families are fine with family, friends, etc just showing up at their door whenever but everyone has different expectations for their home. Not everyone is comfortable with that.   
     
&gt; I currently go to university and it's not uncommon for a lot of people who live on campus to take a spur-of-the-moment car ride back home somewhere in state over the weekend to visit family.
     
And some families aren't okay with this unless there is an emergency. Some people consider this rude. You really can't blame people for feeling this way when cell phones are so prevalent. "
"I‚Äôm sorry my initial formatting sucked. M‚Äôs key card was slid under his (H) door while she was in his room Tuesday night, by the very person H told me had hooked up with M that night (coworker D). "
"Yep. I've found my BF's mom's *bra* in my stuff. (And yes, I absolutely believe it, it was about the right size and a very matronly style.) And mystery socks are always coming and going."
"&gt;&gt; I have a habit for saying what's on my mind without a moments notice, lately that's been manifesting as me saying 'ooh that's a bit of a rough photo honey' or 'you look fine and nice'. 

So what's on your mind IS that she looks rough, and you blurt that out. You could examine your thought patterns to figure out why what's on your mind is the stuff of jerkishness and not kindness."
"It sounds like by ""spontaneous"" he actually means ""I only want sex when I initiate it, not you."" ""Spontaneous"" translates to ""spontaneous to him."""
"Not sure if you missed it, but i have noticed everyone who thinks the OP's SO should be doing the heavy lifting and sucking everything up ... tend to not notice that this has been going on for between 2.5 to 3 YEARS already.  Not to mention the questionable and erratic explanation the OP gives for where her time goes always seems to be missed or ignored.  

In all honesty, do you really think that the OP's SO hasn't probably discussed all of this with her over the last 3 years?  Given the OP's reaction to any questions that she isn't being 100% truthful, her inability to even conceive of a balance in her life, or that her SO could rationally not have any more in the tank to give to her ... do you really think her statements provide a reasoned and rational assessment of the situation?  "
"^this. As much as we want, closure is something we give to ourselves."
"This is a really heartfelt response, thank you. What stuck out to me was ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have to feel like you‚Äôre nagging someone when you tell them how you feel‚Äù and pointing out that I *do* feel lonely sometimes. "

"If she's fighting really hard to justify it, it's likely because she's been doing it a while now, and doesn't want to feel guilty for it."
"&gt;my bf proposed because I was upset 

this will end well."
Correct they either all get invites and they don‚Äôt. Are both sets of brothers still upset by it? I was always under the impression that once dudes fought they got over shit real quick.
" Yeah, love how everyone's heart is flowing with empathy over this guy's heartbreak from when he was 25, but OP being insecure (that he doesn't wanna marry her because of some long ago ex's actions) is soo ridiculous... "
"Holy extinction burst Batman!

IANAL but I would keep records of everything sent to you, ask your work for a copy of CCTV if they have MIL acting crazy on it and document everything in case this escalates further. It might not but better safe than sorry z "
"&gt;but marriage is too much of a commitment

Well hold on, he didn't say anything about commitment.  According to OP:

&gt; He's always told me he doesn't see the point in getting married, as it was just an expensive piece of paper.

FWIW I am married and do believe in marriage...I don't agree with OP's SO, just pointing out that I don't think we can assume he is avoiding marriage due to an aversion to commitment."
"Wow, I‚Äôve never thought of it that way. Thank you so much. "
"I hate this often-unwritten societal rule that in order for women to be ""sweet"", they need to be doormats. Like Warren Jeffs and his ""keep sweet"" thing. But it's much more pervasive than that."
It's called communication. You should never expect a person to just read your mind. 
"&gt; I can tell she would be a great mother 

Dude, you are delusional. Having kids never calmed an abusive woman dow - it just given them more targets.

"
Also the service provider may also have copies that need deleting. I found out the hard way how thankful I am that my ex's mom doesn't know how to login because there were some explicit photos of me that way. (I'm hoping the brother didn't see anything either üòë)
"I'm low on funds right now but I wish I could give you gold for your response. 

OP, I feel like you give yourself too little credit for the successes you've accomplished. A good partner wouldn't make you feel like your career choices and financials are inadequate. Given what you wrote, your partner should be nothing but proud of you and should know by now that you can make sound decisions by yourself, as a competent adult. His behavior mirrors an abusive cycle (he lets his anxieties get the better of him, you suffer, he apologizes, but then repeats the very actions that upset you before - wash, rinse, repeat), and I think *you* could do better. I think that he could potentially improve but it would require the he undergoes therapy to manage his extreme anxieties over earning potential and his controlling behavior."
They've been together one year and they have a newborn. It's basic math. 
"They weren‚Äôt selfies if that‚Äôs what you mean, they were photos that he took during sex, that I didn‚Äôt even know existed , I only knew I was sixteen in them because I didn‚Äôt have the tattoo I got when I was 17 in them "
"On the one hand, there is some grey area here, where if your partner isn't in a good mood for a good reason, they aren't going to be their normal even keeled self, and that can affect the relationship.

But, the thing that makes your BF's behavior troubling is that it's ongoing and repeated, and the fact that he always jumps to you being the direct source of his problem. That's really indistinguishable from straight up emotional abuse. You're walking on eggshells, never given the benefit of the doubt, etc.

As far as how to stay strong, remember that actions speak louder than words. If all he did was apologize, and never called a therapist, or expressed a full understanding of what he is doing (not just apologizing), and the biggest tell: It keeps happening again and again and again. Then you know he's just trying to do the minimum to keep you in the relationship, and doesn't have much interest in your honest feedback or in actually fixing his problem. If he's still blaming his life for his actions and only apologizing, you're doing the right thing."
"100% this. 

""""Things seemed great she was excited planning and getting ready for the wedding up until about 3 weeks ago. She started to go out more to bars and distance herself and seemed not interested in spending time with me or anything else.""""

There's someone else. at some level. not gonna let go of your branch until the new ones solid enough to hold her though. "
"Literally the only nice thing you've said about her is that she's hot.  You haven't provided a single positive attribute other than that.  What exactly do you love about her?

"
"Exactly, if you're in debt you may be comfortable but you are not in a good situation. "
Taking it like a real man. Kudos my friend!
"I feel like they are using your house for an air bnb since they asked, you didn't invite them. They really shouldn't expect free meals too. BUT since they are friends go ahead and cook for them if you wish. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or expensive, you shouldn't be trying to impress them.

Its pretty easy to cook without a lot of salt, spice, or processed food. Try some stir fry, three pans, one veggies, second  meat and last rice. Very few people will refuse to eat at least two of those combinations and you can leave the sauce/salt/ seasoning to the side for everyone to add as they wish. This is one of my go-to meals for company. Its cheap, doesn't take long especially if they help chop veggies, and I can get nearly everyone to eat it. The kids who hate veggies just get meat and rice, the vegetarians just get rice and veggies, anyone that doesnt like rice can skip that.  And if they won't touch any of it I hand them a stack of local delivery menus and tell them they are on their own. 


To keep them from eating stuff they shouldn't, write on it ' do not touch ' and if they do then they don't  stay again. "
"You're trying to control her and you shouldn't do that.  

Here's why.  

You can't mind-control another human being. If she's the type that's going to cheat on you, then forbidding her from talking to XYZ people isn't going to change that. A disloyal woman is a disloyal woman, regardless of how many rules and regulations you place into the relationship.  

To make matters worse, by trying to control who she talks to, you're going to _increase the chances_ that she cheats. Why? Because she'll start feeling suffocated by you. She'll start looking at you as a pathetic and insecure person who's holding her down.  

Instead, it's time to pick.  

If you don't want to stay in a relationship with a former-cheater, then break up with her. Wish her the best, and find someone who hasn't cheated before.  

If you want to stay with her, then sit her down and talk to her about how you're feeling. She's your partner afterall. The two of you should be able to work together to make a plan such that you can strengthen the foundations of your relationship. Why? Because in a secure and happy relationship, people don't ""get mad"" about their girlfriends texting gifs to other guys.  

Good luck."
This is quite chilling.
"Yeah man, exactly.  That's why this whole thing is really fucking suspicious to me..."
"This. You need to accept that, honestly, here reasons for hating you are actually entirely valid. Its possible to make amends, but to do that you need to sit down and say ""we've tiptoed around this for too long: the way things came about wasn't the mature way to go about it and that rests solely on us. I know this isnt an ideal situation for you, but I'd like us to take steps to try and make things better now"".

Suggest both family therapy, and individual therapy for her if you're able to: situations like this are exactly what it is for, and frankly, if the kid wants it, your partners feelings don't come into it: going to family therapy is reparations for you both destroying her family.

Also talk to your partner about easing up: she's a teenager, teenagers tend to let manners slip and tend to be difficult. Boundaries are great, but your partner needs to temper any punitive action with the knowledge that to his stepdaughter, living there is already inherently punitive.

Finally, when it comes to how she is with you on your own, I think you're already pretty aware that challenging her properly is a terrible decision when it's verbal, but you can still be assertive and say ""I won't be spoken to like that. I recognise that you're angry with me, and if you want to talk in a civil manner, we can"". If that doesnt work, talk to your husband, have him talk to her (not aggressively, and not at her) about it being the difference between closeness and civility. She doesnt have to be nicey-nice (and honestly, civility is possibly the best you should hope for in the mid-term) but being its a life lesson for her: sometimes you have to be civil to people you dislike."

"Well, what she's telling him isn't helpful because it discounts his reality, and his perspective is objectively valid.

He's not a schizophrenic in the midst of an episode, ranting that the government is tracking his every move.  He's a trauma victim, and a young one at that, mourning the loss of his old face.  He is facing reality, and his reality is pretty grim right now.

OP is in a very tricky situation and couldn't possibly be expected to know how to handle it without having any experience with this sort of thing.  But she should do some reading on how to be a supportive person to someone in her boyfriend's situation."
"Yeah, but he's not a kid. "
"Yikes I would be getting the heck out of there to be honest.  This would be a big giant no for me.

"I will admit that I'm biased because I don't think it's wise to consider moving for someone you're not *firmly* engaged to. Moving for someone you're just dating, with 0 protections, is risky, at best. Especially when you already have so many concerns about relocating

I do believe that their feelings and history so far is indicative of, well, an impasse. And I'd strongly encourage her to not move somewhere for a BF if she were my friend IRL, and definitely not condone him not moving for a woman he's dating. Imo, this is exactly what the word ""impasse"" means"
"Yup! When I lived abroad, it was commonly said that at about 6 or 7 months in, everyone hits a wall where they get really frustrated with how different the new place is and all you want to do is go home. A lot of people talked about the touch (or lack of touch) thing during this time. Totally normal, but very painful when you're going through it. Eventually you get over the wall, though, so to speak..."
"There's a diff between dating someone who sees their kid once a month and moving to a whole different place to be with the kid all the time. It can be a deal breaker tbh. Life happens, things change. "
"I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is like ‚Äúoh he said he jerks off into them. No big deal! Move along.‚Äù Why is she the devil if she asks to see his phone? Why is he automatically off the hook? Why is this an entire box of condoms and one wrapper?? Why did he not tell her he jerks off into condoms? Why hasn‚Äôt she found any at their house? Why does he only jerk off into condoms when he travels?

It just seems way more likely that he met someone and she made him buy condoms and he did. "
"Putting everything else aside, isn't it odd that she wants you in the wedding but you don't get a plus one? I'm no super familiar with wedding etiquette but do you think they are trying to hide who you are for the day? "

I would imagine her problems stem from her husband fucking a co worker- but that‚Äôs just a guess üòÇ.    Her money is an issue Bc she is apparently patient and very well planned this since he said he wouldn‚Äôt cut off the other woman.   She‚Äôs been collecting evidence to use against him.       It doesn‚Äôt really sound like he has much choice regarding the divorce.    His wife gave him the option of ending the relationship and he chose the other woman.  I‚Äôm not sure why he‚Äôs acting like he‚Äôs shocked she did it.  She gave him an ultimatum and followed thru with it 
"Well, yes, they actually are. Luckily I've set up a plan to leave, I just gotta wait it out for now. We are taking precautions so they won't find me."
"I'm sure he doesn't realize the position he's putting OP in--that's why he needs it bluntly spelled out.

I have to wonder if Dave is Brian‚Äôs life partner but is refusing to publicly acknowledge  that while stringing along OP. I personally would have left along time ago. 
Yes. I know we need to start that back up again. I think we both felt like things were back on track and we let it fizzle out.

"I don't think his reaction would be appropriate in case she forgot something, very childish unless something truly serious happened. Forgetting something doesn't warrant this reaction imo.

"Another option would be to sleep apart on the nights where you have to wake up earlier for work or something that requires a good nights sleep (in addition to all that /u/Sexandcheesecake has pointed out). 

Have you tried using earplugs or headphones with white noise?

There may be some out there specifically for sleeping but don't take my word on it!"
"&gt; Sadly, I think I am willing to.

Don't feel guilty about that. Your wife has betrayed you immensely by having what sounds like a sketchy, borderline-inappropriate friendship(?)/fantasy ""bond"" shit with this guy and she is prioritizing a relationship with him above your marriage and above your parent-child relationship with your son.

My heart breaks for you. When your son finds out the truth, remind him that you're still his dad and nothing will ever change that.

At this point, I would insist on marriage counseling if the marriage is going to continue. "

"It is incredibly abnormal for a 4 year old to be transferred to the custody of a man who isn't proven to be the father, that she has never met, just because the mother said 'send my kid to him'. In any normal situation the child would be given to the mother's parents or another close family member. Even if none of those people were alive/suitable it would be more likely that the child would be put into foster care until there is proof of paternity, a home inspection, etc. I'm not sure who is telling you this stuff but I don't think this kid is gonna be moving in with you anytime soon."
If you showing emotion about a heavy subject makes him dump you- that's a good thing. You need a partner that can support you through tough emotional times. 
"Therapy.

It's called ""projection"" -  a psychological defense mechanism, where you attribute to others your own bad behaviour or thoughts or emotions.

Of course with his history, just because you are projecting, doesn't mean he ISNT cheating"

"&gt; . If she's always had an anger issue I think that is certainly something to address

This is why it's important to read the entire post from the OP:

&gt; She was like this when she was about to have her period before she was pregnant, but I could weather it happening once a month, and just knew roughly when I should limit contact with her, but when she's pregnant it's constant.

Which is why I don't think your post is good advice.  This isn't just a pregnancy thing.  

No one should have to sit and deal with the nonsense OP seems to have put up with for the entirety of their relationship.  He mentions that she's got some baggage from a failed marriage in which her prior partner was a serial cheater, and it sounds like she needs to sit with a professional to deal with this.  Even just once a month around her period, it's not OK, but it's ESPECIALLY not OK for OP to have to sit and deal with this frequently right now.  

This is something that potentially needs the help of both a mental health professional and a medical doctor.  But whatever the case, even if she's hormonal, it's not healthy to continually dredge up the past, and to take out her own insecurities on OP.  "
"I don‚Äôt want to downplay your concerns but I was expecting a lot worse to be honest. I think a lot of people do these things. Especially in their 20‚Äôs. Heck, I knew a guy that did hard drugs from ages 20 to 26 when he quit. He‚Äôs still doing fine."
OP commented long before your comment that she was on the phone with the radio host. So you were misunderstanding what you read. Live radio show just means not prerecorded. She phoned into a live radio show. It was never anywhere close to happening.
For most people those habits will lead to a shorter and more unhealthy life. Yeah everyone has an anecdote about someone that has bad habits and lives long but that doesn't make smoking healthy.
"Be cautious about telling her what you ACTUALLY think, as she may get defensive. Instead, draw her out. ""I noticed you don't go out as much since you're with him, what's that about?""

"&gt;But I also know that people can get better with the right therapy and be high-functioning

In that they aren't suicidal and can hold jobs? Yes. But it still has lifetime-long impacts on relationships. My BPD mother and sister have been in therapy a combined 75 years and they are still very volatile and still embrace learned helplessness.

Why would you believe somebody who says that they are improving when there is literally no evidence to back that up? 

Take an afternoon and go to a caf√© and sit and think about what you picture for your own life. What are your dreams for your relationship? Family? Home life? Career? And take a look at your current relationship and see whether you are handicapping all of those dreams for your one and only life by remaining.

You may find some good support and further advice at /r/bpdlovedones and /r/cptsd. For what it's worth, your GF's behaviors sound much closer to CPTSD than BPD."
"Don't bother.  He doesn't care enough to use a trash can. He knows YOU clean up after him like a child and he likes it that way. Why does he deserve another moment of your time and effort? Any 'talk' you have with him will be a one sided conersation to ease your own feelings. Its talking to a wall. The best you can expect is guilt and anger from him. 

You know you wouldn't leave if he would only use a fucking trash can and not be a disgusting excuse for a human. The bare minimum he cant be bothered to do. 

Just go. No explanation necessary. He already knows and doesn't care."
She needs to get thyroid testing. thyroids can make you gain and make you lose if they are severely out of whack. hyperthyroidism should be ruled out before you start looking at diet. 
No wtf? There's no way he probably even wanted to snuggle with her after he just got rejected. He was feeling hurt and upset. I highly doubt he was doing it to punish her.
"&gt; Well, his latest issue is that he wants my Nexplanon removed, and he wants me to go on the pill instead, where he keeps the pill pack in his possession and gives me one every morning so he can watch me take it.

This is textbook controlling behavior. This is early-stage abuse. This is not going to get better. You should get away fast. Every day you spend getting more attached to an abuser makes it more difficult to extract yourself when you realize you need to. Abuse doesn't need to be deliberately malicious to be abusive."

"You don't have to have bargaining power.  All you need to do is ask.  See if they have another special.

"I made an account just to reply to this, OP please read this! I was in your shoes two years ago. Almost exactly identical. I had just come out of an abusive relationship where I was sexually mistreated and physically hurt. My next boyfriend was like yours - we loved each other so much, I felt like he was my soulmate, but he seemed to have no desire for me and could never climax. 

It made me feel so insecure, and his constant reassurance that he desired me made me feel crazy. After a year I forced the issue and asked him to go to the doctor. He said it wasn't a medical issue, but that he really wasn't attracted to me. We broke up. I was absolutely devastated, and it really messed up my self-esteem (which was already low from the previous abuse). I'm in therapy right now and it is helping so much! It's been two years since we broke up, I've had normal relationships in that time, and am so much happier than I ever was with him. 

I stayed with him because he made me feel safe after the abuse, but there are so many wonderful men out there who will both desire you and make you feel safe. Please get yourself into therapy, and I know it sounds painful and impossible but please consider leaving this relationship."
"Wanna chime in here with everyone else and let you know that you made the right decision.

Yeah, this only counts when it's an event that actually requires a plus one, like a wedding. Otherwise it sounds like he's manipulating her into never being able to do anything without him."
"&gt;And practically speaking, the only consequence you can dole out is decreasing the time you spend with her and being clear about why you are doing it.

That makes a lot of sense. I will start doing that and letting her know exactly why, and see if it makes a change.     

&gt;She is not being a rebel, she is being hateful, and it will eventually (if it hasn‚Äôt already) eat into your, your husband‚Äôs and your children ‚Äòs self-esteem.

Yes, it's really upsetting and hurtful. I think in her heart of hearts she feels like my parents forced me to settle and I wasted all my potential, and she takes it out on my husband. But I keep telling her I am happy! I don't feel like I settled on anything, my life is great.

"Go back to counseling.

I think it's totally normal to talk to a trusted friend about relationship problems. It's ok to admit that a marriage takes a lot of work.

If she's gotten to a point where she suspects you're cheating and has gone to extraordinary measures to snoop, it makes me wonder if the trust is really there anymore. Is she ""really happy"" about the relationship if she doesn't feel like she can have a conversation about why you've been acting weird?"
"Him flipping out because you didn't immediately take his advice really doesn't have anything to do with your birthday or his lack of consideration generally for you. By what you say he often does this, I am going to guess he just doesn't like you questioning his authority, particularly in front of other people. He did the typical anxious gaslighting response as well: suggested you were too sensitive when he was screaming and ranting over it as if that isn't emotional meltdown territory. 

Really reflect on that. I don't think that it matters what day it is, you expressed a concern and he had a meltdown. Is that a pattern? It seems like it is his innate response, especially as he is trying to make you the bad guy. It being your birthday makes it all the more painful, but if this is who he is he needs therapy to deal with his emotions because clearly he can't handle much.

"I think it depends. Do you ever go to their place? If they've cooked for you in the past then it's fair to cook for them. 

Also, if their are intentions are only to have a free place to crash for event they are going to (that you aren't going to), I think it's fair if you don't want to cook for them.

If you invited them because you are friends and you genuinely want to see them, then yeah you should cook for them. 

Generally when I go with my bf to stay at a relatives place because we have a conference to go to, I will maybe drink some wine but I don't expect the host to cook. When I go to my friends place to hang out for the weekend, I would expect him to at the very least pick a restaurant to go out to. Maybe not necessarily pay.  "

A few will even video call with the partner and be asked to video us too so the partner will know with whom they go. Not uncommon too, some men will ask me to step aside from the view until the call is finished because the wives will give them hell if they know they had dinner with a woman present.

Also, while more people in Texas are conservative, I very rarely hear them talk about it outside of Facebook. I've never really been forced into a political conversation with anyone under the age of 60. And like u/TatteredTabi said, Dallas itself is blue, and plenty of the young people in DFW are pretty woke. 

That being said, while Dallas doesn't have great scenery, there is a lot to do! I'd recommend taking a evening to explore the nightlife while you are there on a business trip before you before you write it off completely.

"They *SHOULD* be removed by a doctor, but *can* be removed through other means. It's actually sometimes recommended to regularly check the position of your IUD to make sure it's still sitting in the correct position just as a normal precaution.

My gynecologist also told me a story while she was asking how short I wanted the wires trimmed. She'd heard of a woman who's abusive boyfriend discovered her IUD, and infuriated, ripped it out. She used that to segue into how women who are getting an IUD on the DL have the option to have the wires trimmed so short that they're essentially undetectable.

So i say no to potential friends and plans. Birthday comes, he doesn't reply or answer a single text or call all day until 8 or 9 pm that night. Finally replies to me with ""hey, sorry but I'm hanging out with friends all day instead, I'll try to give you a call in the morning!""

* While he didn't specifically tell you his age, he hasn't tried to hide their relationship from you
* Her behavior doesn't seem to have changed, and she has been respectful and honest with you
* His mom seems honest and above board
* If he's recently gotten out of the military (sounds like he may have just finished a 5 year term in?) he's probably a bit behind his peers in terms of dating (closer to your daughter's experience), *and* is more responsible than most of them
* He is in the same life stage as her despite age - working and about to start college"

"Lapsed Catholic here, the one who takes my MIL to church when she's in town visiting us.

It's easier to stay seated during communion.  There are many reasons why people don't go up there and it's not going to cause all eyes to be upon you if you sit that one out.  There will be others- Catholics included- who may be sitting out, maybe because they didn't fast prior to communion or didn't go to confession.  It's nobody's business and nobody really comments on it.  I sit out when I take my MIL and nobody blinks an eye.

Prayers are usually conveniently printed on sheets in the racks on the pews- the words that I memorized as a kid were changed up a bit after I left and I need to use the ""cheat sheets"".

"I agree. I would not go through with being a bridesmaid for this, I would feel like I am enabling her behaviour.

"I think you need to trade in the whole lot. I'm so sorry they are turning this into a weapon against you and shaming you along the way, not that the shaming appears to be anything new. And the way they've made you the butt of the joke is disgusting. 

It can be a fine line to walk when someone is concerned about a loved one's health, and I encourage you to focus on your health and make some goals relating to weight loss, but you aren't a project and it's absurd to use the baby as a pawn to get their way. You may be obese but you are still a person and perfectly equipped to be a loving, supportive uncle and a good role model. They want to diminish you down to being defined by your size - you deserve better than that. 

I strongly suggest getting some space from all of them. Don't let them think this behavior is acceptable. If they want to play this game they'll lose their relationship with you - they should. Losing the weight and making healthy choices would be awesome, and when you do you should tell them you can't be around them until they improve themselves. "
"Yep. There are peer reviewed scientific studies demonstrating that shaming and negativity have the OPPOSITE EFFECT if you are trying to motivate an overweight person to lose weight. Even if OP does need to lose weight, it's completely beside the point of how shitty his family is acting. "

If he goes through with his threat to sue you and you receive a summons to court SHOW UP TO YOUR COURT DATE or you could get an automatic judgment against you for failure to show, meaning you‚Äôd have to pay him for your ticket and for his court fees. Chances are he‚Äôs not gonna sue you but keep that in mind just in case. I would bring any documentation discussing your travel arrangements and evidence of his harassment after your trip. "

We had 3... the official county court ceremony with immediate family, then we rented a cabin in the woods with our close friends and family, not until about a year later did I take my wife to my home country for a traditional wedding ceremony with my mother and her side of the family.  Bonus that my wife was already too pregnant for them to kick her out for being too culturally the polar opposite of them ;)"

&gt;Yeah, I'm not interested in relationships at all. I don't think I will get married or have kids. I will consider showing them my budget.

As well as saying you never have people over.  So you probably are on the extreme side of the minimal movement, and going from talking about wanting to be rich to incredibly minimal is going to be a shock for people who haven't been living in your brain this whole time.

"You should consider looking into aftercare programs at elementary schools.  Your skill set would be extremely relevant, the hours are pretty light (usually 2:00-6:00 at most, with some flexibility) so it wouldn't interfere with your other commitments and you'd still get done at a decent time, it looks even better on a resume than babysitting, and it can also lead to additional babysitting opportunities.  And the best part is, speaking from experience, it's a really fun job!  You supervise kids, help them with homework, and basically play with them... obviously there's some disciplining and cleaning up after them involved, but I've always found that kids I watched at aftercare were even better behaved and easier than when I'd watch those same kids babysitting.  This was probably one of the most fun jobs I ever worked... and they definitely never lowered my salary."
"Thanks. I appreciate your feedback.  As a person who cries at movies and operas, it is difficult to not be haunted by this situation every day.  My daughter, my youngest son, and myself have talked and talked about it.  We are all hurting, and my youngest son was almost killed and went through not only physical hell with his horrific injuries, but he is crushed emotionally knowing that his brother doesn't care a fig about him.  His older brother came to the hospital one time to visit.  It was awkward, he had brought his GF - whom he had neglected to tell the extent of his brother's injuries.  She left the hospital room and burst into tears in the hallway - she was literally shocked.  My oldest son had tried to play it off as a ""broken arm"", but, when the truth of seeing the younger son in the trauma unit with multiple serious injuries - not to mention his cut face (considered minor, superficial), casts and IV drips, not to mention his pain, it was a shock to her.  I was not surprised that my oldest had pulled this crap, too.  I quietly got up and asked them both to leave, as my oldest son was lingering WAY past visiting hours, talking BS, and basically being a sociopath right out of a textbook.  It was the last time I saw either of them.  Thinking back on it makes me sad and sick to my stomach that he is such a scary, heartless person.  His own grandmother said he should be in jail for this. I agree."

Looking after kids is hard af and just because mum does it for free doesn't mean anyone else should have to unless they volunteer. Maybe...MAYBE if OP was Jaiden's Grandparent I would understand Jean thinking the care was free, but she agreed on a price and had a tanty, she knew exactly what she was doing and it pisses me right off AS A MF MOTHER

Because her wording made it clear it was vindictive on her end.
"I‚Äôm seeing s couple of possibilities here:

1. In the beginning, your girlfriend was completely wowed by how much effort you would put in to make her happy. But as time goes on &amp; you‚Äôre still doing it, it‚Äôs starting to lose its magic. Instead of feeling like she has a partner that is his own person, she‚Äôs feeling like she has an attendant that‚Äôs just waiting for the next thing he can do to please her. Big gestures that throw caution to the wind are great in movies, but in real life, most people don‚Äôt want a partner that would mess up his own long-term just to make a big gesture. 

2. At this point in the relationship, she is unable or unwilling to reciprocate the amount of effort you‚Äôre putting in, so she‚Äôs wondering if her feelings are as strong as yours. "
"&gt;  she's self-aware of the situation.

She's definitely aware that if she pushes the issue too hard before they get married, she could lose this extremely lucrative and gullible meal ticket she's been cultivating. People who want to work do it, they don't vegetate on the couch for 9 months talking to other people who also refuse to work. I mean she even let this guy pay her student loans and other debts while she just loafed around, that's pretty shameless."
"I am definitely not what she is used to.  She has stated many times that I treat her better than anyone ever has. 

I think she has run in circles or pretty abusive men and her mom and family life was terrible growing up.  I on the other hand have only been in one relationship that led to a 16 year marriage and recent divorce.  She has been in many relationships and is very used to getting what she wants.   I have had a very hard time making sure she does not run me over on occasions.(figuratively).  Thanks all for your help.  

I have been trying to show her what I think healthy relationship should be (I am not an expert) like and she thinks and wants us to be madly passionately in love and thinks all I am used to is a ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù. 

I think she is used to high drama highs and lows and I am the same all the time.  I do not play into drama what so ever.  

Thanks for the help.  "

"I gotta say some of OP's defensive replies makes him sound like a moony teenager.

""It's not about sex. It's way more. It makes me so happy to hold her hand. Banging is great but it's not even about that.""

It's like OP has no concept of how complex relationships are. Even if 2 people sincerely love each other relationships still typically require work. If you've been in a relationship you *should* already understand this. Keeping a relationship together is about respect and communicating effectively. It's imperative to be able to respect each other and discuss any potential issues thoroughly to make sure there's no resentment building. It's consistent work especially after the honeymoon period.

OP's also trying to move in with this girl and there's zero external pressure. It's not like they live far apart and the travel is a strain. It's not like they need to live together to secure a visa. It's not like her culture requires this or the relationship cannot continue.

So why? OP's got the perfect set up now. The only thing moving in together will really change is it will deprive the 2 of them the option to have privacy from each other. And that's very significant.

OP's *only* reason is ""I'm smitten with her and I enjoy her time"". 


OP you got a great thing going with this girl. Just keep it going and make a better effort to get to know each other.

Honestly, I'm flabbergasted that you've been dating her for 6 months and still don't even know her exact age. Like, damn, you guys REALLY need to work on the communication. I don't care if she's alien. 6 MONTHS should get you some basic info like age or birthday.

I would say move in when you 2 mutually reach a place where it truly makes sense on all levels. Otherwise I think it's very shortsighted. 

Also, I think it's a terrible idea to secretly learn Mandarin. The best way to learn a language is to immerse yourself in it. You literally have each other to elevate your language and communication skills (desperately needed) and yet you're opting to say yum yum and num num instead of speaking actual Chinese."
"She's abusive.  She's going through a nice phase now, but the next bad phase will always come.  She's not going to stop - note how she blames PMS for her abusive behavior and blames you for ""setting her off,"" instead of taking responsibility for her actions and changing.

You gotta leave.  She's never going to change - she's just gonna get better at blaming you and lying about how she's totally gonna change, while escalating the abuse."
She was abused for 10 years and you thought she was fine!? Jesus.
"Your dad is my hero.  I mean, I can understand why your mom wanted to keep the peace and not have your dad get in trouble for yelling in a hotel hallway but here's the thing:
If you babysit for free that won't make the situation less tense.  Your aunt did a shitty thing.  That's why everyone's upset.  As for the family helps out thing, this can be true, like I help out my siblings by paying them $10 to clean and babysit for me.  And sometimes they help.me out by watching kids for free, after they've offered and we've communicated and it's a win win for ever one. Jeans assumptions, disrespect and manipulations are not what it means to be family and it's not the first second or third time she's done this.

The adults will recover. Ask your grandpa to tell you stories about things he's into.  Enjoy, hug your dad.    "
Also men's shirts get so soft after a few washes. Women's stuff stays... Stiff.
"&gt; if you two are happy with your relationship that's all that should matter.

THIS ^^^ Comparing yourself to other family members = family drama and separation. NEVER COMPARE YOURSELF OR THE KIDS

I know this for a fact because my mom had 1 sister and life was a competition, I lost out on relationships with my aunts 4 kids because of this. It's disgusting and no one should lose out on family relationships for petty arguments and competition."
"Whoa, no one called you a false martyr. Too, no one is assigning you as much culpability and responsibility as you are to yourself here. You just listed all of the shit that you do--why? Are you looking for validation from the reddit community that you do enough? Well you have it, in fact, most people here think you are doing too much. The tl;dr isn't that you are an asshole, it's that you are so much of an altruist that *you are allowing yourself to waste away alongside your sister*. 

Take a bubble bath (or whatever your comfort regimen is) and try and think what advice you would give to a friend in this situation. Figure out a way to have compassion for yourself in a way that equates to doing *less*, not doing more. "
"&gt; and if I don‚Äôt tell him no he‚Äôll mostly reach for his phone and look at porn again when there‚Äôs a break in the action, or ask me if he can use his phone while I‚Äôm giving him head, etc

What the fuck.

I would find this extremely hurtful. Have you talked to him about what those actions communicate to you?"
"That wasn't OP, I think they were just trying to tell you that OP and his bf are both men."
"If you have no other reason to suspect her (like she's cheated in the past, or has betrayed your trust in some way) and something this trivial sets you off, you got insecurity issues. Full Stop.

If you think it's 100% normal for an otherwise wholesome relationship's foundational trust to crumble over something THIS innocuous? you got insecurity issues. And that's really unfortunate. Because that sounds exhausting.

And I'm not saying this is the case for OP. Maybe she has cheated in the past and is leaving it out the post. And maybe this informs her BF's behavior. THAT would constitute a better justification for the suspicion. But we're only dealing with what she's given us.

You can disagree all you want but this is what the downvotes are basically saying. Your stance is that this constitutes ""valid reason"" to suspect cheating. This community is saying ""no, this is a completely innocuous situation turned ugly because of a dude's insecurity""."
This. Honestly some people just aren‚Äôt cut out for committed long term relationships and it sounds like she‚Äôs one of them. Just do yourself a favor and cut her out
"&gt; He said every invite to M was him (H) speaking for D.

I can't believe he used an excuse so juvenile only a teenager would try it. ""I swear baby it wasn't me, I didn't sleep with her. I know it's my phone but I was texting her for my friend."" LMFAO!

Why would she still be texting your husband the next morning to ask about a big bruise on her thigh, if she just finished fucking D a few hours ago? Wouldn't she have his number by now to contact him directly or is he trying to say they fucked in his bed too? "
"No offense to this guy, and I'm sure he'll want to be there, but things can change and people can leave. You need to make sure that you're stable, in all those areas I previously stated, by yourself. Because you never know when you could be by yourself.

**Edit**: How do you know you *want* this guy in your life or in this child's life? Do you even know him? What are his views on raising the child? Do you have differing values/cultures/religions? There's more to just saying ""I want to be there."""
"Honestly it sounds like you two have never spent a long enough period of time together in person to really get to know each other in the 3 years you have dated. It may have been because of the long distance, maybe you‚Äôve matured a fair bit over the past few years and outgrown him, maybe it was partially because he was unwell and acting up because of it. But it‚Äôs worrying that you were already sick of him after a few days, especially given you‚Äôve gone so long without being able to see him and spend quality time with him.

I‚Äôve found myself staying in relationships way past their due date when they‚Äôve been LDR because the distance makes it far harder to identify potential character flaws or dealbreakers. You can definitely use that week as a reference point as to what living with him will be like. If that is an unbearable thought, then it might be time to move on from the relationship. "
"Moving hair out of someone's mouth is borderline intimate.  Probably not something you would do to your friend if he has long hair.  His reaction is understandable especially if he is insecure about their relationship.


I think it's best to give him space.  You've apologized, he can process that and decide if he wants to throw away your friendship.  The ball is in his court."
"I‚Äôm also wondering if when the friend heard that OP was paying for luggage delivery, that she saw this as an opportunity to get help with her luggage without having to pay for it. She knew that OP would have her hands free.

Surely the friend would have noticed how difficult it was to transport everything on the way to the airport. 

She also could‚Äôve just nicely asked OP, ‚ÄúHey, I overestimated my abilities to carry this around. Would you help me and in return I‚Äôll cover half the cost of your luggage delivery?‚Äù If that happened and I were OP, I‚Äôd probably help anyway but the offer would be appreciated."
"What does it matter how you ""lost"" your virginity? I think this is part of the problem, the way you talk about virginity as if it's some precious thing to be given or lost. You didn't ""lose"" it, you went ahead and had sex, you know exactly what you did with it. I had my first PIV time with a guy from my art school drawing class because I wanted to experience having that sex, we didn't date. I don't think about it regretfully, I think about how I was really sexual and wanted to go from being a person who hasn't had PIV sex to a person who has. (As a brief aside... PIV isn't the definition of sex for everyone and thus can't be the standard you judge it by...sexual intimacy occurs during kissing, and oral, and all the other things that happen during an encounter. Really, my first encounter of sexual intimacy happened well before that.)

Also, there should not be this much difficulty or controlling behavior at 4 months in. You are holding onto him despite the fact that he will not be and is not a good partner. Stop judging yourself for having a fling, because that's not what it is anymore...now it's a fling you tried to force into a relationship box but it doesn't fit. 

Every day you spend with someone who is not the person for you means you miss out on another chance to meet the one who is."
Unfortunately I think OP meant they've been together 1-2 years :(
"I mean it's her house, and her money. If she can afford this/wants to do it just butt out. "
"&gt; he loves sleeping together and is really looking forward to things going back to normal,

Of course he loves it. He isn't the one being kept awake all night. While you say he is understanding, he doesn't completely seem to understand how much this is affecting you. 

Since you say he goes to sleep before you, maybe you could read in bed with him a few nights a week while he falls asleep so that he has you there for a while, then go into the second bedroom when you are tired and ready to sleep yourself? At the end of the day, your health matters, and if your quality of sleep is poor, it will negatively affect your health down the road."
What I‚Äôm worried about is him agreeing and we still don‚Äôt recover. We incurred debt while I was sick. 
"Honestly, no. That‚Äôs really the ONLY thing that has been an issue. We talk constantly through the day, we laugh, and joke- it‚Äôs just this horrible black cloud of an issue. "
"I think feeling weird about a kink that involves hurting your partner, even in play, is completely normal. I‚Äôd be more worried if humiliating your husband *didn‚Äôt* feel a bit off to you at times.

That said, make sure you‚Äôre not involving people who haven‚Äôt consented in your kink. If you‚Äôre humiliating your husband in front of other people, make sure they know what‚Äôs up and are okay with it. If one of your extramarital partners isn‚Äôt aware of/okay with this ‚Äúopen relationship‚Äù arrangement, don‚Äôt lie to them or involve them in the kink. THAT shit would not be cool. As long as everything‚Äôs above board in that department, you‚Äôll be fine. "
"You're seeking assertiveness and initiative from your boyfriend. When you separate the story into these segments it's easy for an outsider to proclaim ""wow you're overreacting."" But all these moments compound.

Could you spend more time working on your temper and being more appreciative of his gestures? 100 percent. It takes two to tango. This is your lesson in this story.

Your boyfriend needs to learn that sometimes doing things without the person asking is what YOU need to feel understood. It's what makes the gesture be that much more impactful. Especially in moments of sex when our body does all the talking. It's a sign of connection. Especially when you're having sex consistently with this person.

Do not explode on him and do not approach him with single instances where has has asked you questions. A rule of thumb: praise the individual and criticize the general idea.

The honey: ""I love how you're so aware of my feelings and always offer to support me. You're always making sure I'm in my best mood."" 

The vinegar: ""I began realizing that I'm not that receptive to being asked questions before a gesture is done for me. Sometimes I just want the person to take initiative and do it with asking. Because part of asking me makes me in part guilty of saying yes. And then I feel bad."""
"Sounds like you guys are in a perfect position to sell the house and move into a studio apartment rental!  

Or a one bed, whatever. But on the cheap so you can save money!"
I cook for my guests. Expecting my guests to cook themselves is weird to me.
"To me, as a fellow kinky person, this sounds like you just need more aftercare. If you like it in the moment and it‚Äôs only later that it feels wrong, spend some time in that ‚Äúafterward‚Äù taking care of each other in a way that affirms your marriage and puts your sex life in a context that works for you. 

The sexual play you guys do together IS part of a healthy, happy marriage. Respecting and honouring your kinks IS being good partners to each other. When you and your friends are talking about your marriages, the fact that you and your husband have a rockin sex life that gets you both off like crazy is proof that you guys are good. 

But also, continue to not overshare this stuff with the ladies. Talk all you want in the bedroom about how you‚Äôll tell everyone what an embarassing mess your husband is, but 99% of people 100% do not want those details. "
This! My aunt has been married to my uncle for nearly 35 years and he has been a fantastic father to my cousin who was a baby when he started dating my aunt. My cousin wouldn't have had her father or her brother in her life if my aunt stayed with the loser who got her pregnant.

"Maybe if it seemed like he actually recognized any of his own fuck-uppedness. But the way he says ""I really loved you back then, you know,"" is transmitting more red flags than a communist parade directly into my brain. Please do not reconnect with him."
"&gt;if he were invested in the relationship, it wouldn't be a dealbreaker.

LDRs are **hard work**. Not everyone is cut out for them, and mine, even with literally free flights as long as there was space available, didn't survive it. We loved each other very much (at least at the beginning of it) but not being able to see each other so much still took its toll.

I'm not saying it's impossible that he's not as invested (I am friends with a married couple who did just fine with the wife studying overseas for a year) but it's still okay for him to not be willing to do it.

That being said, I think she should go."
"My boyfriend (5 years together) was adamently against me getting a sleeve (female for what it‚Äôs worth). He has no issues with tattoos but doesn‚Äôt care for them really. Impartial would be a good word.

But the idea of me changingpermanently is what I think was the part that made him against it. He loves me the way I am after all.

Anyways, I went ahead with it (since we‚Äôre not married and it‚Äôs my body) 

He was nervous about it at first

Now he‚Äôll sometimes mention how sexy it is.

He won‚Äôt ever say he‚Äôs glad I got it, but he doesn‚Äôt hate it and it didn‚Äôt make him less attracted to me like he thought it might. 

When I bring up getting another tattoo? He‚Äôs back to the apprehensiveness.

I think you obviously should talk it out more but in my case, it worked out. "
Are you planning on spending the rest of your life this toxic woman? Imagine sitting in a hospital waiting roommate  with a 5 year old daughter who‚Äôs mother just smashed a scotch glass in her face.
"But it's OK for her to put you through this emotional trauma?

She'll live, trust me, and go off and find someone else to abuse.  Do you want your future kids to suffer and be screamed at and hit too?

Dude, you stuck your dick in crazy.  Quit that."
Goddamnit. The mom in me is screaming inside! Please seek therapy regarding this relationship specifically and also go back to treating your depression  or be re-evaluated and go from there. Your parents must be beside themselves watching this play out. You deserve better than this in life and your relationships. I hope you soon realize that. 
"WTF, your mom is a monster. 

I would contact the vet and ask them exactly what happened. If your mother had a healthy dog killed for no reason, contact both CPS and the police. See if your sister can stay at your dad's for a while, because your mother's home does not seem to be a safe place. I wonder if your mom is in the middle of some kind of psychotic breakdown or something.

Stay far clear of your mom while you are doing all of this. You need to keep yourself and your sister as safe as possible."
"yeah, Josh's mom is my stepfather's ex. she definitely goes above and beyond just because she's a good person. "
"&gt; It felt so good to tell him ""in your dreams buddy"".

Yes!! I'm so glad you turned him down. What he said was horrible. "
No kidding. Jeez. That's ridiculous!
"&gt; but he would blame me if I did.

I think we're splitting hairs on whether it's abusive, manipulative, or whatever. It's not acceptable. He needs to own his mistakes. 

WTF is up with this pay-the-credit-card-daily-or-he-gets-fraud-alerts bs? I have never heard of a credit card that functions this way. Why can't he set up auto pay? Why can't you set up auto-pay? That should be the next thing you learn, since logging onto an online site is such a learning experience (WTF is up with that, too?)"
&gt; Why won't she talk to me about things like this &gt; he used to own guinea pigsYou answered your own question 
"&gt; I'm not saying this to be an ass

And yet, that's exactly what you're achieving."
"Please OP, take a step back. ""I don't know where his money goes"" is a very bad thing. Before you marry someone and buy a home, you need to 100% know this person inside and out. You need to look at his credit report, you need to know how much he makes, what investments he has, spending habits--EVERYTHING. If he is not willing to be transparent you guys are not ready for marriage. Personally, marrying someone and moving into a purchased home as your first foray into living together is a mistake. What if he is a total slob and expects you to do all the housework even though you work 40 hours? What if he snores like a freight train and refuses treatment? What if he does nothing but play video games and neglects all of his other responsibilities? These are the things you need to find out before marriage. 

I'm in an awful situation with my husband because I didn't do my due diligence. I would have made different decisions had I known prior about his relationship with money. Please take this to heart; love is not enough. "
Its the principle of denying someone the right over what they choose to expose themselves to. Really shitty thing to do.

"Absoluetly this!  Live a single life.  Your own apt. Your own friends.  Your own everything.  There is no other way to figure out who you are.  

Speaking of someone who got pregnant at 23 and never had the time to independently snjoy being a single adult."
"I just want to point out that your friend is 56% younger than this guy. This would be like your friend dating someone who is a few weeks away from being 8 years old. Imagine how easily an 18 year old could manipulate and exploit a 7.9 year old. Even if an 18 year old tried not to manipulate or exploint an almost-8 year old, imagine how much they still would.

Your friend is not in a good place. Be ready to be there for her if she has to escape, and make sure to never tell her ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù, so that if this happens again, she‚Äôll always trust that she can be can count on you to help her escape."

"That law is absolutely ridiculous. I remember a true story on reddit about these people who found a hidden room behind their bookshelf, and discovered there was someone living in there. So let‚Äôs say the home owners report that to the police, but the freeloader demands to stay because of ‚Äúsquatters rights‚Äù they could lie their way into staying in the home owners house? Seems absurd. "
"Yeah, I am a little shocked at all the people that say no. If it were me, I‚Äôd as the bf if he minded and if he gave the go ahead, why not? I really don‚Äôt understand why so many people are saying it‚Äôs weird and inappropriate. "
"I don't agree in practice. If Chris and Derek are going to be lifelong pals, you gotta soften it a little more than this.

"&gt; What kind of shitty husband

The cheating kind.
He's having an affair with her and the husband found out. 

OP - I know you want to stay and fight for your home, but do not put yourself in danger."
"I think a lot of the comments on here are pretty good, so I won't go repeating things people have already said.

One thing that may help you orient yourself in this arena is to figure out if your wife is working significantly more than her coworkers, or if this is simply a high stress, high workload office. If everyone at her company works just as much, she probably is not getting taken advantage of. If everyone except her works normal hours, then something may be wrong. 

The other thing I will say is that there is a world of difference between intentionally taking on extra responsibility at a job to make a good impression and being unable to say no to your boss. The former makes you a valuable asset to the company, the latter makes you a sucker. What may help you out is trying to figure out which mode your wife is operating under, so you can best support her. "
So.... you would blow up at him and you're upset he didn't do the things you want him to do?
I find myself wondering if you unconsciously set him up because you have trouble believing that *any* man could be faithful to you. Do you have a history of bad relationships?
"I'm wondering about that too.

I'm trying to figure out what could happen in a FFFM group, where the male isn't allowed to do any penetration? Kissing and massage? Penetration with the girlfriend?

It sounds like the guy was set up to be able to watch his SO hook up with the other 2 girls and not be allowed to do anything else.... like why even have him be there at that point? "
"First off, I just need to get this out.

&gt; filosofi 

I think what you're going for there is ""philosophy.""

Now that that's out of the way, your girlfriend is very emotionally unstable. The fact that she has **ever** hit you is unacceptable.

While spoilers suck, she *seriously* overreacted and blew things out of proportion. It should have ended after your apology.

I would respect her request to be left alone and I think you guys should not get back together. That's how you defuse the situation. She needs therapy in conjunction with medication, and she needs to stop drinking, period. It seems like it interacts with her medication and causes it to be less effective.

She should not be in a relationship right now and she cannot be a good girlfriend to you while things are the way they are.

I would stay far away for your own mental health and safety."
"Right? One of the most fucked up relationship SNAFUs on here and it's like, ""how can my girlfriend and I build a happy little family in light of the recent events?"" 

Can't do. "
"OP should insist on full parental rights to this child if he wants, or should insist on adopting her out. This woman does not sound even remotely mentally stable enough to be a parent. "
"Yeah, that one was messed up. Husband started saying terrible things about the OP to their kid, and wouldn't help her with a single thing throughout the pregnancy and insisted that he was only going to be helping out with the work of one child once the twins were born cause that's all he agreed to. I'm thinking that OP is a single mother of three right now. "
"What a horrible selfish thing for her to ask you. She wants to keep you around on the back burner while simultaneously dating other men and screwing with her kids. 

Cut it off clean man."
"I wonder if he realizes that telling you that is basically like telling you that he doesn't actually love you. I'm not saying that he doesn't love you, but the only kind of person who *truly* wouldn't be upset over a relationship ending is one who isn't in love with their partner.

Bring up the fact that he's essentially telling you that he doesn't care about *you* and see if it registers. Right now he might be saying all this as a defense mechanism without really understanding what it means.

If he keeps up with this narrative even after that, consider that he's likely not open enough to being in love to be a good choice in partner. He might need a lot of therapy before he lets himself love someone deeply."
"Why would he cheat? That‚Äôs quite a stretch. Maybe he feels, like most of us do, that cheating is morally wrong. He could just break up with her if he wanted to see someone else. "
"Give him space and he will naturally tell you what happens. I know its hard to not know why but he will eventually say it! maybe he had a bad day we don't know.

Hope all goes well!"
"Ahh. Classic Shmosby.

Don't tell a woman that you love her on the fourth date."
"OP THE POST ABOVE  IS THE PERFECT RESPONSE! Also, I met my boyfriend on Tinder and he is the best thing to have ever happened to me.  Was he the 2nd guy I met off there? Not even close. You have to go through a lot of people to find the right one, but when you find it, it is so worth it.  You just have to keep trying. If you decide to keep going online, state exactly what you want in your bio(like you are looking for a serious relationship, not just sex. ) The good thing about online is that you meet so many people you would never meet otherwise. Good luck and don't give up :)

"People often suggest couples counseling on this sub because it isn't just for trying to save a marriage.

&gt;Hook up: Being a typical guy a few weeks after living with my best friend who is a very attractive lady, I started hitting on her as we moved into our new home.

Gross. So a woman signs a lease with you and literally can't leave so you decide to hit on her constantly? 

 &gt;but she said it was a mistake. There were a few times where I got close. Like I could tell she probably wanted to mess around but held back. But then she started seeing this new guy we will call TJ which is why. She was really interested.

It doesn't matter why she didn't want to, it only matters that she didn't want to. I think she just slept with you to get you to stop hitting on her. This never works. You need to read up on consent. 

Imagine you have a friend who really likes a craft beer that you don't like. But he keeps pestering you to try it even though you think you won't like it. After a few weeks you try it. You were right you don't like it but at least he'll stop asking you about it, right? No, now that you've tried it, he's asking you to drink the stuff ALL the time citing that one time you drank it when you didn't even really want to drink it the first time. Pressuring or persistently  hitting on woman who HAVE to be around you (work, mutual friends, housemates) isn't really appropriate.

""But then how do I pursue women, blahblahblah? This is hard."" Uh, just tell them that you are interested and if they are interested then go on a fucking date with them.

&gt;
&gt;Fight: We had a very good day together one day. So I brought up having dinner, movie, and cuddling on our next day off. When that day came I brought it up again. She laughed in my face and said TJ was coming over for dinner that night. She was super sassy about it which upset me. We ended up getting in a huge argv ument. Too make a long story short I ended up breaking a bunch of shit kinda causing a scene. 

Um what. How old are you? Ok, you're 25. You don't get to break shit because you're mad. This is abusive behavior. Do you break things when you're mad at work? No? Then you have some control. So use that control not to try to intimidate the woman you've harassed into sleeping with you. 

&gt;Jealousy issues: I seriously hate this TJ dude. The atmosphere in my house is so negative now more than positive. She makes attempts to speak to me more often than I do when she knows I am mad at her for bringing TJ over. Almost like she does it too mess with me. I always ignore her because I don't want to say something I will regret in the future. The anger/jealousy is so bad I feel like I cannot control it.  This is getting bad. TJ comes over. Then I treat her like garbage/ignore her on purpose to hurt her like she is hurting me. After a few days of TJ not being around I'm really nice, we get along great, and we're holding hands even though she has a boyfriend (TJ). Then he comes over and the pattern starts again.

So you lead with hating TJ but I saw literally nothing about TJ in there just that you hate how you hate that your roommate acts like she has a boyfriend . Then you talk about intentionally hurting her feelings by treating her like garbage until she does what you want. No wonder she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you.

&gt;he stole her from me. 

No, dude. She CHOSE him. She has her own will. And maybe she doesn't want to be with a violent, emotionally abusive p s y c h o who doesn't take no for an answer.

&gt;What do I do?

Therapy. I'm serious. You have a lot of issues and none of them are her fault. Go to therapy. Especially before getting into a relationship with anyone."
"I watch mainly lesbian porn, and have fantasized about women, but on a 1-10 scale of straight to gay, I'm about a 1.5. I wouldn't even call myself bi. I like women in fantasy only. I know lots of other women like me, and I'm sure there are some men like me too.


Some people's masturbatory habits are different from their real-life preferences. Hell, some people get off on the novelty of something completely new that they're not even into. Human sexuality is complicated. Watching gay porn doesn't make you gay or bi. "
"First, I commend you for doing all that you can to have financial freedom. Kudos!

Now:

* Sheila doesn't sound like a friend to me. She sounds more of a gold digger (best friend[?] mode).

If you want to further improve your life, I recommend that you be blunt with her. Point out what you've point out here and if she doesn't get it, then it's okay. The important thing here is you've said what needed to be said.

You'll meet plenty of friends moving forward. It'll pay off in the long run and you may treat the situation as a test of your friendship with her.

TL;DR - She sounds toxic to me as a friend, ditch her. (just being blunt)"
I got ID‚Äôd and subsequently asked to leave the bar on our first date. It was mortifying. Luckily he found it hilarious and here we are 7 years later. 
Maybe if he has anxiety or stress it could have compounded it. I know I cry whenever I'm accused of stuff as well or if I feel guilty. Maybe he was just ashamed or felt weird or embarrassed. 
Why would you want a bigot friend? That's a crap trade.
"Ok that's what I was thinking. It sounds like she doesn't know about your situation, so that may not have anything to do with it. She may have just been, ""being a parent"", and parents can really suck when it comes to their children. With that in mind, she is probably going to find something wrong with the new instructor too. As for the class, there is no reason you should have to tell her anything about your personal life that would make her say you can't be a therapist. Luckily it's not really her place to say anyway. All you have to do is keep your head down and do the work. She can't fail you bc she doesn't like you, not if you perform well in class (test, etc.). As a student in her class, I would suggest focusing on what's good about her as a professor and not what's bad about her as a person. You may end up learning a lot from, that doesn't mean you have to like her or she has to like you. Just keep carrying yourself as a professional and you should be fine :) hope that helps!"
I was in the same spot as you once with the LDR. Except my ex didn't offer any real explanation as to why he was dumping other than he just all the sudden saw us not getting married despite that being our intentions. I felt so dumb and stupid and also used. I cut off all contact with him. I even deleted all my social media because I'd knew I'd stalk him on there. Best thing I can tell you is that it takes time. I will never do a long distance relationship ever again because of that experience. I feel for you and I wish you luck. Hang in there
"&gt; I often used to joke he would either be the father or the God-father of my kids - I plan on having him in my life for a long time.

If you are absolutely sure that you want George in your life, you should date him. If you choose to date Luke, it would be disrespectful to continue a close friendship with a man who is trying to destroy your relationship and convince you to leave for him.

You should also tell Luke your ‚Äúcomplex history‚Äù with George. If you haven‚Äôt told him that you have a sexual history with George, or that you wanted to be in a committed relationship with him, you‚Äôre not being honest enough."
Lol wtf are you even talking about ? How do you get he thinks he is entitled to sex whenever he wants ? She didn‚Äôt say that at all in her post. He initiated. She denied. He obviously disappointed so goes to bed. She feels entitled to be spooned if anything. Give me a break
"Yes, I am judging OP based on what she said. Talking down on service workers combined with dismissing a woman and being openly mean tells me OP is a mean person. 

Also, I never said OP was judgmental. I said she was mean with a bad attitude and I can understand why someone would want her out of their life."
"&gt;I'm almost thinking about ending the relationship and asking him to move out but I'm hesitant, he doesn't have anywhere else to live right now. Is there something I can say or do to make him stop treating me this way.

No. You have told him you are having literal chest-crushing anxiety attacks and he persists in the behavior. He knows it is harmful to you. He doesn't *care.* You can't make him care. 

As for him not having anywhere else to go? Hey, it will be good for him to be challenged."
"you can't unfortunately. Given their mother's behavior when Sam vented to her, and likely the ""different""(real or imagined) ways they were treated this was a perfect storm. More so if she's been sitting around  for years waiting for you rather than living her life.

"24 weeks pregnant normally sane calm and rational women here.   Definitely feel like any insecurities I had before are a thousand times worse now and I feel extremely sad and miserable to the point of just sitting doing nothing for chunks of days at a time and not wanting to see or talk to anyone.    The rage is real too though I'm older and mostly just keep it in.    I appreciate when my husband is tolerant of my moods and acknowledges I'm not feeling well and shows he understands and cares.   It is only temporary and pregnancy affects a lot more than just hormones.  As a women it's very difficult at this stage to feel and see your entire body change and go from feeling attractive to huge, slow, uncomfortable, and deal with all the very unpleasant symptoms of pregnancy which are generally not attractive.   This can make women extremely insecure.  It's not fair she's taking it out on you but she's probably having a mental crisis of some sort so all the repeatedly talking through it might reassure her.    The hormones are probably just gasoline on whatever burning issues she's got going on.    Aka it's not the hormones causing then problem but they are making her unable to solve the the problem in a healthy way.    "

The DJ was just trying to be inflammatory and scandalous. He‚Äôs not actually scamming on your girl. Have you been insecure with this girlfriend before?

"&gt;he owed her at least a discussion about how it should go, a discussion about what he knew about sex, an explanation for why he was a virgin

He doesn't *owe* her anything.

&gt;I would also not only be betrayed that they lied about something so serious and important to mention about sex, but worried because this is a 25 year old virgin who may place wayyyyy too much value on the relationship because I'm his 'first'.

Your self-esteem problem is your own issue to deal with, not any potential sexual partner's.

Imagine if you were a guy putting this much importance onto a woman's virginity, and how much of a massive fucking creep you would seem like. Imagine if a guy thought he was ""owed"" an explanation as to why a woman was or was not a virgin? Cause that's how you sound right now. Thinking like this is the reason why a 25 year old virgin ""may place wayyyyy too much value"" on sex/virginity, because people like you put just as much, if not more, value on it."

"I think she also finds it difficult to get out of her own depressive headspace when she sees it mirrored back at her in your own behavior. 

Empathy goes both ways in this case. She understands what depression feels like so she owes it to you to be kind. You know how difficult it is to be depressed so you owe it to *her* to cheer on her progress, even if that means giving her some space. You both need to try to understand each other and *you* in particular need to not rely on her to carry you through your depressive spells.

She's actually making the biggest sacrifice having a child she didn't plan to. Stop thinking women are baby crazy and only men do sacrifices for kids when it's women who get the short end of the stick.
I mean ffs, they're in a LDR, she's going to be the one giving birth and sole caretaker of the kid and you say he's the one sacrificing?

&gt; commit to a lifetime of caring for a child that you aren't 100% sure is yours.

Yeah that's the problem, he has NO reason to think it's not his apart from not trusting his girlfriend, and that's a HIM problem.

Which leads me to:
&gt;But you also get to ask, ""Do I want to be with and raise a child with someone who would begrudge, guilt, shame, or invalidate my very reasonable concern of wanting to be sure of my progeny?"" 

It's not a very reasonable concern. It's actually a very unreasonable concern because MOST people do not raise other men children unknowlingly. That is a lie that's perpetuated by certain people with certain agenda and I've seen studies being twisted to adjust to it and it's really annoying.

Like, honestly, if she actually cheated and the kid really wasn't his it's far far more likely that she would have aborted and he wouldn't even know of its existence than keeping the pregnacy and pass it as his."
"I agree very much with this post! Male myself that has had somewhat this problem, it's become better lately.

I think the people replying in this thread are wrong. You are justified in being upset with him masturbating to porn instead of you. I would be upset over that too and i would feel inferior compared to the perfect porn stars. You are being a good girlfriend by initiating sexual acts and letting him know you want him. He may just not be into sexting which i can understand but i also could possibly be that he has lost passion for you or is more into porn instead. Have a talk with him about it

On some level, he WANTS the relationship to be as it is. He WANTS to have a whipping post (you) he can attack any time he feels like it. He has no motive to change. Let that sink in: *He doesn't consider your crushed spirit to be motivation enough to change.* 

Even if theoretically, some abuser somewhere turned over a new leaf, that doesn't mean your boyfriend ever will. Are you willing to wait five years? Ten years? Twenty? For an epiphany that *very well may never come?* 

Take your boyfriend as what he is, not as what you fantasize him being."

"lol she's immature? you act like it's *her* baby to take care of. who cares if she's got a phobia of puke? she's still paying rent and it's not like she's the father, so her emetophobia really shouldn't have much of an impact on op. she wasn't gonna have a hand in raising her roommate's baby in the first place."

"Everyone here seems to be focusing hard on the money. Which is very practical. But honestly I'd ignore that completely at this point. 

Legally if you're the father, you can end up paying money towards maintenance of the child and that's totally out of your control.

So focus on everything else- if you have a son/daughter on the way do you want to meet them? Give them your old stuffed toys? Drop by Christmas and birthdays and big events but let her make the decisions? Share custody and look into schools? Or not meet them at all &amp; let her know you're happy to sign over parental rights if she meets someone permanent?

Basically this is a decision which shouldn't involve money as the only consideration. Especially because there's no avoiding that responsibility if you wanted to, or way to accidentally stumble into it if you don't.

Think about what else you'd want, or not want."

"I would make the call for the reason the poster above has stated, and also so that her doctor knows that she has just taken a pretty drastic action in her personal life. Given that she seems to have been struggling lately, he needs to know this. 

On a similar note, if her close friends and family don't already know that she has broken off your engagement, I would tell someone, especially before you de-camp to your brother's. As much as you can't be that person right now, she will need someone to check on her and make sure she isn't spiralling.

That way, too, you can know she is being looked after, and have confidence to take time and space for your own healing. You're doing so, so well. Keep going."
"Leave and don't go back. Shit, I'll be your friend. Just make yourself get out there and talk to people. Join a club. Make some friends in an online group. But definitely take the other comments advice and talk to a counselor. It's easier to stick to your guns with someone laying it down realistically for you. Good luck."
This isn't making your relationship sounds any better or your husband sound any less predatory. If you're unhappy you can always leave.

"your ""whaling"" post was 15 days ago so forgive me if I'm somewhat dubious that you've made substantial improvements since then, especially because you are still prioritizing getting what you want over someone else's right to make their own decisions. you don't think your sister isn't aware that your dad paid for shit growing up? why don't you respect her decision to not have someone who disrespected their marriage vows at her wedding? why did you think it was your place to insert yourself into this? it's part and parcel of an ugly belief that what other people want doesn't matter, only what you want."

It's because they have been conditioned to prefer it from porn. Most women in porn are fully shaved. And men too to be fair. When I was young and dumb I didn't want to have sex with my ex bf because he didn't shave his pubes. I'm ok with pubes now.

"You really should have a meeting with the teachers going on the trip and the counselor and tell them how she has been harassing you for the last few months. That's right, she has been HARASSING you. Bring a parent if you feel you won't be able to stand up for yourself, tell them what has been going on. Tell them that under no circumstances will you be rooming with this girl on the trip AND that you want them to tell her to leave you alone. You do not want to her to speak with you during the trip at all and you want their help at making sure that happens. You want to enjoy this trip and she has been making your life at school miserable for months. Also, recruit some good friends to form a buffer around you, make sure you do activities with them and not with the rude girl. She has issues, but you can't fix them and she is not treating you well. Just because she has a disability doesn't mean she gets free reign to be a jerk. She needs help you can't give. "

"Yeah, that's weird. A few things I can think of; maybe she was in a relationship in the past where her bf used to come into her work and it was bad and she wants to avoid that happening again, or maybe it's some kind of illegal operation, or maybe she's some kind of stripper or sex worker. "
I don't see how someone who lives 40 min away can run into you that often. She has a crush and is trying to orchestrate meetings. When you run into her don't be available to hang out. When she stops by send her away. Make plans if you enjoy spending time with her but don't allow for these unplanned hangs. It's ok to say you are busy/distracted/have plans. Your plans can be to spend the day by yourself. Maybe that will teach her to stop. 
"I‚Äôm SHOCKED by these comments. You can‚Äôt forbid her to see him? Your daughter is a MINOR in your home being groomed by a fucking predator and commenters want you to let her learn the hard way?! She‚Äôs a kid, this is predatory and not okay, she is in over her head you‚Äôre the adult. You can forbid it. His mom is also on board to rep them apart and owns the restaraunt. You can absolutely forbid it and I still punishment if she breaks these rules. Explain to the best of your ability why this is predatory and not okay and do it. Protect your child. And what do you mean an 8 month relationship is serious?! She‚Äôs a kid! She sees him at work and on dates! This is not serious. I am very curious about your world view that 8 months at age 17 is too serious to keep her away from a predator
"
She doesn't know what love is if she can still claim she loves you with a straight face. I suggest finding a partner who actually understands and is willing to commit to those wedding vows of in sickness or in health
"That's kind of where I'm at.  He got up this morning and came in to talk to me while I was in the middle of a build and I had a team working in the back yard to finish stuff we're weeks behind on.  He keeps trying to backtrack and say he never told me to smooth things over, but he does keep telling me I should talk to them, and I should reach out to them, and he doesn't agree with what they did, but he wants his family around him right now.  I keep trying to explain that 1) my life is on fire right now and 2) I believe in setting boundaries and not rewarding people for treating me badly, but I know he hates conflict and feeling uncomfortable and he wants to do whatever he needs to do to put bad feelings to bed as soon as possible.  Which means I get pressured to do it for him too.  He's gone to cry to friends of his, and I'm still working.

I called my mom, and she doesn't want to involve herself, but when I said I wanted her advice, she said Phinn isn't stable at all within himself, and if she were still there, she'd kick his ass.  Love you, mom."
"I just want to point out that 2 of the 4 examples you provided of you giving him a taste of his own medicine don't even count as flaking because *he* flaked first!

In the first example, you were supposed to have dinner together but then he decided he'd rather ditch you to have dinner with his roomies and you adapted your own plans in order to salvage what could have been a shitty night. In your second example with him sleeping through brunch, again, he fucked up your plans and then you quickly changed your plans in order to avoid a wasted day. How can he be mad about this? Does he expect you to wait around for him while he prioritizes everyone else over you? Hell no.

Honestly, I think this is more of a side effect of dating a 20yo. You're both pretty young, and there's going to be some immature bullshit that you're gonna have to deal with for a few more years (if you're lucky lol). You just need to decide if you love this guy enough to put up with the immaturity. If I were you, I'd call it a day with this one."

I mean, *maybe* this is possible? But honestly, most beds are heavy and a pain in the ass to move. If I lose something under the bed, and it ends up too far away from the edge for me to reach, I go and get a long object to help me move it and grab it. Moving the bed has never even crossed my mind. 

That being said, since the indents in the carpet where the bed was are out in the open and clearly visible (i.e. not in his sock drawer), OP should ask her boyfriend about that first and then gauge his reaction. This is gaslighting in the truest sense of the word. "

9 years later I heard she married a black man last year! I didn't get invited to the wedding but I heard it was real pretty and his family loves her. She's Jewish."
"I'm curious as to what you mean by ""face the consequences"". Like, if OP's daughter's boyfriend turns abusive/controlling, are you implying that the daughter should face the abuse? Or did you mean something else?"

You know that you can ban her from the hospital right. Ban her and once you are better you can explain that she was making your anxious and that it was not the place to discuss alternative medicine.

Oh man... That‚Äôs a super black and white way to look at it. Maybe don‚Äôt have kids?
"I agree with this. My child isn't old enough to date, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about. But it sounds like OP is just washing their hands of the whole situation. ""They're 17 so their romantic life is none of my business"". No, it still is your business to try to counsel and guide your child. You can't just drop them in the deep end and say ""Alright, go fall in love and have sex and it's none of my business"". A 17 year old is not an adult. A typical 26 year old is *barely* an adult, in terms of mentality.

Can OP not remember what it's like to be 17? Even a 30 year old makes stupid choices when they're in love. A 17 year old in love is a machine built for making bad decisions."

"That's not how everyone view gift giving. Personally, I think that always acting like you like the gift can be a bit unkind: I got it because I wanted to make the other person happy, not me, and if I don't get real input from them I can't do that. When I do something nice for someone else I try to get a real response, even if it hurts a bit that they don't like it, it's better than me keeping on doing something they don't like."
"Agreed. There's a commentor above who never told her husband she disliked yellow roses so she's been getting them for 13 years now. Is it a big deal? Of course not. But I don't think it's unreasonable to be able to tell your SO that you'd prefer the other brand/color/version.

Looking at it from my own perspective as a gift-giver: you give gifts to make the other person happy, if they'd be more happy with a different color I'd want to know so I could make it a better gift for her."

Some guys also think by not making a move/withholding sex you will end up throwing yourself at them out of insecurity. It‚Äôs easy to expect you‚Äôll have to decline sex, but if he walks away without giving you the option sometimes it works out better for him.

It is one of the easiest things in the world to back up your work - especially something that takes up as little disk space as stories.  If you had videos that would be an issue. 

If you have Office 365 from Microsoft you can use OneDrive, which has 1 TB of storage.  

You can get a version of Dropbox for free with 2 GB of storage.  That's plenty.  

You can get a backup-specific software like Carbonite for like $72 per year or something, or you can get one of the newer other providers for cheaper.  

I personally use a Mac and I (1) save all my files in my OneDrive for availability across my devices, which also serves as a backup; (2) use Time Machine and an external hard drive that I back up to whenever my computer reminds me - every 2 weeks or so; and (3) use Backblaze to back up my files remotely.  File backup should not be left to chance, it's too easy to have something bad happen (virus / boyfriend) or have the hardware break, or something else. 

Lastly - if he has access to your laptop, he has access to all your files.  Even if he has his own user name.  Just be aware of that.  If he has his own laptop, make sure that he doesn't have access to yours.  There's a (n in my opinion, stupid) trend of giving your SO passwords to all your devices.  If you have a Mac, turn on File Vault; if you have windows, hopefully you have the Pro version of the operating system and can turn on Bitlocker. "

"I love my best friend's family for this exact reason. All the adult women in her family are stay at home moms. They take turns picking up all the kids from school, making dinner, and watching them. On the weekends, all the adult men take the kids out to have fun and the women get a break. So woman A will pick up her kids, her nieces and nephews, and her younger cousins from school. She'll drive them to their activities, then drop them off at woman B's house, who will make them dinner and then drive them home. The next day woman B will pick them up and take them places and then drop them at woman C's house for dinner.

My best friend is super close with all her family because of this, and the parent's were never stressed because they always had time away from the kids. It's great."

"I had to do this with my mother, after my dad left and she was leaning too heavily on me and saying a lot of ‚ÄúI know he‚Äôs your dad but here‚Äôs another reason I think he‚Äôs the worst person alive.‚Äù

I straight up told her I love her but that part of her struggling wasn‚Äôt appropriate for me to deal with. I reminded her that for all my fathers perceived and imagined faults, he was still my dad and right now I was trying to figure out what my new ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was with each parent.

Funny enough, mom kept pushing it (‚ÄúI know you‚Äôll get mad at me for talking about him but...‚Äù) but dad absolutely 100% respected my boundaries and we actively and successfully changed our relationship to cope with this change in our lives. I am way, way closer to him, which I know chews my mom up.

In your shoes, I‚Äôd tell your mom something like this:

‚ÄúI know this is a painful time for you. Right now you‚Äôre leaning too much on me and I just can‚Äôt handle that. You need to talk to your sisters/friends/support group to do that type of venting talk. Right now, our conversations should be focused on what our relationship is going to look like. Mom, you also won‚Äôt like this, but I need to be the best parent I can be and that means setting boundaries around my child. If you can apologize and behave like we discussed, you can attend her birthday. If you ever speak disrespectfully like that around my child again, you can expect to not see us for a while. She‚Äôs young right now and doesn‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre saying, but that doesn‚Äôt matter because you need to be forming good habits for when she can.‚Äù"

"Honestly I feel like if you're dating someone and really feeling each other then an exclusivity conversation doesn't need to happen if you're both on the same page. She wasn't on the same page, clearly she didn't sit and think for two seconds about how he may have felt (or actually she did and just didn't care), she just went and had sex. When you care about someone and are crushing or dating and feeling it will progress, you consider their feelings in your actions. 

It feels to me that what she did was selfish. A lot of people are saying ""I was on her side but I don't get why she told you."" I do. She slept with the guy and then felt guilty (whether by considering OP's feelings before or after the act). Guilty people want to relieve their guilt by getting it off their chest. So she talked about it and hoped to slip by with a technicality, then of course was upset when she couldn't have her cake and eat it too. To me the whole ""have fun, do your thing"" was different when you all had just had one date, but after extensive dating and near constant talking and getting close, it shouldn't take a contractual ""WE ARE EXCLUSIVE"" agreement and speech to prevent this from happening. They shouldn't *want* to see other people because they're enjoying you, just as you enjoyed her.

She's not some woman acting under the guise of it was just casual dating who ended up on the wrong page. She was a woman that wanted to have her cake and eat it too, and felt it was worth it to get laid to risk your budding romance. I wouldn't chase someone that didn't care about me and did something they knew 100% would hurt me just because they were selfish. I have no clue why everyone thinks she's some strong empowered woman living life. She sounds really selfish to me. I would have never done that to my boyfriend while we were dating, *but* I also reiterated to him a lot that I wasn't seeing anyone else and okay with it and ensured he wasn't either. 

Anyways, now you know to reiterate exclusivity but I'm not going to give her a gold medal or anything, I think she took a calculated risk and was extremely selfish and inconsiderate in her actions. "
"I have a close friend who was going through a rough time and needed to talk to me about it over text. I let my husband know what we were talking about in a general way without violating my friend's privacy, and then let my husband and my friend know that after the conversation was over I would be deleting the texts in order to protect my friend's privacy. And then I did.  It's as simple as that. There's nothing on my phone that my husband shouldn't see, but at the same time if I delete something so he (or anyone else) doesn't see it, I let him know in a general sense what it was and why. 

"
"I feel the same way!

I hate the expectation that it's only ""natural"" for everyone to see naked women as the erotic ideal --including other women! If you're a straight women (read: exclusivity sexually, romantically and emotionally attracted to the opposite gender), then naked dudes are where your attraction lies.

I think this idea is so prevalent because the ""male gaze"" dominates what considered sexual in western society, so plenty of women get socialized to think ""sexy"" is what men think is sexy. A mixture of this along with women that do experience same-sex attraction weighing in, is why we often hear the sentiment that ""women are sexier; penises are ugly""."
Maybe she's a stripper or a cam girl and she is embarrassed?
The issue of women being called girls is not comparable to other disagreements. It's evidence of a long history of sexism.
"There is a difference between being a shit head and being downright hostile though. 

You shouldn't feel guilty because you don't want to be uncomfortable in your own home.  You have a right to say ""this person makes me uncomfortable, I am not allowing them in my home."" 

Look at it this way. If the roles were reversed and it was your friend who was being hostile to him, what would you do? What would you want your husband to say to you? Would you want him to speak up?"
"&gt; she can't be bothered with the stress of both thinking about it AND asking me to do it/think about it.

This is the most straightforward solution. Your boyfriend has absolutely no respect for you whatsoever and you'd be far better off in your own place.
"Thanks, my sister is awesome now! Remarried, healthy, happy, has 3 kids that I love to spoil rotten, and that's all a dark part of the past. But it was such an eye-opener. Like, if you had said ""Who is the last person on earth who would hit a woman?"" 100% of people who knew my sister would have said ""Sister's husband! The kindest man in the world who would dash into traffic to save puppies, and who gives to charity and volunteers and pampers his wife!"" It really changed my view. 

I have to admit, after that, and a few other (more recent) experiences I'd had (none of which were ever nearly that bad, just dealing with manipulators), sadly I have gotten more cynical. I confess that when I meet someone now, and they are really warm, charismatic, engaging, and just plain ""cool"", I am on my guard. IT's not to say I shut them out immediately. It's just that I see charisma as like a tactic now. 

Anyway. You DESERVE respect in your marriage. You really do. "

"That specific detail? No. Not a big deal. 

But it implies the possibility that other details were missed and the level of interest in the post could be less than desired for credible advice.
If I got advice from someone who failed to even understand the title of my post, I wouldn't take it too* seriously. "
Yep. I sure hope the kid managed to find this or /r/raisedbybarcissists in about 12-14 years. 
That's 100% cheating my dude.
It sounds like OP may be having suicidal thoughts and feelings. Telling her that suffering is inevitable in life may not be the best way to go at this time.

"You know where to go from here, you are choosing not to leave the cheater you live with. "
Seriously! Babysitters in my area get like 20 bucks an hour. OP would be making FOUR TIMES what's she making. Lowering her already measly pay is so skeezy. Get the paycheck and run. And isn't 8 bucks below minimum wage?
"As a Catholic you don't serve God just in the church building.  The Church is the community we live in, not just the building.  We are called to go forth and be examples of Christ's teachings.  Did Jesus go to services?  Yes!  But he also went to weddings and hung out with prostitutes and tax collectors.

Tell her the truth.  That you feel called to go the concert.  That you believe that it will be fun, but that you also believe that is where you should be that day.  Ask her to pray with you to help her understand why you believe this is the right place for you to be that night.

After all, Jesus hung out with the sinners all the time.  He was surrounded by them.  He was an example for them.  

So go to the concert.  Have fun.  And be an example of Christ while you are there.  "
"Yes, it is ok to dump you after 8 months. "

"I'm so glad you canceled the hotel. He was definitely planning to cheat on you with her using YOUR hotel points. 

Also, he is not respecting your boundaries and it is NOT okay. Not only did he ignore your feelings of discomfort over how much they talk but he went behind you back to make plans to see her in person. Quick anecdote: when I started dating my boyfriend he told me on our 4th date that he had a trip planned in a few months to go to Canada and would be meeting up with a girl he had hooked up with who lived there. When we got more serious I told him I now felt uncomfortable with him going to Canada to hang out with her. You know what he did? Told her sorry he wouldn't be meeting up with her anymore. Then he asked me to go with him instead and we had a great time. 

Your boyfriend's behavior is way out of line, especially considering they were friends for ONE year over 12 years ago. He is putting her feelings before yours and making you out to be the unreasonable one. I know your lives and finances are super intertwined after 12 years together but I'd seriously reconsider continuing the relationship. I'm really sorry for what you're going through."
"Your boyfriend IS A CHILD, this is predatory and nasty. I'd be dropping you as a friend too, tbh! You are almost old enough to drink and you are dating a high school sophomore? "
Your parents are going to be her parents when you marry.  That's heartless of her
honestly sometimes you partner will be a fucking asshole and you need to be one back. not in a i want to hurt them way but this fool needs a reality check type of way. sometimes someone has to lose and he needs to lose this argument and way of thinking. 
"You are her family now, what you want is just as important as what she wants. If she doesn't understand that she's not ready for marriage. 

Make it clear that you're not intentionally trying to derail your wedding, it's actually incredibly important to you to have your parents in attendance. She might be downgrading your feelings in her head without realizing based on what she's observed of your relationship with your family up to this point. You might be saying, ""This is important to me,"" and she might be thinking of the fact you forgot your dad's birthday last year, or you haven't had a real conversation with your mother in months, or you constantly forget how old your sister is. 

If you can make it clear that this is actually incredibly important to you and she still doesn't compromise then this wedding might not be the best idea. 

Also ask her to do some soul-searching and find out what is actually so important about this venue. Is it the circular feeling of ""growing up"" at this place she spent so much of her childhood? Is it the reverence to her family it would imply? Find a way to replicate the most important thing about having this stupid venue in a way that doesn't involve having the wedding there. "
Your girlfriend is being very straightforward with you. Her family is tocos and they will not treat you or your relationship with respect. You have everything to lose and nothing to gain by telling them. 
"&gt; I know that if I give her her space she will realize this and we have real shot at happiness and a life together.

No, you don't know that. You just *want* that.

Why don't you believe her? "
"Your tone is just poison and fuck me you're so self absorbed. The guy has problems and his family were useless at dealing with it, and as if he's not already being punished enough, his sister has the gall to get offended when it turns out he's not terribly pleased over it. Just let him have a shot at happiness for fuck sake."
"Honestly, I would tell her that the new vet says he needs to be left alone more/not picked up for his health, even if they don't.  It might help you get less pushback from the roomie on your new boundaries."
"You seem like a girl that allows drama to happen then complains about drama in her life. He broke it off with you and you still banged an ex? Messy. Dude eavesdrops and then you watch a movie together? Messy. He stalked your new bar dude's insta and you just ..moved on from it? Messy. He tried to project his jealousy by telling you he has a date and you want to know his ... reasoning? Messy.

"
Say hi to the Soviet Army as they march past with all those red flags dude. 
"&gt;&gt;She needs to feel appreciated for what she does

&gt;i hope she appreciates that OP works to support her

The second doesn't negate the first. Stay-at-home spouses that do the majority of the house work need appreciation too."
"In all hindsight, I should have waited until I had gotten home, but texting the girl, she realizes they messed up and I think they both understand that they overstayed their welcome. "
"&gt; hopes you‚Äôre having a good day at work. 

Was he at work when those calls came in? "
"Call the cops now, before she convince anyone that she lives here and you have to evict her."
"Joints and back pain, you have what ? Less than five years until you realise you've been wearing down your body. It's not avoidable when you use a mechanical part with twice the weight they've been designed for. As for the rest of the health issues, yeah they're not automatic. In the same sense that some people survive being shot in the head. 

You're free to do whatever you want with your body. Just don't try to kid yourself about the consequences of your lifestyle. "
I can also see why that attitude has made the brother so insecure and clingy. This child needs to have a permanent home that he can trust is for forever.
"Jean caused this drama, not you. It's unfortunate that you had to discover that your aunt is a terrible person during a family vacation. Be grateful that your dad and grandpa have your back. Clearly they are all too familiar with your aunt's behaviour.


So go to the games and enjoy your vacation with the rest of your family! Ignore aunty if you see her. She's clearly not there for the ""family vacation"", she just wanted a FREE vacation. "
"Yeah, nobody in this situation seems like they have their shit together...sounds like maybe not the best idea to have this guy's baby, but it's too late now."
Yeah but being 22 isn't an excuse to be a pos 
"That's an incredible deal and your girlfriend should be *very* careful about not doing anything to screw it up. However, even if you were both paying rent like in a more normal situation, it's still his home as much as yours and your girlfriend has no right to expect him to clear out when she wants to come over. Part of living with roommates is dealing with the fact that you'll have far fewer opportunities to really be alone, and she can either get used to hanging out mostly in your room if she wants some privacy or she can suck it up and agree to spend more time at her own place. She doesn't really have a leg to stand on here. "
"If you know for sure she only has a few weeks, why is he under the impression this is going to go on for the foreseeable future?"
"You can TELL him that you messaged her, and see if he changes his story. "
"You're 23 years old, I'm assuming that you have a job, right? If you're able to keep your mouth shut and your opinions to yourself at work so you don't get fired, why can't you do the same for your girlfriend? Obviously you CAN not do the word vomiting, you just don't CHOOSE to when it comes to your girlfriend. So basically, you're treating your co-workers to more respect than your girlfriend. Why is that?"
"&gt; Am I being unreasonable or unfair?

The only unreasonable thing you're doing is continuing to sleep with him and to continue letting him live this little bullshit fantasy in his head. Time to end it. Blocked and no contact"
That‚Äôs what I thought. 
This is the most bizarre thing ever. Not this happening but that you havent called the police yet. Call the police
"Op, GET THE FUCK OUT. He does NOT respect you and he's abusive to you. In another post you wrote he manipulated/pressured you to sleep with his COKE DEALERS (!!! omg) to repay his debt to them because he didnt have money. That is DISGUSTING. He is not your boyfriend he's your PIMP. I feel so awful for you. Please take care of yourself and realize you deserve better than this subhuman trash as a partner.

 Go when he's not home. Pack your things. Delete your pics off his phone. Get screenshots of his group messages with your pictures so you could bring that up as proof in case he tries to post them online (in case he still gets ahold of them somehow). You were underage when those pics were taken (also without your consent might i add) so that stuff classifies as kiddie porn, and if you press charges he could go away for a while. I would also save his friends (the ones in his group chat) contact information if I were you, just in case, because they could definitely be held liable for having nudes of an underage girl.

Also call your parents or someone you trust and PLEASE get out of there. This situation is shaping up badly already, and based on your complacency I feel like your accustomed to your abusive treatment and convinced you aren't entitled to feeling hurt and taken advantage of. You absolutely do, and you need to understand this. This guy is a disgusting abusive predator. Please please get out and never turn back."
"Oh come on. I'm not saying OP shouldn't worry, but falling off track for a year doesn't mean you're ""gone forever"". "
"Could she be weirded out by them ""fighting to get a girl""? It's weird, because in a way they're seeing her as a price. But she is a person. Shouldn't she decide with whom she wants to be with? "
"Lovely idea but that might not work if grandma, assumed to be the owner of the house, was not present during the eviction and if Susan wanted to play hard. "
"Tell your parents if you're worried about your sister. And maybe get in touch with an adult at her school as well. Also, you should explain to your sister that if she's ever made any nudes, then she can literally be charged with creation of child porn, which is not a light sentence and will fuck the rest of her life up."
I have very specific instructions for my ring. I expect a black soul diamond filled with the soul of a slave child so that I can enchant other things. 
"Some people panic and freeze, though. This happens all the time. Mary 1) had the wherewithal to go check on OP, and 2) was collected and brave enough to do something. "
"That ""extreme insecurity"" when you go out with your friends without her is called projection. She knows she's violating your trust when she goes out without you, so she assumes you are too."
"When your depo wears off have a Mirena IUD placed. I don't even know I have mine, when other hormonal BC turned me into a raging harpy. All my friends who have had depo said it was awful. That stuff scares me. I got mine free at Planned Parenthood because I was hella poor 4 years ago. "
"Wtf? You could say the same thing about him. There's really no excuse not to be over a 5 year old heartbreak. Is it not self-centered of him to allow an old relationship to affect his current one so much? OP is allowed to consider her needs and position in all this. If her boyfriend doesn't have to be completely selfless, she certainly doesn't either. "
I think it‚Äôs according to the area. Where I live nurses aren‚Äôt even allowed to paint their nails or wear heavy makeup. 
"I can‚Äôt fathom having people stay with me when I don‚Äôt like people staying with me, so what to feed guests is the least of OP‚Äôs hospitality concerns."
"Well the sister's problems are stemming from an accident that she was in, so maybe the mom thinks that by telling her the dog was hit by a car it will exacerbate the sister's issues."
"What bond? The one where you tolerate being verbally abused at you bfs convenience? 

The bond between emotional punching bag and the boxing gloves?

Girl you‚Äôre in an abusive relationship and you‚Äôve stayed which means you‚Äôre addicted. His nice behavior and the times when you are getting along feel really intense next to the shit behavior. But once you have removed yourself you will find someone else. 

"
Guys do this too. Some feel like it marks a woman as theirs and locks them down. Twisted shit.
"I have been looking through both of those subs lately, and I will be sending my husband too. The whole situation just still blows my mind that people can be like this. "
"Tell her no. Maybe open it to discussion so she can feel heard, but at the end of the day, the answer has to be no. Furthermore, I would be walking back that deal to pay her parents way through life if they choose to drain their IRA for this."
"If you were my best friend, I'd take you out for a beer, listen to your story, empathize, and then at the end of the conversation say:

""Dude, I love you...your friends love you...and one day, you're going to find a girl who loves you soooo much, she'd never dream of fucking another guy.  That girl is out there...there are plenty of girls out there.  There is absolutely no need to go back to a girl **YOU KNOW WILL CHEAT ON YOU**.  You're just lonely, but let's hang out more so you're less lonely.  Wanna go to the gym or the movies tomorrow?""

If you don't have a friend who will do that for you, you need to make that your first priority.  Strong male friendships are the ticket to long term happiness while you wait to find your next girl.  Go develop those."
"Just let her pay for it. She has the means and she wants to do that for you. I think your pride is in the way but really, this is what friendship is. "
"Not everyone is career oriented. You wants kids. The great thing about being with someone who is less ambitious is you will never be asked to sacrifice your career for kids, instead he will probably be willing to be a SAHD. I'm really torn because personally I'm a really ambitious person as is my fiance. But the number of times we run out of laundry, have no food in the fridge, etc because we both work 10-12hr days is not cute. And we've decided to adopt instead of having biological kids cause we just won't have time for kids for at least another decade from our career aspirations. There are good and bad aspects of being with someone who doesn't have the same aspirations or level of ambition but ultimately what you want is a loving, supportive, respectful partner which you have "
"Yeah. It would be weird to cook for myself and have my guest..like sitting there?
"
"Don‚Äôt have sex with drunk, married women. Do better."
Your boyfriend is 41 dating a 24 year old. He has problems. 
Her friend is literally offering to pay OP' s way so she can be in the wedding. How is she selfish?
"Want to protect the next guy? Give her a reputation: A criminal record. The next time she assaults you, call the police. And then STAY AWAY."
"Nothing, oh my god. This isn't about you. People change all the time. I used to dream about getting married; now I think it's a waste of time and money. Maybe getting hurt in that relationship is *why* he's not interested in marriage now, or maybe he feels under less cultural pressure now compared to when he was younger, or maybe he feels that he bigger commitment of buying a house with you is more meaningful. There are a hundred reasons for this that don't have anything to do with you. "
"Now that's cruel :/ Husbands given away for free on Craigslist are often brought up by illegal fighting rings. All he needs is a bark collar, and plenty of exercise !"
I've nannied/babysat a lot and tbh if a kid isn't wriggly and bony and jabby and difficult to hug then are they really a kid?
"Ah yes, I don't use the pesky condom to ejaculate with, I use the wrapper instead"
"Next time, don't get in the car with him. Stay behind and call the cops! Fuck him and you - he could kill innocent people who aren't even involved in your shitstorm of a relationship, and you're just going to be all ""Oh, well I tried, but I didn't want to Uber home, so I got right in the car with him."" FFS! Report him ASAP next time, or you are complicit."
"I couldn't do it. Yes, they are adults and are free to make their own decisions but, given how close she was to your situation and the horrible way he treated you, I would not be able to see it as anything other than a betrayal. 

Right or wrong, I'd be livid at first but it would ultimately boil down to the simple resolve of striking both of them from my life for good. 

With him as her husband, I wouldn't be interested in knowing her. I would wish her well - including a very grave wish of good luck being married to the nightmare he represents - and close the door on the relationship. 

You can't save her. You can only protect yourself, and if you continue this ""friendship"" then you will some day assume her old role of support when this douchebag starts pulling his crap*. 

I'm sorry this has happened. It's a ridiculous situation, it must be surreal to find yourself in it and you need to do what's right for *you* going forward. 

*edit*

*This is assuming that she, as your friend from grade school, was privy to the bullshit while you were going through it. Either way, unless you wish to be thrust right back into this jerk's life, even tangentially, you should run from the absurdity of the whole situation."
It‚Äôs not a fraud alert.  I‚Äôd bet money (that he apparently doesn‚Äôt have) that the card has a ridiculously low limit and it‚Äôs getting declined.
"I hate to sound like a conspiracy theorist. But this is too much of a coincidence. Either way he has already abused at least one other partner. If she thinks she is the exception she is in for a rude awakening. But as much sympathy I have for her, this isn't OP's problem anymore.  Her friend didn't think twice about her abuse or her feelings when she made the choice to be with him and now marry him. She made her bed, time to sleep on it. "
"It probably is not the first time William has done this, I could in fact almost guarantee it. And yes, OP, I will forever be grateful for the person who gave me a heads up on a sibling of mine's behaviors before I let him get control of my elderly parent's bank account. I was not angry, I was grateful. 

If your FWB gets angry I would take it as a sign it's possibly a game the twins play, but otherwise yeah he needs a heads up on his bro's actions at once. "
"It's a fair deal. You two have only been together three months, and he's already giving you a rent discount. It doesn't sound like he's hurting for money, so it'd really just be doing you a favor to let you see what renting is like. Just say you can't afford it, and stay at home.  "
"If you aren‚Äôt down for supporting him through these tough times it‚Äôs probably best you don‚Äôt date him. If you do want to be supportive and keep dating him, encourage him to make time for himself and take care of #1 before trying to schedule dates with you and cancelling them or changing the plan last minute. Tell him it‚Äôs important he get his rest and that you don‚Äôt like getting cancelled on. "
Then you could rephrase your post this way: your depression is so severe that your parents have to tiptoe around you and hide relatively normal aspects of their lives.
"You arguing that her family may move one day is stupid. She can just as easily make the argument that your ex may move closer to you guys one day. It doesn't matter about hypothetical futures, you guys need to focus on the now . And right now, there is now advantageous reason for her to move away. She has a job and family here and nothing over there othet than a child that isn't hers and having to be around your ex all the time. It's right of you to present and offer the option to her but to try to coerce and guilt her into it like youre doing now is wrong. You two aren't even engaged or married - you've only been dating for 2 years. What you're asking of her is too much for the level of commitment you've shown her"

"I completely agree with you. This is a give and take situation, and I only see one person contributing to the welfare of the other.

If a woman asked a man to uproot his career and leave his family to meet the needs of her own, I can‚Äôt help but think the reactions to this post would be completely &amp; entirely different."
I doubt it. They were both huge advocates of me moving here. They both know I love them and that I am completely straight and in no way a threat to their relationship. 
i only cum in starburst wrappers or pencil sharpeners 
If my boyfriend made out with someone else I would want to know.
"What if the scenario was they'd rented the room to a person illegally, and now they wanted to lie and say he'd moved in unknown, to avoid back-taxes?  
    
Or just to have the police drag him out instead of doing a legal eviction.  
    
If squatters rights didn't exist, you could be dragged from your home if you couldn't produce a lease when the police showed up.   Could you put your hands on your lease with 30 seconds notice?  Many people couldn't."

"I don‚Äôt like this advice. When you give a reason that is a half truth or lie people try to bargain and get you to agree. Her boyfriend will just try to convince her that matchmaking will turn out ok, and this whole problem will just continue.

Honesty is the best policy. She just needs to find a way to say it that dampens the blow about his friend but still gets the point across."
"&gt; I'm not gonna stand there take her abuse. 

Then just walk away and don‚Äôt engage with her. That wouldn‚Äôt be taking abuse. Getting abusive back just makes everything worse. Her anger was understandable if not justified; you‚Äôve got no excuse.

Let me guess- you have been having an affair with your coworker? And just didn‚Äôt intend to end your marriage over it?        My guess is if wife is ‚Äúfrom money‚Äù she‚Äôs had a PI involved and has proof of an inappropriate relationship.        Divorce papers are never ‚Äúout of nowhere‚Äù
"&gt;Well and good for couples with no other consideration, but the moment children come into the mix, even married couples must make many adjustments

On the topic of putting spouse/partner 1st before kids, I think it can really ever go into play effectively when couples only have kids with each other...and maybe sometimes when couples both have had kids with other people who are around as often on both sides of the relationship. The whole idea is as a parent you should be wanting to put your kid first, but needing to remind yourself that if you ignore your relationship the arguments/lack of communication won‚Äôt be a good environment for the kids to grow up in. That you need to be a team raising the kid/s. I don‚Äôt think OP‚Äôs girlfriend can understand this at all yet. 

But I don‚Äôt find her comment about it not being her daughter all that troubling on the surface. She‚Äôs likely had minimal chance to have any sort of interaction with her...and honestly it‚Äôs probably better that way. She‚Äôs his girlfriend. Not fianc√©. Not wife. And not every girlfriend/boyfriend someone has should become emotionally invested/start raising a kid that isn‚Äôt there‚Äôs. I mean, I‚Äôm a single mom who‚Äôs going to consider herself a single mom til I‚Äôm married. "

I bank with a two national banks in Canada. It really is not that difficult to get information over the phone. He would have to provide whatever information he used to set up the account to prove his identity. I have never once been asked to provide photo ID.
Have you told him that his excessive worrying makes your issue worse? Otherwise there isn‚Äôt much to do. Not right for him to worry like that
"Dude, have some self\-respect. You can find a guy who will respect you and your relationship together and build something meaningful with them but the first step is leaving this lying and cheating asshole. Does anyone else know about the emotional affairs? Tell someone close to you and ask them for emotional support in leaving your husband. Or get therapy and get the strength to do it yourself."
"then he needs to get his ass to Montreal, I guess?"
He straight up told her it was her first gift. 
"I would laugh my ass off if I was looking at a bowling bowl with my husband's name on it, given to me as a gift. Just thinking of it makes me laugh, I think if it happened for real, I'd probably have tears streaming down my face from laughing so hard. 

I kind of hope he does it now lol.  "
"&gt; You should have given him enough credit to wait for the follow-up. 

I think thats the main point here - does she think so little of him that she took this seriously"
So why be even a fraction of how she really was towards your son if you can recognize the damage that it's done to you?
"&gt;Am I wrong to expect this, but once in a while would be nice? 

You can have all the expectation you want, but WHY ARE YOU PUSHING THIS?

Seriously. She's more than indicated her perspective and you keep ignoring it.

Either break up or act like an adult."
"I'm quite sure that this is your baby, but a DNA test will help you by putting your mind at rest. Your girlfriend has huge fears of rejection, leading her to behave in a way that almost guarantees rejection. She's also very good at denial. She convinced herself that the baby would go away, and when it didn't, she only told you about it when she could no longer deny that she has a baby. She, and both of you as a couple, need counseling. She needs to get past the abuse she's suffered, and she needs to learn to trust you. She feels like she's a bad person, and is acting this way to prove it. She's most comfortable as a victim, and that can become a dangerous habit, to the point of never going away. If you love her and your daughter and want this relationship to work, you must all have counseling. She hid the reality of the baby not only from you, but from herself. ""I'll abort it. No, I'll miscarry. No, I'll have it and give it up for adoption. If I hide it from him he can't leave me over this pregnancy."" She never wanted to face being pregnant with you like an adult; she wanted to ignore it and hope it would go away. Now she has to deal with the very difficult process of raising a child with you, and denial is not a good way to do that, so she does need counseling. No matter what happens, you now have a child to raise, and it's better to do that with a healthy mom."
"&gt; I can think of many different gag gifts that are way worse

I have a USAA credit card. This isn't how they work. He's doing this to himself... And also being a jerk to you. What do you see in him again?
How did you even interpret it that way?????
"The first thing you should do is remove yourself from the backup boyfriend role. Driving her to/from the airport, being her emotional support, consoling her while she complains about her other guy(s)...these are all things you should stop doing if you want to be anything more than a friend.

The real red flag here is that you said, ""I just want to make sure she is happy."" That sounds noble in theory, but it does nothing for you and your own needs."
"You're being wildly taken advantage of in both your low pay and how little respect they have for your comfort, safety, or work-life-school balance. Set up a verified account on care.com and start applying to jobs. Set your minimum hourly rate to at least $15. If you act like your time and skillset are valuable (they are!) you will attract new clients who actually appreciate you and all you do for their family."
"If you don't trust her you should break up with her or work together to talk through these issues. 

You shouldn't be in a relationship with someone you can't or don't trust. How can she be the love of your life if you don't trust or respect her judgement?"
You two are done. End this already. 
"I really think you should get a lawyer and if anything, post this in the legal advice subreddit. We're probably all gonna agree that your ex is serious bad news and that being in contact with her is bad for your daughter, but you don't want to do anything that could get you in trouble. "
To be fair when she outright rejected him he threw a tantrum and started breaking shit so maybe what's he's construing as her flirting is her just trying not to set him off again.
"""I'm not looking for a relationship right now. "" - so she is hopeful for later, not now, but later you might come around. 

Do you value her as a friend and person? Then let her move on from you. Find a new sex buddy and stop using her. "
"That shirt is so on point I want one for myself. Remember that advice, grow that backbone, live your and your children‚Äôs lives first, and then whatever romantic interest you might consider comes second.

This is a totally unrelated question, but are you at all interested in your friend? You two seemed to have a lot in common and are going through similar problems, and they way you talked about her was cute. "
"""Mom, I know how much it means for you to have your best friend's daughter be my MOH... soooo.. I've decided to rescind your invitation as well. k bye"" 

And then enjoy the hell out of your wedding!"
Please ignore that comment. I don't agree with it at all. 
"She had her period last week, and considering our lack of sex since that period there's no chance that she should be pregnant. 

I appreciate your point about having the self respect to break up, but then it also was the only option.

Thank You."
"You don‚Äôt have to be friends with anyone you don‚Äôt want to. Period. You could completely cut ties with them and I‚Äôm sure your boyfriend will understand. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in that situation because that is just absolutely terrible on their part.


You could explain to them that what they‚Äôre doing is racist and purely wrong, BUT it sounds like they‚Äôre extremely immature and so I don‚Äôt know if that conversation will go anywhere. You could quite be wasting your time. 


How does your boyfriend react when they say this to you? Does he know?"
"How are you the dramatic one here? I would sit down with him and tell him this has to stop: ‚ÄúYou are not going to wear me down on this, and continuing to pester me about it is only going to disappoint you and frustrate me.‚Äù"
"It sounds like she might have some issues stemming from modeling. If she started when she was 13, there‚Äôs a huge chance she grew up with some seriously fucked up ideas about sexuality. Her stating that her body is hers, and that she would only let someone she lives inside rings some psych alarm bells for me. She probably grew up feeling like her body was a commodity to be seen and enjoyed by men, while working in an industry that chews you up and spits you out. 

If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, are you guys having a girl?"
"That's awfully victim-blaming. These situations are difficult to navigate and it's hard to find the right answer. 

OP, this woman was abusive and harassive towards you. You didn't deserve it and the only person to blame for it was her. I think you should seek out counseling, if you feel comfortable. There is no ""normal"" here. The way you feel is the way you feel. 

As for you breaking her heart? No. She's being manipulative. Don't take that on or worry about her feelings. Worry about taking care of yourself. "
The ‚Äúoutspoken‚Äù bit stuck out to me as well and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised her eagerness was a large part of why she didn‚Äôt get the position.  
"There are plenty of people who don't want to cuddle with their partner if they are aroused and know they can't have sex because they find it uncomfortable/unpleasant. 

It's also ok to sulk sometimes, and being an adult is also about not making a big deal out of your partner being temporarily disappointed."
"The reality of life is that you will never be able to change someone. You can't make this guy not want to do these things. What you can do is speak your piece and then let it the chips fall where they may.

If you want to date a guy who doesn't do stupid and dangerous shit, then this is not that guy. You are not obligated to tolerate behaviors that you are uncomfortable with just for the sake of being in a relationship."
"So....what standards is OP's girlfriend missing exactly?

Because...she didn't kiss anyone, she wasn't in a position where that would even be a possibility, contrary to what you state she actually did NOT make a deal to kiss the host in exchange for the tickets so....

What's the issue here?  That OP's girlfriend was objectified but didn't react the way that OP, or you for that matter, would have wanted her to?

OP should be asking if she's okay, if she feels weird about what happened, if she feels okay accepting the tickets, etc.  He shouldn't be sitting there demanding an apology for **something that didn't even happen.**"
But she also withheld physical affection from him. Why is not cuddling somehow worse? Isn't it okay to feel bad after being rejected by the woman he loves?
"Brutal honesty here - You don't seem happy in this relationship.  And if you're not happy, you need to leave.  It will likely suck for your (ex)girlfriend, but that's not your concern at that point.  If you don't see yourself continuing a relationship with her that would be happy, it's time to go."
"Yeah, I imagine it‚Äôs similar to when people do very public proposals. It‚Äôs super awkward to say no to someone in front of a crowd. "
"You said these are purebred dogs, so get on the horn with a breed specific rescue asap. This is a terrible life for the dogs, bassets do bark like crazy, but not this much unless they're bored out of their skulls. Plus, horrible as it is to say, someone is going to harm these animals and that will be one hundred percent on your husband's doltish head.

A breed specific rescue should be able to help you, it's what they do."
"I have definitely thought about that, and am looking into it. I feel like I know a lot, and I have an English degree, but I've been in a secretarial position so long, I don't really feel my worth. "
"Under the circumstances, I disagree. For all we know, OPs mom does this a lot and the bf is tired of it. "
Sounds more like he's being selfish... Why get in a relationship and then give them this ultimatum...
I'm sure that part doesn't matter-- assume everyone will be under a microscope. 
"Pregnant women are high risk for being killed by an abusive partner. Op should leave and do so with no warning. Letting an abuser know you plan to leave increases risk to life as well. OP and her children are as huge risk for being killed by this man ( let's not ignore the numbers of partners who kill children to get revenge for the other parent leaving them)

Leaving fast and with no notice is the only safe choice for Op"
"You're right, its not but when faced in that situation you usually have two options, make it better or make it worse."
"Seriously, quitting after 15 years is no joke.  Congrats on the 18 months.  "
"As a healthcare worker, this is the most spot on comment. Instead of struggling to walk at 80, you‚Äôll be 50 and have diabetes with leg claudication due to PAD, and it will feel like your legs are on fire when you walk. With smokers, you‚Äôll have COPD and have to tote a little O2 around, unless you can‚Äôt because the wheezing is too bad.

I see this every single day at work. It‚Äôs horrible and motivates me to avoid that at all costs.

I have seen much older people with better qualities of life than middle aged people who spent their last few years in and out of hospital admissions. Truly, some people are suffering."
"I guess that's what felt disappointing. He just kept talking about how hard his life was. And yeah it does seems pretty shitty but after like age 25 or so, maybe he should have tried to stop getting in trouble? Or is that judgmental? It just felt like excuses to blame everything on the ""life."" But maybe I just don't know anything about that life so I can't really say. "
"Second this, I am on year 7 of trying to find a birth control that works for me. 

I need a higher dose pill for the period, but act like a moody teenager on the higher pill.. But I can't quite justify spending the money on the bar/IUD without knowing knowing it will work for definite."
"Absolutely. I can think of a small handful of people I absolutely cannot stand, like we could never be friends. Even then, if I saw this happening to them I would jump in so fast. No one should have this happen to them."
"I left the LDS church and went through a similar process. Here's what I would recommend:

* Definitely write a letter. Letters are a great slow-form of communication that allow people to consider their response before they say something relationship-ending.
* Do not lie to them and tell them that you are attending a church that you aren't. You also don't have to tell them that you are atheists. Just tell them that you will no longer be attending their church and that your spiritual beliefs and relationship with god is a private matter that you hope they will respect. 
* Tell them that it's important to the overall health of your relationship that you guys try not to discuss religion moving forward, and that if they cross this boundary, that you may not be able to have a relationship with them.
* Get a therapist now. Chances are this conversation will not go well. My mom disowned me for 10 years. There will be a lot of pain and rejection to navigate and you will need to be ready for it.
* Start to accept that if a *parent* is willing to cut you out of their lives due to a difference in religious beliefs, they are no parent at all. They do not love you. They only love you as an extension of their narcissistic egos. They are abusive. It took me years to accept this but it is 100% true.
* I would strongly urge you to go to /r/exmormon and read some of the thousands of resignation letters and announcements that people have sent to their families over the years (use the search function). There are really excellent ones that you could borrow verbiage and boundaries from that communicate their decision with love and urge acceptance in beautiful ways.

Good luck and I'm sorry you are facing this."
"&gt; I‚Äôve asked her about it, and she says that she‚Äôs never masturbated before.

This is in the comment you responded to. I'm going to go ahead and say they aren't doing any of these things. 

Edit: Also this in the OP.
&gt; We engaged in minor things like making out, but it never went farther than that."
Sorry but that is just a backwards and sexist as OPs husbands comment.
You're dating someone who acts like a spoiled child. Do you want to be in a relationship with a spoiled child?
"There‚Äôs no reason for me to believe so. My brother has Aspergers, and he also talks to himself. My brother also doesn‚Äôt deny it. He just shrugs it off and doesn‚Äôt talk about it. I also grew up with him doing that constantly, walking in circles talking to himself. It was never weird. 

But my husband‚Äôs habit is stranger because he *does* deny it.  
ETA: and my husband is *serious* about denying it then accuses me of hearing things"
"You can absolutely disown your family. You're not obligated to remain in a toxic relationship with someone just because you happen to be related to them. These people are committing actual crimes against your husband.

They're clearly immoral people but even immoral people who cared about you would avoid trying to pull one over on your spouse. They're clearly not fussed about you either.

Ditch them. "
"I don't know about worst enemy, but the fact of the matter is that women are socialised under the same patriarchal bullshit that we're trying to move past. My own mom thinks that men get to a point that they're so turned on that they literally can't help but rape someone. She sees herself as a feminist. But she was socialised to believe women are A and men are B, and that's it. You should have seen her face when I first said to her that men aren't fucking animals or machines, and it's always a choice. Like it had literally never occurred to her to question that logic.

I also stated elsewhere that we women are socialised to measure ourselves against other women, against what we understand is ""normal."" A female OB specialises in sexual health, and no small part of that is helping people have babies for a living. It's also very normal to want children. 

Thanks to being socialised to measure ourselves against each other, to compete, and to mold ourselves to the acceptable frame that is ""woman,"" it is perfectly understandable that another woman who sees herself as a feminist will respond defensively against an idea that counters the ""woman"" frame. 

Again, I don't know if I'd go as far as to say we're our own worst enemies, but internal fighting and sabotage is absolutely still a very real obstacle and problem. So at least for the most part, I agree."

"Maybe try ""Hey what was the deal with George again? Your brother said some weird shit and made it seem like that's why your in laws hated me for so long--which, what the hell btw? They held a grudge for years and years because I wasn't George? Even after our kids? That honestly seems literally and figuratively insane. No wonder you wanted to move away."" 

See where that takes you. "
"Yeah but weed is a strong smell. Just like cigarettes, which smell way worse, it sticks to everything. "
YOu good fam it‚Äôs not too big of a gift. It‚Äôs sweet and it‚Äôll show her that you are attentive whenever she speaks. 
"&gt; She said she had 3 periods after we had sex 

It's not yours dude. 

You seriously need to speak to a doctor about anxiety. "
Plenty of women don't bleed during their first time. It says nothing about whether or not she's cheated on you. I suggest you do some more research on sexual health and familiarize yourself with what's to come. 
" I know right, why didn't she bother to check her finances? Or is he so abusive she doesn't have access to them? "
"Agreed. IMO it‚Äôs only seen as softer stereotyping and more acceptable as the culture being targeted is not of a different skin colour. I‚Äôm Scottish-born/Indian ethnicity living in London and hear jokes at least once a week about deep-fried food/tartan/irn bru/freedom/Indy ref and badly mimicking my accent, but no way would they do the same jokes about my Indian heritage!

OP - if the boss is not the owner, inform the actual owner, in an email complete with screenshots of the messages he sent. If the comment wasn‚Äôt enough to get him in trouble, the rude texts he sent would hopefully see that it doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone in the future. Also worth checking with Citizens Advice Bureau to see if they can advise in any way. :)"
"This sounds very manipulative of him. Is he really just this clueless or is he trying to hurt your self esteem and make you feel grateful he deigns to be with you?

Either way it's shitty and you should not tolerate it. This is HIS problem to sort out, not yours, and you should make it clear you won't stand for him saying things like this to you."
"Be the mature one. Minimize contact through the funeral and after. Be polite yet don't be talkaltive with him. Try to never be alone with him, perhaps it will disuade him to fight you or beg you to reconnect or something like that.

"Thank you, I needed to read that. I guess I have been tiptoeing around the issue for too long. But you‚Äôre absolutely right in everything you‚Äôve said. "
"both of you grow the fuck up, dump all your/her friends, get back together, build trust and make new friends. but find out if she cheated first"
"Let it go, you sound like a child when you say ""she needs to learn that using people and lying like that is bad"". You can't make her learn anything, even if you do take things in your own hands and act out some petty revenge scheme. 

Cut your losses, block all contact, and let it go. Learn from your own mistakes and stop worrying about hers - especially when you only care because you think she needs to be taught a lesson, not out of any actual care for the girl. "
To what extent were you supposed to make relationships with her family? Do what you feel is best man.
"&gt;Am I doing the right thing by leaving &amp; seeking help for my aggression?

####Yes!

You got physical with a woman who is pregnant with your child!! There's also a minor child in the home (her 6 year old). **It's over! The relationship is toxic and dangerous to her and her children.**

Don't come back. Co-parent. Seek help for your anger. Don't be a deadbeat."
No. That is not normal!
"And if she meets him in a public location, accompanied by friends, and he gives it back, it won't be theft. But if he makes excuses, or delays, or does anything short of everything he reasonably can to return it- theft. "
"Your brother was in a vulnerable and lonely place. He stumbled upon some very predatory parts of the internet. He is now who he is today.

Try internet dating and tell everyone what you just told us. There‚Äôs a lid for every pot. 
Report him. Do not confront him; it'll only scare him into deleting it.
"This is tough. I have no words of good advice other than be direct with him. From my experience, during times of grief people need directness and honesty. You can‚Äôt do much about what‚Äôs going to happen so I‚Äôd say just love him as much as you can and understand that people this young rarely have to deal with such a situation.

Best of luck to you. I believe in miracles."

She's just not that in to you
"People react unpredictably during confrontation.  I agree you need to be careful and don't visit her door to discuss this with her.  The close  proximity it could turn serious or obsessive.  She might be doing this because she loves the drama in her life.  

Save the text messages, do things in writing for proof in case it does escalate and you need to involve authority or legal action.  I hope its just a simple matter of cutting contact and it's over.  But you just never know.  "

"&gt; Should i have apologized for something I don't think i did? 

Yes, you should apologise because often in these cases, Intent doesnt mean shit. You dismissed her by attacking her with the fact that she is on her period. I will repeat what I said in another comment: When she says you are gaslighting her, its because women are told that periods ""make them crazy"". And that indeed what you are perpetuating. "
"&gt;Also his argument that ‚Äústrippers use their body as nothing but a tool‚Äù, that they are ‚Äúdisposable.‚Äù He said ‚ÄúWhat value does a stripper have, as a stripper, without her body?‚Äù

"I don't know if you do this already, but brushing your tongue after brushing your teeth helps bad breath. Gonna ask a personal question here. Does your breath ever smell kinda poopy-ish and do you ever get these solid yet squishy white chunks in your mouth? If so it may be tonsil stones giving you bad breath. Throw down like $40 for a waterpik and blast those babies away. To reduce their occurrence stay well hydrated and cut back on carbs. "
"A facility absolutely can not force her to comply and they can refuse to allow her to move in if she doesn‚Äôt want to be there. She is of sound mind and she‚Äôs allowed to make her own choices.

"So the grown up response to your suggestion, should have been ""um, No"" and then a discussion on what song you could chose together to represent both of you.

Wtf is a coming out party anyway? Is that a thing? It sounds absolutely pathetic. 
"Okay, you need to make your health a priority then. Cyst or not, his reaction to your question about sexual health is a total red flag about wether or not he would even share with you if he ever had an sti. If the smell is that strong you need to bring it up with him in a matter that shows him that you care about BOTH of y‚Äôall‚Äôs health. I would not be okay with wondering if my boyfriend has an infection and could potentially spread that to me. You need to possibly get yourself checked as well. "
"yes, i think i was trying to be gentle but i feel so bad for that poor little girl in particular. also, seems as if she has no family other than her mom, and i feel terrible. 

however, the mom not taking her kid to have fun and sending her to daycare all day and not reading to her is not something you can report someone for. she is giving her food/a roof over her head/a safe place to be/all her needs/not abusing her- just providing her with no love, which in the eyes of the state is not a crime.

i would also say whever she got the dog from, if op goes there and says, hi, ____ who you just adopted a puppy to has done x and x and x in the past, any reputable breeder will want that dog back. however, if she got the dog from a puppy mill or pet shop, unfortunately they will do nothing. but if it was from a good breeder or a rescue group, i think op should contact them. i would NOT steal this dog! not! because i worry that would be stealing if she paid for it."

"While I don't doubt money is probably a factor, I understand how financial stability would be an important factor to consider, especially if the fiance himself isn't THAT well off yet on his own, or has a role in the family business. The sister is young, too, and presumably in love and has been trying to be seen as a worthy partner for almost a decade. I can see how it would be tempting to meet their expectations if those were the only conditions under which they'd accept her into the family. In my experience, rich people can also be very prideful, and old people used to getting their way because no be one will stand up to the family matriarch/patriarch. Rich old people are often the worst! But if not getting their way means no marriage or committing to being cut off... I'd imagine the lifestyle is hard to give up, and life can be difficult for new couples without the luxury of the bank of Mom and Dad. 

While I don't think feeling pressured to compromise with the new family makes her intrinsically a bad person, the concerns about what kind of family SHE's marrying into are certainly valid. That being said, I'd imagine after this long that she knows what she's signing up for. 

Personally, if I were OP, I would bring up a few of these concerns- especially about the inlaws; will fiance have her back or his parents when it comes down to it? Hopefully he'll learn to support her first- and this could be an opportunity for him to shine up his spine and go to bat for his fiancee's family. 

Maybe your sister would be willing to compromise, and you would of course attend the wedding, but sit with the family instead of being a part of the ceremony. That should take enough focus off of your pregnancy during the ceremony to discourage a case of the vapors without completely excluding you. It still sucks a bit, but you could still participate in everything else and it might be nice to sit down if you'll be far along. If guests ask if you're married, just say that you and your partner have been together for 4 years. Equivocate without lying, and if anyone makes noise about it, you can point out that you two are getting married, just after the baby is born. Last I checked, Mary and Joseph were supposedly engaged or still 'pledged to be married' when she gave birth to Jesus, so it should be fine, but I'd imagine the real issues are closer to pride, image and embarrassment on the behalf of the inlaw family more than an actual religious objection. 

Honestly, even in conservative circles you're doing the 'right thing,' so no fuss should be made, especially if you're going to be sitting, so the inlaws can't even claim they're being forced to support something they don't agree with. (Personally I think people like that can go suck a duck, it's not like Jesus would personally take you aside and tell you that you shouldn't support your sister on her wedding day, but to each their own.) 

I could understand her removing you from the wedding party to take attention off of you and compromise with the inlaws, but you should definitely not be uninvited from the wedding. You're pregnant by a long term partner who you love and intend to marry, not a mass murderer or a pedophile. 

When you two meet for lunch, I'd see if she would be amenable to compromise. If she is, this would be a great opportunity for your sister's fiance to support your sister, and act like he's going to be the head of his household- not at the kids table of his parents' house- even if it means mild opposition. She is going to be his family now, her feelings should outweigh his parents opinion of what's proper. 

If he's not willing to back her on inviting her own sister, who she has a good relationship with and *wants* to be there, that's indicative of a much larger problem, and more issues to come. Compromises with family are understandable, expected even, but ultimatums are a different story. 

Good Luck, OP! 
"
"Yeah, this has been super out of left field for her, and I guess I had complete trust in her decisions so I just went along with it and haven't seen a problem"
"Yes, but that's a big if. If the OP really paid for that stuff then I doubt he would say he didn't buy her a present. Those things are obviously presents."
"&gt;He hates the idea of being ""mediocre"" and feels like he could never live with himself if he sacrificed this -- he feels the need to help people and express himself through his work to the best of his ability. 

He has told you very honestly and very clearly that he'd hate himself and his life if he doesn't put his career first. Don't stay in this relationship hoping or expecting him to change. You would be shooting yourself in the foot. 

He feels so strongly about this that it's easy to draw parallells to the threads on here about religion. What he wants in life clearly clashes with what you want, but you're willing to ride it out and hope that you can convince him that he's wrong. It's like a religious person staying in a relationship because they believe that the atheist will one day see the light. Respect him enough to believe that he knows what he wants. He's 26, not 18."
"This is nutty, next level negging shit. "
"&gt; That being said, you two sound fundamentally incompatible because this is obviously so incredibly important to her and it seems important to her that her partner shares her enthusiasm

Why are you completely glossing over the fact that OPs girlfriend is being abusive?"
"She has had discussions, which have been fruitless, so yes -- breaking up is the right thing to do. However, I have seen some formerly clueless people jolted into reality by getting a little taste of their own medicine, and I don't think it's inherently immature to do that."
 Nope. She handled this exactly right. 
"Because she was trying to be polite to you by kindly telling you not to touch her. As a woman, when we have to shut down someone it can be a scary situation when we do not know how they will react. And even though she was polite, you still managed to scare her.

If she came here for advice, I would advise her to speak with HR. That‚Äôs how inappropriate this is, whether she told you or not."
"She has just escaped from an abusive marriage and has moved in with her boyfriend of a mere 7 months? *And* you're a cam-model?

Dude, this isn't going to work. Living with a new partner early on in a relationship is no way to heal from an abusive relationship. In fact, it sounds like the worst way. 

With no disrespect to you, dating a partner who does sex work is doing a relationship on hard-mode. I've done relationships on hard-mode in the past (poly relationships, sex-worker relationships), not everyone can do them. A woman who has just escaped from an abusive relationship is in no place to do a relationship on hard-mode. The fact that your line of work that makes her uncomfortable, and it's a line of work that you do at home, the home she only *just* moved into, and you've only been dating for *seven months*, is only just increasing the difficulty. 

This is not the right relationship for either of you.  "
It's disgusting. I came across nsfw fanfiction of a literal adult and toddler a while ago and there's nowhere where you can report things. Vile.
"Next time he says this, just tell the guy that it‚Äôs pretty sad his sense of humour hasn‚Äôt matured in the last 7 years.

Also, the guy who is saying this likes you.  It‚Äôs a totally batshit crazy way of dealing with it and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend addressing it, but I bet you anything if you run into this guy in like 5 years he‚Äôs going to drunkenly admit that he‚Äôs had a crush on you since he was 11.

"Yeah I didn't mean that he was going to be a serial killer! Just in my experience as a teacher that behavior is pretty uncommon. I've never had a kid that age swear at someone in anger (as opposed to in a ""haha 'ass' means butt!"" kind of way) or use threats. The only kids I've worked with who are violent towards adults are in pretty heavy-duty special ed programs. If he does eventually act out in school, it would be taken pretty seriously, which could be a good thing (if it means he gets some help and guidance) or a bad thing (if it means he gets labeled as an aggressive problem child) depending on a lot of factors outside of our knowledge. "
"Good on you for leaving him. I noticed at the beginning of your post that you said it‚Äôs hard for you to leave him as you feel like you can‚Äôt be attracted emotionally and physically to anyone else. And honestly, none of that matters if you can‚Äôt be happy with the relationship you‚Äôre in. It‚Äôll feel hard and painful to leave him now but just remember that it‚Äôll only get easier from this point on. Leaving him isn‚Äôt as painful as the shit he has put you through and you deserve so much better. "
"So the thing you were most exciting about for this trip was a visit to the museum; your friend took her time with her meal, cutting into the little time you had available, got upset when you asked her to please speed up, got more upset when you referenced her anxiety, and then abandoned you and ran off once you got into the museum, so instead of being able to enjoy the experience, you spent the entire time looking for her and freaking out. 

Seriously. Was she kidnapped? Did she lose her phone? Was it out of battery? Was she physically incapable of receiving a call or sending a text got an entire hour? Or was she just upset that she was doing what *you* wanted instead of what *she* wanted? Because it honestly sounds like she was punishing you for asking to do something for you, instead of making her and her needs/wants the centre of attention. 

&gt; I'm currently visiting another city with a really close friend,

&gt; but it's been hard to get away from the hotel or spend lots of time in a crowded area. When we're at the hotel it's totally fine and manageable and we can just dip down to the hotel room.

It honestly sounds like the majority of your trip has been spent in the hotel or hotel room instead of actually exploring the city you're visiting. And if you are out in the city, your friend is panicking and *you* are trying to manage her anxiety. 

I think in future, if you're going to spend time with this friend (and really, I would raise questions about that), do it in spaces she feels comfortable in, because taking her out of her comfort zone is just causing misery for both of you. But most importantly, she's an adult. You are not her carer. Her anxiety is *her* responsibility to manage, not yours. "
"Without leaving a note or sending a text to warn his partner in case she opened it and was injured? And taking the time to gather the tools he needs and then putting them in his sock drawer? Yeah, no. That's completely ridiculous."
"I mean, sure but she's already had sex with him. And honestly like I said that part of her life is none of my business. They're always at his place and never at ours. I don't think that I'd do this to my daughter, I stopped grounding her when she was  15/16 because I thought she was capable of making her own decisions. She works constantly, pays for her own car/gas/insurance/cellphone/clothes even her own food as I don't cook much and my daughter likes healthy food. She does still live with me though, but I'd feel really uncomfortable treating my daughter as a child when I know how mature she is. "
"He makes 40k a year? A quarter of that would go to daycare for ONE child. I don't think you're very realistic about how expensive children actually are. Try to understand where he's coming from, he probably wants to enjoy life without a massive financial burden. "
Agreed. You don't get kudos from doing the *minimum* of what you're supposed to be doing as the father of her child. Sheesh! I'm also 7 months pregnant and I'd be pissed off too if my husband spouted that crap! You need a swift kick in the pants and an attitude adjustment. 
Sounds like a lucky escape. At least you have family and support around you right now. Take some time to heal and recover. Then work out where you want to live and what you want to do.  Follow your dreams 
"She's projecting her own feelings of guilt for not resisting more, and she's expecting you to have somehow had the emotional self reliance and maturity of an adult when you were a child. This is may be something you can get across to her - that it's not fair to expect teenage you to have known what to do, that it's not really fair to expect that of any teenager. Also, it usually takes people till they are adults to realize just how fucked up things happening in childhood were - children accept the world as it presents itself. It's growing up that includes the realization that things are not right, and growing up even more to realize that things don't have to be that way. 

She may realize this on her own. 

But it's also possible she's decided to refuse to own her trauma. When bad shit happens to you, you can focus on yourself and how you deal with it. But that is really hard to do, especially at first. It's an easy and tempting to put all the bad feelings on to external targets. She can be mad at you for not speaking up, because then she doesn't have to be mad at herself for not speaking up. When she feels anger or anxiety or anything negative, instead of facing down the emotion and conquering it, she can indulge it by dwelling on all the things that happened.

"

"Definitely not fair considering that he is the sole provider of the house, which brings its own stresses. 

I personally cannot see how she figures going out to the gym and with her friends is equivalent to him going to work to provide for the family. Taking care of the children is a job, which is equivalent to him doing his job in the morning. Then he comes back to so more work and she goes out with her friends...."
"Mm. I see. That's not how that works.

But, just for curiosity's sake, how many times has your boyfriend been on the ""right"" side of an assault charge? "
OP can be criminally liable in some states if she knows statutory rape is occurring and does not report it and even facilitates the relationship. So it definitely does matter what the state specific laws are
"&gt;I tell her I think she should go into therapy, but she tells me ""I'm not the problem, my sister is""

Tell her that she *does* have a problem in thinking that she can be her sister's keeper. Ask her if she wants to be somewhere with her sister as her dependent roommate because that is what will happen if she allows this disruption to your marriage."
You're family - why are you less important?
"Do you know what the most common time in a relationship is for a woman to get killed by her abusive partner?

When she leaves him.

Sounds like this dude has even more resources to harass, attack, and possibly kill her than most domestic abusers.

This woman may not wish to file a restraining order to avoid pissing him off. And they do absolutely *nothing* to stop an abuser. They are simply a piece of paper and any cop knows that. And if she files charges and he gets arrested for abuse, let's be honest - sounds like he'd have plenty of people willing to talk about what an upstanding dude he is, pay his bail, maybe even a union lawyer.

She is likely following the 'grey rock' method of getting rid of him. Be boring and nonconfrontational and fade away. Don't piss them off, remove yourself, don't suddenly cut off contact or file charges to avoid them retaliating.

I know you are scared of getting involved because this dude sounds scary as fuck. But it does sound like there are good reasons for acting as she is. Maybe you could discuss security measures with your wife and the woman, together. Adding locks, setting ground rules like 'do not give him our address or even hints to our location', maybe your wife and the woman both need pepper spray, discussing maybe storing her car somewhere so it isn't outside.

You have the chance to help save this woman's life. Please try to overcome your fears and do what you can to help."
"So you're with a woman, raising a child that isn't yours, and she cheated on you?

If this isn't a troll then you need to run, you have no responsibilities here. This woman has no respect for you, she's been using you as a wallet and a safety net while she continues to sleep around"
"To be fair, those are all things that you have to do in whatever house you're living. Needing to turn off the water valve to the washing machine is unusual, so I think that having a little sign is reasonable. "
"&gt;its like ya don't read. theres a whole other side to this story that you don't know.

&gt; She bit my face. My goddamn face. It hurt like hell and I told her so. She said, ""But I didn't mean to hurt you"" and ""But it's affectionate"" and ""Please, next time I won't bite so hard."" But she always does bite me again just as hard



I am genuinely curious - what possible other side to this could there be?


She clearly is 100% aware she is causing OP pain.


She clearly is 100% aware OP wants her to not do that anymore.


And then she does it again. I just can't see any other interpretation. 

"
"So let her act like that. And if anyone asks why you aren't willing to be her friend, be honest with them and let them know that she mistreated you. You don't have to go into details, but you shouldn't hide the fact that she's a shitty person towards you."
"Ok, so lets recap: He is a cheater, who is also an asshole, he yells at you gratuitously, he frequently ignores you and he asked for a time alone... I say you give the man his time. A long, long time. Hopefully forever."
"The actual FWB process isn't a shitshow,

Only the first example she gave of her history, sleeping with friends, was a FWB 

mislabeling casual dating as FWB is half the problem. I had several longer, very successful FWB sitautions because there was nothing at all about our interaction that resembled dating.

doing mushy stuff and dating and then calling it FWB is just setting one or both parties up for heartache. I have no bad blood or awkardness with the people I had my FWBs with, because we were actually in a relationship that would constitute FWB. In two cases the end was that the other person did start to think they wanted to date, they told me, and we stopped the benefits aspect of our relationship. because we actually were friends, that was okay to do. 

I really don't understand why people do this to themselves, it's completely avoidable if you use the right terms and transition the relationship and label accordingly. "
"In my opinion someone saying they 'are not looking for a relationship right now' simply means they are not talking to someone that is worth a relationship.

I feel like people don't look for relationships they kind of just hit you."
"&gt; Fwb (21/F) says that she has feelings for me (22/M) and wants ""something real"" but when I say I don't she still continues to keep sleeping with me? Am I taking advantage of her?

Yes. You are."
"Hahaha thank you very much, it's definitely a defense mechanism"
"I know it's been said already, but sometimes women bleed while pregnant and mistake it for a period. This happened to my friend. She missed a period and thought she was a month or so pregnant and was going to get an abortion, but then found out she was FOUR MONTHS pregnant (and kept the baby). She was astonished to find out that it's fairly normal for women to have bleeding that seems to be a 'period'. 

Birth control is not fail proof. My sister has two wonderful children, both conceived while on birth control. The pills rely on you taking them at regular times/not missing any, can lose efficacy while on certain medications or even if you have vomiting or diarrhea, etc.  

But, with all that said, she's probably not pregnant. She's only a week late, and this could be for a lot of reasons (diet, stress, exercise, whatever). BUT SHE MAY JUST BE PANICKING. I wouldn't automatically jump to the conclusion that she is manipulating you. I know some guys like to believe that 'most' women are manipulative and just want to get pregnant and trap a guy...but really most of us ladies are not like that. But some of us do get scared by irregular or missed periods. She is young and might just be overreacting. 

YOU NEED TO HAVE A LONG CONVERSATION WITH HER and find out exactly what is going on. And if you want to break up with her, then you need to go ahead and do it. 

IF she actually is pregnant, you still need to break up if you don't want to be with her. Demand a paternity test once the baby is born, if she chooses to go through with the pregnancy. 

But whatever happens you need to have a real serious discussion with her IMMEDIATELY. "
"&gt; Do they go dog walking alone or does his gf go with them? Going alone is kind of inappropriate since it has nothing to do with their project. She can stop it.

Seriously, is there some unspoken agreement where married people can't have friends?! Better go tell my fiance√© to warn his friends in advance I guess..."
"If she's coughing up blood x3 times a week she needs to be receiving immediate medical attention. 

Dude, I hate to be that guy, but this immediately smells like a somatoform disorder. Undiagnosable mystery illness? 5 times cancelling before meeting your parents? Sounds like she's got some off the charts anxiety and it's manifesting psychosomatically. Has she ever seen a therapist?"
even more so the IUDs? Asking for a friend who def doesnt want to get pregnant...
"I hear what you're saying, but honestly, it shouldn't be this hard to adjust to an unusual task. I moved to the UK from the US and was surprised to find you have to turn your outlets on and off. My landlord told me that leaving the washing machine outlet on is a fire hazard. I've never before lived anywhere where you have to turn off the washing machine outlet (or the other outlets), but I heard ""fire hazard"" and got used to it right quick."
Yeah I‚Äôm very shocked that they didn‚Äôt talk about it!! Her poor boyfriend! 
"I did this when online dating too! I deliberately used very silly pictures, action shots, silly face shots etc and surprisingly I got thousands of messages a day- I remember my friends being shocked because they were like but these pictures of you are so not 'dating profile ' type pics, some are downright unflattering! But I guess they made me look fun and approachable and also like what you saw in the pic was likely to be what you'd get in real life, instead of taking a shot on some airbrushed, angled, photoshopped picture. I really recommend using 'bad/silly' profile pics for dating- it also does weed out a lot of the more shallow people I think. "
"I'm going to agree with other commenters that if he doesn't soon, he might need to be hospitalized. start with liquids or jello, if he's refusing to eat out of wanting to die, you ought to call an ambulance."
"I think I agree, I don't like it it when people treat me like a fragile lamb before I've had a chance to react.. Save the ""you're very creative and do a wonderful job, blah blah I love you"" for if she gets upset. 

The bottom line is that you don't trust her with your hair because she has not followed your instructions in the past. "
"Unless he's leaving the money on an exchange, it is in the form of a key that he should privately own. "
"I am sorry you're going through so much pain, but think about each time she caused you pain with her threats! I am sure the pain is probably just as bad, but different. My Mom once told me (it's a german saying, I will translate) ""lieber ein Ende mit Schrecken, als ein Schrecken ohne Ende"" - meaning: rather a horrible end, than the horror never coming to an end"". It has helped me, and it made me feel better knowing that the pain will stop eventually, way better than suffering constantly.

I wish you the best of luck with creating a new, and better version of yourself; loving yourself so much, you won't let people use, abuse or hurt you in a way that you don't deserve. I am saying this, because I know what it feels like, when you are ""too nice"" to people who will take advantage of you. Life is better when you can stand up for yourself, and don't let people walk all over you. 

She will probably try to lure you back in, most likely, so stay strong and see how you feel in a couple of months - you forgot what it feels like when no one will stab you in your chest with mean, evil words! This phase will pass ... and as someone has mentioned before, try the subreddit narcissisticabuse ..you might find some emotional help there and understand why people behave like this, or at least comprehend that there are people out there who do things we will never understand!

And eventually hope for her to change, because if she remains this type of person, she will end up like this again, and again, and again. Being like this will never give her the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship that is healthy!

STAY STRONG!!!! All the best for you.

edit: spelling"
I Wouldn't bother. Even if there is a slim chance he didn't why be with someone so disrespectful of your relationship and you that he would treat you like that.

"It may be useful to routinize your meal schedule a bit more. If you're eating the same types of foods regularly, it takes guesswork and effort out of ordering groceries. Also, maybe try a set day to order food (like every other Thursday). This would make it less likely you would put it off until there's no food in the house. I'm a procrastinator so I've had to implement strategies and systems so I'm not always rushing at the last minute. Finding routines that work for you is key!"
Either way it's no skin off any of us when you eventually crash and burn
"I saw the other person comment saying they weren't ready and for some reason thought somehow I would be better prepared.

I was seriously mistaken and now I'm crying. I don't know why I thought that."
Childish? It sounds like you have a strong bias against video games. It‚Äôs no different from other hobbies. It‚Äôs interesting to see an 80s stigma alive in 2018.
"Been there done that. It only leads to disaster if you keep pursuing things hoping it'll change. All you do is continue to invest into something you don't get the same out of.

It's harsh but at least he was honest about not seeing a relationship with you, because when someone tells you they're not ready for a relationship 99.99% of the time it means they don't want a relationship with you.

"
"&gt;Should I force a break up so he can move on?

I think you should be honest with yourself. If you break up with him it's not for *his* sake, it's for your own. You wish to punish yourself for your actions, to lessen your feelings of guilt. It's not because he'd be ""better off"" without you. 

IMO, the better way to deal with your guilt would be to accept you did something bad and then strive to do better. One choice doesn't make you a ""bad person,"" and doing something bad doesn't necessarily make you irredeemable. Clearly your boyfriend has forgiven you. Isn't it time for you to move past this too?"
"It could be argued that it was not a gift but a trade (plane tickets for access to hotel), but that wouldn't change the outcome since OP followed through with her end by paying for the hotel and not preventing him entry."
That's still manipulating you and trying to get you to stop what you're doing. She might not even mean to cause you distress like this but it's still controlling behaviour and really troubling for a 22 year old.  This is 14 year old girl behaviour. 
I think it's possible for you guys to be friends. Just not now or any time soon. No contact is the best for now and maybe down the line you'll meet again and can try being friends.
"Your wife is a terrible partner! What a stupid fucking excuse too. ""It was too hard with the baby crying at home"" What the fuck?!

I would contact a lawyer RIGHT NOW. Start figuring out how to get away from her. I'm so sorry OP. You and your baby did not deserve this at all. "
Facebook official?? Sorry but this sounds like something a 16 year old would ask. 
"You're right, and I'm sorry because it always sucks to realize that about someone you felt close to. But you'll be better off without her in your life for sure. "
He's **18**. Idk how emotionally mature you were at 18 but this story sounds about right given his age.
"How did you find out and how did you stop them?


From where I'm standing, everyone in this whole situation is sounding sketchy. Including you. Did you snoop through her stuff?


You don't trust her. She feels like she can't be honest with you.  


What kind of future does that spell out for your relationship?"
Thank you.
"I would just be straight with him:

Mr. date, I‚Äôm really enjoying getting to know you and I would like to continue to see where this goes.  I‚Äôm just a little confused about where you are at because we slept together that one time and since then you don‚Äôt seem like you want to persue a physical relationship.  I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm reading this wrong, so I just thought we could check in and discuss where we are at.  I‚Äôm not trying to push for more sex, more just get a better idea of how this is going for you.

"Maybe, that seems easier than losing a best friend. Thats why i feel terrible about putting my husband in this position. But it's not really my fault..I've tried for years to be friends with this guy. We all have the same interests and enjoy the same activities. He's similar to all of our friends besides the fact that he just hates me."
"He's been living a double life, hiding things from you. It's important to be open and honest in your relationships. He's telling another woman he loves her. Instead of trying to fix the problems that he alone created, he tried to threaten you emotionally to get you to give in so he could get his way. That she needs to be careful about what he says or promises, because he's okay with using people to get his own way, and while you don't want her to be scared, it's important that she's aware. That you couldn't pretend everything was okay, and have her think that kind of behavior should ever be acceptable in her life and her future relationships. And that while there might be difficulties as a result of this, that you always love her, no matter what, and will make sure she's well cared for above all else.

Also, therapy. Some joint sessions with you both, and some solo ones for her (and for you too)."

"Okay my perspective may help here because I am chronically ill and unable to work. My boyfriend helps me with chores but I'm still young and my parents are supporting me financially. 

Your wife's illness is not an excuse for behaviour. If she's still fully mobile, why isn't she helping with chores?! I have a condition that makes me faint if I stand too long and chronic back pain that makes bending strenuous. 

So you know what I did? I got a rollator and am able to sit and help with chores that way. I can fold laundry, I can do dishes and help meal prep or cook. It's not a whole lot but it's what I'm physically able to do and just that bit helps a lot. 
Carer burnout is so common and you can't keep going like this or you're going to make yourself sick. Hire the housekeeper, your wife doesn't get to interfere with this because that will give you some sanity back. Your teenagers are more than capable of helping around the house. It's not mean to make them help, you can't go on like this.

You're not a bad person whatsoever. You're in fact a wonderful person by the sounds of it. But you need help and your wife can either go to counselling or figure out a way to cook for herself. "
American Eagle boxers are the shit! Love them! (am female as well)
"Definitely break it off. He was aggressive, he defended himself, and even said *if he was even more aggressive it would be okay* because you could handle it. He didn't apologize for it, he just defended himself and told you he could've been more violent and would have no qualms about it, then joked around with you to play it off. You tried to have a serious talk with him about it, and he blew you off. 

He has no remorse for doing that to you, and he told you he's willing to hurt you *more*. You need to leave him because this is a huge red flag and he'll definitely hurt you again. "
I switched entirely to boxer briefs and I have no idea how I lived for 20+ years wearing panties. I'm so much more comfortable now! 
"Sounds like you're an aromantic asexual, like me. I went through a similar experience of feeling like a ""freak"" who had something ""wrong with me.""

I'll tell you what I wish I'd known then: You are not a freak and there is nothing wrong with you. Our orientation is rare, but that doesn't make it any less valid. You can live a happy and fulfilling life without romantic or sexual relationships.

"Agreed, but the problem comes when it doesn‚Äôt really get better. I don‚Äôt know what industry OP‚Äôs wife works in but in my industry doing these things does not always equal getting the promotion or raise. It may help, but it may not. So I guess it depends on the ethics/setup of the place that she works for. "
"Agree! Absolutely do not accept this.

I pay $20/hour for my two youngest kids (aged 2 and 4) and then drive my babysitter home afterwards. I'm a single mum of 3 and I'm a speech pathologist (not raking it in by any means!), but I would never devalue my babysitters time by offering $10/hour, that's a joke. As two doctors, they can totally afford it and should be putting more aside to cater for the care of their children while they work. How cheeky of them to try and low ball you. I would be furious. "
"Not really. Your own suspicions are not proof of your suspicions. And also, you sound a little stalker-y.

"I don't really think there's anything to be embarrassed about, much less that you have to do anything here. "
"Maybe he should do drag.

Honestly though, your boyfriend sounds selfish and manipulative. There are ways he could further his career as a stylist (like dressing people for creative photoshoots, videos or events) without using you as a muse in a way that seems to rob you of your own agency and tastes."
"I can't tell which part of this bothers you more: the fact that he has a dog or the fact that he has contact with an ex. So I'll address both. 

*People have pets. Regardless of when he adopted the dog, he's 24 NOW which is a perfectly reasonable age to take responsibility for an animal. 

If you don't like animals, then plain and simple don't date someone who has an animal. But don't make it into more than it is by claiming you question his decision making skills because he adopted a pet 4 or 5 YEARS ago. Tell him you don't like dogs and end things. 

*People have exes. And sometimes circumstances require that we continue to be in contact with them, such as shared custody, friends, workplaces, mortgages or financial ties, etc. 

He shares a dog with his ex, I share a child and a credit card with mine. At the tender age of 24, you're going to have to start being ok with people having lives before you entered the equation. Unless he is swapping dog duty for dirty photos of his ex, I don't see why her existence even matters. Would it be better if he shared dog custody with his brother? Or an old roommate? They obviously aren't together and are taking responsibility for caring for an animal they both love. 

If you don't want to date him, then just don't date him. No need to drag his past life under a microscope in order to justify it. "
"I remember when I was young and someone finding out I liked someone else was the biggest embarrassment ever. 

But it makes no sense. ""yeah, I think you're attractive"".  Big whoop. You didn't even out yourself out there with a grand gesture and were rejected. You simply revealed to someone you thought they were attractive. No biggie. "
"&gt;Completely unimaginable how I'd survive without her.. She is my life..

Honestly, this is scary.  Especially for a 18 year old. You're like the Nice Guy that happened to actually get the girl. 

That kind of togetherness is not healthy, and when your girlfriend says she thinks you're treating her ""too nice"", she doesn't mean that.  She means that, while she knows these are ""nice"" things to have done, it's too much, and it's suffocating her. 

You're not gonna break up with her, but when you guys eventually break up, work on yourself before dating again. "
"Boundaries are very important with toxic people. If he is unwilling to admit his actions and take responsibility for them, if he continues to be harmful to others, you should keep him far away from you and those you love.

"It's the opposite where I am.  Daycare is cheap as hell.  $30-40 a day.  Babysitting is $10-15 an hour.  It is expected that when you operate a daycare, you have some efficiency.  $5 an hour doing daycare might not sound like much, but a kindergarten teacher watching 20 kids at a time for 40k a year and nobody bats an eye (about $1.50 per hour per kid).  

Your comparison is still useful though.  She is not babysitting, nor is she doing daycare.  She is a Nanny.  Nannies get more due to them being devoted to one or two kids, and therefore are not able to stack up like a daycare would.  "

"In all honesty. You are moving, will probably never talk to some of these people again. If someone brings anything up act like it doesn't bother you.

It's hard sometimes to accept that you can't trust someone you thought had your back, but you can't trust this guy enough to even be friends with him. He's the jealous type, so continuing the sexual relationship and him having access to your home (don't leave the garage open) while moving forward with dating others is a scary prospect and could turn into something dangerous.

Its ok to have days where you feel like your breaking but now you have a beautiful baby girl to take care of.  With your daughter you will know unconditional love thats unbreakable. I'd suggest you go back to therapy for yourself and cut those toxic people out of your life. Do you really want that for your child? You've just had a child and look how distraught you are? You dont deserve that, you should be happy with the arrival of your little one. Im just an internet stranger but i truly believe you are a strong woman and will get through all this. Sending internet hugs if they are wanted."
I'm glad you see it. Its really hard to look at facts when we genuinely love and WANT to trust someone.

Maybe see if she wants her parents involved yet? They might be part of her problems
I think you need therapy. You're self sabotaging.
"Or rather put the focus elsewhere: ""that guy has been giving angry looks when he is bumped""."
"HE DATED YOU WHEN YOU WERE 17 AND HE WAS 34? If he‚Äôs not a cheater, he‚Äôs definitely a creep."
"While I agree that blowing them off isn't the right answer, I also strongly disagree that arguing their points over email is a good idea. This is why ""don't justify, argue, defend, or explain"" is common advice. When someone feels strongly about something and is known to treat you poorly and disregard your opinions, when you respond to their critiques with your reasons they don't see that the way you want. You're hoping her parents see ""oh, she thought about it and solved the problem, good"". That's not what they'll see. They'll see ""she's open to reason and I still think I'm right so I should argue with her more"".

I think she should talk with them, in person. Thank them as you suggested, tell them their advice was valuable, and that she decided to move forward with the house. Skip rationalizing the decision; it's done and can't be changed, so treat it that way. Then she should express how excited she is and change the subject to something more positive, like the moving plan, decorating, if she wants to repaint a wall, if she's excited about a view, meeting neighbors, etc."
"The fact that she's over enough to consider herself *in the right* by making a ridiculous request like this means she's lucky your roommate hasn't thrown his own shitfit to get her to pay HER portion of the utilities.  Which, unlike her, he would be WELL within his rights to do, you know, as the de-facto owner of the goddamn place.

And the fact that she can't see that gift horse for what it is should give you pause for a few reasons.  First, she's entitled.  Second, she will foist the responsibility for procuring and maintaining her entitlements on you.  Three, she's selfish.  Four, she's shortsighted."
"Sure, move in with a girl that you literally don't know her name or age. Sounds great

Plot twist, she's 14"
Your partner shouldn't be a fixer upper. He should be great already

It sounds like she has been so traumatized that she is reliving it every day. Not talking about it is not going to make it any better. You need to let her start to express some of the emotions that you shut down when you blamed her.
"This is way beyond reddit.

You need therapy, and your daughter needs it too. Separately. Stat. She is not even close to beginning to get past the trauma, and is displaying sociopathic traits now. It doesn't matter how ""nice"" she is to kids. Cycles of abuse are real and she could move on to harming people, though it isn't like dogs and cats are acceptable victims either. This is EXTREMELY CONCERNING and goes FAR BEYOND ""oh no I want an animal but she might kill it."" This is potentially life or death both for her and anyone she may harm. You have been the adult this whole time and haven't protected her since you knew, by first getting angry and then by not getting her professional help. Apologise to her NOW, sincerely, show how sorry you are that this happened, and give her some avenues of who to talk to. She may be past the point of listening to you at this stage, I don't know, but you have to try again and again until she believes that you do care. She probably feels like nothing. My heart breaks for her, even though hurting animals is awful. She has been to hell and back over and over from a young age and was even brave enough to speak out and never got the support she needed.

Oh and if you didn't report the abuser then that was another glaring issue. He will hurt other children. They need you to do this for them."
"This! Forgive the money, but then just go do you. Let her watch her son. It‚Äôs your vacation, you don‚Äôt need to spend it being guilted into watching a 4yr old child in your own. "
I've planned two funerals and each of them only took an afternoon.  Most funeral homes and churches have done so many funerals that you just tell them your preferences and they handle the rest.
"Honey, bring the baby if you have to. There will be some lovely nurse or technician there who would love to snuggle them while you get your very, very urgent needs attended to. Trust me, the hospital would rather figure out what to do with your child than have you die of complications. My mom is a doctor and her hospital has had this excat thing happen tons of times. She's always happy to snuggle a surprise visitor! "
"How does she handle it when she gets an answer wrong for something or makes a mistake? How does she handle being called out on mistakes or even differences of opinion? When there is an error, does she accept responsibility for her part in it or does she try to brush it off onto someone else or other outside influences?

Judging by her reaction from this one event I would assume she can't stand doing anything wrong and doesn't want to take any sort of responsibility for that. So (in her mind) it's your fault that she had to stop dancing you were being the mean one by not letting her do exactly what she wanted (dancing whereever she pleased) and she wants you to apologize for you not seeing that what she was doing was perfectly fine (You didn't want her to bump into him again but she would've been fine if you guys kept going). "
Thank you
-Why- do you keep letting this toxic person back into your life?
"I don't know about you, but if my sister was in danger by putting her life and well-being at risk, not giving her the opportunity to leave the house for a few hours would be the least of her problems."

"That is beyond crazy controlling there. Fuck this dude

Also, OP, I am crazy jealous because I went on nepxlanon for nearly 2 years and all it did for me was give me a nearly nonstop period for 18 months. You‚Äôre so lucky it works well for you. Don‚Äôt give that up for some douche "
"That‚Äôs so true. I‚Äôve never thought of that. When we first got married, she would message him constantly, asking him to come to her house and do stuff for her, like hard labor. She has her own husband that lives there, and is perfectly capable, maybe moreso, than my husband. 

My husband works full time 2-11, and doesn‚Äôt feel like driving 20 minutes to her house at 11pm to move stuff to her storage shed for her. "
Take the baby with you. 
"&gt; In the beginning, our relationship was terrible

Why wasn't this just the end of it? Dating is to figure out if you are compatible with the person, how did you even get past 3 months of ""wow this sucks from the start"" much less 3 years? The beginning of a relationship should also be the end if it sucks. 

Dude sounds like he needs therapy and to get dumped for being financially nutso. After he gets dumped repeatedly over finances and his wonky views of them he might figure out HE is the problem."
"First, have you verified that you need a Masters degree to advance in the field? And will it increase your salary?  Will your industry in the US accept your degree from Europe?  I‚Äôm an American, and when I looked into Instead‚Äôs MBA Program, I didn‚Äôt apply because one of its weaknesses was a lack of a network here. :( 


If those are all positive, then apply. If you get in and decide to go, then break up with him.

"&gt; I don't know if this will help, but maybe try to analyze Jason. What makes him Jason? What makes him so appealing to you? What about your sex life with him was different? Understanding is key. 

Honestly this seems like such a simple idea yet I've never considered it. I did some soul searching and realised it seems pretty simple: I've never been as attracted to *anyone*, including the long term boyfriend I loved, as I was attracted to Jason. Now, why is that, seems a more complicated matter and I don't know how I'd unpack it honestly. 

And Jason was always really into showing just how into me he was. SO I guess I have a validation kink lmao. So combination of those two factors drove me crazy. 

 However, there's absolutely no one in my life I am attracted to on that level (or on anything near that level), and i don't really get celebrity crushes or anything of the sort, so I guess I am out of luck. "
"victim blaming is when people blame the victim of a crime for that crime being committed to them (rape, robbery, assault)

"&gt;Well, his latest issue is that he wants my Nexplanon removed, and he wants me to go on the pill instead, where he keeps the pill pack in his possession and gives me one every morning so he can watch me take it.

"&gt;Wait until she gets older

Men this predatory would probably kick the poor girl to the curb for a younger girlfriend. If the girl had become emotionally invested and finally dependent by this point, that can be very devastating to be left for a younger woman.  "
"I was told on their wedding website that there were only a certain amount of seats. That you had to RSVP to be guaranteed a seat. I don't think that there was a substantially large group of people that were going to attend this dinner. The text that I received, stated that I would not be able to sit with the group."
Yep!! One of the best decisions I ever made. :) I went from a person with lots of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù but who never quite fit to a person who belongs.  It made a huge impact on my life. 
"True. Hugs. You know when parents react differently. At very early age. I was the low-maintenance kid. The accident. The train wreck kid was ‚Äúgritty‚Äù and the oldest was a Jr. namesake. Gritty got admiration for being bad boy, especially from our mother. Jr. was doted on by our father and his family. Thank goodness for my mother‚Äôs parents that were nice to me and as I got older was obvious they were hoping to fill an emotional void. RIP mammaw and pappaw. You done good. I know I have made you proud."
One more reason your girlfriend shouldn't move to follow you. What a nightmare scenario for her.

"I‚Äôm going to be blunt. 

What‚Äôs the point of a relationship where neither partner fully trusts the other? Relationships are *built* on mutual trust and respect. "
"This is very true.  The GF isn't bad for wanting to be someone's #1 priority, and 2 years is plenty to make a lifelong, true commitment.  The daughter needs her dad closer (i didn't have a dad--MOVE CLOSER TO YOUR DAUGHTER), and the GF needs someone who will put her first.  Both are right.  I think this means the end of the relationship, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Children complicate things, in a good way, but still.  They will affect every relationship you ever have from the moment they are born, and I don't blame a woman for not wanting her man's ex and kids to come first.  I've been in that position and I walked--fuck being number two, even if it's for the kids.  I would hate a man for NOT putting his kids first.  But they need to sometimes.  The GF needs her own man and children, let her go and find them.  OP needs to find a woman who is similarly complicated and who will put her kids before him and his kids so it's equal.

It's sad that it means he'll never be able to put a woman first in his life, or he's a shitty dad.  It's why I don't date men with kids anymore (really ,ever, but now it's a firm rule).  The kids have to come first.  I will NEVER be ok with being #2 given I was with both my parents.  So I just don't go down that road.

But see what I wrote there?  My dad being gone has partially ruined my desire to have children, and I never have (and it's nearly too late now).  So OP needs to move closer to his kid and find a woman in the same situation he's in."
"You should think about how things are going to work if you do move closer. Have you talked to your ex about this? If your ex is happy with the custody arrangement you're currently observing, she may not be happy to give you more time with your daughter just because you move closer. In that case, are you prepared to go back to court? It sounds like you coparent well currently and this may not be a problem, but it would suck to uproot your life and then have shit unexpectedly hit the fan.

You should also consider what happens if you don't move. Long weekends with a 3 year old are great, but those are probably going to stop as soon as she starts school because kids can't just miss a day of school every month. In a few years, your custody arrangement is going to have to be rethought and you may or may not like how that plays out. Usually what ends up happening is the kid spends breaks with the parent they don't live with; this means longer uninterrupted visits, but less regular visits. Would you be happy with that? If not, it's another tick in the ""move"" column."
Have you thought about massage? It‚Äôs a great way of getting touch that is all about relaxation and healing.

Your dad sounds like an asshole. I'm a father and I would never tell my kid any of those things. He sounds like a know it all that really has no clue. Is your mom in the picture still?
Korea and Japan are pretty openly touchy between same-sex friends.

She allowed him to sleep in her bed and snaps him.  What boundary is he creeping on? ...cause she seems completely up for it. The only one disrespecting boundaries is OPs girlfriend.  She‚Äôs not a victim in this situation. 
He hurt your cat - he intentionally caused her pain.  Cats do not act that distant for such a long time without good reason.
"I actually just went through two backpacking packs two weeks ago.  I had crap in them from 2008.  Luckily it wasn't food :-p but yeah, stuff can stay hidden in there for a long time.  "
"She didn't do anything right, either. Inaction isn't enough when safety is concerned."
Yeah wtf. She found a condom wrapper but he should break up with her if she asks to see his phone? Wtf how else do you find out if someone cheated? 
"Your story brought me to tears, I'm so sorry you experienced that.. just the idea of possibly making my kid feel unwanted in the hypothetical sense cuts me to bits. I can't imagine a life like that. I'm glad you got therapy and hope you have better people in your life."
"I honestly chose not to have kids partly because I‚Äôm terrified of inadvertently being as awful to my kids as my mom was to me. I‚Äôm a fan of straight talk and don‚Äôt have a poker face, which isn‚Äôt great for kids. But I wish my mom had tried harder to put a parent filter on her interactions with me. "
"I think the harsh comments are letting her know the potential repercussions. It's great this woman is aware of what she's doing, but tbh her rhetoric was, imo, still full of palpable resentment for a four year old. Sometimes, the real advice is harsh and comes with a touch a judgement. That's life. "
"Not resentment, but self preservation. We learn very early. Few things are literally out of the blue :("
"Came here to say the Same thing. Do not let her stay. No need to cause a scene but you have a right to be angry at both of them. Your husband (emotionally) cheated and lied to you. She knowingly violated your marriage by sending nudes etc. She doesnt get to enjoy the comfort of your home. She can pay for or find her own place, other friends, the shelter whatever. They sure as hell werent taking your feelings or discomfort into consideration when they were sneaking around, sending pictures or blowing you off. And your husband had no problem yelling at you, ignoring you et cetera. Again, no need to go all ‚Äòjerry springer‚Äô on them, but you do not have to be nice or welcoming to them AT ALL. 
Good look to you and good riddens, your husband showed you what he is capable of and what kind of person he is. Who want to be with that anyway?? You truly deserve honest, loving people in your life. "
"I imagine the problem might be less her being concerned about you prioritizing your daughter over her and more her concern that you might prioritize your ex over her. 

I think you guys should seriously consider a few couples counseling sessions to unpack all of this together.

It's pretty reasonable to want to be near your family. You can't really resent your girlfriend's desire to stay near her family when your ex moved away to be...near her family. It's especially reasonable to want to be around family if you have kids. Which you don't, with your girlfriend, but do you want to? Does she? Where is your relationship going? 

Moving would be a sacrifice for her. How will moving areas impact her career? Is she ok with those changes? What if she can't find a job? Is she going to want to have a resume gap? Is she going to have to retrain for a new industry? Will she want to? Will you support her without comment through this, since you're the one asking her to sacrifice her life in your current location to move with you?

What are your intentions with her? Moving with you would be a huge commitment on her part. What would you be doing to reciprocate that commitment?

I don't know the answers to these questions. Do you? Does she? If you don't, seriously consider the counseling. A moderated discussion is really good for clearing the air."
"That doesn't really have anything to do with OP thinking that just not addressing her demands or concerns, and carrying on the same, somehow equals them working out their issues together. Or in what world that would somehow be proof of nothing going on. "
"She's already in a women's shelter.  There is no need for you to think about where else she may go.

"Oh I agree, I wasn't trying to absolve him in the situation. I just think she has so much she needs to work on that their relationship won't work regardless of his behavior. I think she needs to focus on her own behavior before she tries to parse out his level of wrongness."
"I completely agree! A babysitter gets the kids dinner, plays a little, and puts kids to bed before just hanging out waiting for the parents to come home. What OP is doing is nanny-ing. "
"The bank isn‚Äôt being difficult. If he truly has the money and the money was actually his and he could prove his identity, it wouldn‚Äôt take much to clear this up. That‚Äôs why everyone says this is a scam. Isn‚Äôt doesn‚Äôt make any sense!! 

Why was it so urgent you pay off your student loan with your moms money right away? There is absolutely no good reason to do this. 

Why hasn‚Äôt the overnighted documents to the bank if fax/email is an issue? It isn‚Äôt that expensive, I do it all the time at work. 

Why hasn‚Äôt he gone up the chain of command at the bank? For a customer with 100k in the bank, an executive would be happy to take care of any customer service issues instead of risking losing a customer. 

Why hasn‚Äôt he booked a flight to Canada to withdraw his money and change banks? If the bank refused my access to 100k you bet your ass I would be there in a heartbeat. 

How could he just forget his security question answer?? What‚Äôs the question?? Is he really an idiot?? 

Now do you see why nothing makes sense and it sounds like a scam to literally everyone. It sounds to me like he can‚Äôt prove his identity... "
"If she doesn't feel like having sex then she doesn't have to have sex.  She doesn't owe you sex.  You've told her how you feel and she told you she has a firm boundary, now you have to respect that boundary.  If your needs are not being met then you break up because you are not compatible."
"Again, I‚Äôm sorry for not clarifying in my original comment - what I meant by valid was valid in her own clearly unstable mind. In no way what she did was acceptable. If she went through with adoption (after hiding this pregnancy and child from her long term boyfriend) and this really was OP‚Äôs child that would be utterly disgusting in my opinion."
"It is hard!  I thought I'd be OK with an open relationship til I tried it.  (I know your situation is different, but they're in the same ballpark.)  It's one of those things that's just really different to experience than to think about, and it can be confusing to feel so bad about something you thought you'd be OK with.

It's also complicated for you because the participants are your friends, so you can't just say, 'Oh, we'll never see them again and we can just move on.'  

Be kind to yourself, don't drink too much, and don't be afraid to talk it out with your boyfriend."
"You can ask for whatever you like. Personally, I'd walk.  "
Thanks for the feedback. That was my initial decision.  I just have to move on and remove myself in their lives
"Wtf? Wtf is wrong with you??

People use snapchat all the time for reasons unrelated to sex. That's the least objectionable part of your comment that I can reply to. "
"Yes, its crazy.

You don't know this guy, not at all. You know the carefully curated image he and his management team have created for his fan. You don't know anything about him. You have a crush. Its fine. Enjoy the crush. But anything you do to ""pursue"" a man you have never met... its just going to come across like stalking. And that'll be no good for anyone."
In this case i'm not sure her husband leaving would be a horror story. He is obviously lying about the money and is now acting like a complete ass.
"You need to get into counseling ASAP.   Your wife has to understand that your son's well being has to come before her romanticized ideas of reigniting this bond with her ex.  How to go about verifying the DNA and informing the son should be part of counseling.   

As should your current marital issues.   Your wife is looking for a ""bond"" elsewhere when she should be working on her bond with you and her family."
no. Olga's not going to learn a lesson. OP is going to learn a lesson. 
"So how much do you think is fair to pay? 

Rent isn‚Äôt indexed against your salary, it‚Äôs pretty much fixed, so you‚Äôre getting an apartment at 50% discount already. If you think of it this way, he‚Äôs going to be paying $600 towards you getting your own apartment for the month, since he still has to cover the rent.

If you‚Äôd been together for years maybe it would be different, but a few months isn‚Äôt that long.

As another poster pointed out, his salary sounds good until you think about the debt he has acquired in order to get it, so his situation isn‚Äôt that good. "

"Working on my MSW in clinical social work right now, and rule 1 of *any* kind of psyc work: Don't take it home. That means not spending time on clients when you're at home, and it also means not viewing friends/family/other personal relationships the same as you do a client. They aren't projects for you to work on like a client is, and if you try to see them that way you're going to run headlong into an ethics violation of one kind or another.

Also, add my contribution to the ""this is why you don't keep banging after the breakup"" advice pile. Although, like you, it's a lesson I had to learn the hard way, so I can empathize with why you did what you did. However, you can't keep doing it, and it's time to let go."
"I think you need to establish very clear boundaries with your mother.  You are not her parent, and you are not your sisters parent.   However, your sister is/was a child so you will be there for her.  Have her live with you, maybe go to a community college to take her core classes and then next year go to the university you work at.   Not ideal, but at least it is a start and will get her out of your parents house.

Tell your mother to put on her big girl pants and get their taxes down.  They have little kiosks at WalMart for gods sake!   Beyond that, you don't want to hear about her marriage anymore.  She complains, you listen and offer sound advice which she immediately discounts, things get worse and she comes back to complain.  Rinse and repeat.

It's not good for you, but it is also not good for your mother as it is enabling her to stay in this marriage.  And hell, it's not good for your father either because as long as he has your mother smoothing his life for him he doesn't have to change.  

Break off from the shit show.  But take your sister with you.  "
"Honestly, after reading more for your updated. I am revoking my 'Fuck Him' attitude. I assume he knew he had a child? If that is the case, I wouldn't stop looking for my Son ever. And when I found him, if he wanted it, I would want to be part of his life. Your Son needs to know now. He WILL find out. How he wants to approach it is up to him. 

And I can even see your wife's point of bringing him into the fold. From the sound of it, he did nothing wrong. This is stuff she should of been doing all of her life. Your Son will not stop seeing you as his father. Don't start with holding the truth now. This is all going to come down to everyone relationship with your wife. Can you, or do you want to stay with her? This is a monumental lie. What will your Son say to your wife? He relationship will be forever damaged. Even the other kids will see their mother in a very different, negative light. 

And this is not because she was in a bad relationship, Or scared for her life or her sons life, Or to make a better life, Or to escape anything!!! This is all happening because she didn't have the balls to tell her racist Dad she banged a non-'Italian'! 

Sorry my friend. This is not a good situation and will be messy for the foreseeable future. But you said it a few times in this thread and it won't change. You love your family, and this is your Son. You were a good father all his life and raised from what you said a wonderful man. Be there for him going forward. Understand what he is thinking and help him work though this shit. Get him in therapy if you think he needs it. He is a man but he is still a kid who is going to be on his own soon (well, at college). He needs to have a strong support network now more than ever. It could be a rough time for him. Luckily he has a good father. "
"people keep suggesting couples counseling, and this seems to be a common thread when a partner cheats, but no amount of counseling is going to fix this. your wife decided to hold onto a grudge after a previous incident instead of making the choice then and there to either attempt to repair your relationship or leave, and is now engaging in a totally unethical relationship with a man 15 years her junior, and she shows no remorse whatsoever. it seems to me like she's blaming you for her complete lack of morals.

have some self-respect and be a good example for your kids and leave this marriage. it is not worth saving. your kids are going to find out the truth eventually, and the last lesson you want to teach them is that this kind of betrayal is okay for them to be on the receiving end of in their own relationships. i don't know what happened between the two of you, and maybe your involvement damaged the marriage in some way, but it was *her* choice to cheat rather than leave.

go to counseling to help you and your kids get through this, but skip the wife."
"Honestly, you are an asshole and I‚Äôm with her friend. Your taking advantage of her as an easy lay. She likes you and she hopes that the more she sleeps with you, the more you‚Äôll like her. You need to stop even if she doesn‚Äôt want to stop. She‚Äôs just saying she‚Äôs cool with it, she isn‚Äôt. You should stop talking to her and definitely stop sleeping with her. It‚Äôll hurt her now but in the long run she‚Äôll thank you "
"SHOVING ‚Äî&gt;  Relationship is over. 

End things and get out. She‚Äôs REALLY abusive."
"I agree with this. If he wants another chance, he needs to come and ask for it. Trying to pretend this can be smoothed over if your ex-friend isn't willing to change is ridiculous. "
You aren‚Äôt FWB. You‚Äôre the B without the F. I wouldn‚Äôt take this any further. 
"**EXACTLY!!!**

I've been there- done that- and paid a 1.5k dud tax. I WAS an  ATM and bangmaid to this asshat. He would even demand that I help him with ""fines"" in cash. Cash not a check. I stayed until ""I forgot my wallet"" for the 100th time happened with the plus of getting yelled at for not getting his Red Bull + Newport 100s ( As a non smoker I got kings thinking they were the bigger size). And if you're wondering no, no he didn't go into the store with me he demanded I buy him garbage and then threw a fit when I couldn't return the cigs.

Seriously these types of guys are the worst. I bet he starts fights because he knows OP doesn't like confrontation. I know my dud did."
"You don't see it now because he seems accomplished, mature and sweet.  But someday you'll realize he is very likely not even as mature as you are.  A 42 year old man who gets involved with a 20 year old is stunted socially or emotionally.  He's very likely manipulative.  You'd be way ahead to get out of this now.  It won't end well, you'll get hurt and eventually you'll see him for what he is.  "
"From her other comments, she's nearly naked in these photos (that she was unaware of being taken) and the texts aren't cute I love you stuff, more like the times she was spilling her heart about not the best personal stuff that happened to her.

"I was gonna say, what rocks is she turning over to find these people?? I haven‚Äôt had a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù like this since my teens. I think she needs a serious adjustment in her search criteria. "

"I don't think so, in this case--it sounds like he thinks he should get the biggest piece of food regardless of the situation, even if the wife is just really hungry or was active all day or whatever. I guess it would make sense if the two of them were getting just barely enough calories to survive and had to go hunt the pie or whatever. "
"Uh. If the word ""teen"" is after your age... you're a teenager. It's the literal definition. "
"I think it might be a good first step to just fix your relationship with him first. I hope you do, I'm really rooting for you two.

1. Give him a genuine apology. With a clear acknoledgement of what you did wrong and a promise not to do it again.

2. Give him a gift or gesture you think he'd appreciate. Some gaming equipment or his favorite food maybe? Just to help ease it in and show you're sincere.

3. Ask to hang out sometime. Watch a movie together or have a nice dinner or lunch out. And talk.

4. Tell him you noticed that he's been acting sad lately and that you actually care about his well-being. And hopefully he will trust you and you can help him."

"&gt; His lifestyle will make his final days hard. Generally speaking, people who eat poorly and neglect health have kind drawn out deaths, while healthy people die suddenly. 

Have to agree with you there.  I'm definitely a *live fast* type of person.  I didn't quit skydiving until my fifth month of pregnancy (doctor said it was okay), if that tells you anything about me.  

However, when I was 23, I had a health scare and started taking really good care of my health.  The first thing I noticed?  All of my extreme sports became way more fun when I was in better physical condition.  Even at 24, I felt more awesome when I cleaned up my diet, cut back on drinking, and began exercising on weekdays as well as just going crazy on weekends. 

AAAAAAND I'm 42 now.  I have friends that are my age that are in mobility scooters.  Most of my kids' friends are practically barnacles. Were it not for the fact that we just got a blizzard, I was supposed to take the kids rock climbing today. 

I am super stunned at how very little most of my peers can even do anymore.  They're good for an hour or two on their feet, and then?  They need to sit down.  

But advice to the OP?  What's your social situation look like?  Are all the 50 year olds in your life barely mobile couch potatoes?  If you don't want to be like them, you guys need to start hanging around with people who are NOT couch potatoes, and learn from them.  It's not simply turning up at Planet Fitness for a few months - It's getting yourselves into a community where you can have older, active role models. 

Some things that I can suggest would be joining a hiking club (lots of fit 70 year olds in hiking clubs) or volunteer at your local trails / conservation area.  Social dancing is another place where you'll see fit adults.  Start running and join a running club - those are big where I am.  In other parts of the country, it's cycling.   Maybe crossfit?  Ideally, you can do this with him.  But if not, you can do it yourself and he can get to ""see"" some of your new healthy 60 year old friends.  "
Thanks for your reply
"I was honest about it - I always have been incredibly transparent with him, as I don't like to play games. I just felt that I would have rather had him in my life as a friend, if nothing else."
