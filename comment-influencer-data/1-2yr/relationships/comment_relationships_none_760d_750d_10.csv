"One time we were in a hotel with my family. I took my 5 years old nephew to the pool and of course she wanted to swim without her floaty on. I firmly told her that no, if she wants to be in the swiming pool with me she has to use it. She insisted that her mom allows her, which I knew that is true since I saw it before. But I refused and told that if she wanted to not use the floaty to wait for her mom to come back in a hour. She decided to wait and stood on the edge with her feet inside the water untik her mom came.

A mother knows what is best for her child and she can be as strict or as flexible as she wants. Me? There's no way I'm taking that risk. I'm babysittjng here, taking care of a child that it isn't mine."
"It is fair and you did ask. SIL told you the truth: She's not interested in doing that training and it's unlikely to stick on this older dog. You think you're sleeping poorly now—just see how bad it is while your SIL is only half-ass trying to retrain that dog not to be in the bed.

You can ask for anything you wanted, but your question here was how to do it AND still have your SIL spend the night. You might not get both of those things. It would also be completely fair for your sister to say ""Uh, no. My dog sleeps in the bed with me. We'll stay home then.""

You can speak to her again and try, but I suspect you are going to have to decide which you want more: Your SILs presence, or a dog-free bed."
"It's not uncommon to end as you two have. You've been together through a period of time where we all do a lot of growing up, and that often means growing in different directions. You both deserve partners that share your goals, when that's no longer true splitting up is the best thing to do in the long run. "
I think that would be best. Just so you are mindful of what's helpful to your friend. 
"These aren't fantasies. He is leading a double life, lying to his parents or friends, etc and is asking you to help him create the lie.

He is posting these weird fantasy photos to his family or friends as what his life looks like."
"I'll jam my face in my boyfriend's pits when he's sweaty. He smells so good! This is, of course, objectively nasty and I would probably puke if I did it to a stranger. "
"Thank you for the small claims court suggestion, I didn't even think of that. 
And that's why I'm so baffled everyone thinks I'm overreacting, everything is in my name. My mother JUST went through a similar situation with my uncle a few years ago. "
"Well honestly, you're not entitled to their honest explanation.  ""No"" is really all you need to know here."
"Honestly if I had a kid and she pulled something like that I think I'd like to know about this situation. This shows a pretty callous disregard for other people's belongings which isn't going to be fixed unless it's addressed. A phone is relatively expensive and important object to someone.

Your cousin sounds like the reasonable source. Calmly explain to her what happened, stress you're not worried about the damage so much as her flippant attitude. I'd wager you cousin would thank you for letting her know. "
Just move on. You don't owe anybody anything. 
"The ADA does not cover morbid obesity. Source, I am ADA certified. :) It would cover the mobility scooter just because it is unlikely to be that different than an electric wheel chair, but it would not cover reinforced chairs or anything of the sort.

"What do you want to hear, OP?

I mean, even your statement about not wanting to say you don't find Sarah attractive betrays your intent. If you're that obvious in this post, then your crush on Sarah must be very plain to your girlfriend. Hence the ultimatum.

Nothing you can say can change your girlfriend's mind at this point given what she has seen already. It's time to choose."
"Phone aside, you have awkward silences all the time. You just don't connect and to be honest if a woman is really interested in you she would ask questions about yourself. "
"&gt; I should have defended her honor and reminded my mother her place was grandmother. I was trying to tell her how difficult of a position she was putting me in. 

You need to put your wife over your mother. Your mother does not get a say in how you raise your child."
"""Liberal"" guys are plenty capable of being sexist. I know the type well. They pat themselves on the back for having a female boss at work or thinking women should be able to wear what they want, but foam at the mouth when asked to actually give something of ""theirs"" up out of respect for a woman's choices. 

Name changes are particularly thorny in my experience. I too have known a few women who caved purely to end the argument, because their partner wasn't budging. This has had the effect of ensuring that I, personally, would die on this hill if it came to it. I am very fortunate that my boyfriend truly does not seem to care (though sometimes guys change their tune when they actually get engaged), but the hypocrisy of men demanding this from women as if it's their due for overspending on a shiny depreciating asset has rubbed me right into a deep trench on this matter. "
"If that's the way things are done, I'd just go along with it. Your family would be able to benefit in the same way from any women getting married, right? Don't die in a ditch over this. 

Other posters saying you can bend these traditions may not understand the strwngth of social and cultural norms. 

Her family gets to earn $ from the wedding because of deep-seated patriarchal traditions. Women get the raw end of the deal in most of these--let this instance of a small benefit to them go!"
"This is pretty much the best and only answer. But here's some reassurance OP, no matter what you choose it's not silly. It's your life, your hair. You like it short and that's what matters. If he's willing to throw away a **5 year** relationship over what essentially boils down to how much protein sits on top of your head, he's the silly one. He's not the one that has to maintain it, he's not the one that has to deal with the heat it puts off. I keep my hair long, usually around my waist. It gets heavy. I get actual headaches from the length of my hair. It's thick, so it loves to try to tangle. If I don't comb it every day, it looks like a massive rat's nest. I cut it to about my shoulders once and LOVED the relief. My bf missed the long hair. This is how that conversation went:


Him: Babe, I miss the long hair. It was sexy.

Me: Are you going to brush it every day and wash it for me? Because I don't want to go back to that.

Him: Short hair is pretty hot too, I just miss the long. You do you.


**THAT** is how your bf should handle it. Your body, your choice. He is entitled to express his opinion, but he is not entitled to demand you change your body to meet that opinion, and it kinda sounds like he's trying to do that. Anyways I'm rambling now. Best of luck to you OP.

EDIT: Formatting. I forgot single line breaks get wonky."
"Hey OP,  I think 2 weeks is perfect! Perfect for prepping yourself for divorce from your so-called husband. 

Please do not fall for the sunk costs fallacy. 10 years is nothing compared to the lifetime of hurt he is going to cause you and your kids if you do decide to stay with him.

I am sure you will be a great single mother and co-parent! Him, not so. Notice that he will only leave after he said she is tired of him. He did not appear to be tired of her and still wants to be with her."
I would show him this post and the comments. Seeing mass amounts of people point out how utterly pathetic he is might be a wake up call. 
"He absolutely has trouble with attention, like he's off in another world. But this is just so much more. I mean it doesn't even make sense. He KNEW all the details and it was like he woke up in some other reality just long enough to make a reservation. "
Wow - all these together suggests some kind of brain injury :/ 
"You assume that because your lives are different that hers is somehow less difficult than yours.  That attitude and approach to others will not serve you well.  You are not in anyone else's shoes and do not know what they deal with, how they feel, what challenges they have, etc.  

Listen, if you don't want to be her friend, then don't.  Candidly, you don't sound like a very good friend.  But stop justifying it by your ""woe is me"" attitude."
I have to chime in - only because I'm a 33F and I've done this more than once to two different men (my ex fiancé and my current husband of 6 years). You aren't alone and I swear it's just a natural reflex. 
"&gt;will admit I don't understand the full story for,

That is because it's bullshit."
"I always feel so bad when this comes up. Not getting into the car when your parents are drunk takes a lot of courage and strength that some young children may not possess. It means standing up against your parents and keeping your resolve. I know, because I've witnessed something similar. 

My alcoholic aunt and uncle were supposed to drive my cousin and I home from a family BBQ, but they were trashed. Cousin and I felt uncomfortable, me more so because this was her ""normal"" at this point. When we tried to protest they began screaming at her to get her ass in the car. Cousin stayed still and tried to say no again and the situation escalated. Yelling, insults, threats... 
By the end my cousin was a shaking, blubbering mess. I knew if I hadn't been right next to her she would have gotten in, but she was embarrassed by the fact I refused to and was shocked it was even considered. I tried to diffuse it by lying and saying my mom had said we could stay at our house instead. Eventually they relented and left without us. 

Alcoholic parents don't like being called out. Just ""not getting in the car"" can sometimes turn violent, which I've also witnessed. It horrifies me that children - anyone - has to go through that. 

I can sympathize how hard it would be for that 13 year old to say no in that situation. We're taught to trust our parents, that they'd keep us safe from harm. At such a young age it's shattering to realize that's not the case... 

I think OP really needs to call CPS. I imagine that would be hard, too... but her sister is a child, and I doubt she'd get much say over her parents. She can try and always prevent needing them to pick her up, but I'm sure situations will still arise where it's not an option in the moment. 

The parents need cut off at the source. OP should contact the friends parents and all put in a complain individually so something is actually done. "

"Frankly I would think that everyone, even parents, would agree possibly catching a murderer and bringing a family some justice is more important than a birthday party.

Totally unreasonable behaviour from them. "
Yeah. Not using dating websites is a fair request in a relationship. 
"What?  No. It's the only emotionally healthy thing to do, at least until enough time and events have passed to allow you both to be fully over the emotions of the relationship.  You can't heal when you are constantly picking at the wound (by seeing them /being reminded of them)"
"As a person who *has* a PhD, I want to tell you to rethink your life plans. If you want to work in academia, it is absolutely *senseless* to assume you know where you'll end up once you finish your degree! You may need to move halfway across the US from your partner in order to get a post-doc or assistant professor or even lecturer position. Unless you are 100% comfortable with earning a PhD and then *not doing anything with it*, do *not* assume you can just move wherever and get a job!"
"I betcha her brother didn't so much have a drug problem as much as he had a parents who treated him like shit constantly problem. 

They could have found one joint ONE TIME and absolutely spun that to fit whatever bullshit narrative they wanted to as long as it kept him under their **control**. It's probably 90% bullshit lies."

It's not unreasonable to expect to get a ride home with the same person you arrived with. I'd be pissed and probably a little on edge if I lacked the money to get home and had to walk in who knows what kind of neighbourhood they were in.
"Sweetie, Pakistani Muslim here. 

Sharia courts first inclination is to steer you towards a reconciliation.  So be sure to point out that you've been through the forgiving and working out phase once before.  If they give you a hard time, then mention that not only has he been unfaithful to you repeatedly (mention the earrings, the obvious fact that they've been alone together and the conversation advising him to lie about them being a gift) he's been corrupting multiple young women of his community by pursuing them. On top of that, he's been lying to everyone continuously (you, his parents, society, the other chick; show the conversation print outs and explain on tumblr that they're public) and that he shows signs of being a munafiqueen.  If you can't trust what he says, how are you supposed to bring up good muslim children with him?   You as well as I know that all the sharia court can do is grant you religious divorce (and you can change sharia courts if the first one isn't listening to you, US ones might be more lenient), so the real question of alimony is going to come from the legal courts.  From what I hear, the civil courts in the UK might be better for you than the US courts.

Divorce is frowned upon but it is legal per Islamic law and is present as a way out for the right reasons.  Religiously and morally, you are in the clear.  Culturally, yes, you will be kind of screwed but it's not a social black mark like it used to be.

You will be OK - as the innocent party, the decision is entirely yours.  Pray istikara a couple times if you still feel you need guidance.  It's going to be a tough road ahead, but you never know what future doors will be opened for you.

edit:  Seeing some of your other comments, remember in Islam you are only responsible for yourself - ""no man shall bear another's burden"", so don't suffer for your husband's sins. "
"I would definitely not put out money for flights/hotels, until and unless every single person has paid their share. I've been burned this way before (with $400 tickets for 4 people who were also ""up for anything"") and I had to rush to sell off the tickets. 

If it doesn't happen, then I'll say it failed due to ""insufficient funds"". I would immediately quit if she expects me to just foot it all to make up for the people who can't/won't pay their share (after evading my direct questions about budgeting)."
"&gt; I can't cook to save my life.

You're a grown man, it's about time you learned. What would happen if your wife goes out of town? Are you going to starve, or feed your kids fast food every day?"
"Lol, yeah. You can't win this. It's her house, and the kids don't like it - and they don't *have* to like it. You bought something and put it in an area of common use. People who use that area don't want it there.

I'm sorry, buddy, but that's on you."
"Yeah, I'd prioritize my brother over one of those others.  Not sure what else to say."
If your dude is so butt hurt about you not taking his last name and won't consider any compromise then you need to reevaluate your relationship
"Your girlfriend is ashamed of this incident regardless of the reasons it happened, most likely because she feels like she was powerless to stop it, and she resents that it happened. It's like a no win scenario for her and it just pisses her off because there was never going to be a different result.

The goal with finding a new job is effectively to wipe the slate clean. She gets to be amazing, and not be put in a no win position like she was before. 

Your friend Chad, regardless of his honestly and most likely being the reason she got the job offer is irrelevant. She did not ask him to be a reference. This incident, although to you and him is nothing, is deeply shameful to her. She has no interest in sharing this with anyone because the situation involved failure, she most likely could not improve on because there were factors that were not in her control.

Point is, she didn't ask him to be a reference. The whole point of a clean slate, is that it's like a new notebook at the beginning of the school year and your friend Chad just drew a black line on the front cover. 

He didn't have to lie, but he didn't need to be a reference either. There's no reason he had to have a discussion about her, besides ""Yes, I know her from work. Please contact her references cause it's unprofessional for me to say anything when she has not asked me to be her reference."""
"&gt;due to things like snap chat actually knew the full details of the accident before I did.

You realize this is still second-hand knowledge....right?  He wasn't there.  He does not have first-hand knowledge.  

But to the point:  Why didn't Chad give Liz a head's up this discussion happened? Might have helped her in the interview!  That sure doesn't sound like a solid friend right there.

You seem really keen on defending your stance and not seeing the other side of things.  Why?"

"Dude, your wife is pregnant, and full of hormones and you suddenly have a new single lady friend who she opines is flirting with you. 

Your wife and unborn child are more important than a new friend. I can't believe you let her sleep on the couch. 

Come on, man. Even if she is being totally irrational, she's pregnant, her body is changing, she is full of hormones, and pretty soon your lives are going to change dramatically. This is not the hill to die on when you've just committed to a life and family with someone. "
"&gt; Tell her the awesome thing about babies is that they grow up, very quickly, in fact. This isn't her life forever because her kids won't be babies much longer.

So much this. I have 2 kids, but I do not like newborns and young infants. Once they begin interacting and turn into tiny people, things are still hard, but in a different way. It can be so hard to want to love something that just shits, eats, and screams, but once they start playing, and interacting, and showing interest in things, it stats to become fun. "
"You will get through this. Go move back in with your parents for a while; you will want your family around you at this time. I'm so sorry that she did this to your family. There is no excuse for cheating, and the fact that she's been cheated on before but had no problem putting you through the same agony shows her true character. "
"I agree, it wasn't nice at all. Let alone to say to someone who doesn't know you very well. Her comments only reveal who SHE is as a person. What she says has nothing to do with you. This is likely a person who goes around comparing how she looks to others around her all day. This isn't a secure person you're dealing with. If anything, I would feel sorry for a person who thinks this way as it shows they have little self esteem. 

There's more to life than being a pretty girl. At the end of the day, if being pretty is all you have and all you're depending on, you're limiting yourself. 

AND beauty is subjective. I know a guy who think Angelina Jolie looks like an alien lol  "
"Yeah, I'm not gonna try to make an internet diagnosis, but that really sounds like something more going on to me."
"You don't need to convince him. You need to tell him that something is wrong and you are not comfortable having a child until you figure out why (and are comfortable that the issues have been resolved permanently, not just until he can knock you up). 

He does not get to decide when you get pregnant. "
"I am guessing your dad was the 'fun' one who spoiled you and treated you like a princess while your mom was the 'mean' one. And you looked at their dynamic as the poor henpecked husband and the crazy wife.

I know a lot of men and women who upon finding out the horrible things their dad did realize  their 'mean' mom was just being the disciplinarian or the responsible one because the fun dad was too busy cheating, drinking, or whatever to do anything to actually raise the kids or contribute to the household outside of a paycheck.

If he has been a great father to you then accept that he can be a shitty husband or even a shitty person and still a great father. One friend of mine had to accept her great father was also a serial rapist. People are multifaceted."
"No he hasn't. I've always wondered if he had any disabilities but my parents would hear none of it. He's very quiet and you can barely hear his voice most of the time. He answers most questions with ""I don't know"" even if they're really simple questions. That might be normal for kids though. I will try my best to see if there's someone he can talk to though."
"This is the most innocent thing I've seen on Reddit all day. But the other comments have covered it, you know your relationship better than anyone, so you'll know when the right nickname comes up for you guys. Best of luck to you kiddos!"
"On a related note, non-ill people should also live by these rules.  I'm sorry for your troubles, OP, but you are clearly a wonderful soul.  Share the sh1t out of that with us while you can!"
"Is her daughter in therapy too? If not- dude, get her some help ASAP. It's unbelievably unhealthy for her to grow up walking on eggshells because of her abusive and mentally ill parent. It sounds like daughter is already developing her own mental health issues as a result of your wife's behavior.

Your wife's illness is not her fault, but she is also not entitled to abuse you or her child as a result of it. Please make sure her daughter gets the help and support she needs to cope with her mother."
"You wanted to be with someone different from him, so you tried to change him into that person. No one likes to feel like they need to change for their partner to love them. "
"Dude, move out.
Give him notice.
If he makes noise, then you can talk about switching bedrooms and him not sleeping in the common areas. If he refuses, move out.

Stop being a patsy. You don't need to yell at him or debate or argue with him. Just state that you're moving out and leave it at that."
"W expected you to lie for him to your good friend (his wife)? Friends don't force friends to lie to cover their own shitty mistakes. Friends are ok with being called out on their shitty mistakes.

Sounds like your ex-best friend is just using you as someone to blame for his own fuckup."
"&gt; Now she's telling me I can't see the eclipse either, and honestly, I'm probably just gonna stay home like she wants.

You'd be wise to reflect on why you're willing to ""stay home like she wants"" when you have been planning this trip for three years and know that you are not doing anything wrong.

What are you getting out of this relationship? Are you really willing to spend the rest of your life sacrificing everything you enjoy so that you can stay with a person who clearly doesn't have any interest in your needs?"
"Coupled with ""It's no big deal, I wouldn't care if I had a naked picture up on the Internet"" "
"'My SO is on my side completely'

"&gt;my mom is threatening to kick me out for taking 1/3 of a pull of her sleeping medicine with permission despite me doing tons of housework and paying rent, whereas my brother had everything paid for him and has never been treated like this

The best time to move out was 4 fucking years ago. 

The next best time is NOW. Get the hell out of this toxic cesspool and your venomous mother."
"I just want you to pause and really think about what parenthood is going to mean as soon as that baby comes. 

Career: If you don't already have one it's going to be an uphill battle to develop one. Babies are draining, time consuming, and expensive. If you don't have an amazing support network it will be incredibly hard to get any sort of stable career going. You need to heavily consider how this will affect not only you but your future child especially if you're a single mother. It sucks to not be able to provide for your children the way you want. When my mom couldn't buy us new school clothes I can guarantee it hurt her more than us. Especially when we got made fun of. 

Education: Since you're only 20 I doubt you have formal education completed. The only single young mothers I know who completed college did it with a partner and a massive support network. And even then it was SO hard. If you ever wanted to go to college please, please, please consider adoption or abortion. Listen to other single moms. Having a child can destroy any future you hoped for. You will still love your child of course but you need to still have your own life. You will still be your own person with your own hopes and dreams separate from parenthood and having a child too young when you're not ready can crush that part of you. 

The day to day reality: Do you have friends? Are your friends also young about 18-23? How much time can you spend with your friends if you're constantly caring for your baby? How many 18-23 year olds want to spend time with a baby? Babysitters are expensive. Are you ready for a tiny helpless little one to become your entire world? Are you prepared to do that without the father in your life or a big support system? 

Maybe reach out to and talk with other young single moms. You need to know what it's going to be like before this is your reality. It's hard. Parenthood is hard even when you're ready. Maybe you've always wanted to be a mom and no matter what this is your dream. Just think about that life you'll have and the life you'll be able to create for your future little one. 

I love my parents but I wish they had waited to have kids. They weren't ready and they were too young. My mom was 22. I had a rough first 13 years of life until they really got stable financially and emotionally as a couple. 

Whether you like it or not your ex can step in at any point and say he now wants to be in the child's life. Are you ready to deal with that asshole for 22plus years? He's even legally obligated to visitation even if he's not paying his child support. What if he gets stable, marries another woman, has kids with her, and wants to go 50/50 custody?

I don't know you but this just doesn't sound good for you or your future baby. It sounds like 22+ years of stress and hardship for you and your kid. I mean obviously it won't suck constantly but there's a lot of ways this could go bad. Just think about that. 

"
"For people to go to such an extreme to stay away from your daughter, her behaviour must also be extreme. I don't know what to tell you, you can't make your friends, family, schools etc want to be around your daughter as she is. Do kids with ODD have support groups for the parents? That's the only thing I can think of. Meeting other people in your situation. 

Are you getting your daughter professional help? Are you getting help in teaching her to manage her behaviours?

You seem to just want people to accept her as she is. But shouldn't you be trying to help her learn to manage it so that it doesn't impede her life? "
"It's gotten to the point where it's constant and they turn every conversation back to it. It's emotionally exhausting and it feels like every success I have is nothing because I didn't ""give"" them kids. I'm considering telling my mom next time we visit that I'm going in my own car. If babies are brought up, I'm leaving to visit my other grandparents."
"That's where the problem is. I've told my mom that the subject is off limits and she was like ""we're teasing you. It's not coming from a bad place."" My husband told her ""then you'll respect her feelings and stop."""
"Thankfully there are no such rules in the custody agreement that prevents me from living at the house which is why my boyfriend refuses to give into her on that. It's just such a shame it has to be so hard.

Having a separate party is a good idea, I think if we made it seem like a pre-party or something they'd like that, I just don't want them to catch on that there's a problem with me and their mom. 

You're right, I just need to grin and bear it for now. My boyfriend keeps telling me I'm doing nothing wrong despite how she makes me feel, so thank you."

"You sound like a very nice person who should feel proud to accomplish what you have so far. But as you get older life doesn't get easier if you have unresolved issues from your 20s and if you've married the wrong person. Your life only gets harder.

For some strange unknown reason he feels comfortable enough to chip away your confidence and begin to break your spirit. If you were emotionally stronger and projected an image of strength and confidence he would not feel in anyway able to suggest that your self value was based on what you see on the scale.

All of us and I mean every single one of us have something that we need to work on. The only fact unfortunately for people who struggle with their weight is that everyone can see what your issue is.

Which means your only two choices are to either build up a confidence that combats anyone and everyone who denigrates you for your size, or you have to be willing to change the fact that you use food as an emotional support system.

He is a very dangerous person to have in your life because he is using the one thing he knows will attack your self-esteem and cause you to question your own abilities.

Anyone who uses your weakest points against you is especially diabolical because of the intense feelings of shame that you must feel when the person who should love you the most attacks you in this way.

Gaining self-confidence is something that takes practice. Every single day. There are many ways to add this to your life, and here are a few things that can help:

If your self image issue is controlling your insecurity, then you're going to have to pick something about your body that you like and practice showing it off in public.

If you have a very nice shoulders or perhaps you really like your ankles or you like your cheekbones what ever it is,  that one item you have to practice going out in public and telling yourself I have a beautiful fill in the blank. Whatever it is.

And while you are out you need to focus on that one item that you like. While you're walking around in the public or at the mall or at a store or in a park you have to practice training your brain that you were confident with this one thing.

You do this until everywhere you go no matter if you were trying to remember your one thing that you like or not, you will start to have confidence on that one issue. So much so that if someone told you that your one body part was in anyway a negative you would not believe them. Deep inside you would not believe them and know they were lying.

This is the start. Once you have one thing that you're confident about that is based in your sphere of insecurity, you will be able to expand that to other areas of your life and even to the point where your size is no longer negative to you.

After you have made this adjustment in your brain, because that's what we're talking about changing the way your brain thinks, you may even start to find that your laziness to lose weight will fall away.

Edit: a word "

"My mom was puking so bad she went to an urgent care who ambulanced her to the ER for scans. They saw the spot on the scans kind of by coincidence-- they also had to remove her gallbladder but that was due to other issues (and was the reason she was puking). As far as I'm aware they pulled both of them out at once. My mom had a giant wound in her abdomen that a nurse had to come over and help her clean etc.

Unfortunately she was kind of elderly (late 60s) and not in the best of health to begin with. Her heart gave out one day during her recovery and she passed. Honestly I think it's better this way-- she was having trouble fighting off infection and the wound wasn't healing right. She was in misery and now she isn't. "
"This is the kind of guy who'd lose his shit at the referee at the little league game for ""favouring the other team"". "
"I'm vaguely afraid they might want OP back to use her one way or the other. Step-horror might have realized as the kids get older she's gonna need a babysitter. I know she told the siblings not to interact with OP, but she did let her take care of them for a whole afternoon.

"Two things stand out for me:

a) From your post it looks like you view this as some kind of game in which your stats (education, money, appearance) are the most relevant thing.

b) From your comments it looks like you are doing the dating equivalent of cold-calling.

Throw out both these approaches. Try a personality-based approach in which you get to know women as people in more natural ways *before* asking any of them to have coffee with you etc.

Women are just people, dude.

"""An understanding"" is often worth the paper it's written on. I can see both sides here - it's annoying, but ultimately that money's gone to your sister, and if you want it paid back I think it's on her. Otherwise your stepmother's out of pocket for your sister's debt to you, which presumably isn't getting paid back any time soon. You fronted the money, so you took on the risk. Yes ideally your stepmother would take the high road and give you the money back, but I don't think she has to. Cynically, she knows that money's gone and will never get paid back, so doesn't want to be on the hook for it. 

If your sister ever pays it back and it doesn't then come to you, that's when you get really pissed off - trouble with being the secret benefactor is that you may never know when that happens! You could always just lay it all out on the table with your sister and get her to weigh in. "

What you described is rape and yes, spousal rape is a thing. He doesn't get a free pass to your body just because you're married. He is waking you up, you're crying through it and he's leaving you in pain.

This is not cool by any stretch of the imagination.

Get your exit plan sorted. Pack an emergency bag, make sure you have a bank account with money in it then when you have a clear path, run the fuck away.

"I've been in your shoes, OP.

I studied French in high school and continued in university since a foreign language was part of the graduation requirement for my majors (International Relations and Communications). I made it a goal to save up to study abroad as soon as I was accepted into my Alma mater and I even minored French, I was that dedication to being able to take classes in French while I was there. Suffice to say, it was an integral part of my college plans.

I met my boyfriend on the first day of freshman year, and it was love. He was my first everything, and the years I spent with him were some of the happiest and most carefree of my life. I thought I'd end up marrying this guy. 

He knew about my study abroad plans and while he never outright opposed them, he made it very clear that he was uncomfortable about me going for many of the same reasons that your girlfriend has stated (distance, potential for cheating, plus the fear that I'd love it so much I'd want to live there after graduation). It wasn't until the time came to apply for programs that he revealed that it was a deal breaker for him.

I agonized for two weeks before I decided I'd never be able to forgive either of us if I didn't follow my dreams. He was shocked that I didn't choose him. He thought the whole time we were together that I'd eventually give up on everything I'd worked towards just to make him happy. The break-up was messy and awful. Neither of us could let go of our relationship or our resentment.   I was miserable when I flew out. He'd made a last ditch attempt to get back together the month before I left, offering long distance, better communication, anything as long as we could leave the door open on our relationship, but I turned him down. I spent the first week in France absolutely certain I'd made the biggest mistake of my life. I cried all the time and I'm pretty sure the rest of my cohort thought I was crazy.

But I pulled through, it's impossible to stay miserable when good people and new experiences are all around you. Those short months changed me. I learned who I was on my own, not as half of a unit. I'm 28 now, and recently married to someone who loves to travel as much as I do and supports me in my goals, just as I support him in his. And even if I had spent the last 7 years single, I still wouldn't regret going. That trip helped me land a job in the international arm of a marketing firm.

My ex is happy too. He just had a second baby with a really nice girl who wants the same homebody lifestyle that he does.

Follow your dreams, OP."
Yup. Break up time. Not in person given the violent tendencies.
Have you made sure it wasn't a false positive? 
"You absolutely need to tell your father. If she's resorted to stealing from her own children, she's likely beggared him behind his back. The lot of you could end up living on the streets if she's anything like most spending addicts. She could also have opened lines of credit in you and your brother's names and trashed your credit scores already.

Tell your father. Hiding this from him is just as bad as walking in on her shooting heroin and agreeing to keep your mouth shut. Spending addictions can ruin generations of a family. Talk to your dad. "
"Right? He gave up using condoms because his wife is ""pre-menopausal"" which is NOT the same as ""basically infertile"". If he didn't want to have another kid, he should have kept on using BC until he sacked up (heh) and got a damn vasectomy, or his wife went through *actual* menopause that was confirmed by a doctor. 

My husband had a vasectomy years before we met, shortly after the birth of his son, and I had 15-16 year old kids when we got married. Neither of us wanted more kids. I was so paranoid about getting pregnant that I had an IUD as a back up, just in case, and it wasn't until I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago (and entered real, actual menopause) that I felt really, really sure that we weren't going to have an accidental pregnancy. 

Not using BC when your wife is ""basically infertile"" is how babies get made, I'm afraid. You made a poor decision and now you have to live with the consequences, especially as it appears that abortion is a non-starter for your wife. 
"
Not being a jackass
"The short answer is, ""Fuck her.""

The long answer is, ""Fuck her. She sounds like a self-absorbed, vapid asshole who you're better off without. Get out of there before, God forbid, the two of you procreate and she abandons you to raise the kids because you've 'been less fun' since you've had to change diapers and prepare formula regularly. While dumping her, be sure to mention that she makes Annie Wilkes look like Mother Teresa and then tell her to go fuck herself with one of the crutches."""
"Yeah, this is just ridiculous. Being obsessed with bio-kids is thinly veiled narcissism. What is so great about you that you can't love a child that didn't come out of your daughter/granddaughter's body as much as one that didn't?

Sounds like with these people, no one would even consider the adoptee's perspective. I wonder what OP's parents' stance on abortion is?"
"No, according to your own story **you** broke up with **her.** You think just because you happened to find out soon after how idiotic it was, that you get to hand wave that and take it back? You ended your own relationship, she's just sticking with your decision. Your relationship is over."
OMG. She is Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced *Bouquet*)!
"&gt;Should I really let my wife in and let her see how vulnerable I am?

Yes. 

&gt;Will she lose respect for me and see me as less of a man?

Not if she's a decent person.  

&gt;Instead should I lean more on my male friends?

In addition to allowing yourself to be vulnerable in front of your wife, you should reach out to your ~~male~~ friends for support.

&gt;I was taught a real man is a Rock for his family. He doesn't show weakness and takes care of everyone. 

That is a shitty, sexist lesson.  Men are just as vulnerable and emotional as women, and have exactly as much need for emotional support and intimacy.  Nobody, of any gender, can be a rock all the time, and everybody, of every gender, needs to feel supported and loved.  It's not weakness to reach out for support, nor is it ""less manly"".  

I know it's hard to overcome the cultural pressure for men to be ""Strong, emotionless rocks"" but... you should.  Let your wife in 100%.  "
"&gt; I've been dropping appropriate hints for months

Hints arnt good communication. Have you flat out told her you want to exchange gifts and told her clearly that this years anniversary means a lot to you?"
This was so sweet. It's great you guys were able to figure that out! It's so refreshing to read happy outcomes in this sub. 
"So you *don't* want anymore kids, and she does want to have a kid, and you're getting married and just hoping this will go away?

*Duuuuuuuuuuuuude.* Don't marry someone who has different life goals to you. This isn't even different, this is completely opposite. You need to get this sorted before you get married, don't just ""think she'll come around""."
OP's boyfriend sounds so much like my ex. And he always told the damning truth because he was always convinced of his heroism. He even admitted in court that he'd beaten me in front of our child and then was shocked that he wasn't given custody. 
"Look at your baby daughter. She deserves better than growing up with an addict in the house.

You like countless women before you have the strength to do what it takes. Why? Because she needs you to.

There are organizations that can help you. Find them and lean on them."
"Ok, those are way over the line... I'd talk to him about this asap. Heterosexual dudes don't send their platonic heterosexual friends pictures that are that graphic. This isn't even about his sexuality, if those graphic pictures were of a woman, you would consider that suspicious / borderline suspect him of cheating right?"
"Yep. 

And what she's doing is making her situation a self-fulfilling prophecy.  She feels slighted when not invited, doesn't go when invited, and therefore, people are to the point to where they don't invite her because she never accepts or bails at the last minute. 

I know that when I'm to a point where I need to call someone out on their shit, it's because I'm really fed up.  So, with this, my tactic is ""be cruel to be kind.""  I mean, she doesn't have any regard to how her shitty behavior affects their feelings, after all, so why hold back?  If it were me, I'd tell her that it's like she's holding onto this problem like it's a pretty little pet that she prizes over anything else:  that she would rather have a problem rather than work on a solution because she doesn't know how to function without having a problem to dwell on. 

She'll hate hearing it.  No doubt.  She may get mad or cry. Good.  It NEEDS to sting.  The more she hates hearing stuff like this, the more it'll stick with her.  The more she has to deal with the consequences of her self-imposed isolation from people who are no longer willing to tolerate her bullshit, the more inclined she will be to alter her course. 

If she's not willing to change course after being told her behavior is not acceptable, dump her as a friend.  You tried, she didn't. "
"Calling them out and threatening them will only reinforce the insanity. People like this LIVE for conflict and will use anything OP does as PROOF of the unfairness of it all. I mean, when BOTH of their children have stopped talking to them *FOR NO REASON* they will have endless fodder for making other people feel SO SORRY for them. How dare their children just CUT THEM OFF when they *only want what is best* for them and *never did anything wrong* and just *don't understand how they could treat faaaaaamily this way*..... 

It's almost like there's a secret handbook somewhere that piece of shit parents all share with each other.."
"And he's **28**!  I was giving him a pass for being a clueless 21yo until I double checked the ages.

Dude, OP, work on developing some empathy, foresight, and emotional maturity.  You're seriously considering taking the ""Complete Tool"" path right now.

Also, dollars to donuts, little sister's character sucks.  That's a totally shit thing for her to do to her sister."
"I think it is the most logical explanation. I mean, Dad knows the kind of hell he would get into if he decided to bring OP back without his wife's consent. The only explanation is that the stepmother knows about it and is ""ok"" with it for whatever reason. Money, perception, need for a babysitter, but she surely knows about it."
"I felt the same way when my mom told me we were going to move to Spain. The best thing you can do is just say goodbye to everyone that you want to say goodbye to, and focus on looking forward. Think of it as a temporary thing, not permanent. At maximum it's 5 years, and then you can go where you want, you know?

Try focusing on all the gorgeous things you will see in that country. Do you know they have black sand? *Black sand* You can go to watch whales, horseback ride on these tiny lil ponies, watch the Northern Lights...focus on getting excited about things rather than what you'll miss.

If possible, try running over to Walmart or any other type of store really quickly and grabbing your favorite dry snacks, as many as possible ,and stacking up. I know at least in Spain they don't have a lot of things (I miss Reese's cups) that are the same. Lots of food, so that you are not thrown in without anything that ""comforts"" you that will remind you of Philly. I actually flew out to Spain from Philly and the airport is absolutely enormous so remember to dress comfortably and get there a few hours early. Bring the snacks, try to focus on the nice things.

Additionally, remember, as soon as you move, try to be social! Most people in non-US countries tend to know at least a little bit of English, so it'll be fun for you to meet new people (school should really help) and learn their language too. Think of it as a one-of-a-kind adventure. :) It gets better, I promise. There will always be parts of you that will miss home, but...once you live there long enough, you will start considing Iceland your home too. I know it seems weird to say that now, but I've only been in Spain for 2 years and while I logistically need to return for University, I'm devastated at the thought of having to leave already-- I've grown to love it here.

It's normal and okay to feel how you feel, but try to give Iceland your best chance. I'm sure it won't disappoint you. And remember, bring snacks! You will definitely be eating a lot differently over there. "
"Please learn from my mistakes. I still regret not going to and doing certain adventures because my ex flipped out and I 'chose'  him again and again. Yet he chose his own wants over me more times than I can count. 

The eclipse is a memory you will have forever. This gf will be forgotten about sooner than you think. 

Anyone that stands in your way should not get to be a part of your life. Choose being happy, not bowing to assholes. "
"1. No, you are not crazy. What your parents are doing is not abnormal, BUT it will only strain things with their DIL. They need to learn to be excited, but respectful.
2) Yes, tell your bro. Have a talk with him about the importance of setting boundaries. He'll be happier for it, because his wife will be happier.

In your shoes, I would talk to your parents. Explain to them that their exuberance is great, but they are only thinking of themselves, not their DIL. Of course they want to spend as much time as possible with there new grandchild, but they can't do that at the expense of the mother's well being.
"
"I browsed OP's post history, for the heck of it.

Apparently he can't talk to women, hates gay people, and thinks he has a right to tell others not to have anal sex.

This girl might not have a perfect smile, but OP is far from being a catch."
"This. There is nothing more draining than trying to guide someone through a tough time *at their request* and them ignoring everything you say, again and again. This friend of OP's is entirely justified in wanting nothing to do with her."
"You're 24. Why does your mother call government offices on your behalf?

&gt; Then she might call the office, who will tell her that her son has some baby momma out there.

They might not tell her anything since she's not you. Let's hope.

Anyway, if your ex filed for public assistance the government will probably try to collect child support from the biological father. When and if they do that you should have the right to insist for a paternity test to determine you really are the biological father. If you are, you will have to pay child support. 

If your ex marries this new guy he might be willing to adopt the baby and become his legal father. You will have to relinquish parental rights for him to be able to do that (assuming you are the biological father). Once that adoption goes through you will be off the hook for child support and will have no legal relation to the child. "
"So,  the first time I met my step-grandmother I was 9 or 10.  At some point I went into the kitchen and started a sentence with ""Grandma, ...""  she immediately interrupted and spat out the she want my grandma.   Yeah, fuck her.   That was the last voluntary thing I ever said to her and tried to avoid visiting at all if I could. "
"Oh my God! Do the relatives who gave you their hard earned money know that she stole it from you (and yes it *is* theft because you were far too young to consent).

Your situation is not normal,  and you mother is spectacularly awful.  "
"Do you know any lesbian or bisexual women who could talk to your friend?

Our culture has a bad habit of teaching women that we *can't* be aggressors. In the lesbian/bi community, this bias leads to a lot of abuse being swept under the rug. Actually having another woman-attracted woman sitting down Sarah would be really helpful. 

Alternately, if you don't know any gay ladies, try telling her that the LGBT community is small in most places. Once she gets a reputation as a creep- and she's basically halfway there-- she'll never get a date. Sometimes, self-interest will stop a person when common sense won't."
"It sounds like a creep took advantage of your (younger) girlfriend's naivete about the modeling industry. It's 'okay' if you are uncomfortable that someone else saw her naked, I guess, but you're missing the forest for the trees here. "
"That's the thing about addicts - they lie. More than you could believe. They think they can act fine and no one will be able to tell they've been drinking/using drugs/whatever it is. They lie to get it, they lie to use it, they lie to hide it, they just lie. 

If she's promised to stop drinking multiple times it sounds like she at least admits it's a problem, right? But the alcoholic mind is just thinking up ways to cover her tracks better. Maybe she even fully intended to stop but just hasn't been able to. 

She needs treatment, not just some addiction counselor. Talk to her about in-patient treatment or at least attending AA meetings. She needs to learn the tools to deal with things without numbing herself with alcohol. It's going to be a long tough road, and be prepared for the possibility the drinking is worse than you thought. But if you want to save your marriage, it sounds like it's what needs to happen. She dodged a major bullet, or a series of them, that nothing major has happened. "
"Even though she had money for it, I'm sure she would rather have spent that on something else. "
"Yeah, and that's been repeated multiple times. Hitting is wrong.

HOWEVER, this guy is using his upset at being hit to completely dismiss his wife's justifiable anger at him being completely useless. In fact, he says she might be gaslighting him when she brings it up.

She doesn't feel in the wrong for hitting him because he's completely dismissing her problems. They need some fucking counseling."
It's been 4 years? Why can't you ask her? Something is up? Really 6 days is nothing.

"When you're with someone, there's fun, and there's also real life. Real life can and will bite you, and how you both respond will determine how successful and happy your relationship will be. What if you got really sick, and needed someone to help you for a long time? She doesn't seem like she could do it. 

What she did was wrong, and cruel. How will you get to the bathroom? She's throwing a tantrum because she's not getting what SHE wants. Not only is she a mean spirited person, she's a bad long term partner. I say break up with her, and report the crutches stolen. You don't have to press charges, but get them back with the aid of the police and show her just how messed up what she did was. "
"Yeah, I can't say I have a lot of patience for people like that. A dog is a big responsibility, which you seem to have a firm handle on, keep up the good work, and ignore the idiots. And maybe bring in a trainer to educate him, haul the mountain to Mohammed so to speak. It may be easy for him to blow you off--which is a different issue--but it's often a revelation for people to hear things from the mouth of a pro. Things like: that's really stupid, stop doing it.

 "
"Yeah that's totally fair. I'm on the fence leaning a bit towards going. I know it's her birthday and weddings (especially one where she doesn't really know the bride or groom) aren't the most fun, but it is only once (hopefully haha). "
"Yeah.

It's sounding like Tom is the sort of person whose going to be let go despite his great work because he cannot work with women. If Red keeps standing up for him, Red will go to. 

I know people in tech, and it sounds like Tom is one of a specific type of tech nerds who believes women cannot do the job. As a result they cannot work with women, and become a huge liability for the company. No matter how skilled they are, eventually is an issue because they cannot have Tom work with women. Even keeping him on and putting Tom in his own little group doesn't work. It means making a toxic environment where Tom's group gets known as misogynist, and is a classic source of lawsuits. 

It will always end with Tom having to move on. And it does not look good for your husband to protect Tom."
"Your friend screwed up, and you screwed up when you took his side.

Chad had no business at all mentioning that accident to the production manager.  The PM did nothing wrong in talking to Chad - that's just basic due diligence in checking out employment history.

"For you, OP, my favourite quote:

""Life will break you. Nobody can protect you from that, and living alone won't either, for solitude will also break you with its yearning. You have to love. You have to feel. It is the reason you are here on earth. You are here to risk your heart. You are here to be swallowed up. And when it happens that you are broken, or betrayed, or left, or hurt, or death brushes near, let yourself sit by an apple tree and listen to the apples falling all around you in heaps, wasting their sweetness. Tell yourself you tasted as many as you could.""  - Louise Erdrich

"You already tried talking to them and it didn't work. Go to your landlord, complain every single time. If it is loud music late at night call the cops for disturbance. "
"&gt; ""no, you have ppd""

Yeah I imagine that just makes things more difficult especially because it doesn't sound like it's the case considering the only reason she had the kids wasn't necessarily the best reason to have children.

The only thing that she might be turned off by RE the Facebook group is that other people may potentially see she's in it so it's down to whether that is something that will bother her or not. It might just need to be suggested that she create a second account with non-identifying details to be able to use that more privately. "
"My wife doesnt have much of a backbone when it comes to her side of the family. So this used to cause us problems as well. After some time i simply told her use me as the scape goat/bad guy. If they are doing something that pisses you off simply tell them i said ""fuck off"".

This has worked for her but also put me in a weird place with most of her family were we dont really get along at all but are nice when face to face. It dont really bother me until it comes time to go see them or them coming to our home (we live quite a ways away from them and used to go visit several times a year and slowly that has become once every couple years).

Personally in the same situation as OP id talk to the wife and likely give the MIL a boot myself. Sounds like shes more of a burden than help and constantly causing a rift which could become a major problem later as MIL slowly puts pressure on her daughter to leave if there are problems between OP and MIL."
"She's being unrealistic, yes. But so are you if you think you can talk about being with other people in the future and not have your girlfriend get upset. It's just common sense not to say those things."
"Adam is either a chronic people-pleaser, and afraid of confrontation (which isn't the worst, but certainly not all that great) or he assumes you don't know your own mind and have terrible judgment, until he steps in and signs off on the situation.

Go out on some dates. You sound like you crave love."
"Why the fuck do you need to get married again? You've never lived together. You have no idea what he's like with chores, with sleeping patterns with so much of the day to day stuff that actually makes up a relationship. 

Wait until you've lived together to start planning a wedding. Anything else is just ridiculous. "

"Yeah, some people were way too harsh."
"That was a really seriously bad idea. 

Part of the dating process is to tell your partner the things they will need to know before you get married so there aren't any large bad surprises. You have to tell him this before the wedding and give him time to think about it. Springing this on him on the honeymoon is unforgivable. "

"I have friends that really like to feel like they're rescuing women, feel like some women just really really need them, get pulled back in again and again. What they have in common is a string of toxic and abusive, exploitive partners it was never their job to try to save in the first place. I'm not saying this is you. But if you resemble this even a little, stop now, get into therapy to help you break out of this pattern so you can move towards having healthy relationships with other responsible adults. Save yourself."

"""In sickness and in health"" only counts if both people agree to do everything within their power to address their illness and seek treatment. He is a depressed alcoholic refusing to acknowledge that or receive treatment. And he's refusing couples therapy. He's not willing to work on the marriage at all. I consider that a complete failure to uphold his end of the vows. Either he gets himself clean and on the road to good mental health, or you get yourself a divorce and a brighter future."

"All the people saying to just ask her or try to give her deodorant are boggling my mind. That is incredibly awkward. 

I would just go on a second date and see how she smells. Get close to her before you have sex again. It's not worth hurting her feelings if that just how she is. "
"This is fairly new behavior- he was always supportive, respectful, etc. I tried to talk to him about his new behavior and he says he doesn't see it "
"This sounds trollish. Everything about it, from the language to the thought process, sounds like it was written by a 20-something. (If that.) "
"Yeah he's not being realistic, 42 year old married women with 3 kids already do not adopt out the 4th child.

I don't know what world he's living in."
"Well, does your gf value her privacy and financial security? If there is a keylogger there that you don't find and you or her enter financial details to access your account etc? Does she have nudes stored on the computer? Besides a keylogger, also check for a remote access piece of software that could be hidden too. "
"So he gossiped on second hand information, essentially. He heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend... He had no direct connection to the incident, he wasn't even a former supervisor so making comments on second/third hand information can blow up in his face, too. It's wildly inappropriate."
"&gt; I kind of want an apology

You're ridiculous. You broke their rules in *their* home and you think you're in the right? Get over yourself. Be a better guest next time."
"Do you know if it's a sound issue or a feel issue? (Does the sound of blowing air/the ac bother him, or does feeling the breeze from it bother him?)

IMO, it's more reasonable that he learn to sleep with the AC on, although at a higher temp than 62. It might take a little while for him to get used to it, but that's the reasonable compromise. He might also look into getting a down alternative blanket for a warm blanket that's not too heavy."
At this point I've been battling PPD on my own and to him it's a joke
"I honestly think this is worth leaving him over. I know that sounds terrible, but what about when he starts doing this to your daughter as she gets older?

You're an adult and can see how fucked up this is, but what about when your daughter asks why ""Daddy always does whatever [SIL,MIL,etc..] wants and not what I want?"" "
"Of course not. She has no idea how I feel about it and she never will. However, I'm being honest - young parenthood is incredibly difficult, especially when you have an unsuitable co-parent. I wouldn't advise anyone to do it unless they're in reasonable circumstances. I'm not going to lie to OP.

 It's not my child I feel negatively towards, it's the experience of parenthood, and it's a very common feeling - I've met plenty of other young women who feel just like I do, they just won't say it because of reactions like yours."
"If they cared about your friend, they would approach her privately &amp; say, ""Hey, you've always been an active participant, but I've noticed you've been absent from polish week. Is something going on?"" Instead, what they care about is teaching a lesson &amp; setting an example for everyone else that you will be publicly shamed if you don't prioritize the sorority. Is that the kind of thing you want to dedicate the rest of your college years to participating in? A sorority that would choose to embarrass one of its members because life is getting in the way of her chapter commitments?"
Shouldn't have cheated 
"This for sure.  The bus was scary for me but forced social interaction I otherwise would have avoided.  There gonna grow up eventually, better sooner than later.  That being said, screw the bus, eventually they're gonna be driving.  You think you're scared now."
"He's not compromising, you are right, he has a very strong character and can't or doesn't want to understand other ideas. He has been a very good person for me to have in my life because I grew a lot being with him, I became more mature, I took his best sides but I can't accept his bad ones without accepting that I will still get hurt in the future. "
"Um, shouldn't the older child be in school by now? Or is she homeschooling? Because round here you'd be in quite a lot of trouble not sending the kid to school until age seven."
 I fear that she'll feel that she can't afford to make me happy in her own way.
"Not really a red flag imo. Its a silly lie but if you think he's been honest, I don't think its something to worry about."
Don't ever be someone's back up plan. 
"Kids can be little dingleberries for sure! They don't have the emotional maturity our verbal skills to communicate their complex needs and fears.  This is an huge learning experience for her, it sounds like everyone is on board to curb her attention seeking.  

Maybe try including her in special activities if she is behaving well? Anything like making bracelets, going to a special outing, making ice cream sundays, a movie with popcorn. Obviously this is with the parents planning, and can be taken away if she misbehaves.  "
"&gt;Your half-siblings are three, and that means that explaining logically to them that it's not going to hurt them is unlikely to take away their fear. Very young children are not rational beings.


Seriously this. My mother had a life sized porcelain cobra that she'd painted when she was younger that scared me shitless as a child. Had so many recurring nightmares involving that thing. 

OP, act like the adult you almost are, and be considerate of shared living spaces. Think of it as practicing being a decent roommate for when you move out.

"
"Just break up with your girlfriend if you don't trust her. It won't work, and invading someone's privacy because of your insecurity and lack of trust is objectively wrong. You're talking about logging into her iCloud to spy on her and then breaking into her e-mail to delete the evidence. You're in a relationship, not the CIA.

Either talk to her, trust her, and believe her, or break up with her because you don't trust her."
"So he's allowed to ignore tradition when it benefits him, I guess? He's a hypocrite. "
"I think this is his issue. How else can he admit Tom is an asshole yet not really do anything? How can he resent Tom for mistreating Kit and Mel, yet not punish Tom for said mistreatment? What's background annoyance to him is daily torture for Kit and Mel and Tom's other directs. 

I think I'm going to try some more direct tough love framed around ""How much longer will Mel last without Kit protecting her? Are you going to try and stem the tide of people running far away from Tom or continue to treat him as a 'made man'?"""
"The guy obviously wants to be more than your friend, so he can't really be your friend. The reality of the matter is you can't make everyone happy, so you should prioritize what makes you and the majority of the people within your circle happy. There's no way to put someone down nicely. It hurts no matter what."
"You are letting this person's failure to plan ahead and replace your role in her business become your problem. You did nothing wrong by moving on and finding a new job and you've gone above and beyond to give her everything she could have asked for in terms of your early warning you were thinking of leaving, your generous 4 week notice, and to put a cherry on top you are still being helpful with information even after leaving.  Most employers are lucky to get two weeks notice, she should consider herself lucky you are so responsible! 

It's pretty clear that you were a big part of the business and in her mind you were essential, unfortunately she did not get her shit together and prepare for your departure, maybe she thought you were bluffing, maybe she underestimated how hard it would be to replace you, but again, this is not your problem. 

She has made it clear that short of putting your foot down and telling her not to contact you again she's just going to keep asking, so you need to decide whether or not you want to put your foot down which carries the potential to hurt this woman's feelings and burn that bridge, or suffer through her continuing to try and get you to come back."
"Ok ill give you some advice from a 50 year old fat woman. Being confident and self assured is really attractive. Own your body and men will love you. I'm not giving you some mumbo jumbo bullshit motivational stuff here I'm talking from experience. Own your fucking body. Everyone has little imperfections and yet everyone deserves love. You are  sexy motherfucker and on one is going to tell you differently (especially not yourself)

Men are not so different to women as you think. You can use your own experience here. If you met a bloke who looked good in clothes, was fun to be with, smiled, was kind, brave, generous and all round attractive, and you decided to have sex with him coz, why not eh? And after you got naked and were you hugging each other and kissing and just generally doing all that lovely stuff, you discovered that instead of a six pack he had a bit of a gut, would you be horrified or disgusted? Of course you wouldn't. Neither will men when they see your baby belly.  

Bellies are nice, they are soft and they are jiggly. Men like them. Be confident in yourself - and even if you don't feel confident at the moment use a fake it till you make it approach. Pretend to be confident until you start to actually feel it. It honestly works.

Now go out and have fun! Men are wonderful."
"Step 1: decide whether to take the new job or stay at the old one. No shame in admitting to a bump in the road. No ones life goes exactly as planned. 

Step 2: get your own place &amp; decorate it how you like. 

Step 3: Feel wise and a little bit smug when he tries to worm his way back in. 

Step 4: Become renowned rude embroidery artist. (Or any other hobby you fancy now you don't have a part time job as angry mans stressball taking up your time)

Good luck babe"
Don't move in with him.  Take the new job and do this on your own.
"Check out r/JUSTNOMIL, for some perspective from you wife's side before you act.

This exact scenario happens on the daily:

""Grandma very publicly slams the mom, half apologizes, wants frequent access to kids""

I kinda get where your wife is coming from here.  There is a person starting and spreading shit about her publicly.  This type of person WILL badmouth your wife to your kid.  This is just a fact.  It is much harder to do when access is supervised.

"
"Yeah. I'm with you here. 

My boyfriend has two kids (4 &amp;amp; 7). And they learned about cursing and flipping people off already. Instead of just banning it, he has chosen to tell them the context and that it's a privilege of sorts to say a curse word they think is funny. But ONLY at home. And only in certain ways. So like his daughter was pooping and goes ""I'm taking a fucking shit!"" and it was pretty funny. But they're not allowed to say ""fuck you"" to anyone. And any misuse of the language results in a ban of the privilege. While my boyfriend thinks it's funny when his daughter or son flips the middle finger, he would NEVER tolerate that at school. They would lose many privileges after a stunt like that."
You are young enough now to find a new passion...  you love the game but it can fucking kill you...
"""I didn't expect to get divorced. I expected her to go counselling and work on herself to pick up the pieces of herself. I thought I'd have sex with somebody, change her entire world, make her feel worthless, destroy her trust, and she'd live with the pain and distrust and uncertainty for the rest of her life, with some counselling. Now she is divorcing me. How did this happen? Shouldn't she want to work on us, given that I'm a guy who will go ahead and hurt her, as long as I believe that instead of leaving me she will work on rebuilding the life that was broken simply because I was ready for her to live in pain and didn't expect her to have the spine to pull out the weed that just poisoned everything she had?""

"I'm honestly baffled as to how a nine year old got that lost, that close to their house. Do they just never walk anywhere? Ever?"
I'm only 30. Changing the menu for the night's dinner isn't always feasible for me and my family. Not sure why it's become any easier for a 90 year old.
"No.

Your girlfriend can see you have sexual interest in this girl and it's reciprocated. It doesn't matter that so far neither of you have acted on it. This isn't purely platonic -- new friend is rude to your girlfriend *and* you're confiding intimate relationship details to this other girl, like WTF dude?

Choose. You only get to pick one. And for the record, refusing to make a choice is *still* making one (spoiler alert: when you are fencing sitting you are **not picking your girlfriend**), so figure out which relationship you're going to continue!)."
"&gt; You'd think his mother would know? She must have given birth at least once.

Sadly some grandmas treat it almost like fraternity hazing -- ""I was miserable after I gave birth and nobody helped me, so now it's your turn."" Now I doubt OP's mom was making transatlantic flights, but maybe that's part of the psychology."
A cheater isn't a friend. Someone who is capable of that level of betrayal is a bad person who you should be happy to be rid of. 
"You know....this is probably above the capability of random people on the internet.  This is a complex situation...one that really does require therapy.  And probably your wife seeing a doctor or a sex therapist to deal with whatever her medical condition is that's preventing intercourse.  

"
"No is a complete sentence ,but since she is talking to him and he thinks they have a good enough relationship to ask for her intervention..... I'd simply say ""I'm not on your side here, you know that right?"""
"Looking once is fine but this girl noticed that she was being looked at and tried to cover herself up more. Your boyfriend stared at her after she had shown that she was uncomfortable which is never okay. Honestly he sounds a bit like a creep. how come he doesn't look at you like that? You should be getting all his butt stares, not random girls that just want to have a fun time. "

"You are way overreacting, and this is not about you at all. It sounds like your mom did let you know--you just weren't immediately by your phone. What did you expect? For no one to let anyone else know until you had confirmed receipt of the message? That's unreasonable. You're not the only person who cares that your nephew was born. 

As someone who lives very far away from her family, I totally understand that you feel isolated and lonely, but putting unreasonable demands on the people you love to make you feel better is not the way to handle this. These are about you and your feelings, not them and their actions. "
"This does not sound healthy. There are a few early warning signs of abuse in your post:

* Demeaning you, putting down your contributions (diminishing your self-confidence, increasing his importance)
* Criticizing what you wear (step to control)
* Demonstrates growing jealousy (step to social isolation)
* Encouraging you to quit your job (step to social isolation)
* Encouraging you to dance as a hobby instead of as a job (step to financial control)

As these things grow, your reliance on him and his ability to control and abuse you grows (this is not necessarily a plan of his, but a natural progression). It's also a little concerning that you married when he was 27 and you were 21, especially if you were much younger when you started dating. Although a 6 year age gap isn't much in numbers, it can be a lot in life experience. You can check The National Domestic Violence Hotline for more information and warning signs.

At the very least, please make a session with a marriage counselor. Maybe your husband is a great guy who is just having a rough time at work, but he needs to learn how to manage his stress and communicate better. Currently, he's taking out his stress (be it work induced, jealousy induced, or something else) by putting you down. That is not okay, and can grow into something more dangerous. "
"Well, OP says this at the beginning:

&gt;Me, my best friend ""Chad"", and my girlfriend ""Liz"" used to all work together for the same company in a very tight knit industry **until about a year ago** Chad got a better job with a competitor. We are all still very good friends and are very close.
**A few months later** our company had lost several more employees and chose to not replace them since production wasnt suffering.

The he goes on to describe the accident. 

So the accident happened after Chad left. Which means that any info he had on the accident came either from Liz and OP or possibly from someone else. Either way, he wasn't there when it happened and shouldn't have spoken about it since all of the information he has is secondhand. That's what makes Chad a blabbermouth and a gossip."
"So do you seriously not see anything wrong then with your friend going out of his way to make sure it couldn't be a clean start by ensuring this follows her?  

That's without getting into the extremely questionable ethics of preemptively tagging her at her new work as causing damage in an event even you say she's not at fault for. Why do you feel like your friend was right to have that follow her when she specifically moved to prevent that? 

Also that your friend only knows about it because you're friends. I think it's extremely unethical what he did when her company, that does have a right to mention it, didn't but he decided to try to sabotage her with it anyway. Have you realized that? Chad was not present for the accident. He did not work for the company that had it, he had already left. Yet he felt compelled to volunteer this accident anyway for absolutely no reason. That's not even questionable ethically, it's straight up unethical. And you're siding with him for giving up what could be privileged information. 

How can you not even feel any empathy for her feeling betrayed by that? 

You're here supposedly asking for help that people are giving in loads but you're doubling down on your own viewpoint without considering anything else."
"Seriously.... if my neighbor broke into my house, hid a bunch of cameras to stream footage of me to their laptop, stalked me when I wasn't home... I'd honestly never feel safe ever again. I'd also not rest until they were in jail."

"Okay, here's the thing. Right now is your mum's last chance to make a good impression on you before you make a decision about the kind of role she's going to play in your college and adult life. She doesn't realize it, but you do, and that can be a very satisfying piece of information to have every time your mum is awful to you. My mum was pretty awful to me before I went off to college and every time she did anything shitty I would mentally reduce the frequency with which I planned to call her.

Re: the texts. It sounds like she reads them through a connected device. There are solutions to this. You can tell your friends to contact you through Facebook Messenger. An app like Google Voice or Sideline will help you have a free new number that your mum won't be able to access without actually taking your phone. "
"You're being willfully obtuse. The structures aren't worthless *to your family* - that's the whole point! And the money they've invested isn't the issue, it's the value they get out of the cabins. And yes dividing up the land would reduce your share, that's also the point. *Legally* you can do whatever you want, but anything short of preserving the status quo or maybe at a push sharing all profits equally with your family is going to cause rifts. You can say ""but it shouldn't"" or ""I'm within my rights"" as much as you like, but it *will* cause drama. 

Actually it's a bit of a moot point because it's already caused drama, and you probably can't undo it. Offering to create a college fund for kids when not everyone has kids was also a stunningly thoughtless move. Why not just offer them a share of the profits each to do with as they will? What was your thinking, excluding childless family members? Ultimately you've handled this incredibly badly and can't be surprised everyone's pissed - selling the land is one thing, but it's your approach which has made the whole situation worse than it had to be. You've made your bed, so lie in it. "

"Way to throw your son under the bus.

"FIRST ISSUE - fapping too much

If he's masturbating to the exclusion if your sex life, it will damage your relationship. 

I'm a woman and once went to /r/nofap and /r/noporn and asked (out of genuine naivete and curiosity) why a guy would want to quit masturbating. They said two reasons, one it took too many hours of their lives, but the second and more relevant reason for you, is that it made sex with a real woman less interesting and fun. 

Porn addiction is a very new problem that affects a lot of relationships. But people don't know it exists or how to talk about it because it's only a decade or so old. So be observant and figure out if your husband really prefers masturbating to the exclusion of sex, and if he's interested in fixing your sex life he should want to address this problem. Those two subs are support groups, if he can get interested it could really turn your sex life around.

We've seen a couple update posts here where a guy is having trouble w/ sex and quits masturbating and comes back later to tell us it made him SO horny for his lady. I mean, it makes sense...

SECOND ISSUE - communication style

You got married after being w/ someone for only a year. I'm sorry but that's still the honeymoon phase. It takes over a year to settle into a relationship. Now you're fighting, and imho one of the best tests of a relationship is how people act when they're fighting. Not during the honeymoon phase when the hormones are crazy.

There's kinda two ways to fight. Either you vs him, or you and him together vs the problem. It seems like right now you're fighting each other? 

Maybe sit down and have a talk with him where you reframe the problem. Say something like ""I love you and want you to be happy, but I need to happy in the marriage too. I'm not upset at you, I'm upset at the problem (not having very much sex). Can we work together as a team to try to fix this? I know you love me and want me to be happy, please work with me here."""

"But the baby stage is temporary.  Also, are you going to want partial custody of the older 3, but not the 4th?  How will that work, especially once the kid is old enough to understand he or she is being excluded?  Put yourself in that child's shoes.  "
"What I can presume is a 50+ man propositioning a 19 year old is wrong, the recently divorced father of your best friend doing so is just plain creepy.

Don't be alone with him - he could be the most embarrassed and remorseful person the next time you see him, but if this was in any other situation would you go near that person again?

When it comes to your friend, I think you are the only person to judge how she will react to what her father has done, however if this is a continuous attempt by him to get with you, or your relationship with her starts to suffer because of it, then she deserves to know the truth."
"I've been in your boyfriend's shoes. 

Society looks down on people who like to stay in rather than go out, and it's doubly true if you like videogames instead of something productive or wholesome such as pickling things, knitting, growing your beard, or pinteresting stuff.

I'll bet you anything that your boyfriend has often been told that it's somehow wrong for him to want to stay in and play a videogame rather than go out and do something; hell, if this isn't his first relationship his ex probably scolded him for wanting to game rather than hang out with her.

I've told the kind of lie your boyfriend told, because when I was around that age it just seemed easier to lie. He doesn't know of a mature way to say ""I'm not up for anything today, I just want to hang out and shoot spacezombies by myself"", and he's probably also worried that you will get angry with him for not wanting to hang out.

I wouldn't worry, and if you want you can tell him that you understand if he needs downtime for himself sometimes and to just let you know instead of lying about it."
"Things will be amicable until they aren't. That point might be when she realizes you're not going to allow her to take your kids and move across the country with them.

"Every relationship doesnt end in a happy marriage. That doesnt make the ones that dont failures. You learned more about yourself, what you want, what you dont want from this relationship. And so did she. And her realizing that this wasnt a good relationship for her and that she needed to do more work to get where she wanted to go too was a big deal. I understand that neither of you wanted to end the relationship, and she still isnt ready to quite let go, but its quite necessary. Your decision to stop contact is healthy and will help you both heal and move forward. You arent being selfish or immature. Its just hard when you break up when you know the other person isnt horrible or anything. You are doing the right thing for both of you here I think. Best of luck, OP. "
"Yeah, this is kinda pretty much spot on. Do I think some cashiers are cute? Yeah. Do I hit on them at their place of work? No. 

On the flip side though, if I'm out with my niece I wouldn't mind getting hit on, then again I'm just out of the obese BMI range these days. When I do get better looking I will probably still be taking my niece to these places, and will follow the next advice.

She could have simply asked if he was his kid or asked how his wife was enjoying some time off(assuming he's there after business hours), or how it was being a stay at home dad(if it was during business hours) to gauge things more appropriately. 

Edit: advice only applies if the kid is in the being watched area."
"You can't tell someone (friend or family) close to you the negative details of your relationship, break up with your SO, unload all your emotional baggage on your friend/family, get back together with your SO, then expect your friend/family to be supportive.

Why did you get married in the first place if you don't want to live with her?
She refuses to talk about a topic that is causing you real concern and harming the relationship. It reads like you have tried your best to have a constructive conversation with her and she just won't talk about or attempt to find a middle ground that is agreeable to you both. I don't know what else you can do here. I'd move on because I'm not willing to potentially spend the rest of my life with someone who is not compatible with me sexually.
"Um, she's stalking him, not pulling a prank. What about installing security cameras and obsessively watching someone in their home is a prank? "
"They don't want to understand, they just want you to pretend like nothing happened so your mom will stop harassing them about it. "
"Yeah, she won't have much of one if she refuses to ever settle down and actually do the work to build it."

"Wait, you cook all his meals too? For your room mate? Sounds like you're living with your son, not a peer.

" The first therapist I saw was a disaster of a human being that used any opportunity to talk about herself and projected all of her own issues on me while almost deliberately asking me questions that didn't address any of the issues that I was there to work on.  The *second* therapist I saw was kind, supportive, and smart as a whip.  She could pick up when I was avoiding addressing certain issues and helped me conquer my fears.  I honestly cried when I had to stop seeing her due to a change in my health insurance policy. 

Please, keep encouraging your girlfriend to see a therapist.  There are amazing therapists out there, and finding one of them can absolutely change your life. "
"Agree with all of this, especially calling CPS. If they won't get him the help he desperately needs then this is your best option. This kid is dangerous and will only become more dangerous. "
"&gt; In my husband's defense, he is a good father, so I'm wondering if I should give him the benefit of the doubt and hold my tongue or if I need to say something. 

Since he's one of those people who is still apparently focused on the ""boys carry on your legacy"" nonsense, you really do need to talk to him. He may not treat your girls outright poorly, but it's not unlikely that he'll treat them *differently,* and this may result in some preferential treatment for your son.

I've seen this happen to other people: they claimed they loved their daughters just as much, but it was the sons who were given power of attorney, who were asked to arrange events, who were encouraged to enter sports and discouraged from entering the arts, who were praised for being tough and picking fights because ""boys will be boys,"" etc.  And the daughters often lacked self-confidence because of it. This isn't good. 

ETA: I should point out that this is often something people do *without really thinking about it.* Like, they don't *actively* think, ""Oh, a girl can't handle my affairs when the alzheimer's kicks in,"" they just automatically pass it over to a son because men are considered more responsible and capable in our society. That's sort of the scary part: we can all fall prey to this, even if we think we're very enlightened. I'm not saying you should drop this man like a hot potato for making one weird comment, I'm just saying it's something that warrants discussion."
"&gt; he could be exaggerating his value.

I'm wondering about this too. And whether the husband is afraid to confront Tom (guilt, fear, obligation, etc.) .OP needs to  see if her husband can work through this in a more methodical manner--what skills are he actually putting on the table. Which are irreplaceable.

Also, OP, I noticed that these stories are about 2 women. In corporate environments these days, saying ""oh, he's just an asshole to everyone"" isn't going to fly the way it might have 20 years ago.

The kids already know that their mother hates you. As long as you treat them with love, kindness, and as a part of your family: they won't believe her lies.

Its time to separate parenting the children.


°Keep any toys, gifts, clothes etc. that either SO or you buy at your house.

°Don't ask permission (unless quired) to do activites with the children.

°Have separate birthday and holiday parties/events for the children. 

°Contact the schools/daycare to get copies of report cards/ notifications of events / conferences with teachers. 

°Do not engage her At all except for a smile and head nod. Learn to grey rock.

°Don't ever discuss her around the children: wait until they are out of the house and gone. Little ones have big ears. Them hearing anything about their mother (even accidentally) will hurt them and make them resent SO and you.

°Don't ever discuss life events (promotions, moving, marriage plans, vacations, etc) or important things around the children. She it grilling them as soon as she gets them alone.

°If she doesn't allow SO to take the children for a scheduled visitation: call the police at the pick up site on the pick up time. 

°Keep screenshots of all her texts, emails, IMs. If legal in your state: record all conversations and load to cloud. Your SO may and probably will need these in the future. 

°Keep a written record of all His visitations in a Composition Notebook. List dates and times of pick up &amp; drop off. Even add notes on what occurred during visitation: went to the zoo, saw XXX movie, celebrated XX by going to XXX, etc.

°Keep a written record of all her harrassing/mean etc comments to or about SO or you in a Composition Notebook. List dates and time of occurrence and what was said.

These things might seem to be extreme but are necessary for this kind of situation. 

Good luck and Blessed be

"It makes me so freaking sad these days seeing waves of parents meeting their kids at the bus stop. Seriously walking home from school is becoming a lost rite of passage. I have seen 13 and 14 year olds being picked up from the bus stop and I just don't get it. I was in elementary school in the 80s and had to walk a mile and a half from the age 7-13 by myself and those walks were some of the best bonding time with my friends. We found shortcuts and picked flowers and just had real childhoods. It's sad that kids can't live that way now. 

Once or twice would be ok for them to learn the ropes. Constant pick up seems oppressive to me.

If your parents have his number you can bet he will have a new one very shortly.
"I think you have to be up front and specific with her. Tell her that she is overstepping and making you uncomfortable, that you wanted a roommate without a social obligation, and the reason she has her own lounge space is because you and husband wanted the front living area to be more for the two of you and private and dont want the default to be that all three of you hang out when you're all home, that your private time with husband or by yourself is important to you and you need her to stop sitting and watching you prep meals, waiting for you in your living space when you're out, and otherwise passively looking to you guys for social interaction. The standard should be if you want to be social you will invite her into your space and vice versa. Otherwise an assumption of private time should be made. And tell her that she has to park on the street all the time and husband is going to take the garage because she cant get her shit together to move her car without being woken up at the last minute. "
"Im torn OP. 

I know you live with your parents and you want to support your family, but $200 Here and there is not chump change as a student. It's the kind of habit where your parents start relying... and then assuming... money is always there. And at 21 that's a big burden. 

And while I agree that when gifted, that money is there to do as you please. But what do you want to bet that your bf gave you that money so you could have *fun* - or at least put towards yourself? So you could do something other than support others. 

Also...

&gt;and they don't ask my for any money. 

If that's true, then how did this come about:

&gt;My dad came up to me 4 month ago and asked me for $200 for some bills,

Or this:

&gt;Now last week he asked me again for $50 for the gas bill

At least be honest with yourself on what expectation is currently being placed on you from your parents. Your parents are routinely receiving money from you. Which they managed not to do when you were younger. 

Also this:

&gt;And they help me out occasionally if I ask them to

Is what parents are supposed to do. They don't get a gold star for doing the basics of parenting. 

OP, I understand that your family struggles and your boyfriend is privileged. But being privileged doesn't stop you from seeing a potentially unfair situation. Im not sure what you have in savings, but I hope you have the means to one day move out. However having chunks of your paycheck go to your parents can't help with that. "
"Yep, no one pays $160-$300 just for a handjob, sorry. And I highly doubt it's only happened twice. If I were you and he gave me the ""relax it's just a rub and tug"" line, I would have lost my shit. He's clearly not sorry, and even if he acts sorry, he's just sorry he got caught. If you don't want an open relationship, then just end it, because this will happen again."
My first flight with my daughter happened when she was 5 months old.  We had to fly as soon as possible as my father in law was terminally ill.  Even then we waited until she had her first round of shots and was strong enough to fly.  Looking back I still think it was too early.  Flying with a newborn is insane!
"Here's the thing... While you don't owe a date to anyone, I feel like you are old enough to be looking for a romance that lasts. And a romance that lasts, even the attraction part of it, will have its attraction grounded in so many more things than hair or even general physical appearance. Go with an intention to have fun, not an intention to scream LOVE off the rooftops.

If you are a person who can be attracted to a person's mind, give it a shot. On this date, you might discover things about this woman that will make you dread the thought that you almost let go of meeting her based on her hairdo. 

And here is another thing. If you still don't like her, you still don't owe her another date. Go out and have fun with another human being. It will cost you nothing and you might find yourself having learnt a valuable lesson about shallowness.

Post scriptum, she isn't losing anything either. If you are actually shallow, she'll learn that one way or another. A date doesn't have to lead to romance. It can lead to a life-long friendship.  And neither of you is gambling much."

"I feel bad for you. However, as the mom of a 1, 5, and 9 year old - it is WAY EASIER when they are in school. My oldest is a terrible, difficult child. I thought I was going to have a breakdown basically every day. But now he's in school from 8-3. It really gets easier the older they are. A 2 year old is really just a big baby. Wait until she's 5 and in school. I bet you will have a much easier time, if you're still with your husband or not. Good luck."

"It's nice you want to help your friend.  Having come out as queer only a few years ago, I am trying to put myself in her shoes and try to understand why she's doing this and I just don't get it.  

In addition to being very blunt with her about stalking and harassment as others have suggested, maybe try suggesting things like online dating?  Or maybe go to a gay bar with her and offer to be her wingman?  Perhaps she's struggling because she's obsessing over this woman but maybe if she were distracted with other women she might be less inclined to focus all of her energy on pursuing this particular one.

Does she work in customer service?  Or has she at any point?  Sometimes it's difficult to understand if you haven't worked in retail or food service, but the person she is harassing is trapped there and *has* to be professional and kind because it's her job to be.  You might bring up the fact that she's only being nice to keep her job if Sarah seems to think any of her responses mean something more than they actually do.  

And tbh, I know this is the relationships sub, but terminating the friendship seems a bit harsh to me.  "

"Can you move out? Or stay with friends for the rest of the summer? I assume he's going back to college when the break is over. 

If you can't stay away entirely, it's probably best to spend as much time out of the house as possible. Go hang out at the library, parks, coffee shops, museums. Maybe pick up a volunteer gig? You'll meet lots of quality people and can build up a support network.

He may seem smart and crafty, but people like him tend to leave a trail of destruction behind them, and the older he gets, the more his peers will notice this and avoid him. You, on the other hand, are starting grad school soon, so you're actually smart. Think of him as an annoying insect. His only skill is making other people unhappy.

Also, your parents suck for taking his side, and it sounds like your abusive brother learned his ways from your abusive father. I'm sorry your family situation is so crappy. If your school offers free counselling, it's a good opportunity for you to talk this out.

PS: Happy upcoming birthday! Go do something fun for yourself, buy a little treat, take yourself to a movie, or just enjoy having the house to yourself. You can remove his ability to ruin your day by having a good time on your own. Your family can go to hell, you're smart and kind and are going to have a great life without them!"

Is she embarrassed maybe because she has told someone about your rough patch and they might be from that person. Perhaps a female friend? Maybe she feels guilty about opening up to someone she shouldn't have?

"&gt;Any advice?

Couples counseling, and/or listening to each other and learning how to argue. You both screwed up in different (and both *extremely important* in their own ways).

You didn't back her up with your mom. Your mom shouldn't have this much say, and your ""keeping the cool"" wasn't helpful. You need to have your wife's back.

She also screwed up using something you said in a vulnerable moment as a weapon. She needs to have your back.

Right now, neither of you trusts the other to have each others' back, and if you want this to work, you both need to cut the shit out.

&gt;Here I am now. Driving around, parking here and there chain smoking, and wondering if I can ever trust her again. She is of course blowing me up with demands to know what I'm up to, blaming my mother and I for all of this, cussing me out, and threatening to withhold sex. I feel like something broke when she said that. I don't know how I'm to cope with what just happened.

This also isn't healthy. You can't just walk out in the middle of a fight, without a word of where you're going or what you're doing. If you can't handle pressure, you guys need to have some kind of system where you can blow off steam, but you need to come around eventually and talk. You can't just take off, especially with a kid."

"Google ""the missing stair"". It explains how people like your husband gloss over people like Tom. Having him read that might give him a bit of insight."

I doubt he would win the custody case and push hard for child support. You have a work history so the sooner you look for work the better. Many friends who have been out of work told me that the longer the unemployment period the harder it was to get back into a job. I hope things turn out better for you once you stop taking care of two children.

Then tell Jack and Diane right away. Discuss with them whether it is appropriate to tell Jennifer as well and how best to do that.

&gt;Worse what the hell is wrong with me? 

Nothing is wrong with you. Just the way nothing was ever wrong with Jennifer. Take this as a reminder that people who end up in abusive relationships aren't stupid or weak. Remember when someone tells you they were a victim of violence, not to think ""Well that can't be really true! They are such a great buddy!"" or ""How could you not notice? I'd never be so dumb.""

Most abusers get the chance to abuse someone because they can pass well in public and they worm their way in. Remember that every time someone tells you about their 'crazy ex'. The crazy one *may* be standing right in front of you. You can't tell, and neither can the next victim. This is precisely why women are warned off of guys with too many 'crazy exes'. Too many crazy exes tell us where the problem is more likely to lie.

I don't know what you do about the wedding. Quite honestly, I would hope you could tell your buddy what is up, and that that is why you won't be able to attend, because you owe it to your good friends to never be in the same space again with someone who threatened their children and physically assaulted Jennifer. Your friend has to make his own decision about his friendship with Hugo, but I would have a clear personal boundary there. You cannot be in the same space with him."

And honestly, considering what ODD often presents like... I don't blame them. 

You've said that you are accessing counselling but don't say how long for or if it has made a difference. Treatment for ODD is difficult but can be very effective with a combination of different counselling interventions such as behavioural intervention and family intervention. 

The only thing that I can think of is to suggest meeting in neutral places like parks and other public spaces. It may also be an opportunity for you to look into alternative care arrangements to give you and your wife a break. 

Edit: have you considered finding a support group for other parents of children with Conduct Disorder or ODD?

"I think you misunderstand what marriage is:  It's the joining of two people for the purpose of sharing a life together (sharing assets, raising children, etc..).  If you aren't living together and won't be living together for a very long time, you shouldn't get married.

There is nothing that being married changes about the nature of your relationship.  It doesn't make you closer.  

The only thing that would change from where you are in your relationship now is that it would be much more time consuming and expensive to get a divorce than to break up if the relationship didn't work out for any reason.  That's the only thing.  And, statistically, a LDR doesn't have good odds of lasting for 5-6 years.  Not saying that you can't make it work, but it's high-risk."
"I just want to say first that your date night sounded lovely and you sound like a thoughtful guy so I understand why your disappointed in her reaction with her bf. It hurts and it sucks.

Just a thought,
 I garuntee the bf told your girl friend that she was getting the $70 ring and was excited she could help with the big night. The two girls were anticipating the gesture and when the ring wasn't given it was a disappointment to both of them. That could be the context to that private text conversation.

 The important thing is how you both felt and enjoyed the night of the event. It sounds like your GF was appreciative to your face but you decided to dig further, why? Were you seeking more praise/validation about what a great guy you are?

I've gotten plenty of poor gifts from people I love but I'm gracious and would never complain to thier face. She's only human and she made some comments privately to a friend. I think you should learn from it and move past it."
"I know this book gets recommended a lot, but this is exactly the kind of situation it was written for -- you should pick up *The Gift of Fear* ASAP.  The author identifies a number of ploys that sound very similar to what you're describing.  Even if your neighbor is merely inappropriate rather than harmful, I think it will really help you to identify and resist some of the tactics described.  

And please, give yourself permission to be ""rude"". You don't have to be outright antagonistic, but you have a right to go about your day in peace."
"Holy fuck this is so predatory and wrong I don't even know where to begin. I know medical bills are crippling and I know it feels like this is your only way out, but please run away from Rachael as fast as possible."

You let this kind of crap slide and it'll just snowball into worse behavior. He definitely needs punishment.
She sounds like a jealous insecure person tbh. I don't think anyone would say something like that unless they're trying to knock someone down a peg. Which implies that she thinks you're above her.

"My biggest concern with this is her dismissing your concerns as you ""lecturing"". That's not how couples solve their issues.

Take it as an opportunity to share your goals and the milestones that you would need to achieve it. That way it isn't ""lecturing"". You're just genuinely trying to make sure your relationship aligns well for the future.

If she isn't willing to try to find a compromise on how you can achieve your goals together, or isn't willing to have that conversation, I think you have your answer - it isn't going to work out."

I'm sure he sounds very firm and reasonable when he tells you this is just how it is, he is going to hang out with his ex and kiss her on the mouth and your feelings on that aren't a factor, he is never going to live with you or have you as a partner in his life. You are just a girlfriend he will cuddle, fuck and hang out with, accept that or don't. You probably feel silly or immature for arguing.

People will say he's been honest and it's your responsibility to realise that's not what you want and break it off. I'm not sure about that. I think it's shitty behaviour to use your greater life experience and relative lack of investment to run rings around someone who's in love with you.

Yep! My husband and I are a package deal. And we are also mature enough to be able to socialise in settings with people we don't get along with (when that even comes up - which it doesn't as we are pretty easy going) without needing somebody to force another person to leave.

Maybe her boyfriend is a spineless coward, but he's not the one that would be making the scene, it would be his friend who's insisted on having this person she doesn't like for whatever reason kicked out of a party she was invited to when she could easily just avoid her. To stand by his side, he didn't have to make a scene. He could have easily said ""Look, OP, I talked to Julie and she is wanting you to go so let's just get out of here.""

To even have frozen embryos they clearly went through IVF together, which can be an extremely emotionally taxing and traumatic experience for some women due to all the hormones, potential for miscarriage, etc. It just sounds really shitty to me for someone to abandon their partner because of that; even if you want kids and can't conceive, there are other avenues to becoming a parent with varying degrees of expense/red tape/difficulty.

Is that really who you want to be with? What if you become ill and he decides your illness isn't convenient to him?"
"Wait.  I am a consultant who has mentored hundreds of small business owners, and I disagree with all these answers.  I hope you'll hear me out, because there is a simpler and less bridge-burn-y way to handle this:

Schedule a 30-minute catchup call (or, if you're in town soon, a coffee) with her.  Update her on your ilfe _like friends_.  Hear about her challenges, and offer advice if she wants it.  Make it clear during the meeting that you're in a different town, living a different life, and while you had a great time with her, that part of your life is done now.

The thing is that small business owners are almost universally bad at boundaries.  This is because running a business is actually a *super psychologically unintuitive thing to do*.  

If you worked for Kristen for 4 years and had a good relationship and a good time there, that makes her one of the rare good ones.  For each you+Kristen out there, there are 20, maybe even 50 employee+boss relationships filled with toxicity and confusion (from the boss).

A 4 year professional relationship is also valuable.  Even if you don't need her as a reference, a friendly contact that powerful could be valuable to you in introductions or even clients (depending on your industry) in the future.  And it's also just generally good karma.

So my recommendation is, from your post it actually sounds like there's an 80% chance Kristen is just making a genuine, common, very-stressed-small-business-owner mistake.  Her company is in need, and she is tapping her network (ie, you) as hard as she can to try to make things better.  

---

Kristen doesn't understand that hitting you up for help is not an option because, from a business owner's perspective, most problems she has to deal with are about trying harder rather than about hard boundaries.  Especially as a woman, she doesn't get where she is by taking no for an answer without trying to find an ""ingenious"" workaround.

(This is probably also why she got offended at your answer.  She was doing something ""normal"" for her, and was too heads-down in it to realize that it's boundary-crossing for you.)

So this is how you translate the ""no"" into her language:

1)  Tell her the story, not just the facts.  Make her understand your life now by talking about your life and giving her access to what your current career, goals, and dreams are.  

If she was a supportive manager before, her empathy skills are probably decent.  So take advantage of them to get her to understand why the shop can no longer be a part of your life.

2)  Validate your relationship.  Express appreciation for her time together.  Make her feel like she has had a significant positive impact on your life that you will always carry.  If it feels right, tell her about how you were able to pursue your dreams because of that job.  In other words, teach her how to shift her current concept of your relationship from ""I am your boss"" to whatever you want it to be now.

3)  Hear her problems out.  30% chance she's doing this not because she thinks you're still her gopher, but because she is struggling without you.  Let that get out and validate her problems.  Possibly even use your expertise to offer suggestions.  This has the dual purpose of making her feel heard, but also giving her a seed/foundational experience of interacting with you about the shop in a way that you are clearly not working for it anymore.

---

If after a nice catchup conversation, she still remains pushy, _then_ go to blocking her.  

But otherwise, the way to shift your relationship is by actually doing something in the relationship that represents the new version, not the old one.

"I think people are getting a little distracted, here - personally I don't think the 'married or dating?' question is as important. What's important is that it sounds like her home isn't a place that you can live in and be comfortable, and on top of that you need/want your space. 

There are two ways to handle this. The first way would be to sit her down and explain what doesn't work for you in terms of living together, and come up with a plan with her for the two of you to work on it. Whether it be regular tidying, going through her space to declutter, you getting a room that's 'yours', etc. The second way would be to talk to her and explain that the two of you are different people and space and time to yourself is important and something that you need. This is something that I've seen come up on here between couples before - some people just never need space or time to themselves and struggle understanding those who do. "
"...wait what?

" the language you used to describe the situation has me thinking you don't understand your husband very well. He is stressed and you are not empathizing. Instead of trying to understand his anxiety you're trying to justify your behavior. I'm not sure if you are really spending too much or not, but your husband is definitely feeling an enormous amount of pressure at the moment. It would benefit you to try to really understand why. "
"I have seen people become 'addicted' to both videogames and weed to the extent that they lost their jobs and went completely off the rails. It may not be physically addictive, but it is a great way of avoiding reality, responsibility and stress and that relaxation is, if not addictive, extremely seductive. It is also possible to be psychologically rather than physiologically addicted to something. 

If you want a line for your friends ""We didn't have much in common anymore"". You don't have to add ""because literally all he cared about was weed."" "
"You are not responsible for his emotional well-being. 

Let me reiterate this. **You are in no way, shape or form responsible for his emotional well-being.**

He is responsible for his own emotions. If you end up seeing him in public, ignore his gaze. Pretend not to see him, don't even talk to him, move on. In addition, block his number on your phone, and remove him from any social media if you have any. 

Think about it this way, OP. If you really and truly DID give him ""an anxiety attack"", let me tell you what a person who is so scared and traumatized by another person that they'd have a panic attack would do: PROBABLY not communicate in any way, shape or form with the person they're afraid of, and spend most of their time trying to calm themselves down and just, in general, be terrified of said triggering person. If he was truly having a panic attack, he would not have asked you to ""tell him when you came by.""

This ex does NOT seem terrified of you. He spread rumors about you, berated you, insulted you, abused you, and revealed personal and intimate information about you. This is a guy who seems like a textbook abuser. You didn't let him abuse you anymore and walked away from him. When abusers no longer have their way, they will do everything by any means necessary to either reel their victim back in (usually this is the 'honey moon' or 'lovey dovey' phase where you see abusers appologize and say they'll never do XYZ ever again) OR they'll try to change the perspectives and opinions of everyone around them in order to make themselves appear as the victim, and you are actually the bad guy (which is what he's doing.) 

Do not give a damn about him. I know that you say you still care, but in this situation, you should not. He is responsible for his own shit. If he hurts himself, that's his fault, not yours. You didn't grab him by the arm and yell at him to hurt himself ""or else"". You aren't ""making"" him feel anything. That's on him. 

Live your life and stop concerning yourself over a guy who was clearly very shitty, and very abusive. Be glad that you dodged a bullet and didn't marry this asshole. "
"Take control of your future and get an abortion, get on birthcontrol, and never, EVER speak to your ex again. "
"Love is always *real*. Feelings are always *real*. 

There's no way to justify that her hiding this huge of an issue from you, and her lying to you within the confines of your relationship. She can't love you and try to alter your view of reality this much at the same time - she openly deceived you and felt no guilt. She did not apologize, she did not own up and commit to making it better. She is doing everything out of her best interest and none out of your best interest. She loves you? I don't think so. She loves having you but she doesn't love you. I'm sorry. "
"By the way, I think this is much more serious than ADD/ADHD. An ADD/ADHD person will forget instances, lose time, procrastinate, etc, but they will not forget that you own a car. The good news is that this appears to be non-malicious. The bad news is that he needs to see a neurologist stat."

Fight it. You can do this. You are your own person. You don't need permission to live. Cut them off entirely and you'll wonder why your life is suddenly so peaceful. It will be hard at first but honestly, they are toxic."

"This reminds me of the time my uncle found a joint I lost in the kitchen while I was living with him. HUGE fight, ended when he told me to leave his house and never come back, so I went to leave and he blocked the front door and told me I can't leave. So I went out the back in socks, walked around for a bit and called my mom. 

While I was on the phone with her, the cops found me and told me to come with them and go home. So I hung up and my uncle had the biggest crock of shit of me hitting him. Once they left, he told me I was under house arrest and unable to leave to attend high school. 

So I was out of school for two days before I had a chance to leave. I pack a suitcase and went to a good friends house. I crashed there or at anothers and didn't miss a day of school afterwards(I was usually late due to the long bus ride though). 

About a week after I left, I got called to the principals office. He wanted to talk to me because my uncle tried to remove me from the school because I ""ran away and wouldn't be attending anymore"". 

I can only suspect about the next part. Every few weeks, I would get called down and have my bags and lockers searched because there was an anonymous tip that I had drugs on me. The first time I had like half a dime bag, and the school cop told me not to do it again and made me flush it. So I left it all at my friends house. 

The next 20-30 times I went down was annoying, but the principal assured me if I didn't have anything(which I never did again) then it was just a formality that they were legally required to do. 

After I graduated, my uncle also called my work, and said I was sexually harassing any woman who came in. Well, they checked the tapes, and wouldn't you know, I never left the kitchen except for smoke breaks in the past three weeks. Luckily, I always had the till staff meet me at the border to chat, and it was only when there were no orders.

He's stopped now(because I closed any avenue he had to reach anything of importance to me), and none of our nuclear family have had contact with him in 6-7 years.

Side note: He was sent to 10-13 different school before grade 5 for basically psychopathic behaviour(killing animals, burning desks, beating the other kids), but keeps it all well hidden now. 

This shit could happen to your brother, even if he's ""clean"" now and just smokes a little pot, like a lot of the ex addicts I know do. That could destroy his family depending on the state or country. If your parents are half as bad as the insane reaction my uncle had to a joint, then you have a dire need to help him out.

&gt; We went out to lunch last week and he leans over and said something like, ""I just threw up in my mouth, that woman should NOT be wearing those pants, way too fat.""

Dear god, how incredibly nasty. Honestly, the thing that gets me about this the most is that he's just so *mean* -- like, these women might not be able to hear him, but he thinks it's reasonable to not only think this stuff but vocalize it and he does it allllll the time. It's almost like he gets off on feeling superior to women who don't properly stimulate his boner. You're right to be concerned. "

"Maybe also analyse how they have managed to get in contact with you when you have gone low contact / no contact before, and the tactics they have used. Did they find you on social media?

Maybe you can explain that your parents are harassing you, and arrange to have your phone calls screened through reception or something... I think you mentioned that they have made up stories about being seriously ill to guilt you into making contact. Be alert to these kinds of claims, and maybe ask a third party (cousin or something) to verify before you believe such claims in the future. Good luck with husband &amp; baby!

If you want more contact and to learn how to be in this different kind of friendship with her, then you are going to have learn how to have that contact without bringing your relationship into the equation.

He's told me it's because my mother will leave him if he disrupts her system in the household, but I 1. Think she's bluffing because she'd be lost without him and 2.

A good option would be to talk to teachers at your school. They will be aware of your situation and they can often be very persuasive for parents. If it is for financial reasons they might be able to suggest some sort of scholarship especially given your grades"
"So the same thing happened to me and a friend. He finds so many girls hot and I just sit there like a log. A year ago we both met a girl he found hot and after sometime it was clear she wasn't interested in him but in me. So we started going out and just before things got you know official I told her I'd have to tell my buddy because I wouldn't feel comfortable dating her behind his back. So I met him and told him that she liked me and I liked her and that we were gonna go out and that I wasn't looking for his permission to go out with her but  he is my friend and I respect him enough to let him find out from me. He didn't take it well and still won't speak to me today. Well I learned that in life you're gonna have to choose whether you want to be happy or put your happiness on hold indefinitely for someone else. I chose the former and don't regret it at all. I would have stepped aside if he was really into her but he was always hooking up with women while I just watched and I just knew when he said he liked her that he was full of shit and when he said he felt hurt, it was just his ego that was hurt, that he could never imagine a girl liking me over him. So it sounds similar to your situation yo."
you should probably work on your self-worth problems before you try to date someone tbh
"Hitting isn't okay, and like everyone said, you should see a counsellor about that with your wife. But you really need to stop being a useless sack of waste.

You're a 29 year old man with two kids who can't even cook, clean, or do anything but work. You have to interrupt your wife when she's in the shower instead of placating a baby for like what? 20 minutes while she washes? It sounds more like she just couldn't handle your incompetence and blew up on you. 

The fact you don't even know where the cleaning supplies are really tells us what the division of labor is like in your house. Being a house-wife/stay-home-mum is a full time job, but unlike you, she never seems to be able to clock off. You can leave work, she can't. Of course she's losing the plot, she's in work mode 24/7. 

Stop making excuses for yourself. Heavy sleeping isn't your issue, you're a terrible husband and father. Your wife seems like she's all but given up on you.

If you want this marriage to work, go get counselling. Your wife needs to work on addressing her frustrations in a constructive manner, you need to work on being an adult and a parent. "

"Hope your wedding goes smoothly! This seemed like a classic case of overthinking and worrying how any criticism would come out. You weren't trying to change your friend (I've seen posts here about a bride asking someone to change their hair so they don't have their thunder stolen... yeah.), you just wanted her to look good and were willing to foot the bill to help her out. Hair like that is expensive to get done so I don't blame her for trying the home route. Her, and your, hair sounds fucking awesome. Enjoy! "
"Good lord the advice in this thread is entirely written by people who have never been married with children. Divorce is not a casual breakup, it's a major life decision you think long and hard about and work with until there's no other option. It changes your life and hte life of your family forever. It's not a bargaining tool, it's not a weapon, it's not something you sling around during arguments. It's something that people do because they feel, in the cold light of day with a calm rational mind, that it's the best decision for everyone."
"When you were 12 years old, you made a genuine mistake. It had horrible outcomes, but it was a mistake. An accident. And your aunt, an *adult* told you she hoped you died. She shunned you and smack talked you behind your back for YEARS.

I get it. Our pets are our families and I would be devastated if one of my pets died in an accident. But I wouldn't blame a child for a genuine accident, and I wouldn't tell a child I hope they die. 

Your aunt's behaviour was out of line. If you've apologized before, and you're over it, you don't need to meet her if it's not something you want to do. "
Understand that you cannot have sex with her again. 
"I love butts myself but I'd never openly ogle an underage girl and then treat my SO like they're uptight when they said something. 

He's a creep, I'm surprised you've been together this long and he's only just now shown his true colors. "
"I know a lot of people are commenting on OP's relationship with his wife, I know that's what he wanted advice about, but I also think he should consider the feelings of the children he has too. I know that if I was in their shoes and had knew that he forced my mom to give up a child or divorce her because of a baby, I would definitely resent that about him. I would question what's so different between that baby and me. It could definitely cause some tension in a relationship between OP and his current children. I'm not saying the should have a say in what happens, but it's important to think how this could effect your whole family, not just your relationship with your wife. "
"&gt; I don't see a problem wearing customary clothing in customary places 

I very much agree with this sentiment.  Being raised in a traditional Roman Catholic family, it was at that time customary, for the females only!, to wear a mantilla, hat or scarf covering the head to services.  Not as encompassing as a hijab, but still a traditional covering.  We didn't wear those outside of the religious setting.

If the compromise of wearing a hijab to religious events, religious areas makes your parents feel happier and respected AND they respect your desire to not wear in secular or ""civilian"" areas is also respected then this seems like a good deal.

Edit: added the codicil about females wearing the head covering in church.  The men removed their hats."
"Aesthetic things like that dont have an age limit. It wont revert you back to a child. If anything you will mature more as you gain confidence. 

Sure some people may perceive you as childish, but people make hasty unfair judgements about others based on much less than the way someone dresses. 

Id say change up your style gradually and go for it at a pace you can ease into as long as it doesnt break the bank and put you in a tough financial situation. THAT would be childish. "
what grown man needs to talk to his mother every single day?
"Names can be strange sometimes, but that's a very rare one. I don't know which country you're in, but I just had a little online check which said less than 100 people in the USA have that last name.

However, I've also found an old online Welsh and English dictionary (from 1815), which says that ""satain"" means ""chestnut"". It's a corruption of the French word, ""chataigne"". 

So you can tell your grandmother that your bf's name means chestnut, which I think is fairly innocuous. :)

"I guess that's part of my concern too is that what if my breaking up with him leads to him going back into truly distractive behavior with drugs and alcohol? I truly do love him and we've been through so much together And him relapsing would be one of the most heartbreaking things in the world to him. Where in recovery to you know why they suggest you don't go through recovery with a partner and I thought maybe we were the two that defy the odds but as we get into this maybe we really aren't. 

Edit: congrats to you too by the way that really is amazing news."
"Have you ever spoken to a therapist about this before? This conversation could probably use some professional guidance as it's a complicated situation. You definitely should bring it up so you can speak rationally and not let emotions cloud your judgement. It isn't a burden you should have to carry on your own. In the end, your relationship could end up being stronger because of the way you handle it."
"I don't think you understand...you could permanently damage your brain, *in the near future*, if you sustain another concussion. This isn't an abstract future-you problem, this is *immediate*. 

I'm gonna guess your dad has a bad habit of trying to be the ""fun"" parent and make your mom the bad guy by telling you what you want to hear. In which case, you can't trust him to have your best interests at heart. He's more invested in making you happy in the short term (or making your mom look unreasonable) than he is in your safety. "
"What you're saying really hit me I never thought about it that way. I guess I just figured he would try to be there because of conversations we've had in the past.  He basically said if I ever got pregnant he would be there for me, and would never put a woman or his child through the same things his father put him and his mother. But I guess I just need to realize a hypothetical situation is completely different than the real thing and to not have hope he'll be there."

"Everyone feels nervous and self-conscious when they're approaching people they find attractive, to an extent. And everyone makes a fool of themselves around someone they like, on occasion. What helps is practice, and not dwelling on potential embarrassment.

I'm so sorry for your loss. The fact though that you've posted this, wondering if you're ready to try pursuing things with someone else, suggests to me you are ready to try. So get out there, ignore your fears and take a chance. 

As for the pure mechanics of asking someone out. See a girl you like, chat to her for a bit, ask her if she would like to get a coffee/drink/meal some time, talk to her, if the connection is good ask to see her again, when you feel ready then become more intimate with her, and at some point a discussion about exclusivity should arise - if she doesn't instigate it, you should, and ""hey, wanna be my girlfriend"" is an adequate if blunt way to do that (you may want to reorganise the order of those steps so that the discussion about being in a relationship is pre-""initmacy"", depending on you or your partner's   preferences).

Take things slow, you're going to have to go outside your comfort zone a bit, but don't do anything you really don't feel ready for. And if you have a bad experience, whether you meet the wrong girl or do something wrong, don't worry about it. Reflect, realise how you can I'm over things in future, take time to recover, and have another go.

You'll be fine."
"That's exactly how it started for me and, you're right, the window slams shut before you even know it. I got so good at manipulating my doctor. It started with 1 Norco 4 times a day and, by the time it was done, I was getting scripts for 60-80mg OxyContin, 60-30 mg OxyContin and 180 Norco. And, I took every single one. I am so fortunate to be alive.

First, destroy the pills you already have. People say to flush them, but I've heard that it's not so great to put opiates into the water supply; an alternative is to crush them up and mix them with something disgusting, like kitty litter or coffee grounds, then put them in the garbage. Make a ritual of it or something. 

Then, have a straight-up conversation with your doctor. Accountability is so important for me. You're not nearly as far gone as I was, and I'm past the shame part of my recovery. I have a new doctor now and I'm just straight up that I'm in recovery and that if a time should come in the future when I need pain meds, we need to have a very serious conversation and I need to be absolutely accountable for my use. I dread that day, because I know how very much I loved the meds. It's that powerful.

For you, I'd also recommend having a conversation with your prescribing doctor, but you could just keep it more simple and let him/her know that your issue is resolved enough that you no longer think strong pain meds are necessary and discuss alternatives. From there, you need to be aware that it's lurking in your brain and that it's on you to keep it at bay. Maybe check out an AA or NA meeting or talk to a therapist. 

I'm wishing you all the very best; addiction is a sneaky and powerful thing. If you ever need to talk, please feel free to PM me.

"So your fiancé is thinking he'll pay for this vacation with his savings, and then...how much will he have left to contribute to the other things y'all are saving up for?  Is he expecting you to take on more of the wedding expenses, more of a downpayment on a house, etc.?  I'm disturbed by this ""it's my money"" business he's pulling - even if y'all have completely separate finances, your financial choices still affect each other, and I'd be concerned that if someone who is underemployed and not making much money uses a bunch of their savings on a vacation, they'd be expecting the other person to pick up a lot of slack.

I think you two need to talk and make sure you're on the same page re: financial goals like wedding, house, savings, etc.  You should also discuss family stuff in general - why does he want to pay for his parents to come on this vacation?  Does he expect to do this frequently? Is he going to want to vacation with his parents every year and/or pay for them on every vacation they come on?  Are you okay with how much involvement he wants his parents to have in y'all's lives?

EDIT: a good compromise may be taking his parents out for a nice dinner or something now and planning a vacation with them once your wedding is over and your fiancé is working full-time again."

"I'm surprised no one has paid attention to the fact that this is a relatively new thing! If there's been a sudden shift in his attitude, it's likely for a particular reason - it's best to talk to him about your own feelings, how you dislike the attitude, and try to work out the root of this."
"Haha my mom is the opposite. I dated a guy in high school, but we had a messy break up and I HATED him for a few years. We reconnected and are dating now. When I told my mom, she just says, ""Oh good I always liked him."" agh I was all prepared to start convincing her! "
"Yeah from reading all this, I think I'm in love with Jason too..."
"Your family sounds awful and I think it might be best for you to permanently separate yourself from them.  They are clearly a sink in your life.

You don't have anything to apologize for.  Make that clear and cut off contact."
"I'm sympathetic to how disappointed you must feel about how this is going to effect your life, but you had unprotected sex, so ya, now you have a baby on the way. That's how that works! 
You can't just give away an oops baby with 3 older siblings. That's no how families work. Can you even imagine how your existing kids will feel? How about that new child when they get old enough to realize they are the discard child because daddy didn't wrap his wanker but didn't want to be a father again? 

I really hope you can turn your attitude around and be there for your family, even if it's not what you would have chosen. P.S. any doctor would have told you guys pre-menopausal does NOT mean you should stop using birth control.  "
"I honestly hope you're wrong, I struggle to comprehend her acting like this. But everything's gone weird this last week.. "
I just feel like other than my kids the last 10 years of my life has been wasted because it was obviously all a lie. 
Oh I get you on this. Because sometimes in life - your insecurities are really justified. 
"&gt;Do I just let him get his own stuff now and do the house shopping by myself? Which seems unfair to me because then all the financial burden for the house items falls solely on my account. 

Everyone is right that you should just buy for yourself and your kid if he's gonna be like that, but I want to talk about this. You don't have your finances set up in a way that household purchases are split? You two just alternate picking things up and hope that it ends up pretty even? Maybe setting up a joint account that you both contribute to equally/proportionally to pay for groceries and household items would be a good idea. Maybe your husband has some idea in his head that if he tacks ""his"" items onto your shopping trips that he's getting a better deal, in some way? That you ""forget"" his items on purpose so that you don't have to pay for them or something (not saying I think that's what you are doing)? "
That's a good one.  I'd like to see her try to logic her way out of that compromise
"I ran the AC at 68 all month in July during a heatwave here in Portland, and only paid $128 for the electric bill, $700 definitely sounds like she hasn't paid the bill in a few months. 

Even the business I work at only pays $500ish every month for electricity, and that's with the AC running and all of our lights, computers, ect.  "
Even if it's like a mental/behavioural addiction instead of a physical addiction I don't really see the difference. I think any relatively young person has known someone whose relationship with weed is unhealthy and compulsive. Whether it's an actual physical addiction is kind of irrelevant to me.
He's either a drug dealer or has a mistress... or in all seriousness it could just have to do with his work. Honestly most cheaters I have known don't put the effort in to do it on a second phone.
"I think they mean to not make similar mistakes with future partners. You may need help forming an idea of what to expect in a (future) healthy relationship, especially since this was the only serious adult relationship you've known. "
"this is an easy problem to solve.

call the credit card company.  report your card as lost, and report a change of address.  remove your mom as an authorized signer. 
 new card, and subsequent statements, are sent to your house instead; your mother is magically no longer able to charge to it.  

the first step is to take back control of that account, and the best way to do so is to get a new card and ensure it is sent to YOUR house, not hers.

yeah, your mom will be pissed.  guess what?  she's not entitled to rack up debt in your name, no matter how much she'll argue to the contrary.

important edit:  if you report the card as lost and have a new card/statements redirected to your home, you are by proxy acknowledging ownership of the account and will be unable to claim identity theft later.  so you have to pick one.  if you know for certain you will never report your mother for identity theft, do this.  otherwise, skip to the report."
"I would personally give it to her straight, and here's why: she probably doesn't get that some of her actions come off as uncomfortable or strange, and she's never gonna get it if someone doesn't tell her. If you ghost her she'll think you had issues anyways, if you tell her you felt uncomfortable with her opening up so quickly and wanting to spend large amounts of time together maybe she'll reflect on that and change for the best (as in she won't do it with other people and won't be so lonely in the future). 

That plan is really caring more about her than you, it's trying to help her see that she can be kind of awkward in case she wants to fix it - and who knows, maybe she doesn't. "
"&gt; I do understand that this sucks for them, in their position I also wouldn't be thrilled. 

In their position you might feel deeply betrayed. Because you might feel that your grandparents gave the deed first to Aunt Mary, she to your father, and your father to his son to act as caretakers of the land for the rest of the family. Not to profit from the land at the family's expense. 

OP, you should take some time to think about what you're doing and whether it's really the right thing. And whether it's worth losing the rest of your family over permanently."

Treatment may change the when, by a little.  But this is what is going to happen.  It's awful, and gut wrenching, and terrible, and cruel, and fucking unfair.

"It's all about what's more important to you.  If having your dad in you and your children's lives is important, than you need to find someone of the same/similar ethnicity.  I really doubt you can have an interracial relationship and children while also having a relationship with your dad.  Very few people will put up with his shit."
"Honestly I would not want to date someone that is as aggressive, possessive, and jealous as you seem. Especially your comment about her 'definitely fucking him' is kind of disgusting. There's a good chance they are just friends, and even if she is dating him it's none of your business unless the two of you have decided you're exclusive.

My advice - if you want any chance with her - is to drop this completely. There is nothing shady about her behavior, she doesn't have to be 100% open with you about everything she does after a few dates. "

"Money and parents is a very cultural issue so there's more than one right answer. I think if you are comfortable that your parents aren't wasting money in other areas which is leading them to ask for help with bills it is ok, your boyfriend doesn't get to decide how you spend your money.  
A change that might make your boyfriend more comfortable while also helping your parents is paying a monthly rent. Being in college full time is financially vulnerable so your boyfriend may be concerned that they are taking advantage of you when you can not afford it but a constant monthly budget will clarify things and make it clear the situation is not going to escalate."
"You're wrong for not leaving him. Obviously him unlocking his phone isnt going to change his behavior. He will continue to lie and flirt and spend money on camgirls, you'll just make him work harder at hiding it."

Do you want to be a prostitute? Do you want him to be your pimp?

WTF. How did you accept that and casually left? How did you not tell him to try his luck with her because clearly this isn't working out?

I'm sorry to be harsh but if you don't have enough self respect to shame him for this behavior and make him see consequences for this unbelievably disrespectful way of dealing with things then I can't help you. Stand up for yourself goshdarnit."

Ive had a similar situation with a bully at work. Mine however is as useless as a box of rocks - extremely unprofessional, and makes my life way harder. She spends a solid 2-3hrs talking about lunch daily to boot. 

I got called into mediation because she whined i was keeping ber from doing her job because i didnt do X/Y/Z etc.
I showed proof i had, got no backup from management and shes done her best to continue to bully me and my dept.

The kicker is she does an awful job and its not a high skill job. A trained monkey could do it (better) as it is at best a admin role.
Shes been with the company less than 60 days when the blowup happened.
I work 80+ hours, been with the company 3yrs, and i have a extremely unique high paid skillset.

Why they continue to back her while she blatently bullies me and goofs off and does a shitty job i will never know. People speculate shes providing sexual favors its so obvious.

I got fed up and decided the best way to handle is to leave. Clearly management isnt going to back up a dedicated employee with 20yrs experience who runs circles out of peers vs an admin who cant send emails to entire company without gross spelling mistakes and claims she ""wasnt told"" something when emailed 4 times in a 8hr timeframe.

Sometimes - its not a battle worth fighting.

"That's not enough money to put up with all this for. Agree to the photo and the job/club/internship thing -- the latter sounds like a lot of work but it'll probably serve you well in the long run. If it's too much you can go for a club or organization that isn't terribly time consuming and/or have ""a really hard time finding an internship, grandma and grandpa!"" 

Do not agree to let them control how you spend your own money and do not agree to let them look through your laptop. If they want to make sure you're doing your homework they have access to your grades already and you might be able to pacify them by sending along the occasional essay or photo or whatever. 

It sounds like they sprung these conditions on you *after* paying, and counted on your gratitude to make you agree. Downside of this manipulative little plot for them is that most of what they spent is nonrefundable, so refusing will cause some friction and likely result in you having to pay your own way for the rest of your college career but it won't screw you too bad.

"Not to mention incredibly stupid.  Besides, 42 is definitely not too young to have children. Holy shit. "
"First, you need to prioritise your own safety. Your emotional, mental, and physical safety as well as the safety of your possessions. You do that by not being in contact or physically around your little brother. This will consequences for your relationships with your parents, and whilst that might hurt it's still in your best interest.

You can't stay over or visit your parents house anymore. You met up with your parents only outside the house without your brother. You don't come home for holidays or birthdays and just mail the gifts. You get all your things, especially sentimental things, out of your parents house. Consider offering taking some of the heirlooms for safe keeping. You block your little brother on all social media, and instruct your parents to not give him any info about you. You need so systematically and consistently cut out your brother.

Secondly, you need to realise it's not your responsibility to fix your brother. As an older brother and son, it's instinctual to try to fix a dysfunctional family situation. But there are three people activly working against any such efforts. You are only one person. You are so vastly outnumbered that it doesn't even make sense to try.

But as a last ditch effort to help your family you should call the CPS. Seriously, call the CPS as soon as you, your possesions, and your social media is safe. The responsibility of the CPS isn't just to catch abusive parents, but to help and assist children in bad situations, which includes bad situations due to mental illness. So call them and explain that you believe that your little brother has an undiagnosed mental illness that is making him a threath to himself and others and that your parents is not capable of caring for him. Tell them about your little brothers behaviour, especially incidents that involves school or resulted in contact with a hospital or police, but also how your parents are dealing with him. Your brother needs professional help at this point, and this is the fastest way to ensure that he gets it. But after you make the call you relinquish any responsibility you feel for your brother, and go back to focusing on step one: prioritising your own well being and safety. Good luck!"

"You need to do several things:

-make sure all bank accounts are in your name only.  Set up new accounts and close current accounts if necessary.  You may even want to go to a different bank than the one your mom is using now.

-talk to your brother.   Make sure he knows what is going on so that he can protect his money.  If necessary he may have to confront her if she has stolen money from him too.

Now about your dad.  I know that you promised not to tell him but he needs to know if you mother is running up debts that he is ultimately responsible for too.  It sound like your mother has a spending problem and your dad needs to know before any more damage is done to your family's finances.  Your mom needs counseling to deal with her spending issues.  "

"I'm not vegan but I'm a vegetarian who eats very little dairy. Everyone around me had the same concerns and frequently lectured me, especially because I barely started showing until I was in my third trimester (I'm average weight). My baby ended up being 9.5 pounds. I'm sure someone on here will come at me like, ""That's unhealthy too!!!"" but whatever. About ten of my friends and coworkers were pregnant and due around the same time as me and my baby was by far the biggest. I think it was surprising to everyone that the vegetarian made the biggest baby when it was thought all along I was the one getting the least nutrition. I was actually the one who had zero pregnancy complications too and had hardly any symptoms, but I'm sure that was more so because of my own genetics with a dash of luck than the fact that I don't eat meat. 

I'd just listen to your doctors who say you're fine and healthy and ride out this wave with your partner and your families. If you're only a couple months along, you're still in the stage where everything is new, scary and worrisome. They're probably so excited and happy about the baby that they're nervous about something going wrong. You'll be able to see soon through ultrasounds how baby is developing and I'm sure that'll ease everyone's minds, including yours!

For now, educate your partner and families as best you can, take your prenatal vitamin, and encourage your partner to come to appointments so he can see/hear for himself that everything is okay with you and baby. Remember that your baby will take what it needs first and that he or she can endure way more than you think.

Congratulations!

ETA: I focused on my baby's size because I know people equate proper nutrition with weight and use that silly little number as an indicator of health, even though so much more goes into it! I was just saying people expected me to have a smaller baby because I don't eat meat, and obviously my baby grew just fine and then some! lol I know genes play a role as well, but in my case I don't really know where my larger baby came from."
I'm honestly surprised it took so long. After the second incident with a lot of places he would have been marched out and told never to return. He invited this by behaving like a jackass and thinking he was irreplaceable. And now as he is learning everyone can be replaced 
"I saw two of my friends go get addicted to Oxies and it literally takes like a week. And none of them had access like 200+ tablets in four packages, which OP's gf has. I'd be surprised if she didn't end up overdosing or vomiting in her sleep by the end of the year. With access like that, and being an addict already, the girl is doomed. "
"And now that sentence can be, it's weird that a 26 year old dated an 18 year old. He just seems off. You did not wrong OP."
"Thresholds differ but my social work team would never ever ever even consider this as needing any intervention.

For context, you can be an active user that gets your kids to school most of the time and they get fed in breakfast and after school clubs, your kids will stay with you.

WHY would anyone willingly sign up for such a shit deal?
"He agreed on the situation under terms he's violating. Simple as that. ""You said you'd sleep in the bedroom. You've been on the couch every night. What the fuck, man?""

"I really regret not breaking up with my bf to study abroad while in college. We ended up breaking up anyway, before I was even done. I say dump her and go for a full year!"
"&gt;She just invited me to Coney Island (a knockoff Six Flags) in Brooklyn with the kid for tomorrow.

first of all how dare you, Six Flags is a knockoff Coney Island, thank you very much.

Second: you are 100% correct that it is too early to meet her kid."
"Wow.  Well it's obvious your husband has no respect for you.  You've attempted to call him out on his crap but then he's instantly dismissive of you as well.

I think you're just going to have to tell him your sick of his lack of respect for you and make she he knows how he always makes you feel like shit when he does this sort of thing.  Loving husbands support their wives, they don't put them down all the time. 

This is probably something that you need to decide if it's going to make or break your marriage.  If he doesn't want to change then do you give him an ultimatum?  

&gt; Wow she's too lazy check the steaks at my own party

The answer to this is ""Yes I'm so lazy that I bought the groceries, made the food, and prepared every aspect of this party.  Now get off your ass and check the steaks."" in front of every person there.  You need to stand up for yourself, he walks all over you because you let him."
"Yeah look people saying stuff like that are 100% being derogatory, or just seeking to insult you. You can give a complement without tacking an insult onto the end of it like that. And you can make jokes that don't seriously hurt the feelings of the person you're talking about.

You don't need to cut them out entirely. Even just slowly limiting contact and then fading out on them would be better than forcing yourself into a friendship that makes you feel terrible. There is the possibility that even if you tell them it makes you feel bad, they keep doing it, and that's when you cut them out.

If possible, maybe bring up your body image issues with the therapist? He would know if it's appropriate for him to talk about it with you or not, and you might find breaking down your issues by describing them to someone else could make you feel better."
"Common sense DOES tend to go out the window when some people become grandparents.

And she might NOT have given birth - OP could be adopted, or had through a surrogate, or whatever. I doubt that's the case, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "
"I let my husband read this. I'm your (ex) boyfriend's age. Husband is a little older. He says your boyfriend is a violent dude and would bet a kidney that he's never playing. He also looked at the ages and sighed. He then said, ""Let me guess. This is her first serious relationship and he lords his 'experience' over her. Oh no, babe! I'm just playing! This is how real relationships are! Why are you so sensitive? I wouldn't get so mad if you wouldn't..."" 

I hope we're wrong, but since he already behaves like a wacko it seems likely that we're not. Our advice to you is that if ANYONE ever gives you any of those lines, uses violence as a joke, or play fighting as an excuse to seriously hurt you, leave them. They're not a good person. They don't have good points. It's not your fault. You cannot change them. Just leave.

Remember to always respect yourself."
"Yeah pooping like that is a sign of really severe mental illness, and everything else you've described makes me think he has anti-social personality disorder"
"You are right, are not ditching her, she is choosing to ditch *you* and the trip you two had planned. The reason you can't make her understand is because she understands perfectly well. She does not need a whole week to pack for her dorm. That is just an excuse, she is doing this as a power play.  

Be prepared, when you go there is a 99% chance she is going to manufacture an ""emergency"" while you are gone and blow up your phone and try and guilt you into coming back. Don't fall for it. Don't even look at your phone. And don't fall for any ""I fell down a well (or whatever) because you were gone, and then you didn't answer your phone to come rescue me so I was trapped and it's all your fault"" when you get back.  "
They've been **together** a year. They've been broken up for 7-10 years since OP says they dated in high school.
Sounds like he is trying to sabotage her.  How about you invite her to come visit you and get a breather to figure out what she really wants.
"I'm probably giving similar advice to everyone here, but it's important nonetheless.

1.) Get your kids tested and make sure they aren't suffering the consequences of someone's bad decisions.

2.) Don't immediately lead in with ""YOU CHEATED ON ME!"" Show him the results and explain what HIV is and make sure you emphasize any negative effects and possible sources to him. If he did something bad, he will snap under pressure.

3.) If you think he's hiding something or he confesses, find a good lawyer."

"His changes should be for him, not conditional on your continued presence in his life.

He has a lot of work ahead of him. You're both very young and you have a lot of changes ahead of you. Let him go do the work he needs to do on himself without having to focus on a relationship. Meanwhile maybe you can try experiencing a relationship that isn't a project. "
"&gt; ""I just would want you to have one real child"". 

""If I ever hear those words, or anything like them, from you ever again, you will not have a relationship with me or my child.""

"It seems very strange that he remembers these conversations, but somehow doesn't understand what they mean. I agree that both neurological and psychiatric visits are in order. "
"Agreed.  This isn't getting distracted or solely forgetful.  This is an inability to draw basic inferences and make associations.  Someone with a car cannot pick you up in said non-existent car.  A four month road trip won't be booked for lodging in a single spot.  Besides, if you were living somewhere for four months, you get a furnished apartment.  Renting a hotel/airbnb is insane for that duration."
"Also very ironic that it was your Dad who was so overly sensitive to having his ""buttons pushed"" that he had to run home. Maybe your parents should practice what they preach and not be so sensitive. "
"One night when things are getting frisky, slow down. Way down. Before my first real girlfriend and I ever had sex, we had this moment where we just undressed each other and took a step back to just kind of look. My hands were covering my dick, which isn't small but I was embarrassed because I wasn't huge like I had believed all girls wanted. She covered her chest even though she was gorgeous. 

I took my hands away from myself. I watched her look me up and down, and I closed the gap and lightly pushed her arms away, exposing her.

Then we hugged and stood there holding each other, just feeling our bodies against each other.

I've gotta say, if anything ever affected the way I view my body, it was that moment where she and I stripped away our insecurities in front of each other and then physically supported the other. It was fucking awesome. I felt no shame, even when I had clothes on. I got more confidence to wear more than just baggy sweats. She was more confident in her outfits, my god she stepped her game up, and she was also less afraid to be in physical contact.

By the time we starting sleeping together we were so comfortable with each other that it felt so natural. 

We ended up breaking up because of petty teenager shit, but being so at ease with my body and hers, and her with her body and mine... man it was great.

So basically, try and take a step to break that ice. If there's anything you guys can do together to explore this aspect of your (and hers too!) self image, nothing but good can come. You'll be more confident and you guys will hopefully have a better bond with that understanding, however long it takes you to get there. 

Wishing you the best, good luck buddy"
"I know this isn't your question, but please think about the impact your fiancee has on your son.  It is very hard on a child to be shown that they are only worthy of love when they are ""good.""

Have you considered talking to her about it?  Stating what you observed, and why you think it's a bad time to have a baby?

Can you three do some family therapy to learn parenting skills before you start trying?"
"If they just got back together after a separation, this is at least strike two."
"Of course she's being unfair. But while you are living with her, living by her rules is just going to be the option from which the least amount of drama ensues. "
"&gt;  but seems to be a common parenting tactic these days. 

jfc, really? That's terrifying. It's micromanaging on the most micro of scales. There's no reason for something like this with a minor child unless you know they have been up to shenanigans and it's part of a set duration of punishment.

There's no reason at all for it with an adult.

Fucking surveillance culture."
Perhaps you mean sympathy rather than empathy. I'm not sure any rational person could truly understand that sort of hatred and bigotry. It is their lack of empathy that is noteworthy. 
You guys should both take the 5 love languages quiz - sounds like she's more of a gifts person while you're more of a quality time person which is why you thought the event was a good present while she didn't.

"I'm guessing when she told you you could have sex with someone else, she wasn't expecting you to actually do it. which is kind of unfair to you, but I'm sure she felt a lot of guilt about not being able to have sex with you and probably told you to find someone else out of anger. then you brought it up again...

I'm not sure why you were expecting her to be fine and dandy with you having sex with someone else. I don't think you thought this through at all. Counseling, individually and as a couple might help. She's probably feeling incredibly hurt. It isn't her fault that she's not capable of having piv sex, and instead of working towards finding another solution, you jumped into someone else's pants. I hope you guys find a way to work through this."
"Exactly this. She's done. It's over. If one partner wants to end things it's over. She doesn't ""have"" to stay for any reason. And OP is a bit delusional in thinking publicly shaming her and calling her crazy is going to make her wake up, realize she's been wrong all along and come running back to him. Let her go. Get a lawyer and counselor. Sounds like there's some self-reflection to be had here."

"Easy solution: never offer to get them anything again. In fact, just don't tell then you're going, just go and come back.

Then, start looking and applying elsewhere. This isn't normal. It's either some kind of prank or you got some weird people you're working with. "
"I can't even imagine the psychological effects of stress + familial problems + losing a baby all at the same time... has she seen a therapist? She is probably feeling claustrophobic and overwhelmed by everything coming crashing down. If she makes hasty decisions, she will likely lose her husband forever."
Yes she tells me it's my fault she has to go through my phone because she doesn't trust me 
"You get to pick then. Do you want to be uncomfortable alone, or uncomfortable with the dog? You can't have it two ways. "
"&gt; I don't know why you're married to him.

This sums up what I was thinking while reading. I fail to understand the reason why she got married to this person who seems, at best, indifferent to her."
"Wow. Having been through a nearly identical situation myself in the pre-smartphone year of 2003, I want to give you a major ray of hope. 

You have this golden chance now to completely reset your life and start something new. You can make new friends. You can devote yourself to a wildly fun and adventurous hobby that, while married, seemed too silly to even try. You can find someone new once you get your bearings and feel like you can trust someone again. You are very, very young. I promise you all these delights are possible, and yours for the taking. 

I was your age when all this happened to me, too, and it aged me beyond my peers for sure, but there is still so much light in your heart to shine on your world, I promise. Embrace your family, your friends, and most of all, yourself. Cry all you need to cry but balance it out with sunsets on the beach, puppy kisses, karaoke nights, forest hikes at dawn. Give yourself all the love and compassion you can. 

PM me anytime. "
You can't fix this. Sounds like your boss isn't protecting you from an obviously abusive co-worker. This might be better addressed in r/legaladvice 
"Hi OP! You're getting a lot of biased responses here so let me speak from a sorority perspective.

In my sorority (an NPC sorority), we don't do hearings and we don't usually ask others to ""testify"" - we would call that member into a meeting with the Chapter Relations &amp; Standards Board and speak with her privately, then work out a contract with either sanctions - like, you pay this fine for missing this event, or you have to attend the next 3 non-mandatory events, or whatever. There would be no need to bring anyone else into it because we know they missed so what's there to testify? It's also entirely confidential from start to finish and the president had no right telling you what she told you. It also gives the member to speak to the board honestly about what may be going on with them, or to be like, ""honestly guys, it's personal, I've been sick, etc."" It should be between that member and the board and nobody else - especially not the member's little?

I'm not sure what sorority you're in, but it seems massively unfair and completely goes against the values of a sisterhood organization. Do you have an advisor you could speak to, or someone from your HQ (if you have one), or even someone from the Office of Fraternity/Sorority Life at your campus? Nothing about this seems correct and someone should step in and help you guys work out a different way to handle behavioral issues. I would also look into what your bylaws say - do they require you to testify against another sister? Do they go into detail at all about the process for these hearings? I just can't imagine an organization would require you to rat your sisters out like that?

And honestly, if it comes down to it and you can't find a way out, I wouldn't testify against her. Honestly, I love sorority life and I'm the biggest supporter of it in both college and alumna life, but it's not worth this, and everyone I know says that the drama they deal with in their chapters isn't shit once they get out in the real world. PM me if you need to talk some more. Best of luck to you!"
Actually even before you told me I was thinking this. I'll never leave my baby alone with them. I have always feared that they would convince the child that I'm evil. They even told a few days ago if they baby is left with them for some time he/she will tell me that he/she is going to live with them and not coming back to me. 
"&gt; (That's errr how it works, right?)

I *think* they actually stab you through ~~the abdomen into your ovary with a giant needle~~ and suck some eggs out that way. 

Edit: Turns out they go up through the vagina, the needle goes *through* your uterine wall, and into the ovary, and then sucks up the eggs. "
"&gt; I told him if he did it again, I'd leave. 

Stick to those guns, otherwise he'll know he can keep doing it without you leaving in the future. 

"
"I'd be mostly worried about them wanting another new best friend now that you've grown up. 

They're lonely, sad and wanting you to fund them while they re-live being single child parents all over again with your child. Don't let them do it.    "
You don't have children to make someone else happy.  
"They weren't trying to set him straight, ever. What they wanted was punishment, pure and simple. As far as they are concerned, he hasn't yet been punished enough. I suspect they would prefer that the punishment never end."
"I'd be careful with this because I think it'll have the opposite effect. Step mother played puppet master before to get OP shipped off, who is to say she's not still doing so now?

I'm absolutely willing to bet this is financially driven. Way back when step-monster was probably willing to ""pay whatever it takes"" to get OP away from her precious nuclear family picture. A few years on and the fear of OP ruining things has faded; she's probably looking at the bill and wondering why OP has so much money spent on her, and not on her two precious biological children who are *obviously* better and worth more. -insert eye roll-

The compromise with daddy dearest was probably that step monster conceded to let OP continue to go to private school, but locally, which would obviously be much cheaper than having to pay for room &amp; board. 

OP look at scholarship options for your school and see if you can qualify for any. You might have better grounds to make the argument to stay if there's no/reduced cost. That would be what I'd start the conversation with step mom with, ""look, I have this scholarship so I can go to school for free/cheaper! But dad wants to throw that money and opportunity away. You could save that money for brother/sister's education!""

I think you need to be careful about mentioning the things you overheard as a young child. That could be used as fuel to ""justify"" why your relationship with step-monster and her kids needs to be ""fixed.""

I'd push back on your dad when he can talk about it about what specifically causes this complete 180? Point to the drastic and traumatic change and ask why he went for that instead of implementing gradual changes first. What caused this to suddenly be an issue now when it never was before? What other steps could be taken to fix the issue without stripping away something you love?"
My husband is my absolute best friend.  I don't see the point of being with someone if you're not friends.  Why would you want to spend that much time with them?
"She hit you and that's not okay.

You neglected your child by letting a baby sit in shit for twenty minutes and have apparently abdicated all parenting to your wife, and that's not okay either.

Your wife hit you once: how many times have you stuck her with all the parenting and household tasks? Because that sounds like something you do daily.

None of that justifies your wife hitting you but when people ask why you have a hand print on your face I hope you answer honestly and fully."
He already set the tone when he gave up on his dream.
"I'll give that a go, thanks! (I *do* actually straight up hate his last name...but for tact, I think I'll stick with reasoning with him because of the unfortunate initials). "
"&gt; I suggested he take mine. He said he didn't see why he should have to.

And he doesn't see why should you have to?

the problem is that a name is such a small part of obe's identity, and it's this tiny thing that's causing so much friction.

I think you need to be clear that there are two options. You keep your name, or you don't get married."
"I always think of this Mark Twain quote: ""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor.""

"I'm not only proud of you, I'm very proud of your parents for handling it in a manner to make it your choice.  Since they had such a respectful way of saying where their opinions lie, you are more likely to respect their way of when you DO wear it. 

Wearing it around family and mosque events is no different in my opinion than not wearing shorts and tank tops or club wear to a (christian) church event.  Its respect.  

I don't think you will go crazy with your hair style or looks, and you don't have to (unless you want).  Get your hair trimmed and play with it to figure out what best fits YOU.  "
Sounds like you need to dump him. That's toxic.
It's ridiculous that they thought to start mailing this stuff in the first place! It's bloody rude and unwanted unless I ask for it.

"His adoption is not something that needs special accomodation. Every time you do something 'because he's adopted', you not only separate him from other kids, but you also make it seem as if being adopted is something taboo. This is a child you want to keep and love forever in your home. That means you discipline him in a loving way that corrects his behaviour. If you don't, his adoption will become a chip on his shoulder. 

Because your parents apparently struggle with his adoption, perhaps it's better to keep them away for a few weeks. They are grandparents now, you need to teach them as well, just like Elias. Correct them lovelingly that Elias' parenting is not up to them and your rules come first regarding him."
"OP don't do this, your dad has given no indication that he has changed or cares about your emotional needs. Quite the opposite considering the bombshell he just lodged at you. This letter being successful banks on your dad being someone who he isn't, depends on a cruel and selfish man acting empathetically and selflessly."
"Turns out telling him not to isn't actually going to do anything but oppress him.  Forbidding it isn't the right thing to do.

Just let him play with them and don't worry about it."
"Yeah, this. I am kind of with Liz to a degree, albeit she could need some help letting go of this since it's as resolved as it is ever going to be - the only excessive thing i see here is turning the job offer down and leaving her crappy worklplace behind (when I read ""since the production didn't suffer"" I just thought, this is going to be bad, they suck). 

Being blind sided like this didn't help I guess. Did Chad really have to mention a thing that was deemed not her fault, solved internally and happened, apparently, when he wasn't part of the company anymore? I don't feel competent telling people in professional settings things I didn't witness because I was already working somewhere else, and feel no moral obligation to do so if I know the company did this to themselves and the employee shouldn't have put in this situation to begin with. That, and Liz isn't OP's colleague, but his girlfriends, he acts like a co worker, not like a partner. "
"The guy is an inch shorter than you, not barely over 5 feet. This would be akin to turning down an awesome person because they're 10 pounds overweight. I mean if such a small aesthetic thing is enough of an issue for you to pass up on what seems to be a great guy then that is your prerogative, but by limiting yourself that strictly you're probably going to miss out on a lot in life.

If you can't get over it, just end things and *do not tell him it was because of his height.* There's nothing he can do to change it and shorter men often get enough shit for their height so it'd only serve to upset him which he doesn't deserve. Just say you think it isn't working out between you and let him find someone who accepts his height."
"I want an updateeee of thisss! Man, that sounds so sweet"
"Sounds really tough. I wonder if he's on the spectrum. Nothing wrong about being on it, but if he is, it would be easier to deal with him if you knew what an effective communication tactic would be.

Anyway... wait, did he sign the lease with you guys? If not, you can always exclude him and say you're sorry but you guys made a decision. The friendship will crumble for sure but...

Have you tried talking to him about how clingy and creepy he can be? Maybe he just doesn't realize it and needs people to tell him what he's doing wrong. I have a friend who my friends and I suspect is on the spectrum because of how she communicates and how clueless she is in reading social queues so we constantly have to tell her things. When we do, she asks questions until she understands. It's frustrating a lot of the time but gotta be patient

TL,DR: talk to him about how he's making it hard for the rest of you but make him understand why. "
"So, to your disappointment, he didn't see the need to give you an engagement ring (as you say in your comments), but THIS outdated tradition is non-negotiable for him? How convenient for him.

You say you let the ring thing slide, despite your disappointment. Clearly, then, you're capable of compromise and respecting his feelings and opinions. But this issue is more important to you, for multiple reasons. Stand your ground and find out if your fiancé is capable of respecting your reasoned opinions even when they're hard for him to hear. If not, this doesn't bode well for your life together."

"If I was your sister, I would do the same. And I find it completely acceptable that she reacts like that to someone being so neglectful to my child.

But about what you can do in this situation: So far it seems like you are looking at all of this from the wrong perspective. You see your sister as the problem, and you want to find a way to make her talk to everyone again. She is not the problem, and she has the right to talk to whoever she wants.

If you want to still be in her life, you should stop making excuses for your mom and show your sister some support. She is already going through something really difficult, and your response is to treat her like she is wrong and put more pressure on her to do something she is not comfortable with. 

How about being a supportive brother? Ask if her son is ok and offer support. Tell her you understand what she is going through, and respect her wishes."
He has at least one a day unfortunately 
"I don't think you're being paranoid. Sophie is acting very weird, moody and is seeing David a lot. She is deleting David's messages to her. She was at his place and didn't tell you. 

The very first time you met this guy, he commented on your girlfriend's breasts. To your face. You were right to not react, but it shows that he thinks of her sexually and is flaunting it to you. Maybe he gets off on ""stealing"" away women who are taken. He sounds like a real asshole. 

I wish you'd mentioned this to Sophie, not to make it her fault, but to show her this side of his character (the part which treats her as a sexual object rather than a person) if he'd been Mr. Super Charming to her face up to that point. 

I'd confront her gently with the evidence you have (you seem very sympathetic rather than abrasive in your writing style, so I think this will be as diplomatic as it could be), and say you want to work on your relationship with her as a priority. Emphasize that it's not the meeting with her guy friends that's the problem, it's that she's not being straightforward with you about when she's meeting with them, the acting oddly moody, the hiding text messages and lashing out at you for no good reason. Then the ball is in her court to take responsibility and prioritize your relationship if it is indeed important to her to be faithful. I don't doubt some things have happened, and you will have to wait to find out from her whether this constituted emotional or physical cheating or both, and how you want to proceed from there.  "
"My guess is that he can't stop talking about her because she was cute and he felt that she ""obviously wanted to date him."" She puffed up his ego and he can't stop wanting to revisit that feeling and let you know that he's desirable. I think this has less to do with any feeling he has towards this girl and more to do with the fact that it sounds like it was a very pleasant ego stroke for him. "
"Your snooping is secondary to what you found. Addressing this problem has to be priority.

You cancel the visit immediately. Then you sit down and tell your wife what you found and explain that if she wants to keep the relationship with you alive then she has some explaining to do. If she chooses instead to make you the bad guy, turn the issue around and freak out about the snooping, etcetc then you know just how much she truly wants to fix things. She needs to be totally open and apologetic.

Then you proceed to ask her why she never told you and most importantly how she could be so cold as to invite the man she had feelings for to your house and get you to agree to it while withholding details about her feelings for him. I personally couldn't get over this, but if you want to try then you need to confront her and have some serious talks about boundaries and respect. Also, he needs to be out of the picture forever. No contact."
"a childhood friend of my son is in this position.  she is 22, works her ass off, pays her bills on time, is an all around awesome kid, and has a credit score in the 485 range because her mom took out a card in her name ""to build her credit,"" then another, and another, and another.  and then car loans.  and apartment leases.  and defaults on every single one of the bills.

she uncovered it all first slowly, then quickly.  she got a bill in her name from a credit card company she'd done no business with - her mom ran the ""i did it for youuuuu!"" line.  (mom had previously hidden it by using her husband's business address as her mailing address, but apparently fucked up somewhere along the line.)

 i urged her to run her credit report.  she didn't know how, so i did it for her.  15 lines of credit in her name, some dating back to when she was 12 or 13.  including her mother's lexus.  and her mother's utility bills.  macys, victoria's secret, nordstrom, multiple major credit cards, on and on it went.  i felt like vomiting.

unfortunately for my young friend, her mother is a beauty, looks far younger than she is, and can easily pass for her daughter.  (btw, we figured out where her 'missing' driver's license went a few years ago - into mom's wallet.)

unfortunately, you have two choices here:

report identity theft and file a police report, dispute all accounts, and freeze your credit

or

pay this bill (and any others) in order to protect your credit score, and freeze your credit

my young friend chose the latter, because she didn't want to 'fuck over' her mother (setting aside the fact that mom fucked HER over, and this was only one example of such), and is 25 grand in debt as a result.  of course, in her case, there was the danger of being considered culpable for fraud as well, since her mother wasn't merely opening secret accounts, but was doing so under the kid's identification.  personally, i don't think it was that big of a risk, especially if she'd hired an attorney, but she didn't want to take that chance anymore than she wanted to see her mom end up in jail with five other minor children to care for.  so, she sucked it up, and is working double shifts to pay off her mother's underwear.  awesome.  

frankly, i'm guessing this isn't the first time your mother has screwed you over, and it probably won't be the last.  in your position, and in my young friend's position, i'd personally report identity theft and scorch the earth.

at the very, very least, however, you need to freeze your credit.  and it wouldn't hurt to post over on /r/credit for more specific advice."
"Wow this is fascinating.  He needs to see a doctor about this.  This really seems to only have two possibilities: mental issue like ADHD , or he's malicious. Can't imagine the middle ground.   Please give updates though this is the most fascinated I've been with a relationships post..."
Right like wow that's not even a red flag thats a red blanket lol

"None of this sounds romantic and it's just so many red flags here. He sounds incapable of or unwilling to manage his own life, putting you in the role of parent. He doesn't take your thoughts and opinions seriously. He clearly has no concept of money and made an enormous financial decision without consulting you. 

Also, you say you have been waiting for a sign that this wasn't going to work out. People in happy, healthy, functional relationships don't do that. "
Thank you for breaking this down into understandable steps. It's so important when dealing with traumatic experiences. 
"Oxy is not a drug you even want to entertain as a ""for fun"" thing. 


PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE confront her and tell her that if she uses this, you cannot be with her anymore. It is highly addictive and will ruin her life. Encourage her to get help immediately and for the love of God tell her this is an immediate deal breaker. 


Do not let her try to sweet talk you into allowing it sometimes. This has to stop now. "
"This is super bizarre. She's acting extremely entitled, as though you automatically ""owe"" her a relationship just because she and her boyfriend broke up. Even if you were occasionally the subject of their fights, so what? You didn't know, and it's not your fault her boyfriend has jealousy issues.

She's like the girl version of the Nice Guy^TM.

Actual advice? I'd steer clear of her in the future, and if you feel like defending yourself to your friend's wife, you can make it clear you're not interested in the sister that way, and never gave her cause to believe otherwise. But given that she's the wife's SIL and your friend's little sister, there's always the chance that they'll automatically take her side anyway.  "
"&gt;But your kids need to learn this eventually. The 9 year old should be able to find his way home in his own neighborhood.

Seriously. With the millennial generation being accused of being entitled and constantly needing hand-held in the workplace, I can't imagine what Gen Z will be like, if this is common. 

OP, if you and your husband have time to drive them to school, then you have time to walk them to the bus stop. Then leave work to pick them up from the bus stop. You need to do this for no more than a couple days at 9 years old. This should have been done way earlier. "
So he trusts you enough to have sex with but not enough to tell something any business can find when they pull his credit report.  Either he is really strange or something is going on
You may want to add this to your post so people are aware. 
"Just call him up and end it. Don;t meet them, don;t go to dinner, just end things with  him before they arrive.

I'm sorry, what I'm going to say next may sound harsh but I don't mean it to be. *He has said he doesn't want a relationship with you*.  You ending things with him is not going to hurt him deeply, or ruin his parent's visit.


"
"&gt; I feel like I have no right to complain at this point since I let him have the room, but I can't help but feel like I got played and it really pisses me off.

OP, you have got to work on not being a doormat. You let this guy bully you into taking the bigger bedroom and not paying a cent more when you knew he wouldn't use it, and you also feel you have no right to complain. you have EVERY right to complain! He uses the living room as his bedroom! That's weird and it means you don't have a living room, plus you have a crappy bedroom!

Plan your remarks and say that this situation is not working for you, you tried it but it isn't. It isn't fair for you to pay half the rent and have a small, dark bedroom and no living room. It simply isn't. You aren't getting the normal things a person would get for their rent as he is hogging the community space plus the largest, nicest private space. Tell him that his choices are to either pay significantly more rent (and prepare a dollar figure) because he has significantly more of the house than you do OR to let you move into the master suite. "
"He needs to learn some common sense. Watching TV instead of making dinner? Making his wife clean up the second blowout instead of pitching in? He's utterly useless. How can he have two children and not know how to clean up poop, unless he literally closes his eyes while he wife is doing the cleaning."
"Yes. Great job. 

But you guys never skyped before hand or facetimed? Or had her take a pic with the date on a piece of paper? "
"Your second paragraph hit the nail on the head. She is very good at what she does and takes great pride in her work. 

But you are right, my first reaction is to just try and fix the problem. I will definitely try to start stepping back and understand her feelings. Her happiness is sincerely the most important thing in my life right now. "
Good. You deserve better. 
"So he sexually harassed if not sexually assaulted you. Ok. You shouldn't be in the same room as him alone. Probably best not to be in the same building with him alone. 

His life and emotional state must be a car-crash if he's thinking this is ok, or he's been shitty for years and only his fear of divorce or being caught kept him from doing this when you were 15. It doesn't really matter - that's for him and his therapist to sort out, and has nothing to do with you, his victim. It's his fuckedupness, one way or another. Nothing to do with you - you were just available.

It isn't your job to be his psychiatrist, his stand-in wife, or his fleshlight. He is an adult who can sort his own problems or seek help where he needs it, from those who are qualified to give it. You need to be looking to your own protection and wellbeing, not lighting yourself on fire to keep him warm. 

Whether you tell your friend about this is for you to decide. I would suggest you tell your friend and your own parents, but that's your judgment (no doubt others here will have stronger opinions on this). I think for me the thing that would make it vital to tell is if you think any of his daughter's other friends might become targets should the same situation recur. If you are able, try to protect others as well as yourself.

"Take your mom up on her offer of buying you a lock. Get multiple locks if you can. Keep all of the keys, so your sister can't just steal spares from your mom's purse or something. I know you store a lot of your clothes outside of your room, but you should lock your door anyway. 

Is your mom punishing your sister when she steals things from you? Taking away her laptop, phone, etc? 

Why does your mom need you at home? "
"His ""in her position he'd be fine"" thing doesn't make sense to me. He's basically telling her that he needs the car so he doesn't sit inside all day, but if he were her sitting inside all day he'd be fine! It's BS because he's obviously not fine with not having the car "

"Some off the wall advice:

How attractive you are can have a lot to do with where you are.  I went to a small, rural university and it was like I didn't exist to the men there.  The preferred type was blonde and preppy.  It got on my nerves when we couldn't get group work done because the men were too busy chatting up the cutie pies.

Then I moved to a different university town with more of an urban vibe, and I get lots of male attention.  So you might only have to put up with this through grad school.

Second, you need to either make peace with your choices about glasses and hair or change them.  It's very likely that you read as a lesbian, and gross men don't pay attention to you because they figure there's 'no point.'

"
"Well, i have fewer friends than you! Probably 8-10, 3 really close friends. But I'm happy with that. I am always open to meeting new people and am good at it and i stay as busy as i want to. That's all that matters.

For what its worth, your parents talking about you like that is pretty terrible. You might bring up to thwm that you overheard them laughing and calling you pathetic and explain that you are happy with your life the way it is.

As the other poster said, paraphrased: introverted is a fine way to be. I would say your parents are the ones who don't get it."
"Bang on. I'm a behaviour therapist and work with children with this disorder. Drop the gifted. The amount of times you referenced it in this post makes me question the rest of your information so I'm sure your family is struggling to believe what appears to be conflicting diagnosis'.

Follow all this advice to the letter. Starting now. "
"&gt;Specifically, he gets shitty.

Oh that's just weird.  

I am short, and my husband is tall.  He *always* walks ahead.  I hate it.   I even called him on his cell phone once, he'd gone that far ahead.  I find it insulting and disrespectful.  I've been cool and calm and I've also been very angry when talking about it with him.   

**He never gets angry with me when I bring this up**.  He knows **why** I see it as a problem *especially* on a date night. 

We eventually compromised - when he knows it's important he will really try to stay by my side (or walk a little behind me so that I kind of 'block' him from speeding up).

"Really? Cuz to me it sounds like a normal kid who gets no love or attention at home.

"He's made his position clear - he does not want to be a father. Carrying on with this pregnancy will mean the end of your relationship.

Break up with him, file for child support when the child is born and prepare for life as a single parent. "
"Omg this is exactly what I thought and I told my husband that I suspect this. That they want to re live their past, that's why they are asking to send my baby to them. 

And when I refused they told ""why not, we are parents, aren't we"". I told them u r my parents not my child's parents. My child's parents are my husband and myself. I remember mum crying over it and she didn't talk to me for a few days after that. "
I think the husband should have met them at the stop the first time. 
"Seconded. Starting from when I was 11, my 7 year old brother and I would walk to school 15 mintues away on our own but for the first week my mom went with us until she was satisfied we had the route down.

"&gt; She does have a bf but he's abit of a douche and it looks like he's on his way out(hopefully)

I wasn't going to call you an asshole, but dude. Are you seriously hoping your long-term girlfriend's sister's boyfriend gets out of the picture so you can have a shot with her? Have you forgotten that you have a LONG-TERM GIRLFRIEND? 

Twins are not interchangeable - you can't just switch one for the other and expect everything to be hunky-dory. 

If you no longer feel like your relationship with your girlfriend is working out, then break-up with her. People grow apart, it happens.

But don't you dare pursue her twin sister. If you do, you will permanently destroy the relationship between the two sisters and ruin their family. Nothing is worth that. "
"Please NEVER comment to a father that he is babysitting so the mother has some time off. He is as much a parent as she is, and if it's his kid, he's parenting, not babysitting."

"&gt;Linda tells me that she senses something is off with Emily and that Emily is acting rude towards her. I tell Linda that everything is fine and that she might just be acting hyper-sensitive/insecure.

Dude, what is wrong with you that your first impulse isn't to ask ""Hey babe why do you feel like that? Did something happen? Can I do something to make you more comfortable? Tell me more."" Way to dismiss your gf's feelings and gaslight her into submission."
"So it won't be a bad thing to keep asking him about this? This is all foreign territory to me, as this is my first relationship that has become 100% sexual. I just don't want to be a nag, and while I don't mind arguing, I'm afraid he'll shut down again and we'll end the argument solving nothing. I think he cares about my feelings, but doesn't understand where I'm coming from. Like he doesn't get why I would want more sex. "
"Kids go through phases where they are VERY attached to certain people. First it will be mommy, then daddy, then Uncle Jim, then Grandpa, then back to mommy. Right now she's very attached to your boyfriend, and she's too young to understand the difference between romantic and family love, and she thinks that any attention he pays to you means he doesn't love HER as much. I think that, in addition to being punished for treating you badly, your boyfriend needs to have a heart to heart with her. Along the lines of ""You're the best niece and I love you so much and also I love my girlfriend and each one of you has a special room in my heart. Just like you can love your friends and mommy and daddy and me and whoever else, I can love you just as much as ever and also my girlfriend. But you've been having tantrums and hitting my phone and that isn't okay. Are you feeling scared that maybe I won't spend as much time with you?"" And let her talk it out. She's being a little shit, but she needs emotional support to get through the little shit phase."
"He's the mean drunk who nearly killed someone, but *you're* the one that needs to make the first move? That's fucking rich, and proves what kind of person he is. He has no interest in quitting alcohol unless he is guaranteed his reward up front.

So she's supposed to toss her kid out of the house for someone else to raise because her husband doesn't want it? What a horrible choice. 
"I know this will sound counter intuitive and my even go against some of the advice that you may get, but don't rescue her.

Let me explain a bit. There appears to be a theme of abandonment that is prevalent in her life. Her mother abandoned her, the man who is in her birth certificate abandoned her, it appears as if her first boyfriend abandoned her, it is possible as if she sees that you abandoned her and she may see it as if she has had to abandon her children. You coming out of the blue and rescuing her will make her latch on to you and create an extremely codependent relationship with you. You will not be doing her any favors by riding in and solving all her problems, instead, what you will accomplish is to rob her of her ability to be self determined. Do not be strong for her, teach her how to be strong.

One thing is that it sounds like no one has ever really been there for her. Open the doors for her and let her know that she can always come to you whenever she has a problem or something to talk about. Create a relationship of trust and let her know that you are a safe place that she can rely on. Something that I really need to point out is that you should encourage her to speak about positive things that have happened in her life, so that these meetings are not also draining for you. People have a mixture of life experiences. Some people have more negatives that positive life experience and others have more positive than negative life experiences. Encourage some of the positive stories from her life, even if they are few and work on creating positive memories with her.


It is important that you resolve the conflict that you have with your wife. You said that you already had a paternety test, then show that to your wife and show documents that she really is your daughter. Do not put your daughter through another situation where she has to ""prove"" herself. Remember when I said that the theme of abandonment has been very prevalent in her life. Putting her in a situation where it needs to be proven that she is your daughter will just keep her on edge. There are files and documents that you can trace and present them to your wife without your daughters knowledge to your wife to allay her doubts. Also, do not subject your daughter to your wife, knowing that your wife has no intention of accepting her. If your wife has no intention of accepting her, then limit the contact between the two. Trust me when I say that the feeling of abandonment really, really sucks and constantly being subjected to it can really deflate your self esteem. You cannot force your wife to accept your daughter, but you do not have to subject her to the constant rejection that she will have towards her if they need to interact on a constant basis.

It is also possible that your daughter is being manipulative by bringing up all the negative experiences she was subjected to. This is not done out of malice, it is done out of survival. Let me explain a bit. I grew up with a stepmother who was fresh out of the disney films. She was constantly trying to drive a wedge between me and my father, by talking negatively about me and trying to get him to kick us out of the house. She always managed to get to him first and by the time I got to him to tell him my story, his mind was made up. The only way that I could get him to listen to me or not to abandon me by kicking me out of the house was to evoke sympathy from him. I could only do this by emotionally manipulating him to feel sorry for me and have compassion for me. I learned this at a very young age and it always worked. The only reason I had a roof over my head when growing up was because my dad felt sorry for me and so emotional manipulation by getting people to feel sorry for me became one of the ways of communication. It was and still is an unhealthy form of communication, but it was effective. 

It is possible that through all the experiences that your daughter has gone through, being abandoned by her mom, being raised by a foster family, being raised by her grandparents, she has developed some very unhealthy forms of communications. It could be that, in order to survive or in order to feel loved, she has had to, one way or the other, emotionally manipulate her guardians and caretakers and perhaps anyone in a position to help her in order to survive. Perhaps that is why you do not fully trust her and see elements of manipulation in her, but these are really as a result of someone who did not have a healthy and proper ubringing, in a secure and stable environment where she could learn by example how to effectively communicate what she wants or needs from others. I would suggest that you offer to get her to therapy, where she can learn to deal with the cocktail of emotions that someone who has experienced what she had can only go through. 

Other ways that you can support her is through college. The fact that she wants to study shows that she has goals that she wants to achieve and is not just going aimlessly through life. 

Take things slowly by slowly, one step at a time. You do not have to have all the solutions all at once and you do not have to solve all her problems all at once."
"What she did was low.  The two of you badly need to sort out the child-rearing situation though, because you need to have your wife's back when these things come up.  If your mother is inserting herself into these situations, you need to tell her to back off and that you and your wife will be the ones figuring it out."
"Ya, you've been more like a mother than a potential spouse when it comes to him being an adult and having to do normal adult stuff.  I doubt he's a horrible person, but he's not your equal and may never be, especially if he's not getting any help for his anxiety. 

It sucks, but I'm afraid the two of you are too far apart in maturity to make this work for the long haul.

Sorry."

I also think a lot of young women go through high school just growing it out and putting it in ponytails.

Is there a way to meet her in a public place.  Nothing too crowded, but somewhere with people around and where you could make a quick exit if you needed to?  

Keep in mind that it's unlikely your grandmother would have gotten better over the last 11 years.  She may not even be the same person you remember.  What do other people in the family say about her?  Is she still violent?  Is she prone to outbursts?  How lucid is she?  Does she recognize people?  Can she hold a conversation?  

If you aren't, I would recommend that you get some individual counseling to help you deal with your past trauma of being stabbed.  "

"Yeah, it's an odd behavior from your sister, and yes, she'll probably be happier living without them in her life than living a lie to keep them there (it's not like they became wonderful tolerant parents when she was living the lie - she just lied to continue hanging out with these assholes). The parents may even come around again when they have to come to terms with never seeing their daughter again. But that's your sister's fight and all you can do is offer advice and support, and then let her fight it and make her own choices.

As for you, see if you can start with the bakery part-time. I know it seems like a passion right now, and it seems like you have some serious skills to be be offered this job - but you said yourself that you find it hard to settle on any one passion in life, and you may find that the reality of working in this bakery for years full-time leaves you wanting more or something else. If it does, having a completed degree will help you in so many ways - or at least you won't have to suffer from not having one. Most people get that mid-degree ennui and wish to just rush out into the world of work, but they rarely do better than those who stick with it. In fact, a lot of the value of a degree is proving to your future employer that you are capable of sticking with something instead of just jumping from job to job or interest to interest - which is even more of a risk for you than for others, given your lack of passions.

Stay in school, take your free college education, try to part-time at the bakery if possible (if not, keep your skills up and see what else you can find when you graduate - the job might open up again there or somewhere else awesome). It really isn't that long until graduation if you just pull up your socks and grind through it. It's all very doable, you just need to grin and put up with it a little while longer - preparation for the adult world, honestly.

But save that money of yours. I know it sucks to not be able to spend your money as freely as some of your classmates, but you need to be building up a nest egg and a lot of ""fuck you"" money so that you can live independent of your parents should you ever need to cut them off completely, or should shit go down with your sister."

As for how you can make this up to your family... your fiancee physically destroyed much of their reception and irreparably damaged what was supposed to be a celebration of their marriage, so the very least you owe them is financial restitution. They may have spent tens of thousands of dollars on the reception; how much of that do you think is appropriate for you to pay them back, given the damage she did?

Even if she apologizes, even if you try to pay them back for some of the reception she ruined, even if she gets treatment for her drinking problem, you should be prepared for some of your relatives never to warm your fiancee."

"She just got cancer and she's suddenly dying? That's extremely unlikely, especially at her age. Having cancer doesn't necessarily mean she's going to die.

Also, if she was really your friend, she wouldn't ask you to cheat on your girlfriend. Friends don't ask that of each other. She clearly wants something more and is using cancer as an excuse to get it. That's sick and manipulative.

Tell her you will not cheat on your girlfriend. Tell your girlfriend what happened, so the friend doesn't go behind your back and try to break you two up."

CPS or private adoption services will not likely allow you to adopt children with her records. 
"Hey, so don't be surprised if you get interviewed by children's services.  If you live in the United States the hospital will have already reported this incident.  Your sister, her husband, your mom, and probably you will all have a social worker setting up an appointment very soon.  If you're at school, they'll pull you out of class to speak with you alone."

"Also what the heck at people defending this guy's right to drive while high. I've known people who get high a lot and some of them don't act so different, but you can tell others' reaction times are definitely impaired. They talk slower, walk slower, just move slower in general. It's not safe to drive while high. It's just not.

There's a reason that a lot of pharmaceutical drugs advise you not to drive after taking them. There's a reason that drinking and driving is illegal, or any impaired driving, really. You also shouldn't drive after consuming large amounts of caffeine, or while you're emotional or super exhausted. Yeah, people still do it but that doesn't mean you *should*."

"The timelines coincide with the birth of your children. 

Childbirth certainly changes couples' sex lives and often prevents people from getting their needs met. But instead of talking to you about his needs, he went out and got it somewhere else. While you were bearing his kids.

"I mean... is someone who would have a 2 year long affair with a married man someone you want to marry? In some situations cheating *could* be a poor judgement call or mistake, but a 2 year affair is...  beyond the pale. It's an extended deception that ruined a marriage. 

I don't think you can trust her in your relationship unless you have a lot of talks with her about the morality of the situation and she expresses a lot of regret and takes total responsibility for her role. Given that she lied and said it only happened once, she *has not* done that. She hasn't even admitted what she did was wrong. That's a giant red flag. Self awareness is necessary in these situations."
"Did he want you to spill water on yourself? Why? That was before you did what he didn't like. It has nothing to do with trust issues. Why did he want you to do that to begin with?

Is he insane? Is it about control?

Would he have stopped you?

This is an issue unrelated to trust. His trust issues and the crazy way he deals with them is a separate problem."

"""no need I trust that you've got a cute pussy-mole""? What the fuck makes you think that's appropriate for you to say? I'd fucking kill my boyfriend if he was in your position and was saying shit like that to my friend instead of knowing HOW NOT TO ENGAGE. I'm bisexual too, but he doesn't interpret that to mean permission for him to flirt with my friends, and you shouldn't either. Why can't you tell her NOT to send you stuff like that because you're ""married and uncomfortable with where this friendship is going""? Unless you like the attention, which you obviously do. And you're taking advantage of your wife's trust to compliment other women on their ""pussy-moles"" and receive nudes from them. Why are people so fucking shady.  

&gt;no need I trust that you've got a cute pussy-mole 

You were supposed to draw the line and shut this shit down instead of FUELLING her with a response like this. You're pathetically loving this attention. Anyone else committed to their marriage would have killed this situation off and told their wives by now. You know, because they actually respect their spouse

If you love your wife and respect your marriage, ""this is inappropriate and I would appreciate if you stop sending me things like this"" wouldn't be more uncomfortable for you to say than ""I'm sure you've got a cute pussy-mole ;)""

"It doesn't sound like OP was using her dogs to take care of her baby - or that she was letting her baby do anything to the dogs.  From the post, it sounds like OP's mother didn't like that the dogs would seat near the baby when OP was changing diapers (that is, when OP was changing the baby's diapers).  It sounds like OP's mother found the dogs proximity to the baby (or their existence in the same house as the baby) sufficient to report OP to CPS.

The reason why most of us react so badly about CPS is that they could have, very easily, decided to pre-emptively remove the baby from OP while they did a few weeks worth of investigations regarding the suitability and safety of the dogs before allowing OP to have her baby back.  That is also something that CPS could do. 

To say what OP's mother did was harmless and precautionary is not giving enough weight to what she did.  It's like if a grandparent was worried about their grandchild's lack of academic advancement, and report the parents for child abuse to the school.  The school might waive it off - or they might send in social workers, the kids get removed while they figure out what's going on and the parents have to hire lawyers and attend court.

OP's mother escalated an issue that should never have been escalated, and did in a way most guaranteed to cause stress and worry to OP plus running the very real risk of her losing her 4 month old baby until she could prove that her and the dogs were completely safe to have around the baby.

"This reminds me about what happened to me a year ago. I was pregnant and finally fully snapped at my brother and mom. 
He always was the ""favorite"". He got into so much trouble and ended up being invisible.  Basically I never wanted to be home and was so unhappy. I even was homeless for a bit because I didn't want to live with them both. 

He never held a job and went to prison even for 5 years. He is on the sex offenders list for life. But all that was never his fault. It is everyone else. He was in another state but than moved in with my mom. 

He just drank and was unhappy so he made everyone else unhappy. I think he even was ""goofing around"" and tripped my son with tried to cover it up. My son walked funny for a long time and we even took him to the doctors to see why. He is on the spectrum and can't explain/won't explain what really happened. 

I just got out of the ER a few days before I snapped. I almost lost my second child but was recovering. I got sick of him on a trip to go school shopping for my oldest. He came and didn't want us(my mom,me and my son) to go shopping because he wanted to go to some lake.  Heck I even made a post about what happened almost a year ago. 

I snapped because he was acting like a kid and was whining about being in the back seat. He told me to sit in the front because I was prego. I was ok with the back. 

Well anyway he said he would punch me if I was a man.  And also punched the seat I was in over and over. I called my husband to get me and my son. I never talked/saw him after that day and don't plan too. There is a ton of other shit  that I am leaving out. It can fill a novel. 

It hurts my mom but I don't care. My health and my family's health matter more. I am not forced to live with him anymore. He won't stop being a jerk/drinking a ton. 

Yes don't wait for stuff to change. My brother would get ""better"" than go back to how old ways. Your post OP reminds me so much of my brother.

Stay strong.  Worry about yourself and your mom.

I'm really sorry that this happened, but your fiancee lied to you about who she was. She literally lied to you about everything. She is a criminal, an addict, and a manipulator. Nothing about this sounds salvageable, and I encourage you to get out now--and be safe in doing so. She does not sound stable at all. "

If you have no close friends and you are expecting your entire social life to revolve around your relationship, you are expecting too much. Be single for a while (potentially a long while). Make friends and build a life where you are comfortable on your own. Relationships should be the frosting on the cake of your life, not life itself.

"*She is totally convinced in her mind that there is something about being with me that disables her from reaching her goals.*  I think she might be right about that, OP.  Money is control.

And then you accuse *her* of being ego driven.  This is one of those situations where if you love her, you will let her go without trying to tie strings to her by forcing money on her or secretly on her mother.  You've had seven years to ""share the wealth"" but apparently you haven't.  It's taken her planning to leave you for you to suddenly realize that you should have been sharing with her all along.

And now that she is an ""other thing,"" you want her back.  I don't think that's a fair way to treat her at all.  You need to figure yourself out before you drag her back into it."
"&gt; I don't want to leave my husband.

But he is more than content to abandon you if it means he doesn't have to deal with your nagging need to socialize anymore. Marriage is about teamwork, collaboration, and compromise during the rough times. But he's not willing to do that for you. He doesn't value you or the marriage enough to work with you.

You want a partnership and someone to share your life with  but he has drawn the line in the sand that this is not who he is, nor is it what he wants. He may love you, but love is not enough. You need to have compatible values and goals and the desire to help your partner reach their goals as well as your own.

You can try to go to therapy about this, and try to construct some sort of ""new normal"" for yourself and try to reframe what it means to be happy for you, but I think that what you need and are looking for is too deep to be changed. The more time passes the more you'll hurt, and ache, and long for these connections and this level of intimacy and the longer you are denied that the more you'll become resentful and angry and then boom, you may realize that you wasted a decade or more settling for an unfulfilling life that you can never reclaim.

He's already settled. You now need to decide if you want to live the rest of your life what little he offers you, or take the risk to find the connection, family, friends, and love that define true happiness for yourself.

Personally, I'm not that anti-social but I do have some social anxiety, and I sometimes grin and bear social situations and events that I don't want to go to for my wife because I know it makes her happy and it means a lot to her. I recognize that I married her knowing that part of my vow was to be by her side. I can't fathom being married to someone who couldn't be assed to make a gesture of love like that and threaten divorce. To me that's horridly neglectful."

&gt; He already knows that she's not my favorite, and sometimes makes joking comments about how I ""hate her.""


If he's already making remarks about how you ""hate"" the dog then I feel as though there is possibly more than the behavior. And again, that will not help with the possible resentment that may come. 





&gt; I will definitely bring it up soon, starting with the fact that I'm already over the limit allowed by the lease; there are 3 pets allowed per unit, I told them I have 1 dog and 1 cat.



Also, you are currently lying to your landlords and what not about your pet limit already? You need to also let him know about that ASAP, because I would not want to live with someone who could have them evicted in a matter of seconds. You need to fix that, or get a new place asap.




&gt;I agree, but he doesn't really have a lot of expendable income to spend on training for her. And I don't really want to spend my own money to fix her either, especially because I just don't want two dogs in general. 

I'm not trying to be rude, but if I was in his position I would rethink our relationship. I understand your concerns, but it comes off selfish to me. You say it's because of all these issues, but you are essentially saying you just don't want another dog. You guys are a team now, and that means what's his is yours, and vice verse. You should take this as a chance to come together as one and train the dog together. It does wonders, and would be a good trial run for kids.

If you want to make him crazy then suggest that girl babies get your last name and boy babies get his last name.

He had to drink at least 6 times a day every day or he would get so cranky and annoying to be around. Everything was about how great alcohol is and when he would drink next. He drank before his grandmother's funeral and went there drunk, with red eyes and reeking. He actually argued with me and said alcohol does not smell even though his place and his car reek and he often smells of it.

Yep, so he's got a problem.

 
He's prioritising his addiction over you and you were right to dump his ass. 

Not your circus, not your monkeys.

"While everyone over relies on their personal experience to make generalizations, people with a low IQ do this a lot more. 

It sounds like he confuses correlation with causation (the jelly bean), mishears or misunderstands things he overhears (he was at a gas station when he heard that tuna can contain dolphin meat) and he makes sweeping generalizations from one time experience.

"You have nothing to apologize for. As others have stated, she loves getting attention so she didn't want to commit so she could be free to do whatever, whenever but expected you to fully commit. She figured since she apparently oozes sex appeal, you'd feel lucky to have her and obsess over her. 

The fact that you slept with a 32 year old made her jealous. She probably didn't expect you'd be able to land someone younger like that and sees it as a threat. She was knocked off her pedestal and doesn't know how to handle it. If she wants to play games and ignore you, so be it. Don't beg her for forgiveness or apologize to her. If you managed to land her and a 32 year old, I'm sure you can land someone else who isn't immature for their age and conceited to boot."

"They really do sound abusive, OP. My parents, most parents, where OVER THE MOON in anticipation of their first grandchild. My kids (and my brother's kids) are my parents favorite people in the world.

"&gt; she walks out of movies all the time (one of our few times together)

Just a helpful suggestion: find something else to do together. Go out to dinner, or cook at home together, or play card games. Find a podcase you can both enjoy and sip wine or work on a jigsaw puzzle. 

I'm not saying ""you can't ever watch movies together, ever again"", just that *right now*, it seems to be a problem. The purpose and intent behind ""trigger warnings"" is to let people know ahead of time, and decide for themselves, if they want to deal with difficult subject matter. It sounds like you've got a pretty good idea of the kinds of things that trigger her, so either avoid the triggers or make it clear before things get started that those themes are present. "

Personally I think I'd make a move in your position - especially as you're already physically close. Have you tried just kissing his cheek during a hug ? That might be a gentler way in than a full-on pash :) 

It gives him an opening to kiss you back; and if he's not interested, you can still play it off as friendly / affectionate - whereas you can't really do that with a mouth kiss...."

"I've taken showers while being the only one watching my kid. The difference is that I made sure my son was in the room next to my bathroom and I kept the bathroom door open, making sure all other doors were locked. I made sure he was busy and not on a bed or table from which he could fall, nothing sharp to hurt him and I was as lightning.

The sister's mom was clearly nowhere near as careful. The person you replied didn't imply *never* to take a shower while looking after a child - but if the caregiver cant be bothered to be careful, then their shower can wait."
"All you can do is accept that the vibe will be weird &amp; that your roommate will likely choose to keep your deposit. Hopefully, you don't need it for the next place. 

This whole situation is basically what happens when you don't have a formal lease agreement. Your roommate decided for you that you would be moving out in December, which I think is kind of shitty. (If you had a lease, you would have known when your lease was up for renewal &amp; that you might need to move when that time came, but that's kind of different.) Your roommate's insistence that she get a lease with her name on it caused your rent to go up without warning. (Again, when you have a formal lease, you know this may happen at time of renewal &amp; are prepared for it.) So now, because you were on a month-to-month agreement (&amp; not a part of the lease she signed), you're doing something that people on a month-to-month do, which is move out with 30 day notice. She's upset because she's finally on the lease &amp; on the hook for the money. 

Now granted, I don't live in NYC &amp; may not be up on how people handle subletting &amp; stuff there, but I don't think it's your responsibility to find a subletter for a weird number of months. Honestly, I think your roommate should have waited until she lived with her boyfriend to sign the lease, but she probably pushed to get it now because she wanted to keep the apartment &amp; this would force your hand that you were the one that needed to move out. "
I mean this guy is a piece of work. OP was sick and he leaves her with all the child care for the night? Bullshit.
"By my calculation, your BF left his wife with a 9 month old baby and a 2.5 year old.  That is a rough situation for anyone to be in.

Then he starts dating a woman more than ten years younger than her only 6 months after the divorce is finalized.  Then your bf moves in with you after less than a year of dating and exposes the ex-wife's young, vulnerable children to someone she has never even spoken to.  I would be pretty pissed if I were in her shoes too.

I'm not saying her attitude is acceptable but I can understand why she would be angry, both with her ex and with you.  My advice is to rise above and remain mature, calm, and collected in any situation that involves her.  Don't respond to the online abuse, just block her.  Don't engage just kill her with kindness and once some time passes things will normalize.

"Agreed. I have 4 children, the oldest of which has serious ADHD, and we are still invited places. Your daughter's behavior is far more serious than you are alluding to here. 

You sound like you are desperate for a break, and resent that your family isn't willing to provide respite. Have you spoken with a social worker? Is she old enough for public school? For kindergarten? Public schools cannot just refuse admittance, maybe you need a lawyer. She should be eligible for Special Education accommodations.

"Hey OP, I was in a fraternity in college, so might not be best advice, but here it goes:

These organizations are entirely temporary in your life. I did enjoy living at the house as it gave me some structure and social life during my college years. I also butted heads with leadership, on occasion, and was part of the leadership in other occasions. But all of these things were temporary and fluid. Last time I went back to visit was about a year after graduation and at that point I've realized that it's not the same place that it was and it's not interesting to me anymore. 

The reason it's not interesting anymore is because every semester there is turnover, and the people that made it what it was for me were no longer there. I formed some amazing relationships with people while part of Greek life on campus and I still keep in touch with many of them. A few I would even consider some of my best friends. 

What I'm trying to say is that the organization is not important, people are important. So stick by your friends and principles. Place value in people, not value in rising within your particular organization (employers don't really care if you were president of a sorority once you're in the real world). I can tell you that if you sell out your friend in this situation, you will not win with these people. You'll just be known as a sellout. I've seen this happen to people. Stick by your guns, and if current leadership is giving you hell, just know that they'll graduate and new people will eventually take over. Your reputation will be that you cover for your friends, not sell them out. "
Kids also love spending 12 hours a day playing video games and eating cake for every meal. That doesn't mean that it's the only consideration.
"Get a divorce and get full custody of your children. 

Frankly, I'm appalled at *everything* I just read. Your wife is irreparably damaging your children by living with them, and I'm sad that you can't even see that.

"I think you just described him on the surface and inside, with the best words one could possibly choose. I will quote you when I will talk about it with him. Thank you for taking the time to write me. 

It's very true that I am adjusting a lot to his moods and behaviour. Sometimes he has days when he is in a very weird mood, hiding in his own shell and doesn't want to talk to anyone, including me. Then it's like walking on hot coal thinking if I should ask him how he is doing, or if i should leave him alone so that he won't get the impression that I am needy, when in fact I am just thinking of him. I do question myself why do I have to suppress my actions, that is not supposed to happen when two people love each other. Or am I wrong? 

I don't know what's right or not anymore. "

"You make an awful lot of excuses for yourself. 

You choose arbitrary ways to ""help"" instead of doing the things you've been outright *TOLD* will actually help.

It sounds like you're just along for the ride and your wife is tasked with being the driver 24/7. Even the throwaway name you chose ""wifeispissed"" shows you think SHE is more of a problem here. 

If this is *genuinely* the way you've always been, I strongly recommend getting tested to see if you are on the spectrum. Asperger's or the like might explain the maddening disconnect between you and the reality of your situation. At the very least, couples counseling should be your next stop. Wife needs to learn not to bottle things up until she explodes and you need to work on ... well... many things. The situation you detailed above is maddeningly frustrating to even READ. I would rather raise children alone than with someone I couldn't depend on for even the *simplest* things. Conversely, I would rather *be* alone than with someone who felt like hitting me was an okay thing to do. The environment you two have created is not good for children. You need to figure it out and start working to make it better, ASAP. "
"&gt; I told her that I was done working at a place that didn't respect me.

Good. Good for you.

&gt; I feel guilty because my friends (who I go to school with) will have to work harder. One of my friends messaged me calling me selfish for not coming in Although I quit a month ago.

This is manipulative. You are being *guilt-tripped* and, unfortunately, it's working. Your friends need a wake-up call: they don't get to determine where you work, or if you work at all. It's not their decision.

&gt; I don't know how to deal with this without burning bridges and ruining friendships and I also feel guilt for putting a heavier load on my friends.

Alright, here's what you do. The next time this job calls, you tell them to stop contacting you and hang up the phone. If they continue to call you after that, block their number. If they're stupid enough to leave voicemails or emails after you've told them to leave you alone, save them because you may have a case for harassment. 

As for your friends, you need to kindly but firmly explain to them that guilt-tripping you into working a job that they hate because their manager can't do his job properly is unacceptable, and you won't tolerate it. You're not going to work a job where you feel like you aren't being respected simply because your friends are stuck there. If they don't like it, they should find another job. There's one person who gets to determine where you work, and that's you. Don't be afraid to server relationships with manipulative assholes. If they can't respect your demands, then not only are they guilty of guilt-tripping, but *also* disrespecting your boundaries, in which case you should find new friends."
"A lot of the ""birthdays aren't everything"" comments are really missing the point. 

1. Your birthday, and how important it is to you is up to you. Not anyone else. If you really enjoy celebrating yourself, DO IT. Don't let rude internet strangers make you feel bad for wanting a party. 

2. Your friend is super rude. How would she have reacted if this were her birthday party? Has she done things like this before? 

3. Absolutely go to your party, and do the best you can to have an amazing time. Have a few drinks, laugh it up, dance your ass off, or sing your heart out. Whatever you wanted to do, do it. Is it too late to get another MUA? 

It's a bummer that this happened, OP, but really, the only thing you can do is to go and have a good time despite it. I know I always regret it when I stay home and ""pout"" or whatever, instead of doing the fun things I wanted to.

"For now, it's best to just deal with the fact that you aren't cleared to play. Your mom, being the neurosurgeon, is much more qualified to make this particular call over your father. Neurosurgeons would know the risk of whether playing could cause you a more serious injury down the road. 

If you still want to play, ask your mom to sit down with you and explain what she is seeing on the scans, and why that is a concern. It's possible that you may be able to make a case to go back to playing sooner. However, please keep in mind that in the case of head injuries, it is much better to play it safe. "

"Yeah the fact that she didn't give a fuck that this really creepy thing was happening, made me confused. I still thought it probably wasn't her (what would the point even be?? tweeting her undying love into a black hole of nothingness?) but her reaction was still very odd"
"&gt;  Sometimes that is the sole reason two people come together.

You know, this also crossed my mind few times already. What if our purpose is not to be together but it's for me to become the person I am now. He got something good out of it too, people started to talk how much kinder he got since we started dating, he used to be a lot grumpier and cold. Now people included words like ""nice"" when talking about him. So maybe that is it. A lesson which could have had a much better ending. "
"OP, clearly, your SO suffers from narcissism which is impacting his day to day life. If it continues down this path, it will only get worse, his sense of entitlement will only grow, and his well-hidden, deep-seated self-hatred will escalate. Therapy is highly recommended. "
"You realize this is his wedding, too, right? "
"Did the ""not sleeping with partners until things were steady"" rule apply to you? Was she sleeping with him and not you, I assume? That's pretty bad and very telling."
"You were right, and you should stop telling your parents things if they're going to badmouth your parenting to anyone who will listen. Who does that??"
"I'll try to summarize:

- Your boyfriend is going to a baseball game. This appears to be a positive event that could help him in his career (getting along with coworkers). An excellent teambuilding event.

- He asks if you would be willing to pick him up and you agree.

- in the 7th inning, he confirms that he would like you to pick him up in an hour. You then argue about the time (30 mins instead of 1 hour). 

- To avoid further confrontation and argument, your boyfriend suggests just taking an uber. However **you refuse to allow him to take an uber** and insist he comes with you.

- Feeling what I assume is frustration, your boyfriend tells you he's going to the pub with his coworkers. he then extends a 3rd olive branch and invites you to come. I assume it's because his work event is going well and he wants to introduce you to people or have you spend 20 mins talking with them before heading home. 

- you angrily and reluctantly come (because of course, you won't allow him to take an uber) and insist that he comes out to help you find parking.

- upon seeing your increasing anger, he offers to just go home instead to appease you.

Now, here are my thoughts. You should have let him go in the uber. You're being very controlling insisting on driving him and not letting him do that. Further the timing. He ask for 1 hour and you give him 30 minutes. Again, another controlling behavior. Further, when invited to the bar, you force him to come out and guide you to a parking spot, another controlling behavior. Further, after finally trying to compromise again, you display hugely negative emotions to manipulate him to just go home.

I really feel you're the problem here and that your boyfriend is the reasonable one,

"&gt; I love my SO so much and genuinely can see myself with him for the rest of my life but I don’t want anything to do with her.

Pick one. She is his sister. Unless he is willing to cut her out of his lifeentirely, she's going to be at your wedding. She's going to visit and see your children together (if you have them). She's going to be around at family gatherings. She is going to drop by some days to your house for unscheduled visits.



&gt; TL/DR Is it wrong of me to break it off with my boyfriend purely because his sister is ruining our relationship?

No. If he is unwilling to work on this problem then you are entirely justified.
When people think of ""deal breaker"" in a relationship it often comes down to cheating, or discovering they're a serial killer.

Sadly it's entirely possible for a deal breaker to be far less dramatic and often simply not the fault of partner that's losing out."
"&gt;  but the hypocrisy of men demanding this from women as if it's their due for overspending on a shiny depreciating asset has rubbed me right into a deep trench on this matter. 

I had an ex who, when we were deciding if we would get married (we came pretty close, too) told me that he didn't mind if I kept my last name, but hyphenating our kids or letting them have my last name was ""selfish.""

THEN I LAUGHED FOR ONE MILLION YEARS.

"&gt;I think in this particular case, it's a toxic combination of ""change is hard"" and silent sexism. The two employees with the biggest witness accounts to Tom's behavior are women, and I don't care what any of those men say, that has to be a factor in this somehow.

This is exactly what I thought as I was reading. Young woman gets persistently abused by senior male colleague. Second woman becomes the brunt of the abuse, and this makes the first woman even angrier? There's no way this isn't due partly to sexism. I'd be surprised if either Kit or Mel were unaware of that. Tom isn't just an asshole; he's a liability. This is a lawsuit waiting to happen. "
"In the future:

""Wow.""
""Yikes.""
""What a question.""
""Well that was rude.""

Or just sit there silently, staring at him, until it becomes super awkward."
"I'd tell 'em to fuck off, in those words. Then to knock it off, in nicer words after.

This *is* your real child. They're insulting your kid! They need to know that if they keep disrespecting you and your family, it's going to damage or even ruin their relationship with you, and they have to decide: Is it really worth ruining my relationship with my daughter just to be snarky and mean for a bit?

Traditional values ruin everything."
But it is his kid too though. It has been five years. Shouldn't he have adjusted by now? OR that a thing that just keeps going? 
"I've been blindly taking her word that that was where the money was going, because I never had any reason not to. But your comment made me examine my last bank statement and there were a lot of withdrawals of $5 here, or $10 there :/"
"&gt; Rachel then sent me a list of things that we were going to have to do to make sure that she and Julie are accommodated in our house. I very honestly have never seen anything like it because it includes reinforced toilets, a temporary wheelchair ramp to go up our stairs, The doorways inside have to be a certain width, our kitchen table has to be a certain height to accommodate Julie's scooter and the bedframe has to be reinforced amongst other things. The list is about 20 items long.

Unbelievably entitled.  I would just say ""I'm sorry, we won't be able to accommodate those requests - i wish you luck in finding more suitable accommodations."""
"My grandma is pretty much okay about it. She herself told my mother I had to go to work and that she'd be fine. 

My mother on the other hand is pretty pissed with me."
"These kind of accusations could ruin your husbands life and she seems to be spreading them maliciously. I'm not sure what country you're in but please, please consult a lawyer. It might seem like a wild overreaction at the moment but at the point when it starts affecting your husbands career, you'll wish you'd sent her an early cease and desist letter.

If you don't want to spend money on a lawyer, tell her you will take legal action if she doesn't stop defaming your husband."
"&gt;Ultimately the land is mine and I don't understand why they can't at least be civil, despite the disappointment. 

Look, you're choosing money over your family. You are allowed to choose money over your family if that's what matters to you. You are not allowed to choose money over your family and then complain that your family is upset with you. You get the money, or you get your family. You don't get both."
Culturally it's the norm for unmarried Pakistanis to stay at home. Doesn't matter how much they make.
"&gt; TL;DR: I will break up with her and it will totally crush her and possibly derail her life.

Don't worry dude, she'll bounce back. Power through the anxiety; good luck to you!"
"You sound like my boyfriend. Even though yes, this is reality, it's never really nice to hear someone you love tell you that there's other people out there that you both will be compatible with. In my option, it's an indirect way of saying when things get to hard, we can just go our seperate ways and we can find someone else. "
"Uh. He already has another child with another woman. You've mentioned he's ""there"" for his child, but is he still with his ex? Does he support her unstintingly? Give child support without bitching and do an equal share of child care without complaint?"
"Wha...what's that? You wanna sack race me?

*unfurls glorious silk cocoon on the bus*"
"The issue here isn't so much the sex. The sex is a symptom. It is about affection, and seeing how each other shows affection.

Each of you have a way to show affection and a way you prefer receiving it. And it's okay that it differs. But what isn't okay is that neither of you will compromise. Or haven't communicated this correctly. 

Her wanting to have sex daily isn't wanting to use you as a dildo. If it was about getting off, plenty of toys could give her a better orgasm. It's about that physical and emotional connection with you. You need to see that she doesn't want to just fuck you to get off. It is her way of showing that she loves you and, in her mind, you showing you love her.

Meanwhile, you like the more traditional romantic gestures. The date nights, the gifts, walks in the park, letters, etc. In your eyes, that is a good way to show affection. That is how you show how much you care.

And it's about communication. It's about paying attention where each person gets and receives that joy and sense of love. You need to talk to her and explain to her that just because you don't want sex literally every day, doesn't mean you don't love her. That all these gestures are you showing your affection.

And you need to understand that sex is the same for her. A night in bed has the same effect in her mind as a candle-lit dinner would have in yours. And you need to understand that.

In my last relationship, we were very mismatched. I am a one a day or every other day kind of guy. My ex was once a month if that. But it wasn't a point of (much) conflict because she had her ways of showing affection and I had mine. It's when that fell apart that our relationship did. 

It's the communication that's the most important. This relationship is doomed if you don't communicate. If she refuses to accept that you might not want as much sex, then it's done. But also, if you keep that mentality where you're just a human dildo, things wont work either. "
"For me, I'd be turned off by it completely. Insulted really. I would move past this by breaking up with him. For me that's just crossing line."
Google 'mental load' and 'you should have asked'--read the comics and tell us if that clarifies anything.
This!!! Check to see if they were receiving any money to care for you!
"My brothers wife and Her sister have been addicts for years. 

They got his step-children hooked on it too. 

It destroyed their marriages and anything else they touched. They almost destroyed me, my brother and my son. Now all 4 of them are in prison. 

Think long and hard before you step into that mine-field."
"I'm sure it's nice to be 19 and have absolute moral certainty, but adults don't treat each other that way for no reason.

Your dad is going to be racist towards your children.
DO NOT FLUSH ANY MEDICATION EVER. Mix them with some old coffee grounds and throw them away.
"Concert was planned first and work event is not mandatory, so you go to the concert. If he feels it's important for you to spend time with his work friends, he should plan a get-together on another date.

Or is going to the concert alone an option (and he can go to the work event)?"
Apparently the bus stop is visible from their house.
Ouch.... Ouch ouch but how right you are. Who knows what else he is not telling me about her. He always says he doesn't want her back because they can't function together as a couple but... it makes me wonder if she is the reason why he just can't offer me more because in his head he didn't really move away from her. It never crossed my mind until now. 
"&gt;They are strict Christian conservatives who you can't drink in front of

Well there's a fun cruise.  /s

Just tell them you can't afford it and can't get time off work.  Send a nice gift to you sister with a heart-felt note in a card.  The next time you see her, take her and her spouse out for a nice dinner to celebrate.  

One option: Could you fly to the destination and just attend the wedding rather than taking the cruise?

"You are his enabler.

Instead of forcing him to take responsibility for himself and his life, you have made it so that he can continue his self destructive habits.

YES, you can leave him, and you should. In the long run, you will be happier and healthier, and your kids will be better off too."
I clicked on this because of bizzare title. 
"&gt; She never remembers any of this once she's sober the next day.

&gt; she's not going to remember anything that happened. 

You keep saying she's not going to remember. Does that mean her fuck-up is *your* responsibility to deal with? How is she going to feel about her behaviour once she's sobered up? 

Not remembering what she's done doesn't mean she is any less responsible for her behaviour. If she were to hop into a car and cause a serious accident, she wouldn't be able to say, ""Oh officer, I was so wasted, I don't remember doing it at all.""

I don't think you'll be able to look your family in the eye if you were to get married in late September. Your brother and his new wife will be seething as they see your new wife enjoy a gorgeous drama-free wedding whilst their own was completely destroyed just a few weeks earlier. Your parents will not be enthusiastic to welcome her as their daughter-in-law with memories of their son's destroyed wedding still fresh in their minds. All the guests will be joking about when she's going to start pole-dancing. 

Postpone your wedding indefinitely. Cancel all the bookings and recover any deposits you can. Return any money your parents or future in-laws might have contributed to your wedding. From now on, your fiancee's focus needs to be on 100% sobriety and making amends with your family (if they'll let her). She needs to offer a sincere (and SOBER) apology to your brother+wife, your parents, and your SIL's parents. Then she needs to prove, over and over and over again, that she can be trusted around alcohol, and that she will *not* touch a drop of it. Some people need to maintain 100% sobriety for life, and never take a sip of alcohol. Your fiance is one of them. 

I would suggest postponing the wedding for at least a year. There is no way a single member of your family is going to be enthusiastic to welcome her into the clan in any less time than that. And to be honest, your brother and SIL might *never* forgive her. 

You know what, the more I think about it, the more I think your family might never accept your fiance again. I don't know what kind of relationship she had with them before this incident, but this is a pretty serious fuck-up, and not one that can be easily forgotten. Your fiance didn't just get drunk, she got completely out-of-control wasted, acted obnoxiously, humiliated multiple people (herself, you, your newly-married brother, his new wife, his wife's grandfather), and literally brought the tent down. Your family may never respect her again. 

You yourself sound nervous about her alcohol habit - you're embarrassed by her behaviour, but you're too scared to tell her no. You feel obligated to babysit her because you don't want to be seen as a ""controlling boyfriend"". A woman of 25 shouldn't *need* babysitting. Her obnoxious behaviour shouldn't be for you to apologise for. Her alcohol intake shouldn't be up to you to monitor and control. Do you really feel comfortable committing your life to someone who has an out-of-control alcohol problem? People *divorce* over behaviour like this, why do you want to marry into it?

The only way you should agree to continue a relationship with her is if she *immediately* and *wholly* takes responsibility for her behaviour, agrees unconditionally to give up alcohol for life, and goes to every effort to maintain her sobriety, apologise to your family, and work hard every day to make amends with them. It will be a thankless task as they will be reluctant to offer her any forgiveness for a *long* time, but that's the price she has to pay. 

I hope this girl is worth it for you. Because even if she maintains 100% sobriety for the rest of her life, your family and friends may never respect or welcome her again. "
"&gt; Please do not throw your wife under the bus or make her deal with your parents in any way. 

So much this. 

They're just trying to be important and get your attention away from your baby. They sound very self-centered. Me now me now me now. "
Thinking about a newborn baby surrounded by all the germs and conditioned air in a plane makes me shudder. Plus the noise and all the people and luggage... just no.
"You were close, you say. 

But were you ""close"" when you didn't do what she wanted you to do?
If the ""closeness"" was tied to good behaviour, you were controlled, not close. 

Took me ages to realise that for my own family...

edit: ooh, Gold! Thanks!"
So you take care of 3 of your kids and ignore the 4th? That's a messed up family dynamic.
He doesn't seem to fully understand pet care. He refused to come to puppy school with me for the longest time until the puppy wouldn't listen to him (he wouldn't use the same verbal command and would get pissed).
