"Definitely not when they’re still in the throes of denial like he is. He absolutely has a chance to be a good one but not without serious, major effort and acknowledgement of the problem. "
"That's a really good point - especially re: their (likely) ages. I'd expect any school-aged kid to be okay doing their own thing while mum or dad cooks dinner. So it's pretty likely that theres some room for OP to relax her expectations around how much of their parents' time her kids need.


TBH, my kids are younger than OP's, so I could be way off base here, but at least with regard to their extra-curricular activities and staying active etc, IME it can be far more emotionally draining to care for bored and restless kids than it is physically draining to drive them to/from after-school classes. Plus, putting kids to bed is SO much easier when you've stuck to your normal routine, and I imagine the kids going to bed is the only time OP gets to relax lately."
"She doesn’t want you there. 
She wants to be with her ex and friends. 
Save that money for a new girlfriend that actually respects and appreciates you. 

He’s got the problem with you and yet YOU will cause a bad environment? Research triangulation and blameshifting. 
Stop wasting your time and energy on someone so selfish and disrespectful. "
"When you are in a plane that is nosediving toward the ground, you either grab the stick and pull up, or you bail. I bailed... 

At that moment, a lie seemed like the only rational thing to do.

And yes, he is a piece of shit."
"I’m in the exact same boat right now. I had a total hysterectomy in an emergency immediately after giving birth and have been on replacement hormones ever since (4+ years).

I recently asked my doctor to change up the hormones in an attempt to curb my libido because my partners has tanked. It’s too soon to tell, but I’m hoping that me being less aroused will lead to less disappointment and rejection. 

I’m conflicted because it feels like chemical castration, but I don’t know what else to do."
I had loads of friends and multiple successful birthday parties as a kid and my mother barely learned any other parents names. OP your son is 6. His parties will get easier once the kids get to an age where their parents are cool to drop them off and leave. Or throw a Chuck E Cheese party where they can show up and let the kid run loose. 
"It just makes me wonder what else she is making OP do, he probably doesn’t even realize how controlling she is because they’ve been together so long he’s normalized it "
"Still gross. Parents still have some control over their kid. Not much to be fair, but some. "
"When you're a mom with little kids, they are climbing on you, grabbing at you, demanding to be picked up, and needing cuddles all the time. She needs a bit of space - actual physical space - and that is coming at the expense of your sex life right now."
If you do a PhD you work on average way more hours than 40 a week!
"&gt;  would they consider firing me for taking a day off once every half year.

They shouldn't but if you take the day off you call in sick.  Don't ask for ""compassionate leave"" just because you had a fight with your father.  That kind of leave is for a death, not a fight.  You do yourself no favors by being honest about why you don't want to work."
"Grieving is a normal reaction. The person you loved is dead. Have you considered therapy? It can be really helpful to work through something like this.

I'm so sorry - internet hugs from another jaded 31-yo lady."
"This will only teach your guys' daughter that rules are for control, not for the best interest of everyone or for safety. 

My dad was smart enough to never do this, but he would have lost me over it for a long time.

In 2 years in most places she can vote, drink and smoke weed. He needs to be reminded that isn't that far away for her being considered an adult. Is a kiss okay then? Jesus Christ, I had sex at 15. Most people are already having sex and she can't even kiss a boy for a play. 

Let him read this so he knows he is WAY out of line. If he loves her and wants to support her hard work, he needs to let her grow up."
"Ok - this is why it is NEVER a good idea to be a SAHM to someone you are not married to.  
  
OP this man does not care about you or your baby.  
  
Let me repeat that just in case you missed it: THIS MAN DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR BABY.  
  
Get your job back, look for housing for yourself and your child, file for child support asap as well as custody, and leave him.  
  
But really - you didn’t think to ask him about paying his family’s rent when you got pregnant and before you left your job? Did you just assume he would stop?! I mean obviously it’s ridiculous that he does that but you knew this about him - so at the end of the day the one who is wrong here is you.  
  
Anyway - this is a lost cause. You’re a single mom now. Best of luck!"

"&gt; But it just bugs me because I think it's weird that siblings have nicknames for each other 

It's really not. "
Fuck that.  It's nobody's responsibility to be nice to sexist assholes.

"In what ways are you trying to be supportive? Because it sounds like you're utterly unaware of the magnitude of the physical and emotional event she underwent and are just thinking about your sex life when the girl *you got pregnant* is having emotional trouble because she got an abortion **she didn't want** *for you*. No, she's not cheating. "
"It's just a stress reaction.  If money has been tight, then he's stressed about it and it's bugging the hell out of him."
"Have him get his iron and thyroid checked to be sure.
When my iron is low, that is all I want. I had favorite ice places and textures and my husband bought me an ice shaving machine because that’s the only way I would hydrate. Now that my iron is normal, it doesn’t hold any appeal to me."
"The sibling is not her responsibility because OP did not choose to have a baby.   
OP's mom made that choice. OP's mom is in her 40s, and chose to have a baby that she is incapable of supporting.

Any ""lurch"" OP's mom will be in is a lurch of her own making. Time for Mom to stop depending on her teenage daughter -- it's entirely unfair and inappropriate.   


OP: Live your life. This is none of your concern. Mom has to grow up and take care of her responsibilities and decisions. Minor children do not owe their parents for taking care of them."
"So he thinks wearing matching watches with your twin brother signals that you're an incestuous cheater? This is some next level insecurity. This is the kind of immature that meets twins and immediately starts imagining a kinky porno scene. I would not agree to his request, wear the watch as you see fit. Also watch out for a pattern of ""all about me"" behaviour if his antics haven't already turned you off completely."
"ugh. i want to know how they can just decide this stuff, but i know that won’t get me anywhere."
He is a father... he gave up the rights to layins when you both decided to have children... he's being selfish and your in the right.
"It sounds like he’s a little too hung up on the idea that matching watches are only for couples. If he *really believes* that matching watches are a specific couple thing, then in the context of that belief I can (kinda almost) see his point. Aside from the part where it seems like he just wants a free watch.

But... they’re not. Sure, maybe a lot of people who wear matching watches are couples, but that doesn’t mean it’s some kind of rule that only couples can match. It’s also totally normal and common for siblings (especially twins!) to have fun with matching stuff. He seems to be somehow not aware of this.

He seems to think that matching watches are somehow inherently romantic. "

"I don’t have the same condition as you, but I have a few medical disabilities that amount to similar restrictions. It also usually affects people who are a lot older, but I got sick at 22. I think dating with a disability is harder via online dating because it can sometimes be more of a numbers game, but if you keep at it and maybe try the other things people are suggesting I’m sure you’ll find somebody special. It just takes times, and don’t be afraid to message people first either! :-)

I’m 24, and I’ll be honest with you, people who don’t have a disability at any age don’t understand what it’s like to live with a disability. I can definitely agree that making friends with older people is sometimes easier, but that doesn’t apply to dating in quite the same way. 

You’re not being picky, this guy is massively creepy and the way he’s acting is completely inappropriate. If you ever feel uncomfortable with somebody and ask yourself if you’re overreacting, you’re probably not. And don’t feel afraid to tell somebody that they way they’re talking to you isn’t okay, or better yet just ghost when it’s somebody as gross as this. "
"This is some scumbag level shit he did, and frankly I'd be more concerned with you starting your healing process as opposed to trying to revive a failed marriage.

Take care of yourself, you deserve so much better."
"Tell her relationships need trust, and surveillance, trickery, &amp; ""proof"" aren't substitutes for that trust. If she needs to do those things, it means she doesn't trust her husband. And if she doesn't trust her husband, she should just divorce him, not waste time with her whackadoodle plan. Or she could see a therapist."
She should keep it and use it and you should be allowed porn. These insecurities are not necessary in a healthy marriage. Relax and enjoy the pleasures you have together and alone.  
"You say your sister in law is horrible yet she is kind enough to let you live there rent free. You sound very ungrateful. From what you’ve written they have only asked you reasonable things of you. And to just not show up for a family meeting that she’s requested is pretty rude. 
Move out and enjoy paying rent and bills "
"Grooming isn't strictly used by pedophiles. It's often used in that context, but it can refer to any case where an unbalanced power dynamic is being used to push a vulnerable person's boundaries and normalize doing so."
"Crushes happen in long term relationships - that does not mean your relationship is doomed! It's a good sign that you're not romanticizing what you could have with your coworker. I'm not discounting that you are young and could grow apart eventually, but that's not what it sounds like at this time. The grass is green where you water it and all that jazz, so just focus on your relationship and try not to dwell on thoughts of your coworker."
"If you're at the point where you're ready to end the relationship over this, then you need to tell her that explicitly.  Make it clear to her that you're upset that she's 1) purchased the animals without having a clear discussion with you, 2) neglected the animals and their training.  I'm not sure how the situation can be fixed--maybe getting the animals proper training and her and the kids providing better care will be enough, but if not then it might be too late anyway (because of point 1--the fact that she did this behind your back).

I'd give her one chance to show how serious you are--especially since kids are involved, it's worth trying to work out.  But yeah, I'm with you and I couldn't live like that, so if nothing changes then I'd absolutely leave."
They closed the kitchen early and cost your boss potential income because they were stressed or didn't want to work more. Please don't feel bad and I would fire them too if they did shit like that. 
"I think we've all read this post about sixteen times trying to figure out where he got the ""wife agreeing to a threesome"" thing.

Seventeen now."
"There will always be a reason for her to avoid dealing with it.  Once her mother is gone, it will people at her church who knew her when she was small and are all she has left.  Or it will be someone at work and she ~~needs~~ to get along because ...  There will always be a reason for her to live in her cocoon of white privilege and avoid taking a stand on your behalf.  

Just so you know, your present is your future."
"You need to know that this isn't a reflection on you as a woman, or him as a man, it's just a thing that happening.

I also think you need to make each other more comfortable in each others presence, so if it happens, don't leave embarrassed, try to stay and continue the intimacy.  It doesn't matter if he still can't get hard, you can have intimate moments: cuddling, touching, he can go down on you etc..  Penetrative sex isn't the only sex.  Hopefully in time this will make things more likely to 'work'.  If it continues, and he also has issues when he masturbates, then he might need to see a Doctor.

One question, is he on any medication?  Some anti-depressants for instance can cause impotence, or performance issues at least."
"Are they still at your house? 

Your husband realizes they can never be invited into your home again, yes?"
"Honestly with these types of ppl. Just cut contact. Period. It’s not like you can actually reason with them. 
Go no contact no explanation needed. They know what they did. "
"&gt; It's an economic downgrade for her however. 

She’s 24, why were her parents supporting her so much that she now has a marked lifestyle change? My parents are wealthy, but the second I graduated college I was fully on my own financially."
"&gt; Honestly your wife sounds greedy and I'd be surprised if this doesn't turn the relationship with your parents abit sour

It absolutely will. The thing is her parents will *know* that his wife is the one that said, ""No they can't stay here."" They sound like nice, polite people so I doubt they'd make a fuss but in private they are absolutely going to be hurt by this and it *will* negatively effect their relationship with his wife. "
If that’s her concern she’d be best helped by plainly stating it.  Because right now she seems like a brat.  If this is what she’s really afraid of it makes more sense why she’s being so rude about the request.
You're supporting a 49 year old artist and you let him use you for your money. Either he starts contributing financially or you cut him off or leave him.
"Right but you are still enjoying the perks. It's not necessarily gifts, in fact most of the guys I know my age that date girls your age don't have money to buy lavish gifts (they are not particularly successful). They do have enough money for an apartment to spend alone time in though, a car to get you there and enough money to do the things you want to do within reason. "
nah fuck those people i first had sex at 22 and my girlfriend at the time was about it because she just taught me what she liked and it was awesome for us
"Well of course there were times of frustration, especially when we were doing everything but penetration. I’d always be left wanting more. But I really loved her. I still do, but I did then , too. And I wanted to respect her. For me it wasn’t really about the sex, it was about the time with her. She was helping me become a better person and I was more focused on improving myself than with having sex. I knew that eventually we would, but I also knew it was going to take time for her to trust me like that.  I was learning patience, something I had always been lacking. "
"Unless there’s substance abuse, neglect or physical/sexual abuse, or some other egregious stuff going on (mom’s mental and flying off her rocker and you get the cops in for domestics every week) there’s almost no chance of dad gaining sole custody. My ex was an apathetic hands-off dad, and I still had to share with him (60/40), and my lawyers said that unless you had something seriously bad like substance abuse etc, it wasn’t happening.

Also our lawyers told us that a full blown custody battle could cost like $100k, so unless you have cash to burn or big obvious reasons in your favor, you probably get to deal with split custody."
"Yes you are being inconsiderate. Her child comes first whether you like it or not. She is still little and this has a huge affect on parent-child relationship.

I don’t know how joint custody usually works in the US, here it is usually one week/one week with each parent. This just doesn’t work if parents live in different cities. Especially when the child grows up and goes to school.

Sounds to me like you have to accept the fact that you are now part of a family and that family’s needs keep you in that city for now."
"You're 20, unemployed and think it's strange your dad is asking you to get out of the house? 

I know it sucks, dude. But you're going to have to not leech off him. Get a job, put your money in savings, try to move out. If school isn't for you, try doing an apprenticeship in a trade. 

I'm sorry man, but your dad is right. You're at the age where it's time to start working towards something with your life. It's gonna fucking suck, but you have to figure something out instead of just sitting on your couch all day. 

Are you depressed at all?"
"He is not going anywhere unfortunately, you can’t move away and hope he disappears. It’s not going to happen. Dating someone with a child is a whole different ball game and the ex’s can be a piece of work but you do your best to work with it . You don’t remove the mom and try and move the child to create distance. That’s only hurting the kid and the mother. That dad will be involved forever (or at least until 18) so don’t go into this thinking you can remove her from him. Are you ready to move in with a child and be a parental figure? Have you discussed any of that with her? What role is going to be played? "
"Someone not liking a specific kink doesn’t make them repressed and toxic inherently. Some kinks just aren’t for everyone, and ABDL is a particularly polarizing one. I do think he needs to find a partner that will accept it openly. "
Jug is dating the actress who plays Betty irl anyway
"Hey just so you know, your friend is a predator. He preys on all of the female friends his extended friend group brings around, and he tries to touch and kiss them when he knows they don't want him to. That's a predator and it's fucked up to bring women around him knowing that about him. He is not clueless, he wants to push ahead. That's why he says ""No,"" when your partner tell him girls aren't interested. He doesn't care and doesn't want to hear it. As a woman whose been in the situation you're repeatedly putting your friends in, it's fucked up and going to cause *you* to start losing friends if you don't distance yourself from this creep. "
"I'm glad you realise it. Very few people who come to this sub do.

These are all red flags on their own, and all together, it sounds like a miserable relationship."
He sounds like my ex towards my current boyfriend. The difference is that I would choose my bf over my ex 10000% of the time in every situation. Why is she not doing the same with you?
"And isn’t the whole point of “spending less time commuting” so that you can spend more time doing things you love, like spending more time with your loved ones? "

"&gt; People hang out with guys and it’s not cheating.

Assuming you're not a troll, even though it's likely. Sure, guys can hang out without it being cheating. But they have to say no homo after finishing in each other's mouths. "
"&gt; Why would it be okay for them live for free at my parents, fear no consequences, meanwhile I have to pay them? 

It's not fair and it's not healthy and your parents suck, but if you stop paying rent then you need to be prepared to find another place to live.  Your parents suck for treating you and your siblings so differently; no one is going to tell you otherwise.  However you can't just do what you want simply because the situation is unfair.  You have no control here; it's their house and they make the rules."
"Random thoughts...

The older daughter will all too soon pick up on his attitude towards her which can lead her to a lifetime of doing anything to obtain approval from males.  Ever hear of daddy issues?  Yeah, this is the type of stuff that is where this very real need of young girls gets started.

The bias will become evident and that will cause strive between your children.  They will weaponize this difference and they will make each other and you absolutely miserable.  It may last their entire lifetime.  The DH will take the bio daughter's side obviously.  You will be forced to fend for your bio daughter but it will be tepid support as you are trying to ride the middle ground.  Essentially you will be building a great big fat wall right in the middle of your home.  Such a lovely way for young girls to grow up, don't you think.  

If he isn't man enough to handle being a father and all that entails, you are better off alone with a grandpa or other real man to provide a masculine influence in your children's lives.  "

"Do you not see that you are on here doing the exact thing she is nervous about? At no point do you wonder about the fact that your behavior might be causing this. At no point do you think about asking her what you can do different. You just talk about what she is doing wrong and how that will impact her life negatively and how she should feel.

&gt; There's been a few times where we've been joking around, and suddenly she'll emotionally shut down because I've crossed some invisible line. 

This is called hurting someones feelings. And instead of wondering how you can avoid that or express regret here is your response:

"I don’t know girl, I would just not talk to her anymore. Don’t unfriend her or anything because that might cause drama I’m sure. That’s not a real friend. If she’s upset she’s not engaged she needs to take that up with her boyfriend. She’s taking it out on you because she’s jealous and that’s insanely immature and rude. She should be over the moon happy for you. If I were her and I was that upset and jealous, I would straight up tell you. I’d be like girl I am so happy for you and I am so jealous. My boyfriend is dragging his feet etc etc... You seem like a nice person and a good friend, don’t waste your time on someone who isn’t supportive. I don’t understand girls that ask and beg their boyfriends to propose. First of all it comes off desperate and why would you want to marry someone that doesn’t want to marry you?? Congrats on your engagement and good luck to you!"
"Yes, this. They aren't comparing her to the general public, which includes mostly adults with fully-developed brains, they're comparing her to her own cohort. 

It's a concerning finding, but she's only seven, OP. There's a lot of interventions available to increase a child's empathy but you really need to push for treatment. It's not a terrifying flag but a sign that you need to stop focusing your energy on your relationship and focus on your child's significant needs.
"
"I seriously don’t get why you’d want to marry him when he barely helps with housework or childcare despite you working more than full time. If you’re looking for “valid reasons to leave him” this is a totally valid reason! Why have a partner who doesn’t contribute?

The only reasons you give for staying with him are because he lets you use his car and his mom babysits. Do you think those are valid reasons to marry someone?"
"What in the fuck?? I can see you’ve blocked her now but Christ this is really crazy to me. I’ve blocked people for posting too many stupid quizzes etc, this girl was harassing you.

You should work on putting your own needs forward a bit (a lot) more and / or being able to tell people that they are making you uncomfortable. It’s not mean to ask a stranger to stop calling. Lord"
"It's basically a promise to propose at some point in the future. As the OP noted by saying she didn't think of it because she wasn't in 8th grade, it's usually something that younger people do when they feel too young to get engaged but want to have some kind of token showing that their relationship is serious. Someone gave me one when I was 19 and even then I felt like it was a weird thing to do."
"\&gt;Plus I don't even know if this is a valid excuse for leaving him, but I don't want to live with someone so miserable with their life.

I'll chime in here that, that is a super valid reason for leaving him. That and all the other stuff listed. I would strongly recommend taking photos of the messages on his phone. They could come very in handy when making custody arrangements if he suddenly gets funny ideas about being a primary caregiver."
hahahaha digesting &gt; disgusting
"First, I'm very happy this worked out well for you, and wish you and your family all the best.

But I think this is exceedingly dangerous advice to give to someone who explicitly doesn't want kids, or even is just leaning towards not wanting kids.

The act of having a child does not guarantee the emotional bond you experienced. And the negative impact of an unwanted child - not just to one's relationship, but more importantly to the life and upbringing of the child - is enormous.

If you find yourself in a situation where you're going to have a child, and you're trying to make the best of it, that's one thing. But I *strongly* disagree that anyone should even consider having a child if they don't think they want one. It's not something you can ""try and see if you like""; it's a life-changing, multi-decade commitment."
Do we have the same mum? Mine has serious stomach issues. Multiple hospital stays. The doctors told her not to drink. So she sneaks it. We live in different countries and I just had a baby. She told me that one day her stomach was bothering her so I asked her if she had considered not drinking. She said oh well I don't normally drink anymore but I'm on vacation! As soon as she was home she was back in hospital. 
"This user's advice is great.

You don't need to share your crush on him. Don't do that. Besides, him sort-of-hitting on you (if not hitting on you) at 16 years old is inappropriate.

Was he wearing a wedding band?

All you need to share is, ""He told me things did not work out, and I did not see a wedding band on his finger."" Lead with being upset/pissed off/angry/raging about it (within reason). This pushes the narrative onto him for being a shitbag (where it should be, anyway).

There is a possibility your friend or her cousin might wonder why you did not check Facebook or Twitter to make sure this guy was single. **Do not retreat to you having a crush on him, or liking that he was into you.** Just repeat that he told you explicitly he was single, and you took him at his word *because you thought he was a good person. Clearly he is not.* He was in a bar, not wearing his wedding band, and telling people he was single. That's a shit bag. You believed someone you thought was a good person. Why would you bother to check on social media?

I hope this helps, and I think you should tell your friend. If you need to explain why you delayed telling her the story (I would not explain this unless asked), then explain you were so angry to learn he was married that you wanted to calm down before telling her (which makes sense because you're showing righteous indignation now, and that seems strong, so imagine how much worse it was when you first heard?)."
"It appears it was *inconveniently* omitted in OP's case.

"You are making waaaay too big a deal about this. There is no law about who can be a +1, and bringing this person doesn't seem like it will cause any sort of drama, so why is it such a big deal that he brings her? It's fine, everyone will be fine. "
"Did you go to school with a kid who had cold sores when you were growing up? Yeah, that was herpes simplex. It can be passed through non-sexual contact such as kissing. It's one of the reasons parents are warned not to let people kiss their babies. There was a recent case of a child dying due to complications from herpes simplex infection.

HPV is the same way. Warts are a HPV infection and plenty of kids have them growing up. 

Beyond all of that? Your doctor told you they were atypical of any STD he could think of. He's running tests to figure out what's going on. I think you could probably tell her ""My skin is having a reaction and the doctor has ordered some tests. I'll know what it is in a week but I want to leave it alone so it doesn't get worse. Can we just cuddle?"""
"So, my partner and I were basically Jack and Sophie for a long time. Best friends. People asked us all the time why we weren't together, had we ever thought about dating - we brushed it off, we were just platonic friends (in retrospect, we were both in denial)!

I moved away and he started dating his Stacey. She was a nice girl and fitted in well into his life. But at the three year mark, when things needed to get more serious - shit or get off the pot, you know - he couldn't bring himself to do it. After a lot of soul searching, he ended things with Stacey. To be fair, things hadn't been all roses at her end as well, so it wasn't like he broke up with her solely because he was pining for somebody else. But, despite the troubles they'd been having, she was blindsided by the breakup and took it pretty hard.

Anyway some stuff happened and we got together (I'd like to point out here, because it's reddit, that I was living in another country so knew nothing about their breakup until he reached out to me and he didn't explicitly dump her to pursue me!). And he has confessed to me that he feels terrible for what he did to Stacey - she got hurt because he was trying to distract himself from his feelings for me. He thought we would never get together so he tried to make things work with someone else who wasn't right for him. He wanted everything to be great with them but he couldn't keep forcing it, and she got hurt.

So, from seeing all this play out from the sidelines, here's my two cents on your situation. Given that Jack has opened up to you guys about this, next time you guys are hanging out with just him, press the issue a little bit. You think Stacey is great, but what he said about Sophie has stayed in your minds. Is he sure he's doing the right thing? You would hate to see Stacey get hurt because, in his own words, she's ""second best"". Your partner should never, *ever* be second best. They should be number one, always. If he feels like his love for Stacey could grow to eclipse that of Sophie, then crack on and wish them the best. But it's not fair to Stacey to be living in another girl's shadow, and if she can't be his number one, he should let her be free to be someone else's number one.

It's probably not going to be a pleasant conversation, so take care with it and try not to come across accusing or as an ambush. It's coming from a place of love, and concern for both Jack and Stacey's long term happiness. If he decides to stay with her, so be it, you said your piece. But it sounds like Jack might be aware of the true strength of his feelings for Sophie, so it might just be the push he needs.

For the love of God, do not breathe a word of this to Stacey. It would be absolutely crushing to hear that your boyfriend's friends believe he is in love with someone else."
"If the bride and groom didn't want people other than those invited to come, they wouldn't have included plus ones on the rsvp. "
If either the lying or the virginity is a deal breaker you have two choices. Forgive and forget OR divorce. It is your decision. But don't stay together and be salty about it for the rest of your lives.
"\&gt; He cited Matthew 5:27 ""You must not commit adultery""

Meaning...he's with someone else?  Because adultery in the biblical sense is sex between a MARRIED person and someone who isn't their spouse.  Are you sure this guy is actually who he says he is?  Because his behavior screams that he is not.  He behaves exactly like he's older than he says, is in a relationship, and has been carrying on an emotional affair with you.

I would not go.  If you insist on going, do NOT meet him.  Try to get the hotel to switch your room to somewhere else (the major city where the airport is), or just take the financial hit and don't go.  This guy is not who he says he is."
"&gt; There just isn't the time or energy to put into a hook ups/secondary relationships without neglecting your primary responsibilities.

This is very true. Many or even most couples have a hard time making time for each other in the first year or two, let alone people outside the relationship. If he tries to maintain hookups/secondary relationships when you guys have an infant at home, that time has to come from *somewhere* and the truth is there's often not that much time to spare."
"Can you guarantee that's all that happened?

I don't think you can."
Haha 😂 but why would someone write down all their sexual contests? That’s just weird
"Get her help immediately.  Not to frighten you, but this is life threatening.  Based on this post, she should not be the caregiver for a child.  Getting black out drunk and hurting someone is extremely dangerous behavior - definitely not minor league stuff.  
Your wife needs to be evaluated by a professional.  Please do not take advice from Reddit about your wife’s specific treatment needs.  It is far above Reddit’s pay grade.  She needs professional help ASAP.  (My blood boils when I read comments that feed into misconceptions and offer treatment advice!  Even if one is a professional, they aren’t evaluating your wife.  They don’t know whether she qualifies for rehab, detox, outpatient or any of the various treatment options.). Just get her to a professional immediately.  I don’t tell you lightly that her life - and the lives of others - is at stake here.
Her job must be a secondary concern at this point.  If she needed chemotherapy, would you avoid it because she’s on probation at her job?  Also, if she’s incarcerated, in hospital or worse, the employment issue is moot.
Al Anon is a must for you.  Have you ever attended? Codependency is an issue here and I’m not surprised considering your history.  Counseling for you would be beneficial because you’ve got a lot on your hands.  You are not at fault for her drinking and you likely know that you cannot cure it.  You could use a support team, comprised of professionals, friends and, if possible, healthy family members.
I’m sorry for your pain and I wish you the best.  You are your child’s rock.  Be the father he needs you to be and keep him safe.

"Nah, don't apologise. It just sounds like his parents think he can do no wrong or because ""he's a child"" he can basically say or do whatever he wants without any repercussions. He sounds like a golden boy and his parents are just mad because someone finally called out on his bratty behaviour. Not all kids are saints and they shouldn't be treated like one when they are acting out. "

Thats one way to put it. Another would be ""I'm an asshole and proud of it"". 

He is just going to make you miserable. If he goes, he's going to sulk the entire time like a toddler and ruin your visit with your family. If you tell him to stay home, he is going to sulk and whine. Probably blow up your phone while you're away too. My advice would be tell him to stay home, go on your visit, enjoy your family, turn off your phone, and reevaluate the relationship. Here's a polite way to tell him to stay put: ""I didn't reaize how much strain the visit was putting on you. I will see you when I get back.""

""But I'll go since it makes you happy.""

""That's all right. I'll see you when I get back."""

"First -- I'm so, so sorry this is happening to you. 

Your safety is your #1 priority. If it's impossible for you to get out of the living situation because of work/school, I would consider taking a break from work/school in order to look after your safety. If you can stay with friends or family somewhere else, even if it means taking some time off, please do it. You will not get to continue work/school if he kills or hospitalizes you first. 

I am INCREDIBLY alarmed about intentionally causing accidents. Why did you keep driving after his first attempt? I don't mean to shame you about it, but I do hope you'll think about it. He tried to hurt/kill you once, and you just kept going. And that's what you're doing now, too. No. This is severe, and it's dangerous. His abuse is not your fault, but you do have to be the one to say it's no longer allowed to continue. You can absolutely not count on him getting past it or stopping on his own. If you get in the car with him, EXPECT that he will try to crash the car, literally and figuratively. 

Regarding school -- get in touch with an advisor at school about your situation. They can help you make a plan to deal with your life situation right now without losing track of your educational goals. If you have to take a semester off, or make some special accommodations with professors, do it. I am positive that your school has history dealing with circumstances like this, and that you can reach your educational goals even if there's an interruption right now. Don't let school be the reason you stay with your abuser. Make leaving your #1 priority. The rest will follow later. "
... she stated the place was packed and if they ran out of food where did the 4 burgers and the app come from so quickly?
Don't cater to her any more when she's in bed with a hangover. Don't clean up her messes unless they are a danger to your child. There has to be consequences. 
That sounded genuine to me. 
"You are correct in wanting to keep your pet safe. I don’t let my cats outside at all for several reasons, all of them are for their safety.  I don’t want them hot by a car, stolen, grabbed by a coyote, getting in a fight with a wild animal, killed by a dog, poisoned, etc.   Your cat should only be outside on its harness and supervised.  "
"If everything you're saying is true, then your SIL-to-be threw you under the bus and you did nothing wrong.

If your brother has reason to believe your dad is dangerous and a safety concern, his reaction makes sense.

However, what I don't understand is why the two of you have such different views about your dad? How come you don't know *why* brother cut contact? The communication amongst you and your siblings is horrible. Does your sister know something you don't? Feels like part of the story is missing.

Honestly, based on this post my advice is to skip the wedding and not have your wife and daughter attend either. Since them a gift and a card. You don't need the drama and over the top scolding after 1) not being told pertinent information about dad and 2) his fiancée changing her mind about reconciling but **never clued you in about her change of heart**.

You did something she *asked* you too, but bringing that up to your brother will only inflame the situation and make him even madder at you. He sounds like he is already super defensive and will chew your head off if you try to explain his fiancée's request.

It sounds like you didn't do anything wrong. You could have reached out to SIL-to-be again *before* you tried to get your dad to call. But all things considered that's a minor mistake, she previously asked you to help her bridge the gap but is intent on concealing her involvement to avoid her husband-to-be's wrath. It's shitty. But once again, conflict avoidant people often take the path of least resistance..."

"IMO, let him have his friend.  Friends are hard to come by as an adult, especially once you have children. Maybe explain to him that there are certain aspects about Adam that you would like kept out of your household and away from your child.  Maybe ask your BF to talk with Adam and explain that these are unacceptable actions. You don’t have to like the things he does, but he should respect the fact that it is your house and your child that is being influenced. A good friend will realize these things and at least change his behavior when he is around.  "
"That entire speech reeks of emotional manipulation and empty threats.

"There is in cities in the US. It simply isn't safe for cats to be outside regularly. Levy of people do it but they are absolutely risking their cats life.

The conversation is going to be tough but you need to face it. Consider finding a time to drop your kid off at a sitter perhaps so you can muscle through the conversation without interruption. Also I strongly suggest you write down what you want to say first, either just to get your thoughts together or so he can read it. 

As hard as it is, when you speak to him, be prepared to stick to your guns. He messed up big time, not you. I'm not saying you have to get mean or anything but if the blame gets defected to you I feel it will set a very bad precedent where he can make decisions for you and you just have to give in and take it. Why anyone involved felt it was a good idea to go over you head like this, I'll never understand, how crazy and disrespectful. (Also you might want to check your finances)"
Right on! Two women I know work from home. One is a data analyst and the other is a programmer. They often work longer than 9 to 5 schedule and definitely no Netflix and going to cafe with girlfriends during their workdays.

"I have a  friend who is also an ex, whom I have armchair-diagnosed as narcissistic. This is the kind of thing he does. It's tiny little details, almost microagressions, but what I think it says is, ""I know everything, I know better than you, I even know what you want better than you."" And when I say, no, I like the blue one not the red one, he will fucking gaslight me. ""Oh, no, you said you liked the red one."" ""That's not what I said. What I said was, the red one isn't bad but I would prefer the blue one. So you went right out and got the red one. Because you go deaf when I speak and you don't care what comes out of my mouth."" And then he gaslights me on that too. And this is why he's my ex and it's also why I won't get back with him and keep it to just friends because he has no respect for my needs or opinions. In this case, we're not talking about needs being met, so it might sound petty. But I think all these petty little micro-disses add up to no respect at all for other people's preferences, tastes, needs, desires, opinions. The only thing that is valid is what HE thinks. "
"You are on the right path! Soft skills are MORE important than technical skills. I mean you have to be technically competent but beyond that, smarts don't mean much.

"Your boyfriend sounds like an asshole.

That was a cheap shot to make at you and he knows that. 
 
The fact he reacted so defensively makes one wonder *why*. Like you said, it would've been enough for him to simply say he wasn't interested and then move on.

Him bringing up your (maybe) autism and saying how ""cute"" you are during an argument like this is extremely patronizing. 

You are definitely not overreacting. I would approaching him calmly, but sternly and tell him that what he said to you was rude and hurtful. And if he doesn't apologize to you after you tell him he was hurtful to you, sounds like he's the one who lacks any empathy here.

This type of post always brings them out. There are a *lot* of men like OP’s boyfriend and every last one of them feels fully justified in their viewpoint. 
"If youve already tried addressing him getting therapy with him, there may not be much else you can do. I do agree with you, he would benefit greatly from therapy. If you want to try addressing the notion of him getting therapy one more time, Maybe frame the idea of therapy a bit different. for example, you could say, ""Hey, i noticed this summer you seem particularly down, and i know you feel like you should be able to get your shit together on your own, but believe it or not, a ton of people get therapy. A lot of people may not talk about the fact that they are seeing a therapist, but a ton of people do. Everyone can benefit from a a 3rd person objective insight into things going on in their lives. You know im always here to talk, but someone trained in the field will be better equipt to give more helpful suggestions. Im not saying you Have to go and stay in therapy, but for me, would you consider at least going to one or two sessions, and see what you think? If you hate it, you can absolutely not continue going, but it would give me peace of mind to know at least it was an option you/we tried"""
This is so true.  There are probably girls who would want to hang out with you and be part of your group but don't because Ross is creepy.
"I would caution you against building a relationship around your family’s wishes. Yes, definitely take into consideration what they think of your girlfriend — read their reactions, but do not put them in the driver’s seat of your love life.

"&gt; I would respect his right to choose but I wouldn't want to meet her

I think you elegantly and precisely define the issue here. Well put, well said."
"I can understand not wanting to make waves in your families, but honestly that’s not a good reason at all to rush into a proposal and marriage. If you are adult enough to be considering marriage then you should be adult enough to express what it is you want from your life to your parents in an honest way. 

One year from now after you move and your relationship with your girlfriend is still going strong, you can sit down with your parents and explain to them that you want to move in together, because you love each other, are committed to each other, and want to take your relationship to the next level. If you are financially independent, then this should honestly be none of their business. They can express their displeasure, or ask why you haven’t proposed, and you can calmly explain that this is something you have thought about carefully for a long time and feel strongly is what is best for your life. If they are conservative and ok with living together before marriage (which is honestly pretty surprising) with just a proposal, then they should also be ok with you living together as two adults in a committed relationship who are waiting until they are more financially secure and set in their lives before they legally bind themselves to one another. Even if they aren’t ok, and freak out, then they are likely people you will eventually need to set boundaries with anyway in order to successfully establish an adult life. "
"Then if you're sure it's legal for you to keep her out, do exactly that. 

Taking the high road doesn't mean spreading your cheeks. Taking the high road means not stooping to her level by going out of your way to make her life worse, and that's not what you're doing. Keeping her out of your home isn't something you're doing to fuck her over, it's simply a consequence of her own behavior and you doing what is best for you. Having her out means moving on faster, not having to deal with her bullshit. That's the right decision."
That is really hard to be around. I think there may be something deeper going on if she’s acting like that and drinking excessively. See what comes of talking about it.

Ive lost 8kgs, started vomiting regularly, crying a lot for over 3 months, generally really depressed and sad.  I was and still am more than miserable but know it is the right thing to do.

"The problem was not her body. The problem was she was feeling badly because he had a sexual experience with someone else, someone paid to be hot. "

"Not OP but like, you need to understand something. Your feelings are valid, and you're not comfortable with him doing these things. You don't need facts or proof, you need him to understand exactly how and why you are feeling the way you're feeling. He then needs to act on that information for the good of your relationship, not for the good of his ""friendship"" or any other b.s. And if he doesn't then he's simply not prioritising you or your relationship.

"If you put a block on his friendship with this girl, he will just go underground and lie to you even more than he is now. I think you should always trust your instincts, it does sound like way more than just a friendship, possibly more from him than her. Is there any way you can talk to her, face to face so you can read her? See where she stands on all this? She might have no idea that you’ve put restrictions on certain activities or that you are concerned. If there is something going on you’ll see it in her face, if not, then she needs to know direct from you how you feel."
"Might I suggest two things?

First of all, consider blocking your ex on Facebook and Instagram.

Secondly, appearances are not necessarily reality. It's possible your ex is in a legitimate business. It's possible it's a scam."
"Sorry, but yeah, this."
Yea I figured that much but can’t they at least tell me?
"I'm so, so sorry that things have taken this turn, but it's better to get the heartbreak over with than waste another, what, year, three years, the rest of your life, all the while with that awful feeling in the pit of your stomach that he would rather have been with her. You deserve so much better."
"So he only cares about himself, and the only feelings that matter are his ?  Along with the double standard of him insisting on going to your friend's wedding and banning you from his... I'm not sure your relationship is as good as you think it is. :("
"It sounds like it was just the reason why they get approached all the time and if he didn't say that but just left it as, they are fun because they always get approached by new people, and you might ask why. In context that doesn't seem that strange is just him giving the explanation preemptively. "
"I mean it would be one thing if you kept bringing it up and there was a legitimate reason you couldn't go...

But he is the one who keeps bringing it up AND reminding you that he is going alone AND keeps making up bullshit excuses that are all couched in some negative about you (ie can't be around strangers). 

Like at this point its a ""we need to sit down and you need to tell me what is going on"" situation. 

He is CLEARLY bothered or has something on his mind but he won't communicate it like an adult. "
I would go back and re-read your post and see how much you felt you needed to qualify your position before you were even able to get into the meat of the issue. That to me is a big red flag about the health of your relationship. 
What relationship? It's dead. You killed it. Two wrongs don't make a right. Just end it. And try to be a better person next time

That's absolutely untrue.  In fact, it often turns out that the unfaithful spouse was not giving enough in the marriage.

Affairs are always about the wayward spouse and his/her willingness to put the extra-marital relationship above the marriage.  

They do need to go to counseling but under no conditions should the OP think that he and his illness were in any way responsible for his wife's infidelity."
"OP, I don’t know you but I’m proud of you. You did the right thing here and while it sucks, you’ll be so much better in the long run. It’s absolutely disgusting how your sisters treated you.

Glad you’re still around because the world needs more people like you. "
"I know that I'm echoing what other posters have said, but my paternal grandmother did the same thing to my immediate family. She never liked my mom (claimed that my mom took my dad away from her; the reality was that my dad, well before dating my mom, decided to go to school out of state). And that resentment definitely trickled down to her feelings about my brother and me. In one memorable moment, she demanded that I return part of a gift because she ""accidentally gave me more than she meant to."" My cousins, by comparison, had received far larger gifts than I had original received. Having my parents explain that it wasn't me or my fault definitely helped the situation as an 8 year old. 

You may not know the full reason behind your inlaws' actions towards your husband &amp; child. Whether or not you do have contact with your inlaws during big gift-giving events, I do strongly suggest be open and communicative about it with your daughter as she grows up. She may not be close to the grandparents, but if she hangs out with her cousins during other times, they will surely talk about gifts they got from the grandparents. It's your call on how you'd want to approach that conversation, but at least having a conversation helps mitigate any warped view your daughter may develop about this. Years later and long after my grandmother died, my cousins still idolize her. Thanks to my parents being open about the situation with her for years, I have a much more realistic view of her. And in my situation, I am fully aware that she was just crazy. "

"No, I definitely don’t feel like I need to call people who don’t do things I don’t like autistic all the time, but it would give us much better insight into the way you are speaking and the way you seem to treat those around you. I grew up around many people with very slight to very severe autism due to my mom’s career, so I believe I could give you better advice if I had a lens into that. For example, if I was asking for advice anonymously on reddit I would include that I have ADHD and have been diagnosed with depression to help people give more targeted advice (and I see many other posters do the same with their diagnoses as well). I do not think of any of these things, autism included, as being “bad”, but they can be important parts of who we are as people so if you want the best advice I believe it is important to include. 

Ok, now with all of that out of the way - I think at the end of the day you might not need to actually fire this woman to make your wife happy, but your wife might need some extra reassurance when it comes to this particular employee. Is this a compromise you are willing to make that still falls within your boundaries? You know your wife better than any of us do obviously, so the “extra reassurance” might be literally never speaking of this woman ever, it might be kind of talking bad about her within reason (just things like oh, so-and-so messed up so badly today, etc.) or it might be telling your wife the 1000 ways she’s better than this woman. But at the end of the day you need to acknowledge that this is a sore spot for your wife and she is allowed to have feelings about things, just like you are allowed to have your dealbreakers. 

I also urge you to ask yourself whether you hold yourself to the same standards that you hold your wife to. You don’t have to answer it here, but something about the way you speak about her “violating” your boundaries and some of your other terminology makes me very uncomfortable and worries me that you can be quite controlling. If you both hold each other to such strict standards and never cross these lines and you both are happy in your marriage, then more power to you for finding a dynamic that works. But it seems like you may be the one laying down all the boundaries and enforcing all the rules. If this is the case, maybe take a step back and look at the dynamic to find something a little more mutually beneficial. "

"My husband and I are like this. We spend time in the same room doing different things. However, we also watch tv or movies together from time to time and have found other hobbies. We both like animals so we bond over our pets and nature. We both workout together although sometimes it’s different activities. You find ways to make it work. "
"Exactly this. My boyfriend is not perfect, but the things he falls short at are things like ""buys the wrong deodorant at the store"" and ""is particular about me eating snacks in bed"" not things like ""doesn't treat me with respect when we argue."""
"&gt; she wants to leave at the end of the lease

&gt; says that I'm not the one.

&gt; Girlfriend lied about going backpacking with a friend

Even if it's with a different friend and it is just a misunderstanding there are pretty clear signs that she's been out of this relationship for awhile.
"
"&gt; Don't know if this is a legitimate concern

It's not. You can't tell her how to eat. If it bothers you, find someone else who is a quieter eater. I'll be honest, if a guy tried to give me pointers on how to eat, I'd just find a different guy. It's condescending and weird.

Also, ""inappropriate""? Sounds like you're making a huge deal out of a very small thing."
"Months from now it'll happen again, and your relationship will grow more toxic, and down the spiral you go. Don't think about it too much because emotions cloud judgement, and clouded judgements result in disaster."
"Alternatively, she'd be keeping her commitment to plans she *made a year ago* and he was already aware of when they were making newer plans together.  He could view this as a positive thing, proof she keeps her word to people she cares about, instead of turning it into an argument."
"Agreed. I think he might be giving such weak reasons because he doesn't want to admit fear. I'd be the same about spiders, I wouldn't be able to handle them even 5 acres away. I just wouldn't be able to trust that they'd stay in there - what if one escaped and my partner carried it back in on their clothes, or it had babies unexpectedly and they were small enough to escape? I know that's an irrational fear but it would be legitimate. OP - I'd suggest showing him a detailed plan:

- size of sanctuary
- how many reptiles and what types
- how cages would be handled
- what are your safety plans to prevent escape
- what are your backup safety plans
- what is your plan for if you're ill/busy/on holiday and can't look after them - reassure him you won't expect him to
-etc

I assume you'd be planning all those anyway so it shouldn't be extra work to show him. "
"I mean I'm with her, I'd love to get my uterus removed. But no doctor in their right mind is going to preform unnecessary abdominal surgery. "
"I mean, you can reach out in a ""long time no talk, let's catch up"" type way, if you get any kind of response and the conversation is going well you could tell him you appreciated that he was kind to you when you were a kid. I wouldn't make it weird and thank him for having a crush on you or anything like that."
"I disagree strongly.  A wife should not have to justify her hobby with a business plan to her husband.  The husband should encourage and support his wife's pasttime and vis-versa.

I might feel like husband would have more to say if he would be partially responsible for the animals, of if they were large animals like dogs, or loud animals like birds.

Reptiles are small, don't make any noise, and harmless.  Having a bunch of chameleons in a barn is nothing the husband should be worried about. "
"I think you're right, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and he's taken it for granted"
"&gt;she's expressed that she wants to leave at the end of the lease, but that she still loves me

This is a break up. She’s just too chickenshit to wait until after she moves out to date her new crush."
The fact that he was *offended* that she didn't want to immediately start dating him again is an incredibly bad sign as to his emotional maturity/stability.

Your marriage sounds awful. He's never going to change. You should just get a divorce and move on. It sounds like your ex really screwed you up. You need to stop dating men who don't respect you. Find someone that actually respects you. Your life will be so much better once you stop tolerating bad behavior from people.
"You aren’t being too sensitive. Studying just leads to more important moments ... med schools exams, steps, residency, licensing exams, board certifications. If you guys don’t learn to find a balance that works for both of you now, it’ll only get harder. Springing a whole day at the beach for him might now work, but it’s fair to ask him in advance to set aside a few hours for the same. You need to talk to him about feeling used, but I wonder if it’s his way of trying (and failing) to show you he still cares and finds you attractive. 

I’ve gone through the whole lsat, law school, big law route. Everyone handles it differently, but I’ve never put my husband on the back burner through any of it. I might get busy, but we just plan around it and reconnect when we can."
"I shouldn’t have ever done it. I realize that now. At the time, I didn’t have a reason to think anything would happen. He’s always been an honest person and everyone in his life would say the same. "
"If they were his friend group, I can see where his feelings are coming from where it's almost slightly territorial or why it would make him uncomfortable. In that situation where you were his ""plus 1"" to the event and then changed already agreed upon plans to spend more time with people you just met and have me drive home alone would make me feel uncomfortable. He should have said something in the moment but in this setting you should have realized he may try and communicate discretely in front of his friends. I get the sense you got caught up in the fun and weren't paying attention to his signals, so he got frustrated and stop trying to signal or didn't want to be direct at that point if his friends already picked up on him being stressed about it. 

In a new situation with his friends you should have been more actively looking to him for guidance on etiquette instead of making all the assumptions you did. I think you bf is upset and just isn't really articulating it well. Overall you both need to work on your communication. I don't think it's as clear as a right and wrong, but expecting him to be direct with social pressures you aren't familiar with isn't all that fair to him either. "
"&gt;In a healthy relationship, sex only happens as often as is required for the person who wants it least. 

This is complete crap and not healthy at all. ""In a healthy relationship the person who wants healthy food should do all the cooking""  or ""in a healthy relationship the person who prioritizes a clean house should wash all the dishes"" are basically saying the same thing and neither of those are part of a healthy relationship either. 

Sex if just like any other part of a married relationship. You need communication and compromise to make it work best for both parties. No part of any healthy relationship is 100% controlled by one party. 

If they can't find some middle ground then counseling would be the next best step. If there's still no solution op will need to think about how much he wants to push this issue. They should be able to find something that works for both of them but it'll be work from both parties and lots of communication.

"He's right imo. Personally I recommend a day at the beach, go fishing, go play a sport, ride a bike, walk around town and explore, hike....tons of things to do outside. "

"This isn't a relationship issue, this is an issue with yourself.

You don't need to end the relationship to find yourself. Talk to your bf about it  and set aside a few days out of every week to focus on yourself and whatever hobbies you're interested in. From how you describe your BF I'm sure he'll be supportive, encouraging, and understanding. "

"&gt; “you offered to titty fuck someone.” Walk away and chill out if she doesn’t own up and acknowledge her bullshit. 

This right here would be totally unacceptable behavior to me. Like grounds for divorce and inexcusable. I wouldnt be worried about her feelings personally. Id lay out mine and tell her exactly what i thought about it. Wife and i recently went through some stuff ourselves and had a similar conversation and I did just that. Laid out exactly how i felt we both did more so myself but she also had some stuff to say as well, turned out we both were unhappy with our relationship and found some areas to work on and have since been doing so to try and make it work, so far so good, but only time will tell if it will work out for us or not. For us i hope so. For OP i do as well. Seems to me OPs wife has a alcohol problem, there may be more on top of it much the same as my wife had going on causing her to do some questionable shit that would piss me off to no end that lead to me literally getting ready to file for divorce (i had papers ready and everything, wife didnt know it though, decided to talk to her first because i still love her and we have young kids together who i think deserve to have both their parents together and happy if possible). So here we are giving it another go. 

Be open and honest about how you feel though OP, even if she will get defensive, let her have it. My wife got defensive to, but did a lot of the same kind of shit and just like you i had proof as well, just get those videos and lay it out. I laid it out like this is a breach of my trust and your faithfulness and the foundations of our relationship its unacceptable, you have a problem it needs to be dealt with if its not this relationship cant continue, thats not what i want but thats what your pushing me toward pretty much, told her all of my issues, she said hers and we after a bit of arguing started talking about how to address the issues together.

Just using my relationship as a example for what you could do OP, my situation was different to a extent but similar as well. I laid my foot down, was prepared to end it if thats what was going to happen, but also ready to work it out as well if she was willing to admit not only she fucked up but she has a problem and discuss how to deal with it which she did so we are working on it. Its understandably a tough decision and took me a few days to even come to terms with it myself so you might want to take a bit of time and think about what you even want to do and how to go about it.

For me when faced with a tough decision i clean, i clean like a motherfucker. Like full on spring cleaning mode. My house, my car, whatever i clean the hell out of everything. Spotless. While doing so to everyone else it looks like im focused only on cleaning as i look like im working really hard cleaning, but im mostly just thinking. Its my i dunno peaceful time, no one bothers me while i clean cause they dont want to help me so they leave me alone lol. I move furniture, wash baseboards, clean under the fridge, stove, etc. detail the car. Do all that crap by the time im done it usually takes me a couple days and i usually have thought everything through good and have come to a decision im satisfied with. Do this like twice a year whenever theres some big thing to deal with and it kills two birds with one stone and takes a weekend so its kind of a nice way to get shit out of the way. Make a habit of it and no one questions you doing it. So like organize the garage or something like that one of those things you kind of put off but needs to be done and use that time to mull things over and come up with a course of action.

Good Luck OP "
Being cool and edgy about stuff like that is very annoying outside of reddit.  You think it's funny but he feels criticized and embarrassed when you call out things he likes.  
"From reading this, there were probably times you should have broken up with her sooner but you didn't see the signs. You dodged a bullet my friend. "
"That may be a genrational or age (or even my family) thing. we were always encouraged to give it a few weeks after a break up and then date as much as possible. Even if the dates were terrible you were at least out of bed not focusing on the past.

My kids are highly resistant to this however so I could be outdated in my thinking. My daughter is a purple belt in JiuJitsu, great student, tough as nails kid and she just had her first major break up and she's been a blubbering mess all summer. My mom advice has been meaningless to her so I may have been trying to find a surrogate on reddit and may have been wrong.

"When I was in my teens and early 20s, the young men around me seemed to suffer from a mass delusion that ""just being honest!"" meant unfiltered stream of consciousness remarks about anything that crossed their mind, no matter how offensive, hurtful, mean, insensitive, and weird they were. 

When called on it, they would get angry and defensive, as if speaking ---not even your mind! just your unfiltered word vomit---was in the friggin' constitution or something. Let me assure you it is not, dudes. 

As you get older, I can reassure you that most young men mature due to a combination of time and harsh life experiences (say, being dumped by their dream girl for saying ultra harsh things that should have been kept private) and no longer subject the women around them to ""My Every Thought"" TM. 

For now, maybe dump this guy and show him that his deepest, darkest, most hateful thoughts are NOT welcome conversational topics.

"Hang in there, buddy. Do what you need to do to take care of yourself now. Surround yourself with people who will support you.

You'll get through this!"
Yeah I don't think negotiating sexual acts for changing her body is healthy or mature. She could find fun with another man who likes her the way she is.
"&gt;They're actually very clean people. I should know, I grew up with them.

Everyone's idea of ""clean"" is different based on what they grew up around.

If she doesn't want to go, don't make her. She can host your parents when they want to visit your home."
Yeah my mom is 70 and she's not an asshole about this stuff.  She was born and raised Catholic too.
"Dude right?

Everyone is like ""OP you're not thinking about your wifes feelings!"" I don't exactly see her considering his feelings either.

So a week and a half is to long. How about 5 days? Split it right down the middle."
"This is from one of OP's comments:

\&gt;We spend way less time with my parents than I would like and that's because I know it's my wife's favorite thing in the world. We spend almost all major holidays with her parents because it's more important to her. We stay with them for a week+ at a time. The longest I've been with my parents since I was single is 3 days.

So time spent with in-laws isn't the issue as much as his wife being unable to compromise about things that aren't her favorite that are important to OP.  I can see why he's upset about this."
"Your fiancé is the type of person who is helping to walk an addict to their death. In reality, her behavior is further enabling to be an alcoholic and making it much easier for him to keep up with this lifestyle. She needs to go to therapy or something (there are groups specifically made for people who have alcoholics in their lives) because what she's doing is ultimately hurting him, not helping. "
"He is, but I don't know if he frequents this sub. 

Ironically, the one time I looked on his reddit (This was before I knew he had an account and I just wanted to scroll through the home page because I was bored, he was busy and my phone was dead) the first few subs I saw he was subscribed to were in the porn category. 

Yet he tells me he's never looked at other women sexually. 

I think there is insecurity there but I'm struggling to see what's causing it "
Tell your cousin to stop being a moron. Why does he have your boyfriends back over yours? 
"&gt; I felt like I owed him for being there for me like that, and it was so painfully clear just how much he liked me.

&gt;The next day, his friend pulled me aside to talk. He told me my FWB likes me a lot and asked me not to hurt him. 


so what's your option here? A relationship out of pity? You don't owe someone a relationship because they cared for you 1 day. 

&gt;his friend just told me that in his opinion, age shouldn't matter in a relationship

This is a thing dudes in their 30s who want to bang teens say.


&gt;Cutting contact would probably just hurt him. What do I do?


The dude's banging a 20 year old. Let it hurt him. He's a grown ass adult he should be able to deal with life. 


The longer you don't tell him what's up the more it's going to hurt him.


And apparently he alraedy knows what's up because he sent his friend after you to basically beg for a relationship. "
"Wow, that was do far out on your part I'm reeling. You're not shy, you just don't like the consequences of being a twat. One of those consequences is you now have a coworker that rightfully hates your guts. Save both of you some effort and find yourself a new job and stop being an arsehole."

Yeah he’s lying. It’s true OP doesn’t initiate enough but it also sounds like he really doesn’t want sex anyway.
"That's bullshit, emotional blackmail, and a huge boundary violation. You don't owe this guy anything. In fact, if you were to respond, I'm 99% sure he'd only escalate.

"...don't date a guy who lives in his car if your goals are to live in something that's not a car.

That's my best advice to you."
"This is incredibly fucked up. Not only are you removing her ability to make an informed choice, what you're doing is potentially illegal and could get her in a lot of trouble. Real life isn't a romance movie, do you think someone is going to fall madly in love with you when they find out your relationship was based on a lie? 

The longer you keep up this lie, the worse it will eventually be. If she's a wonderful person and helps you, don't you think she deserves honesty? Even if it means losing her, don't you think that if you love someone enough you should let them make their own choice?"
"Haha in that first paragraph, I already knew the answer!! I’m the avoider :) I take a little more time to wind down my emotions so I can clearly explain.  I’ll leave the room and he’ll want to address it right away if he notices I’m upset.  Will work on that!

One of the things I want to ask: I was expecting sex mindset to change.  My thoughts were to get more hobbies and keep busy so that there’s always a little bit of the “U. ME. 2NITE ALL NITE.”  If that’s not the case, how do you work around the monotony of each day to keep that spark? 

The best part about our situation now is that I Sassquatch Monday through Friday :) "
"Yes, I think you're right about the deflection. It sounds like sister is trying to convince herself, not OP."
"&gt;I would suggest paying the doc an incognito visit and gaining his trust via empathy and convincing him to show you those results

"&gt;If you really wanted to marry her you should have eloped just the 2 of you no one else, you could have done a small reception at a later date with your family. she said she doesn’t want something big and you kept pushing for a bigger wedding and she didn’t want that. 60 people is still a lot.  
&gt;  
&gt;I got married at a court house just the 2 of us and we were happy. I don’t see why everyone needs their family to be at the wedding you are marring your spouse making a commitment to them why does family need to be present for that?

It's completely legitimate to want to have your family with you at your wedding, regardless of whether you can't ""see"" why or not.

You can't advise that someone 'compromises' and simultaneously tell them that their position is worthless."

"FYI - it's not ""totally ineffective"" but if you do ever need it there is a prescription alternative called Ella (ulipristal) that is effective in overweight or obese individuals if taken within 120 hours of unprotected sex. You can also use the copper IUD as emergency contraception but it is difficult to arrange getting it placed soon enough usually.

As a pharmacist and a bigger girl myself my plan is to get a prescription for this from my provider after the birth of our daughter this fall when we plan to start using condoms again. That way I'll have it on hand if we need it."
"That's...horrifying.  The LGBT community should be a safe place without cherry picking who qualifies for equality and kindness. :(

Just break up RIGHT NOW.
"When the kids are asleep make a big ass casserole that can be used as dinner the next night and possibly lunch during the day.  U can also make food in large batches to freeze so she doesn’t feel the need to cook for everyone?  If she does that is, I don’t know the situation I’m just trying to troubleshoot a little for ya.  Meal prep takes time and is stressful when you’re trying to keep an eye on kids.  

My personal fave? Make a ton of chicken cutlets then freeze em.  When dinner rolls around u can toss em in the oven for five min on a cookie sheet.  Instant mashed potatoes and a bag of peas and you have a full decent dinner with little work."
"This is what I hope for.  I just can't shake the feeling of ""there must be something better out there.""  

That's horrible, and it feels bad to end my relationship based on it, but it's real.  Having had a few long-term relationships now, my personal opinion is that marriage is pretty irrational.  There's no way that you will ever find the perfect person.  So therefore, you need a bit of that stupid passion spark to make it work. 

When my boyfriend (after talking about marriage for months) didn't propose at any of the waterfalls, that was when I was like, ""This relationship is so fucking practical that of course he wouldn't do it here.""  He'll wait until we're settled down.  He'll wait until it makes sense.  We've always been that way.  And I just need it to be a little sexier and a little messier."
He was actively soliciting other women on Tinder.  It's not like OP's distrust of this guy was wrong.   She trusted her gut and now she needs to leave the cheater.  There's no need to throw blame and doubt at OP when she realized the guy was not trustworthy.
"It’s no coincidence that the first time in 2.5 years you are social without him that he blows up on you so extremly. You are very much living in a situation were you are constantly under your boyfriends control. Perhaps mostly you want to do what he wants you to do anyway, so it doesn’t feel like you are being controlled, but the parameters of the situation are still the same: you are constantly monitered by your boyfriend.

Except this one night when you went outside of his control and monitering. And now he’s angry for something that happened whilst you did that? Which is no suprise, because it’s text book reaction of a controlling person to lossing their control.

This isn’t about you being groped. This is about him punishing you for going out alone. He wants you to feel bad for doing it, and he will use anything to make you feel bad. If absolutly nothing had happened whilst you were out he would have yelled at you for being hapoy with your friends whilst he was home alone and miserable or something else he made up. Just like this reason is made up. He wants to yell at you for thinking you can have one night when you are not in his control.

Also, he wants to make you so afraid of him yelling at you and throwing you out of the house that you never dare go out without him again. If this is something you risk everytime you disobey him, it seems easier to obey. Except for how you will be miserable in an abusive relationship."

"&gt;He's never actually said 'dress more like her'. The clothing he has suggested to me happens to be the clothing she wears.


Ah, sorry; but of course the message and implication is the same.

&gt;I have always complimented him. I have always encouraged him to work out. I have always treated him well.

I'm fresh out of ideas then. Sorry. This  sucks"
"The daughter is normal, tbh many teenagers/teenage girls are like that that in terms of long showers, and just having a really hard tome to pay any attention to stuff like lights or where which item in the fridge is placed. It is a behavior she would need to practice to be mindful of because she does these things on automatic and pays no attention. Talk to gf and ask her to pay more, she has a job and used to be able to support this girl. 


Second, what exactly is she supposed to be doing outside school? Whatever she's doing online can be socializing, learning and all kinds of things you don't know about, so it's a bit unfair to make that judgment in favor of stuff you consider to be Hobbies. Either way none of your business.


The cat thing is serious, they depend on you and you need to make sure they are cared for. This needs serious attention and discussion. 


The wifes jealousy and controlling how long what activity takes you is crazy. Worth breaking up over if she doesn't knock it off. Is she actually suspecting you're cheating or is scared you got lost??


Edit: you most certainly will take care of the daughter after she turns 18. Unless she has to move out for college, what exactly do you think would happen for a child to suddenly be able to support themselves? The reality of today is that kids depend on parents for much longer because it's unrealistic to expect someone to support themselves at that age, and even if she goes away for school she'd still be financially dependent for years. "
"I don't think you owe any of them an explanation, honestly. Especially if you and your husband are fine and have moved on from it all.

If any of them say anything, I feel you could go two routes: 1) ""Well, I'd like to see how any of *you* would react to something like that on your wedding day!"" or 2) ""I can't really apologize for how I reacted. Brenda was rude and disruptive at my wedding, what was I supposed to do? Yell? Make a scene?"""
"Do you really think she'll grow out of this? As long as there are not repercussions for her attitude, she has no reason to want to change. She's abusive, immature, and entitled and you're enabling her. You're obviously frustrated man. You're trying to be a good person and make a life of things, but do you really want to be this girl's footrest for the rest of your life?"
"Dude, you totally did this to yourself. You ignored her when she texted you and then you propose a break. I presume you didn't talk to her, as you implied that your only way of checking up on her was looking at her snapchat. You also changed your status to single, whereas she made hers hidden. You think she was waiting around for you to come back when you were engaging in all that?

Honestly, it seems to me that you're just mad that you lost your safety net. Chalk it up as a lesson learned and don't take ""breaks"" without clear boundaries. "
"This is truth and I don't even have kids. I did go through a DRASTIC increase in work hours and other personal responsibility several months ago and some nights I'd just look at the filthy carpet, the piles of dishes, the nasty bathroom, the mountains of laundry, the lists of chores and errands, none of which I had time or energy to touch, and just break down. My own life had gotten away from me and the sense of being overwhelmed and of failing infiltrated everything. 

If SERIOUSLY helps to have someone take up some of that slack. I was trying to do it all and was doing none of it. After a meltdown I'm not proud of, my BF volunteered to help with some things and wr brainstormed other ideas.

He got me a subscription to one of those dinner boxes and I strarted using paper plates and disposable cutlery to drastically cut down on dishes. I used a laundry service. He volunteered his Tuesdays to help me with chores and errands - stuff like picking up my cat's meds, my meds, small store runs.

I felt IN CONTROL again, and better about everything overall. And I saw he was willing to be a partner and a team. "

Eye color is a polygenic trait. Many people believe what you do because it's often used in example Punnet squares which leads to a serious misunderstanding of eye color inheritance. Many people are very sure they're right on this because it's what they learned in school. I can't link but google it.

"I don’t think I ever take nudes or sexy pics for a specific guy. I’ll just be about to get in the shower and go damn, my hair is mussed and my makeup looks great, let’s snag this while we can

I’ve gotten older nudes from guys and I don’t find it disrespectful or weird, people save flattering photos of themselves. I’ve never gotten a complaint, if I’m at work, sorry, you can have this previous photo, I’m not gonna go make an excuse to go to the bathroom for twenty minutes to pose "

"Yeah, speaking from experience, I had a relationship where I felt I was wholly dependent on my S/O at the time and when I broke away one night to spend a night with friends and meet new people and just *be me*, I realized ""oh. This is what respect feels like.""

"I agree with what you are saying. I am 99.99% sure I am not going to tell my aunts. I hardly even speak to them. 

But to address your last point; I am already alienated from those people. They are not my family. She did not consider them family either. They have always treated us badly and just because I was her daughter I was an outcast since I was a child (which no child deserves), excluded from everything. Despite my disdain I am civil and will not tell them, no matter how much I dislike them. It will cause more drama that I certainly don't want. "
"What is her long term plan? Did she just expect you and your brother to support her the rest of her life? It may be harsh, but if she isn’t working then I would move her out of one of the most expensive cities in America. Also, has she considered a work from home job? She could work remotely as a customer service rep or do medical transcription/data entry that would not require her to go to an office or interact with people in person. "
They aren't exclusive or committed.  Read it again.  She didn't cheat
"She's a pathological liar, so if you're comfortable living with that it could still work.  It's a mental illness that doesn't just go away.

I don't know how you could want to stay with someone with so little regards for you and your health.  It's not like you love her, but you love the person you thought she was.  Now you know that she isn't that person."
I think this is a solid point but it needs qualifying. In this particular situation there’s no evidence that the OP works out excessively or devotes every meal and minute to being hyper muscular. I agree that I would not want to be in a relationship with someone like that. But if she’s going to the gym 4-5 days a week for an hour at a time that is not problematic behavior. 
Yes.

Most importantly: Do not marry into debt. Suddenly he’ll make it your responsibility.

"Nah, i think this other comment nailed it:

&gt; I want to add, as a person whose ex-partner wanted a big wedding mostly filled with *his* family, she probably invited those friends so she had *someone* there for *her*.

Even with 25 friends, the bulk of the guest list is still OPs. She came into this wanting to *elope*. Her original MO was not throwing a huge party for her friends. "
"Aside from his completely inappropriate reaction to this, the comment that you shouldnt have been ""anywhere near him"" shows how little he knows about being a woman moving through the world much less at a dark bar. I have had men literally come up to me and poke me in the zipper of my pants. When I was a teenager a carnival worker chased (literally) me and a friend so he could grope our breasts. In public in the middle of the day surrounded by peolle an adult man was chasing us and no one did a damn thing. 

He is a giant asshole and should be angry at the person who touched you. Fuck this person, I hope he is your ex soon. Don't bring him to the wedding. I imagine he is the type who will ruin it, and you sont want that shithead in pictures you will see for years. "
"Yeah, exactly. I don't mean to minimize the importance of them making sure their partners know they still find them attractive--it is a really good thing and it's very important for the RELATIONSHIP and the way a new mother see how her partner looks at her.

"If that’s how he behaves during arguments then that’s not gonna change, he’s gonna be insulting you and making you feel insecure every time you argue. And things like this can often escalate into psychical abuse. 

You just gotta find yourself someone who makes you happy all the time, it’s not worth wasting time with people who hurt you "
"""I don't want to upset her"" is not a valid reason to marry someone. And, putting the debt and location issues aside, why would you commit, for life, to someone you can't even talk to about difficult subjects? Who makes unilateral decisions and refuses to budge. You need to step up and end this. Sure, the fallout will be painful, but it will also be temporary. Then you will be free to build your own life. Marry her, God forbid have a kid with her, and you will be stuck forever in a slowly deteriorating life. Don't do it."

"You're mom can't physically stop you. That'd be false imprisonment at best. A lot of people have covered the basics and told you there's fuck all you can do about your brother and they're right. You can't change him or the way your parents decide care for him.

So switch gears and start looking out for yourself since they won't. You're in what could become a very dangerous situation. If your brother decided to act up and you were the only one in the house, you'd be in trouble. 

Plan to leave. Talk with your school counselor, or a teacher and find out what your options are. Do you have good grades? Have you looked at scholarships? School is a great way to get away from people. You absolutely can do this on your own and don't have to tell your parents about it.

Save your money. Do you need that expensive make up? It sucks losing it, but think of putting that money toward getting out. Do you need those extra groceries? Do you need that particular phone and plan? Do you have a bank account? Did someone help you open it? If so, withdraw your money and make another private account that no one has access to.

Think of it as having one year to save as much as possible. Talk to your friends about being roommates and renting a place. Could you get a better job? Somewhere that lessens your time at home?

No one but you can keep you where you are. Keep all your things locked away, don't tell anyone how much you make, and start saving."

She's had his ashes for 10 years (during which you didn't reach out). She cared about him and loved him and you don't have any right to his remains. It's not like she's throwing them away.

Uhhh...yeah you have. 

People financially support their spouses, or long-term serious partners. He managed to convince you to financially support him shortly after you met. That's nuts.

Then he managed to convince you to extend his free ride from the summer all the way until December. I bet when December rolls around, there'll be some new excuse for why he can't move in with his friend.

Then when he was asked to contribute to an electric bill, he weaseled his way out of that with excuses that don't even make sense. If he's staying rent-free with you to save money, how could he not have $45 on hand?

Then he plainly admitted he uses people.

One lie? Trivial? you are delusional if you think those apply to this situation
"There was this couple who went up to the highest court in Germany to get the incest ban lifted so they could marry (I think they were siblings) and the court's statement was really interesting. They didn't lift it but they purley argued that it's a societal taboo and therefore it's not desirable to have it lifted. Because the explanation of genetic risk to offspring is a slippery slope. You'd need to forbid people with genetic disorders that are high risk of being passed down to procreate and you certainly couldn't do that. 
So if I'd know somebody who fucks their sibling in a consensual manner I'd probably be like ""don't get caught"" (so obviously also not marrying each other) but then would mind my own business."

You just have to say ""No"" and ride the waves.

He's 16 - let him watch the movies he wants, ask him to help cook dinner once in a while and generally respect the recipes he wants to make (e.g. pizza is okay if it's homemade but he can't cook a frozen pizza on his night), but make it clear that he's not to start smoking e-cigs, vapes, juuls or whatever, or cigarettes. Show him the science behind it, but stress that that's a boundary you have. In my opinion that seems like the only dangerous thing his friends are currently into."

What???? Not only did he snoop, read your journal, get in your face, yell at you, take back the ring and kick you out, he says that? You were violated again by the person you trusted the most. 

I could not care less what a few other commenters are saying about his shock or rage. He didn't walk in on an assault and assume cheating or something and say the dumbest or cruelest thing. He read your journal while you were at work. Unless he started reading 6 seconds before you came home, he had time to get his (biology-challenged) head together. He could have gone for a walk, called a rape hotline for advice, done just about anything besides blame you and call you a liar. He is so, so, so wrong.

Because I would think that they were a child who couldn't manage their emotions. And while peoples emotions are important, I don't manage my department because people's feelings are important, I manage my department because we need to get shit done and meet our quotas. 

Taking a day off because you had an argument isn't going to help my department meet quota.

Higher weight is usually associated with health problems bud. I think your parents above all else want you to avoid those health problems. They are looking out for you.
"But OP doesn't KNOW. He's just assuming that the cold shoulder is due to what she read. Maybe she was like ""Wow, you went to vegas for a bachelor party"" and immediately goes WTF WHY ARE YOU SNOOPING. And she's upset and gives him the cold shoulder.

Both my version and your version could be correct based on what we, the readers, know. I mean, yes, snooping is bad and we could get into a circular argument of what each of us feels constitutes as snooping - but neither of us (and OP doesn't even know) specifically why the cold shoulder is being given."

OP's feelings are completely understandable but there is nothing here to indicate OP's husband is doing doing anything inappropriate. The ""work wife"" obviously sees OP as a friend, includes her in lunches, etc. so I wouldn't question her motives either. I think OP just needs to communicate her feelings to her husband so that he can be sensitive to them and maybe refrain from terms and behaviors that OP is not comfortable with in terms of his coworker.

Yup. My sister was our best man. 
"OP had a very serious conversation with her boyfriend, were she was clear that either they agreed on their life plans or they had to breakup. The boyfriend agreed and OP made a massive commitment. Then, just like you wrote, the boyfriend is now not only taking back his agreement, he’s lying and saying it never happened and he is reacting hostile to OP for bringing it up.

The relationship has to be over after this because OP can’t *trust* him on anything ever again. Whatever plans they make for the future, big or small, OP can’t trust he will actually intend to do. At any moment the boyfriend can turn to her and say he never agreed to that. How can you have a future with someone when you can’t trust your partner about what he says his plans for the future is?

Also, he even lied about lying. This guy has zero credibility. There can be no trust with a liar, an without trust there is no relationship."

I don't know about OP but it's become way too common with kids parties where I am. We show up when we say we will but the number of actual last minute cancellations I hear about or all no shows at kids parties is just heart breaking. Heck we just joined a party last week at a park when one poor kid had a single friend of 10 show up. 10 whose parents rsvp'd yes only a few days prior that they would attend. Kid honestly looked like he was going to cry. 
"The difference here is that your ex is a human being who your wife can watch get fat or old or awkward, or compete with effectively, and the fact that you chose her over your ex means she doesn't even have to compete. She is secure in the knowledge that, to you at least, she is the better woman.

this poor bastard is competing with a guy who will always be 19 years old and completely in love and utterly supportive. He will always live in a time when the OP thinks that she actually met the love of her life as a child. Every day with anyone else has to be a little bit of a letdown. Don't get me wrong, it seems like living with him might be an especially big letdown, but it's not the same at all. Your watch isn't a holy relic of a better time, before you knew you could die or love could fade."
I feel sorry for your boyfriend.
" Oh, we’ve both made it clear that we get one veto for each person‘s guest list, and I let her know when advance that it would be him, and she completely agrees."
"Thank you, I do understand. In the relationship, I feel im the one that's more easy going with outsiders and strangers than him as he is more introverted than me and gets bothered by others easily. I feel like the alcohol almost made him more outgoing and I've never seen him like that before. 

I did feel like I was a good sport up until that one point where yes, I do feel immature for being upset at him but he noticed I was upset and asked me to explain.

Its also funny because he always wanted me to be more of a ""clingy"" one. He used to often ask ""why can't you be more clingy?"" In a joking tone because when I first met him, I was more independent than I am now and he sort of wants somebody that will depend on him, I guess for pride?

"I'm a guy so I can't speak from the female perspective but it sounds to me like you might have something more to unpack here. I'd say the best course of action would be to speak to a therapist who specializes in sex and get a professional opinion. Probably not what you want to hear but these are the kinds of issues that can really impact relationships that would otherwise be perfectly normal. 

On the plus side, at least you're self aware. Most people aren't smart enough to realize they might have an issue until it comes back and smacks them in the face. "

"To be fair, I think I subconsciously realized I wasn't making the right decision on going on this day- long excursion with him because of some warning signs prior to today. For instance last night, he compared a friend of his to me and said we looked similar as in ""we both weren't gorgeous pretty"" and ""but she's skinnier"". He also berated me one morning when he started talking politics (we both have contrasting political views) and because I didn't know some things he was trying to argue on he says, ""do you even know any history? Do you even know what you're talking about?- essentially calling me stupid. He also did a few other strange things during this short week I've known him, but I brushed them off as a sign of getting to know him better.

I really cannot understand what your problem with her is though. Sure, vulturing isn't for everyone (like me, I'm very squeamish) but it's really not that unusual. She wants to learn about medicine and science, but not become an actual doctor. So what? Can you only have an interest in things if you intend taking a degree in it? Sounds like you're intimidated by intelligent women and are one of those people who have no interests of their own so they just shit on everyone elses instead. By no means do you have to like your partners hobbies, just don't make them feel like a weirdo for having them. No wonder she's shy talking about them. 
You're also now latched onto the 'witch' aspect, which again doesn't make her a weirdo. This isn't the middle ages. Some people were just joking when they called her a witch, but as other have said 'witch craft' is rooted in real world things like herbs. Women branded as witches often were just medicine women. "

"You're going to get mixed opinions here. I am of the belief that when you marry someone, you join your lives together. She deserves to know anything and everything about you. You're the one she shares her money, body and home with. That us not just any relationship pr friendship. This is your partner. Your equal. So to me she didn't do anything wrong. It's weird though like damn why waste time on that but ok whatever she did it... 

As far as you mailing a post to get others opinions, that not gonna help. All that's gojgn to happen here is the ones who agree with you will make you validated. You will also see some that make you see others think like your wife, that it's fine. This post does nothing but make you more upset. 

What you should be doing is telling her how you feel. Calmly and lovingly. You're allowed to feel your feelings and so is she. But in a good marriage, you're both going to be trying to understand the other person, where they are coming from and why. That is love. That is respect. 

Go talk to her and ask her why she has been distant. Dont assume. Maybe there is something else at play you dont know about yet and it just looks this way... if she thinks you got a prostitute well then it needs to be talked about that you didn't. 

This feels like w weird issue that shouldn't be one. Noone did anything. Or even if you dont agree, noone did anything big like cheating etc.. this isn't dealbreaker stuff so go talk to your teammate and get this fixed. Try to talk with love and empathy and not anger."
"If she was looking through old statements she may not have even known what they were when she picked them up. She HAD to look at them to decide if they were important. Most people quickly scan things they are looking at. Sheesh people not everyone is out to get you. I could also see how if he accused her of snooping during an innocent look where shed also be pissed.

Edit: typo"
"&gt; I thought you were knocking me.

Perhaps a little. After all, you chose to parent a child when you have no way of giving it a home"
"&gt;  including an extremely offensive gendered slur.

Oh no, someone think of the men being called a gendered slur! All they wanted to do was sexually harass a lesbian in a homophobic way! They should definitely only be called gender-neutral insults!"
"She was 17 and he was 18.

At that age, you expect her to know about the workload and lifestyle of a med student/resident/doctor and to make her dating decisions based on it?

Almost all teenage relationships end, often because of conflicting academic and career paths."
"This! I did this for my friend who lost her husband. I acted almost like a body guard. She didn't want to burden any other family members with the job because they would be involved in their own grieving process. She was completely shut down and didn't want to speak to anyone and needed a way to 1. not speak to anyone and 2. while also acknowledging that people were there. I literally sat next to her and held her hand and people walked up and said ""I'm sorry"" etc and I said ""Thank you"" etc. She was better during the second viewing and able to interact. 

Also definitely ask for a private area. There were moments when both my friend and her husband's mother needed a place away from everyone in order to some break down of emotion. "
"I would love for you to use the words the OP wrote to prove me wrong. Seriously, if there is another way to read everything here and interpret it differently I would love to hear it. I won’t pretend I have all of the answers, but if you think I’m wrong (and I could be) then it would help to specifically point out what you think is wrong here, with examples from the post or comments. 

I read through all the comments and the post, and this is the conclusion I drew. You read through everything (maybe) and came to another conclusion. So how does it look to you? "
"&gt;My next move is marriage counseling which she has always brushed off as a last resort

Yeah, you guys are already there. Your relationship needs serious and intensive work. The internet cannot provide that. It's odd that you two have mystified and locked away the one easily accessible tool at your disposal. Almost as if you're afraid to hear from a third party that your shit is fucked."
[deleted]
"RIGHT?! I'm reading some of these comments and I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Someone even said they share beds with their friends of the opposite sex and it's okay. If you're almost 6 months into a relationship and you feel uncomfortable with your significant other having someone of the opposite sex sleep in their home ON TOP of knowing they made out, then you're totally entitled to feel jealous. Not only that, but it undeniably warrants a conversation to make sure you're both on the same page. You don't have to be the ""cool"" girlfriend and not say anything or be okay with it. What's more, it's okay to have standards for yourself in your relationship. If your SO fights you on that, and you've clearly expressed that it's sketchy and makes you uncomfortable, then maybe he isn't the right dude."
"Okay so we're all going to agree that your boyfriend is dickcheese and yes you should absolutely ditch him...

...but can I just take a moment to say I legit applauded when I read how you handled this:

&gt; Finally, around 12:15, I was knitting on the couch and he was drinking outside. He comes in and says ""we need to talk about some things that have been bothering me that you're doing"" and I tell him ""okay, we can talk in the morning"" and he says that no, we need to talk now. I tell him that it's midnight, we're both tired, and I won't talk about anything serious now (I 100% saw that he was just looking for conflict and was trying to argue with me for the sake of it, also he was quite drunk). He stood there just glaring at me for a minute and then said ""if we don't talk about it right now, then I will burry it down deep and never tell you"" and I said that's his choice.

Especially that last line.  Fucking BRAVO for not letting him manipulate you.  You're one boss lady."
"She needs to say she’s afraid it’ll keep happening, if that’s the real issue here.  

It’s not unreasonable that OP’s family thought they’d save some money by staying in an vacant house owned by a close family member.  It sounds like they’ve been polite about asking, not just assuming it’s ok.  But obviously they picked Aspen because they thought they could stay free.  I think most people would do that."
I honestly get the feeling you're looking for a reason to break up with her. Also your friends are assholes. Why do you think any of her hobbies are red flags? Literally nothing in your post makes her come across as anything more than a bit eccentric. Who put the thought into your head that you should break up just because of her hobbies?
"They understand very well that they seriously violated your personal boundaries, your stuff, your home, and deliberately and ostentatiously wished harm on you. 

If your husband doesn't do the above that Enrichmentonly suggested, it means your husband doesn't have your back.

"OP, this is great advice. I just wanted to add that you are being incredibly brave and I really hope that it goes the best it can with your father. Goodluck! You're going to need it. "
"He can take them bowling himself, problem solved."
"Ok but fathers shouldn't threaten children with physical violence to keep them in line either. This kind of behavior would be abusive no matter who it was aimed at, a decent person wouldn't treat a pet like that either. "
"First of all, you need to end that relationship without doubt. He's being a straight up creep. After that you seriously need to get some therapy. It's okay to not want to get married but these other boundaries will lead to anything but happiness"
"&gt;She's saying I need to be aware of how it ""could"" sound to someone else, and how it ""could"" get her daughter taken away

No, she's accusing you. 

She needs therapy. Not for your relationship, but for her own sake and her daughter's sake. "
"What she did wasn't normal, it was abusive. You were abused and because you were only a kid, you could never have understood what was happening to you. You have experienced trauma in your life and the worst kind by far - trauma by your parent.

People get off on this idea that we should make amends with others, forgive and forget.

You don't have to forgive her, you don't have to love her, you don't have to accept her in any way you don't want to. What she did to you can never be taken back and it wasn't your fault. She also doesn't have to know that you won't forgive her. You are your own person and you can be as involved (or uninvolved) with her. It is your choice and no one else can ever take that away from you. And regardless of what choice you make, it's neither wrong or right. It is simply just the choice you as an individual made and you are entitled to it.

I'm so sorry for what she did to you."
"I would frame this in a different way: GRANDMA destroyed your relationship with grandma. She is the one who made the choice to shun you just because you live with someone you love. She literally is throwing your relationship in the trash because...why...religion? That certainly isn't what Jesus taught people to do.

You can be angry with your parents but the person you really need to hold accountable for this is grandma. She isn't some helpless person who was manipulated in this situation. She made a hateful choice, and she isn't the person you thought she was. She's full of hate.

You are better off not having someone like your grandma in your life, frankly."
"His wife could have phrased it better, calling someones parents home gross is pretty much starting a fight. Its not a way to start a constructive conversation. Also this is a fairly yes or no case so he should be able to state his opinion on it.

I definitely agree that they should keep the trip to about 3 days though no one wants to stay with their in laws for 1.5 weeks."
"Maybe no, but at the same time...do they want to contribute to the sister's future irresponsibility by continuing to just hand her stuff even though she does nothing to earn anything she has? Is that really for her good?"
It's just kind of  mean spirited. I can't imagine telling my own family they weren't welcome to stay in my vacant vacation home for a few days. I'd be utterly ashamed. Is she like this about other things in life?
It took 10 full paragraphs plus a few more baby grafs to explain your relationship issues three months in. Your “honeymoon phase” is the equivalent of the first 5 chapters of a James Patterson book and it’s just as bleak. 
"I agree with maglab4, OP. I went through something similar in my last semester and was in denial until I realized I had become suicidal. Maybe she hasn't realized it yet, but my ""symptoms"" were pretty much the same.

I'd talk to her before going to someone else in her circle."
"&gt; This might seem like an odd suggestion, but consider checking out some of the polyamory-related subreddits.

This is a terrible, terrible suggestion.  Even if OP was at all interested in polyamory (which her post gives absolutely no indication of), being in a polyamorous relationship with a lying, gas-lighting douchebag is a terrible idea.   "
Child abuse is so not on the same spectrum as this 
"One thing to keep in mind is that in most jobs, you do get little moments to yourself. You get a lunch break, you can take a second to drink your coffee without someone yelling at you or pulling on your arm, things like that. But kids don't really allow for that, maybe during a nap but it sounds like even then she needs to rush to get chores done, and with two kids naptime can really vary. Maybe if she occasionally had an hour to herself during the day (the way many people have a lunch break) she might feel more like herself. I think a great solution for this is working with other stay at home parents to occasionally switch off watching each other's kid. So maybe your wife can drop off the kids at a neighbor's for an hour and take a walk or get coffee, then she can take their kids for an hour in the afternoon. Just a little bit of time to herself might make all the difference. "
"Also, you were 16 when you first met and he was 25? Gross. He used you and you should tell your friend."
"To add to this, OP, don’t just take her away on a weekend, it sounds romantic and all, but it won’t help in the long run. Have a dad day, or a dad time each day, where she can have time with herself and you take care of the kids. It’s mentally and physically super tough to take care of two kids and everything at home. It sounds like the weekly blowjob has become just an extra chore for her to do. It sounds like she’s maxed out exhausted. Take care of the kids so she can take care of herself. If she gets time to focus on herself, her sexual needs may very well return, but when you’re busy like a new mom of two, you don’t feel like you have time for anything sexual. Feels as if her body is not her own. Make her feel like she owns her body. "
This is completely OT but I am crying at the imagery here 
"As a person with chronic depression I pretty much agree with this analogy. Depression can be like parasite, just feeding off of you until you’re just an empty shell. Comparing it to cancer might be problematic, but depression is problematic. It works for me to remind myself that this is an illness and that I have to fight to work through it, instead of letting myself get sucked in like I used to. "
"Nah, bro. It doesn’t “suck” that women get full power in these situations. Until you have the ability to grow a human in your uterus, you don’t get an opinion. Sorry. "
"He's part of her friend group and unlike with op she doesn't have the kind of relationship to ask him not to come?

I mean, you could tell your spouse ""it would be better if I went alone so that X causes no scene"", but you couldn't tell X ""I don't want you to come"" and expect them to say anything but ""fuck you, I won't do what you tell me"""
"This isn't college anymore. He can't just have sleepovers with friends. He's married and has a home, he should act like it.

EDIT to add: If I were you, I would tell him that if it's so much easier to stay there, then he can stay there permanently and never come back. Seriously, he picked the job, if the commute was such an issue it would have been brought up beforehand. "
"Okay, first thing - take a deep breath.

It seems your life is a mess right now, and you have a lot of issues to overcome. I think you shouldn't try to pursue him, or any other relationships right now - focus on yourself, for your daughter's sake too.

I think this is over the paygrade of reddit, so you should probably seek professional help.

Good luck, OP!"
I have kids and 1 bathroom. I haven't had a shower without someone using the toilet in years.
"You sound like you are in the US, which means she is violating labor laws. As a college student, you probably have access to legal services. Go to them.

&gt; she never added me as a permanent employee 

What does that even mean? Does it mean you never filled out whatever those forms are, I9s and W2s (I might have the numbers wrong)? That means nothing. You worked, she has to pay you. If you didn't fill out the paperwork that a regular employee would fill out, you are an independent contractor. She has to pay you.

&gt; and was paying me with personal company checks.

What does this mean? Was she withholding taxes? If she wasn't, you will owe those taxes when you file next year.

"She’s a child with separated parents, yeah she’s going to be a little shit for a while. Coming from someone who had to go back and fourth every other week between my mom and dads house my whole life, it sucks. I was a brat to my stepdad when he met my mom but I grew out of it and I’m sure your daughter will too. She’s 7 and he’s a grown ass man. "
"Seriously, the cost of living is seriously dirt cheap in that area, as well. It's a no brainier type move if you want to be able to live very well."
Imagine if you’re a guest in someone’s home and they give you a portable toilet to use?? I sure as hell wouldn’t use it. And I sure as hell wouldn’t want my friends to have to clean it up after me. I also wouldn’t sit in my car and do my makeup every morning.

Double yikes. I agree that this is not a black-and-white issue and you have some valid points, but the contempt in your tone is a major red flag for me. You guys need a counselor, pronto. "
"“She says it’s not my place to have an opinion”

Well first of all fuck her. Let’s completely disregard your reason for speaking to her in the first place. She is telling you that you are not allowed to have an opinion. How crazy is that!

o·pin·ion

A view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.

So am I not allowed to have an opinion about my shitty toaster? 


You did everything right! You want to live your life by certain traits and values. If someone doesn’t live up to them and you really don’t want them in your life then do what you want. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

 This is YOUR life, not theirs! 

Yes you probably will make mistakes (as do we all) but they will be yours to make, to reflect on and then in the future to think about if you made the right call or not.

"I have general herpes. It sucks to have to tell people, but I’ve always told people *before* I had sex with them. The STI is really not as big of a deal as health class would have you believe, but people should be able to make informed decisions about their sexual health. I’ve only had one person choose not to sleep with me after I told them, and yeah it sucked but it was his right. I’m telling you this to tell you that 1) if you do have it, don’t stress because it really won’t affect you as much as you think it will, and 2) that was absolutely wrong of him to not only fail to disclose but also actively lie to you about it. I’d absolutely break up with him. Don’t stay with him just because you’re afraid no one else will want to be with you if you have herpes... trust me, you’ll find plenty of people still willing to be with you even after you do the right thing and disclose your status. He lied to you about a very important topic—your sexual health. If he doesn’t care about your health, he’s not a good partner. "

"To me it sounds like she's (perhaps subconsciously) minimizing your presence in her life in order to not appear too attached in front of her side partners and I'd absolutely be hurt by this.

Your feelings matter and they've been pushed aside for too long it sounds like.

"My dad died from a heart attack at 61 last year. He had been over 300 pounds for most of his life. He had years of doctors telling him to make healthy choices, but I didn't realize until after he died that he was a miner stuck in a hole with a shovel. He had been digging all of his life and never thought twice about it because he didn't know how to climb. He didn't have the right tools or drive to climb out of the hole. It wasn't a shock that he died, only that he died right then. If OP wants her brother to survive, she has to convince him to start the climb."
"Is it planned that they arent staying at said hotel afterwards? If they are, are they sharing a room? If they arent staying the night i really dont see a problem. However if its expected to stay i would feel uncomfortable with my SO sharing a room with a male coworker in this situation. "
"She is rightly ensuring she remains with her daughter, and that the schedule / custody arrangement she has will be maintained. She COULD consult a lawyer but it is accurate to imagine that if she tries to relocate with the child, it could be against an existing custody arrangement and / or that the father could petition for more or full custody as he remains where they have agreed to live and where the child is living currently. 

If you're going to be a part of this family, you will need to accommodate the daughter and the divorce and custody arrangements in place already. If you cannot, you're incompatible and should break up. "

"You didn't say anything wrong. Frankly, you were nice.

"She said the fact that he has a record now makes him irresponsible.  She's using the fact that police routinely cite blacks at much higher rates as proof that he's irresponsible.   And goes from there to not wanting her boyfriend to associate with him.   And she also goes to objecting to his music which is associated with race.  

Also, your argument, that she would be getting different answers if she hadn't put in that he was black and her boyfriend called her racist...is a fallacious argument since that was in fact the reason she posted.   And yes, I would find it very troublesome for someone to brand an SO's friend as ""irresponsible"" based on the fact that he ""now has a record"" for something that he probably wouldn't have been cited for had he not been black.   It's circular reasoning to say it doesn't matter -- because it does."

Oh, and your mother is just horrible. Who secretly sells someone else's car? And then buys another one without consulting you and asks you for the money? That is just such a weird thing to do. What reason did she give for doing this without asking you? Because the only reason I can think of is she wanted to be in control, of you.

Also, any caring, considerate parent would totally work around your shifts. She's telling you she thinks her whims are more important than your career."

"&gt; So his thing about variety was total bullshit...

Sure, if you don't consider that her personality is different than yours. Just because two people are similar doesn't mean that they're the same person. All you're getting is an outside perspective , and you're making a lot of assumptions because of it.

Your feelings are certainly valid, and I get your train of thought, but you're letting your irrational and emotional side lead you down a path of bitterness. You should learn mindfulness; it'll train you to recognize when you're having these irrational thoughts and give you the tools to get you back into a more healthy mindset.

For instance, if you think ""He basically just replaced me,"" counter with the thought ""But obviously I don't know her personality, so I shouldn't assume anything."" And then focus on whatever you're doing at that moment. The idea is to recognize irrational behavior, address and correct it, and then directing your attention to what you can immediately control."
I know how you feel being on read its the worst feeling ever.. Fuckin asshole.. Try facetiming or video chat if you can and stand your foot down and tell him dont fuckin leave me on read again. I honestly feel he could be cheating. What kind of a person doesnt answer to their s/o..
"no, it's a third world country, laws are absolutely on landlord's side and I don't think eviction of family members is even defined by law.

I see the point of her calling the police and complaining that I'm not letting her in, but I'm 99% sure they're not going to do anything and since she's leaving I don't see us getting into lengthy legal disputes. Also I don't think she'd go for it, but then also what do i know about her"

"I am a female with a male best friend who I don't have romantic feelings for. I've done thing like go to dinner with them one and have personal conversations. 

That said, I've *never* lied to my husband about spending time with him. To me this is the tipping point. At the point where you are lying to your SO about your time with someone they just plain can't trust you with that person. You trusted him and he choose to break that trust. No matter what he says now, you can't trust it, and that's a choice he made.

You do know he lied. It's like when talking to a child who is in trouble, you don't ask them *if* they did something you know they did. You tell them you know. (Otherwise you are just setting them up to lie.) Tell him you you know he lied. Tell him your clubs were used *after* the conversation where he promised not to golf with her. Tell him your brother heard someone in the house and thought it was you and asked you about it. See how he reacts then. Don't accept lies just say ""I know that's not true and I'm really disappointed you're still lying to me.""

&gt;When I asked him to give me a reason he would not be with her romantically, he said “she wouldn’t have me”. 

This + him lying to you about their time together (again the biggest issue with that isn't the golf but now you can't trust him with her at all) I think your two options are to end it with him or he has not see her anymore. This is a 100% fair request on your part given he's lying about seeing her and what he does with her and he's already pretty much said he'd be with her if she wanted him. Now, he won't find it fair since he clearly wants to be with her too (at least emotionally?). But are you going to marry a man while he is actively having a relationship with another woman he lies to you about and says the only reason he's not with her physically is she hasn't agreed to that (yet)?

Disclaimer: This is assuming you are confidant about the golf clubs timeline. It is completely possible that you are totally confidant and he defiantly lied. But I'm not you so I don't know how sure you are about when you talked to him vs when you last used the clubs. "
Protip: When someone hates someone for no reason and wants them dead there is something SEVERELY wrong with that person and you should run away from them.
Boy byeeee. He's 27 and clearly has no understanding of how female biology works (as others have said). Dump him for someone who won't constantly accuse you of cheating.
"This is emotional abuse. If you're so horrible to be with, he would have left you ages ago. He instead enjoys torturing you and watching you fall into a pit of despair over how supposedly horrible a person you are. 

He's not gonna leave - you are. If you want to regain some sanity."
"For the first 30 years of her life she wasn't just getting out of a traumatic experience...now she is. 

Therapy is a given but it's not some kind of tantrum she's throwing right now."
"You're right, your MIL isn't looking to compromise.  She wants you and your husband to be Catholic or at least raise your child Catholic.  That's her goal.  It's not enough, to her, for you to occasionally attend church to appease her - that doesn't make your child Catholic.

The only thing you can really do here is live your life the way you want to and understand that MIL will probably never fully approve of your choices.  That's fine, though.  You're a strong woman and mother and you don't need her approval."
Divorce is always messy. No way around that. Its a bit ridiculous to suggest no one should ever buy a house together.
"You're totally right, I was just trying to get in OP's mindset as in ""I put hard work into the relationship and she didn't"" type of thing."

"Are you using condoms? If not, you should be because you know he’s going to blame you if he gets it. And honestly, he’s pretty immature if he doesn’t know how to protect himself. It’s not YOUR job to protect him. 

I think it is normal for someone to go back and forth. If my bf told me he had herpes, I don’t know what I would have done in the beginning of our relationship, to be honest. Maybe you could visit the doctor together so that he can get all the information he needs to make a decision. Then let him know that he needs to commit to a decision (either break up and go out separate ways or come to terms with it, don’t mention it again, and move forward with the relationship). "
"Saying vom makes me want to vomit, we all have our funny issues with terms; but if all parties are happy with saying whatever they're saying or calling each other whatever they're calling each other, why should it matter or make us vom[it]?"

I’d try loosening up a little. "
"This is all BS dude. I hate to break it to you but at some point in life you're going to realize you watch what people do, not what they say. 

You say you want to be single. You act like you're in a relationship. If you really, really want to be single and work on yourself. If you honestly inside want that then be deliberate in your actions. Break things off with her and actually go start living that way. Otherwise, stop talking nonsense and face reality."
"I fail to see how that’s relevant?

"&gt; Weddings are limited time events. Grief and mourning go on long after the funeral. Your step sibling will need support in the days, weeks, months to come.

This is an excellent point. They're (hopefully) going to have tons of support during the funeral. The addition of a step-sibling who you see once a year isn't probably the tipping point that makes everything ok.

"Does he have any hobbies?
Or does he mainly just do the things you guys do together? Maybe he can't think of anything else to do with his friend apart from what you've introduced him to.

It still doesn't negate the fact that he's lying to you at all tho."
"It might also be worth calling the MIL (or getting your husband to call her once he's calmed down) and explaining calmy that this drama went down and you are going to need her to not do her usual act of forgiving her golden boy for everything and blaming your husband instead - she is going to have to accept that her golden boy did something awful, not apologise for it or try to downplay it, and not blame your husband. And accept that any fallout or not-talking between the two is for them to sort out, not her place to say that they should just make up again for the sake of brushing this under the rug, protecting her golden boy, or protecting her idea of how the family should be - if she has a problem with the family ideal being destroyed, she needs to discuss that with her golden boy who tried to sexually assault you, not with your husband for responding to that assault.

If she wants to see her grandkids again, that's a minimum. So let her know before she gets golden boy's side of things, and before she decides to defend the family status quo over the safety of her family."
"She’s right that it is her body, but what she’s talking about is very extreme. You are absolutely correct about the risks and results of this. Did she say why she wants to get a hysterectomy? Is it possible that your partner is non-binary or trans?"
It is too late to bring this up now and he is certainly wait too late to send her a Venmo request. You should have discussed expectations during the trip. You should have said to her “OK this gas costs $XX.” Maybe she thought you intended to treat her for the entire weekend. This sounds like a lack of communication on everyone’s part.
"&gt; I’ve been told that if I leave my “inheritance” may be on the line. 

Keep in mind that you have no guarantee there will be an inheritance even if you stay. I've read countless stories here of children who busted ass for a family company, only to see the company go to another, more favorite sibling. 

Your dad is putting pressure on you because he knows he can't get anyone else to work under those conditions and for that pay. Your brothers are putting you under pressure because it gets them off the hook and makes their lives easier. 

This has nothing to do with family or love from their side, as much as they might use that argument against you. Listen to your mother, it sounds like she's the one who is actually thinking of what is best for you.

"Yes I do have a known health condition: endometriosis and some other things that factor into it. Along with that based on how many abdominal surgeries I've had, doctors have told me that my getting pregnant is highly unlikely. "
"This is on him for not taking your word that it won't happen, and that you're not concerned about it. Like you said it's become sort of a challenge which is understandable, but only makes it more difficult and even not enjoyable for you.

I'm a guy but there are times when I can't finish, or it takes longer than usual, and the more I get in my head about it the worse it gets; and my girlfriend is perfectly understanding of that, and just enjoys the sex, and has never had a 'why can't you finish?!' attitude, which would kill any chance completely. Likewise she doesn't always finish, and I'm not offended by it in the least, I just feel kind of bad without her getting that relief, like she held in a sneeze or something lol; but I understand it's like 80% mental and if it's not happening, it's not happening. Maybe we understand each other because we've both had it happen.

So I guess any advise I'd have is to lay it out plainly, if you haven't already; that it's nothing he's doing wrong, and likely nothing he can do to change it, and the more he obsesses about it the less likely it becomes, and ruins the mood of anything else. It's probably hard to understand if he doesn't have difficulty with it, but in order to move past this he'll have to set aside his ego and trust you when you say that you're enjoying sex without an orgasm.

As for faking it, I wouldn't recommend it but I can understand the pressure and it's kind of tricky because like you said now he thinks he can get you off. There was one instance where it seemed like my gf faked it, and I didn't want to argue about it, I just said it seemed like she did but either way she shouldn't because I don't take it personally if she doesn't finish. I trust her to tell me when she wants or doesn't want something, rather than only relying on what her body does or doesn't do.

Sorry if I talked about myself a lot, I just wanted to show that it basically comes down to communication; for something like this he has to listen to what you're telling him over what (he thinks) your body is telling him."
"Removing the womb? No. Messing around inside when removing the cervix? Yes it can. I don't have anything other than what my doctor said to me and what I saw on the message board of other women going through it at the same time as me.  It seemed to be well known to them. It wasn't something my doctor mentioned until after the fact. 

Believe me or not, I don't really care. "

"Honestly I would disagree with some other commenters about the duration of Depo Provera's side effects. My wife was on it for 6 months and had zero libido for at least 6 months after that, maybe more. 

The other thing she and I have noticed is that the more sex we have, the more sex we want (up to a point) and the better it is. If we don't have sex for a while, it's very easy to get in our heads with the pressure of ""performing"" and the fear of being rejected. For us it takes a couple of days of intentionally planning sex to get back into the swing of things. 

A couple of times we've done 30-day challenges--have sex 30 times in as many days. We've never fully completed one, but even so I cannot overstate how helpful it is and how passionate we become when we are literally all over each other all the time. Scheduling sex sounds like the opposite of sexy, but it can really work.

Good luck--you guys can make it work! It will take some teamwork, and there will be some failures to launch, but you can get back there :)"

"Oof. I totally get why you're internalizing it and feeling horrible about yourself after the way he behaved. It's hard not to when someone you are hopeful about in a new relationship treats you like this.

For real, I wish I had your backbone when I was your age. (My past abusive relationship started around 24 and began with this *exact* kind of bullshit. In fact, he'd be 33 now....)"

In the long run this is highly doubtful. Very few people look back on their lives and say ""You know, I really should have stuck it out in that dead end relationship with my high school sweetheart that I had nothing in common with, found unpleasant and avoided having sex with."""

"So you missed all the comments where OP says that they almost never talk about her photoshoots, huh? He almost never asks about them, he knows nothing about her line of work, and she usually doesn't go into detail about her workday. Her not telling him about this is actually in line with how they normally interact. You can argue that in THIS case she should have told him, but I don't see why. It's not like she is out there texting nudes to her exes or whatever. She is modelling lingerie for her job. You would think that someone who asked a model to marry him would get that she does modelling. "
"After a year he can’t even tell her he loves her, and has said he doesn’t know if he loves her. Those comments to me make it feel like when he says he’d feel bad without her it’s less about *her* and more about the part where he doesn’t want to be alone.

People will put up with mediocre and what they know because change is unknown and we always worry that it’ll be worse, no matter how shitty the present is.

One year may not be long enough for a marriage proposal or to know whether you want to be together into your dotage, but you could at least give someone a pretty good idea of whether you love them, and otherwise you need to stop wasting their time and feelings."

"&gt;Why would someone be so angry about not finding a friend as physically attractive as they did before though?

Could be that, if he indeed does have a crush on female Kal, he had her on a pedestal and the idea that she is no longer who he thought she was makes him angry. She was a cute, cool chick who he liked to fantasize about and crush on sometimes, and now....suddenly she reveals she's not a chick, but a man inside, and they're going to physically become a man. It's like when ""nice guys"" lash out at the girl they previously fawned over because they discover she has sex/smokes/likes weed/etc. She doesn't fit who they think she should be, and this makes them angry.

It could easily be that Kal has broken the pedestal OP's husband had him on, and he is angry that the person he was crushing on isn't the same person he had built up in his head.

I could see him not telling his wife exactly why he's upset because, since he's married, he knows he shouldn't be having feelings for someone else. But crushes happen."

"&gt;We don't typically speak in these types of terms to each other

Super minor, but can you maybe... start? Between my sister and close girl friends, we are constantly telling each other how amazing and great we all are, how we all deserve only the best things. If you two have a dynamic of 'joking' put-downs and negative self-talk, constant joking about how terrible you are can quietly undermine a person's self-worth... even if it's always, *always* meant as a joke.

Edited to add: it might be worth it in the long run (even if you're not in time to stop the wedding) to practice saying these sorts of things out loud. If you feel it's hard for yourself to say to your *best friend* that she deserves to be cherished and adored, how hard do you think it is for your friend to tell herself that? Getting her started on being able to say, out loud, that she deserves to be treated well might help her stand up to her BF (and get him to change) or eventually leave if she's really, truly unhappy."

This is why most posters think you should chip in for the expenses. 

Also not paying could further alienate your friends.

She doesn’t want another child. That’s it. I am in he same boat. I had one and although it did not effect my body in that way I just do not want another child. There are a lot more factors emotionally that don’t exatly have to involve ppd . She doesn’t want another one. It’s not a car or a move. It’s another human in this world . It’s incredibly life changing .

If he asks again, tell him EXACTLY THAT, and then tell him that while it's totally fine that he feels that way about feet, it's not appropriate to engage in his fetish with someone else's girlfriend, or with anyone who is made uncomfortable by it, and that you are uncomfortable.  Try to keep the tone light so he understands you're not ANGRY with him, and he's not in trouble, but what he's doing isn't appropriate and needs to stop being directed at you.  Also, you might think about discussing it with your boyfriend so the two of you can talk to him together - gently, of course.  Good luck."
She didn't say she was slender. She said she was underweight.

"""They have shown almost no interest in being an active part of my life until recently. When they found out I was dating a trans woman, they all of a sudden badly want to be in my life, but they say they just can't and that it ""tears them apart"" knowing that they cannot have a healthy relationship with their son.""

Sounds to me like they want to make drama. You say they haven't even been a big part of your life before this, so it's not like you had a healthy relationship prior to this, then they come into the picture so that they can shit on your decisions.

Your parents don't respect you. If they loved you and respected you they would want you to be happy, and at the bare minimum wouldn't behave like assholes.

"I drank a bottle a night for several months straight at times when my twins were 1-4. (I was in my late 30's) The shear depth a human has to delve in order to draw from the patience of Job is no joke. I have an addictive personality and needed somewhere to release the stress of it all. (my husband travelled too, but honestly he and drank wine together after the kids were sleeping a zillion times.)

I feel sorry for this woman. OP has no freaking idea what his wife is pulling off as she sacrifices her own emotions to remain even-keeled and steady so her kids are stable and protected. My God, let her have an outlet before she cracks.

Happy ending: My kids got older, life got easier, the wine consumption plummeted. It's not always about addiction. Sometimes it's just fucking getting through the years from hell."

"Maybe not the best for relationship advice, but I play Pokémon Go regularly (and love with an SO who doesn't) so might be able to give some perspective. 

Basically, if it is just the game it probably shouldn't be a big deal. I know gaming addiction can be a thing, but I honestly have not come across in a wide Pokémon Go community (that is incredibly diverse in age/job/background, seriously I play with 70 yo's that are just as into it as teenagers). There are definitely SO's who are kind of bugged by it, but most don't really mind it, and some play with their partner just to take walks with them daily. I'd suggest he try playing with her, or at least coming along to hang out, they're usually very welcoming groups. 

But it does sound like there are much deeper problems in this relationship if she is flat-out saying it's not worth fixing, or that it felt like shy anyway. Maybe this is just her release from a marriage she is genuinely unhappy in. 

TL;DR I'd say he should be less judgmental of her playing a game and offer to join her if he really wants to fix. If she doesn't want him to or still unhappy, go to counseling or get a lawyer. "
"it's not mean. you can't open up to a counselor you don't feel comfortable with. if you're willing to talk with someone, tell danny you want to see a counselor but not that one. it's okay to be picky. you're 15 and you've got some serious trauma in your past. you get to decide who to open up to about that.

"&gt;I've been with my first serious girlfriend for about 4 months and over I think we have a terrific relationship overall.
&gt;

Your relationship is not terrific. Your girlfriend is manipulative, disgusting and has no respect for you. I do not know anybody that would be comfortable hearing these detailed stories of their partners past. She knows you do not like to hear those stories, but insists on doing it anyways. Your girlfriend is intentionally upsetting you, and her friend is in on it.

&gt;In one instance they compared the penis sizes of all her partners, and her friend asked how I compared.
&gt;

What kind of person does this to their partner?? She is saying this TO YOUR FACE. Why would you antagonize someone you love like that?

&gt;she talked about it in a joking manner makes me think she hasn't changed, and doesn't even regret it. 
&gt;

Uhm... she has not changed. And she does not regret it. Your girlfriend literally has no shame. She is a serial cheater. You said she ""explained herself."" How in the fuck do you explain your way out cheating on multiple boyfriends, with multiple men? How do you think your girlfriend is anything but trash??? I wouldn't doubt she has not cheated on you already.

&gt;friend thought I was kidding at first, and she was surprised to see that I was visibly angry. She convinced me to come in, and she was becoming incredibly upset at how angry I was.
&gt;

So after your girlfriend tells yet another story about how she is not a self respecting person with morals, even though she know it makes you mad... got surprised to see you mad. Then she turned it around on you! She made you feel guilty for her actions. Also... your girlfriend slept with a guy to get back on a friend. Your girlfriend is gross, dude. She is NOT a good person.

&gt;Eventually she began to cry and at this point I wasn't angry anymore and I went to comfort her.
&gt;
Easy Rider has your number.

&gt;But she still continues with these stories that she knows bothers me and at this point I'm not sure what to do.
&gt;

Dump her. What the fuck. She is refusing to do something very easy, which is not talk like the trampy tramp she is in front of her boyfriend. Not that hard. Her outright refusal to abide by that simple request should show you how much she cares about you. And your relationship."
"You aren't a bad person for being unhappy, that's just the reality of the situation and the truth of your feelings.

Now you know you are unhappy you need to address it:

1) You can try and address it with couples counselling or by at the very least trying to do some date or fun-type stuff with your wife that you might both enjoy.

2) If 1) doesn't work you need to think about leaving/ending the marriage. It doesn't sound like you have a sexual relationship and you aren't friends so what are either of you getting out of this? 

And regardless of your financial situation, you are not obligated to spend the next 50 years of your life being terribly unhappy because of a decision you made at 22 (and it sounds like the marriage was partly for practical financial reasons).

Good luck.

Changing a bad situation is hard and takes courage but a marriage can and should be more than the relationship you describe above."
With the benefit of hindsight

"I’m going to just slide in here and give you a little life advice:

You seem like the type of girl who, due to your self-described daddy issues, may fall into the trap of dating a much older man. 

It will likely seem romantic and exciting and like true love to you, but hear me when I say this: Generally speaking, older men like dating girls like yourself because it gives them power over a weaker person who doesn’t know bad treatment when they see it. 

They are counting on the fact that you’ll be too unsure of how things work to stand up for yourself when he’s being abusive. You’ll be in your late twenties before you finally realize that you were taken advantage of, and by then the guy will have moved on to a new naive teenager.

BEWARE."
"I don't know how long you've been working out but it doesn't sound like you're ripped? Just like you're in good shape, your legs and butt probably look better. Is it possible it's coming from his insecurities that you will be out of his league moreso than being super jacked? I mean being a super muscular girl is definitely not everyone cup of tea but it doesnt sound like that is the case."
Agreed! With more detail to the plot and where he told everyone to place the money!
"For what it's worth, OP, I think if your girlfriend were the one posting this, a lot of people (not all) would be more sympathetic to your plight; it's why people recommend you don't complain about fights with your SO to family, since you'll get over it, but the family member is less likely to. 

This guy treated your girlfriend badly—of course you're still upset about that. My wife's' college roommate used to say really shitty stuff to my wife in order to hurt her (my wife's) self-esteem. She's since apologized to my wife and explained that she was in a not great place and was taking it out on my wife in order to make herself feel better; the roommate's been in a fine place for 20 years and she and my wife get along great. Super. I still don't like the roommate because I can't forget how she purposely made the woman I love feel terrible. Fortunately, she lives on the other side of the country and I think they've only seen each other once in the past 20 years, so it's easy. 

In your case, this guy's in your social circle. Add in the fact that you never really liked him and sex is involved and of course you've got strong and negative feelings. I get it. 

But there are only a few options. Break up if you can't get over this. Continue to limit the amount of contract the two of you have with this guy, but do it in a more casual manner, without any passive-aggressive comments. Or figure out a way to get over it entirely. None of them are ideal, but there's really no other way around it. "
"&gt; tell you about 10+ women I've met in my life that's never gotten into any physical alterations, 

Or maybe you aren't trustable to tell those stories to. "
It is creepy. You're receiving a bunch of awful advice here. Just ignore it and go with your gut.
"You could have revealed this before the service, with the goal to honor that wish.  

Now with the service over, what would be the goal to reveal that? I could certainly see you mention it in a conversation, if one of your aunts comments how bad they treated her and you reply that she did not even want them at the funeral.  

That said, I don't think it matters that they live for drama and gossip. Things are different when it is gossip about them, that does not cast them in a good light."
"It’s fine. Women should passively accept when a guy grabs them and stops them from leaving. Wouldn’t want to risk hurting the feelings, or shins, of the guy intimidating and grabbing women! He was probably such a nice guy."
"You're blaming this on your past relationship with your ex, when it actually has no bearing. Unless your ex cheated, or was emotionally manipulative, I don't see how it's related at all to your current fears.

I think it's unlikely to be because your ""last relationship ended abruptly"" and more because you have deep-rooted anxieties that you need to explore more regarding relationship-status overall. Maybe you should go see a personal therapist? 

Do you feel like you need to be in a relationship? If you're not in a relationship, how do you feel? Do you feel secure, or do you feel a drive to get out into the dating world? When your ex broke up with you, did you fear that it was a reflection on your worth as a person? On your worth as a partner? 

What do you want to get out of a relationship (any relationship?) or out of dating? Are you in it for commitment? Is there an end goal you'd like to achieve in all/any relationships? Or is the fact you're in a relationship a good enough goal?

Shot in the dark (because obviously only going by bare info of post - but taking the shot regardless!) : I think you have a lot of expectations of dating, and view being in a relationship as an end goal in itself. Meaning, instead of a ""*I need to know more about this person and judge whether or not they're right for ME. If they are right for me, I want to commit to them and vice versa. I can achieve this by using a technique called dating*"" mindset, you're more on a  *""I'm dating, so I need to know more about this person and feel a sense of security""*. 

It's a small difference, but basically it's like you put the dating/relationship as the main goal in itself, as opposed to a means to an end that you define. My hunch is formed because your first relationship was almost forced. It was good on your guy to recognize that you were incompatible as life partners, but it is worth asking yourself why you would have stayed in a relationship where you were incompatible life partners - is it just to stay in a relationship for the sake of being in a relationship? What was the end goal you had in mind at that time, and what's the end goal you have in mind now? 

Not every relationship needs to be stable, or happy, for it to be successful. Dating is a process to find what you really want and need in a partner later. This means that sometimes, it's ok to end them or for them to naturally fade or for them to be unhappy or unstable or unsuccessful - as long as we're learning from them each time. 

The act of being in a relationship itself shouldn't make you happy or secure. It's the other person being compatible with you that should make you happy or secure. 

Again, shot in dark, but I do think you may have an innate fear of being single/not being in a relationship - so you get anxious. This explains why you didn't have it with your ex, and why you have it now - your anxiety is over the relationship, any relationship, potentially ENDING, even if it could be for good reasons. So the question becomes, why does it matter to you if the relationship ends? What self-values have you tied to the status of ""being in a relationship""? Etc"
"It’s incredibly selfish to stick him with the bills of the wedding, with a front of “he pushed to get married”. Last I checked, you have to say yes to such a proposal.

What ever happened to communication? You blindsided him and literally everyone, and I didn’t see any part of your post where you communicated any of those issues with your partner. I’m glad you’re doing what is best for your happiness, but I’m not shocked a lot of people think you are the bad guy here. "

Ultimately, your hook up taught you that you are an attractive, desirable person. You can find someone who won't treat you the way your ex did. It's worth holding out for that person."
She gave two instances where she had done tons of research and showed a great interest in getting these things herself.  That's not a pattern of control.

And as I said, I don't know your girl and her feelings...  but I can confirm that night in, night out, dancers are pretending to like it when the customer touches them. Sometimes it's nice. 99 percent of the time, you're pretending it's nice so that he spends more. I have pretended that I find a customer so attractive that I feel really shy around him and am lost for words. I've pretended that their back massages are great, their jokes are funny, they smell great, their stories are interesting, they're super-handsome and I'd love to go home and have wild sex with them, but I just don't know them well enough... yet lmao. That's the job. We all do it - the good ones anyway. If someone makes you feel amazing in a strip club, chances are that you're lucky, you found a great operator and you should be grateful.

Maybe your girl likes you. Or she might like you as a person, but still see you as a customer and just doesn't want to continue outside the club.

Hit me like a tonne of bricks and made me feel so invaded and like the whole thing wasn’t an issue. To be honest I still haven’t found a good way to deal with it, still creeps me out now. I get paranoid in the bathroom still. And this is the first time I’ve actually said anything about it in a long time. When I asked my mum why she brought it up she replied saying she didn’t realise it was an issue for me. Like I’m being the one making a thing out of nothing. I still don’t think she does think it’s an issue and when I said how much the whole thing hurt she responded with ‘what was I supposed to do’. I would say, to make it explicitly clear that it’s an issue for you- and that you need her to validate that it’s a problem and do something about it. It’s horrible, and not your fault. I hope that it gets sorted and you get the help you need to actually deal with it, because it’s an issue. "

What about the kid’s right to have a close relationship with her father? 
"Remember to value his opinion on the matter and not make him feel like he isn't a partner in the household. You might be severely downplaying your daughter's behavioral issues because you are her mom. He might feel like her manipulation and lies are a much more serious matter and when he goes to correct her or find a solution to the behavioral issues you might be freezing him out.

If you're doing this because she's not ""his"" child then you're making him feel like he's not a part of the family. I have a friend who essentially raised a child since he was 9 years old and his wife froze him out of every important parenting decision because the child wasn't his biologically. He is the most miserably married person I've ever met because the child is now grown, was essentially his, and he never got to instill any of his values on the child. 

If you won't let him discipline or participate in the upbringing of your daughter and she misbehaves it is a lot more serious of an issue than you think when she misbehaves. 

I think you two need couples and family counseling. It is a really difficult family dynamic when there is a child in the home that isn't ""yours"" biologically, you are expected to care for it, but you have no say in how the child is disciplined when they misbehave."

You know him better than me, OP, is it possible that's how he felt and then it came out wrong and spiraled out of control as he failed to really articulate why the moose bothers him?  
  
Personally, I wouldn't consider it a deal breaker if you find that that was the real reason why he was upset. Because it's way less insane than getting upset at the meaning of the moose (which would indicate he has secret crazy jealousy issues or you aren't over your ex subconsciously). "

"I highly recommend hiring a doula if you can--hell, make him pay for it since he won't be a helpful birth coach anymore at this point. A doula will support you, will be your birth coach and advocate when you are in labor, and will ensure that your wishes are followed (including who can and can't be in the room while you are in labor). Many doulas also provide after-birth care at home and you will likely need/want this in the absence of a supportive partner. 

There is a ton of good advice here about getting a lawyer and moving ahead with the divorce, but you need to think about your most urgent need first and that is going to be labor, delivery, and newborn care. Make sure you still have a safe space for that so you are in a better position to navigate the end of your relationship. 

Also, fuck your husband for putting you in this position while you are 8 months pregnant. I am 4 weeks away from giving birth and I can't imagine what you are going through. Be gentle with yourself. You don't deserve this. "
She's jealous that she's not engaged and is trying to bring you and your happiness down. Don't talk to her as much and definitely put her on an information diet. 
It sounds like your roommate just reiterated exactly what you already heard your boyfriend say. 
"You've hit the nail on the head - this is predatory as all hell. She is only just the legal age to consent, he is eight years older than her and friends with her dad. Age gaps aren't necessarily terrible but, at this age, this is a high-schooler with an adult man who has befriended her parents - there is no way this is going to be a healthy or typical relationship that she can chat to her friends about. You need to tell her parents because I can bet almost anything they are not aware this is happening - no parent is going to be all buddy-buddy with the man who is 'dating' their 16 year old daughter. They need to know who they are letting into their home.

I wouldn't bother confronting him because there is nothing he can say that is going to change the situation, you are just going to end up hearing his bullshit rationalizations. I can even tell you what he's going to say: he never intended this to happen, she made all the first moves, she is so much more mature than all the other 16 year olds, there is some terrible family drama and she really needed someone to talk to, he's been going through some bad times and this is so out of character but he loves you, he's going to get counselling. I would just pack up and get out of there or get him out, whichever is easier. He is clearly extremely manipulative - just look at what he's done to this girl and her family - I wouldn't give him the chance to manipulate you too.

Also, 16 years old may be the age of consent, but if she transmitted photos to him or he asked for pics or anything like that in those texts, that's a police matter. "
"To me, considering the nature of the conversation boyfriend was having with roommate while he thought op was asleep, and everything else from the post that boyfriend himself said, it sounds like he runs his mouth to this roommate and thinks he’s a BRO who will back him up. He may be slipping up around roommate a lot more than OP knows, and roommate may have seen some asshole things from boyfriend and is speaking not only from hears things, but things he’s seen. "

"OK, this might not get you your money back, but for $20 or so, you can get a fingerprint dusting kit from Amazon. Dust the money can and maybe the dresser drawer for prints.  Then get fingerprints from your friends (stealth ways: hand them something ""clean"" like a glass you've wiped down, or a tablet, or anything), and catalog their prints, and look for a match. The dresser drawer having prints isn't super-incriminating, but their prints shouldn't be on the money can unless they're the thief (keep in mind there will be some ""innocent"" prints on it - yours, your grandfather's, whoever handled the can before giving it you, etc). If you find your friend's prints on the can, I think you can accuse them of the theft and ask for the money back, and if they deny, make the accusation public. It might not get the money back, but it could be enough to get them deservedly ostracized from your friend group, or at least make them mad enough to stop associating with you, so you won't have to be subjecting to their stupid thieving presence anymore. It's a little Veronica Mars as far plans go, but why not?"

"Reproductive coercion is uncommon, but it's common enough that if someone starts throwing up red flags you should take precautions"
It also isn’t what ”abusive” is
"I guess the issue is two-fold. What is your stance on parental duties/responsibilities and how do you feel about getting answers?

Some people believe that, no matter what, your parental responsibilities should come first. You say you have no idea what your kids felt, what was going on, that you're not a ""mind reader."" You, as their father they were supposedly close with, could not even fathom a single reason for their reaction? Was their reaction emotional or rational? What was your relationship with your kids like *during* the divorce, not just after? Why would they pull away? Were they scared? Were they being fed lies? If you don't have a single clue, you were not as close to them as you write here. To what degree did you - consciously or not - exert pressure on them because you did not feel ""loved"" enough? An example would be the step-father; of course they're going to get close with him. That's a natural, healthy reaction and a good situation. It makes equal sense you were hurt, but what were you (again potentially subconsciously) exuding? Were your children met with ""I'm so happy my children are getting support and love from a step-father, another role model, and are in a well-adjusted situation"" or were you primarily just focussing on *yourself* and how sad you were? Again; the reaction isn't unreasonable. It's understandable. But as a parent you had a responsibility to your kids in modelling an emotional response. Did you do this before the divorce? during? after?

Even assuming you had aboslutely 100% to do with this entire situation and are completely blameless (which is unlikely; in situations like this, it's often significantly more nuanced than either party could/would admit), were do you stand re: parental responsibility now? Do you believe parents should be rolemodels? Do you believe parents should model emotional maturity, openness, forgiveness? Do you believe parents should support their children? Do you believe parents should stand open and ready for their children, even if those children make mistakes? If children make mistakes, which mistakes are permitted for which you maintain and open and supportive stance, and which mistakes are unforgivable and will end your open and supportive stance? What is the measure by which you judge these mistakes - morality and ethics? Your hurt feelings? 

Reddit is going to give you *their* opinion. Some people are going to feel you should go, no matter what. You're their father and that's your responsibility. They didn't murder anyone; they just reacted emotionally shit, in a difficult situation they did not have the tools to deal with. On the other hand, their reaction wounded you deeply. So some redditors are going to feel you shouldn't go see them because they hurt you so bad. Some redditors will prefer your emotional 'justice' over parental responsibility, and vice versa. I know I certainly have beliefs on how a parent should behave in your place.

The important thing is that *you* know what you want and why. Stop worrying about your feelings towards the letter, or even your kids. Worry about how you want this situation resolved. What is going to make your life happy and fulfilled moving forward? What are *your* priorities and why? The important thing is that you don't regret this. If you go and it sucks, you're hurt for a bit. If you don't go, will you always wonder what could've been? Will you regret it?

What are *your* priorities? What do you believe re: parental duties? What do you believe re: regrets? And don't just think best case scenario. If shit's absolutely worst case scenario, which mistake is worth making?

If you go - for parental duties - will you feel good knowing you put your best foot forward and fulfilled your responsibilities, even if the situation remains tense and unfulfilling, and it hurts? If you stay, will you feel good knowing you protected yourself over any (perceived) responsibilities? 

And do you want answers? Even if the situation after the wedding remains unchanged, would a proper talk and explanation from your kids allow you some sort of closure? Would hearing your kids apologise and explain their difficult emotional state and mistakes help you in some way, even if you decide not to forgive them?

Take a good, long look at your priorities. By all means, unpack your feelings, but don't make the decision solely on ""I didn't care about the letter"" and ""I don't love my kids anymore."" Become as self-aware as you possibly can, and please make sure regardless of the decision, that you really process this situation and everything that led up to it, because it doesn't sound like you have. It doesn't have to be therapy, but you need to process it for sure."
"""I’m breastfeeding so have done about 90% of the childcare.""

No. No, no, no. The breastfeeding is literally the only thing the dad can't do. He should be changing diapers, putting the kid to sleep, holding him, burping him, laundry. He should be cooking and cleaning so you can sleep. Even if you sort out the rent situation, he's watching YouTube videos while you take care of a newborn. And you're paying bills while you're not working? Out of your savings, I assume? I am so sorry, but he sounds like a terrible partner. Do you have family or friends who can help? Who is monitoring you for PPD? You need to focus on yourself and a future without him unless he makes some big changes."
That’s a big red flag. You’re his fiancé and he doesn’t want to talk about finances? 
"I might ask if this issue was a symbol of something deeper going on. Maybe you don't realize how often you dip out when there's a baby thing to do? At least ask, because if it really only is about that incident only, then it's a bit silly. But I'd bet that it's about something more. "
"He's struggling to accept that Anna is growing up. I'm 25 now, but when I was 16, my dad acted the same way. It did SERIOUS damage to our relationship. I figured if he was going to freak out about me going on a date or kissing someone, there was no way I could talk to him about anything. My mom sort of stuck up for me, but not enough to make me feel comfortable talking to her either. 

So there I was, a naive 16 year old (I also had never kissed someone until I was well into being 16) learning to date and deal with teenage boys all on my own. It... didn't go well. I wish I could have talked to my parents, or at least my mom, about the heartbreaks of high school dating. But I didn't say anything to them because I knew how my dad would be, and that my mom would be a ""united front"" with him, even if he was wrong. 

Say your husband successfully keeps Anna from interacting with guys, she is presumably going to move out within the next few years, whether for work or for college. You and your husband won't be there to stop her from doing whatever she wants. This is unavoidable. If she doesn't know how to handle herself around guys, there's a much greater chance that some player or ""f-boy"" is going to take advantage of her naivete. 

In short, it's in Anna's best interest to learn dating skills now (saying no when she's uncomfortable doing something, recognizing red flags, how to communicate effectively, etc) AND to be able to go to you guys, who obviously care very much about her well-being, for guidance and support along the way. Your husband's reaction to this play and the idea of his daughter growing up are detrimental to her."

I think you should finalize the divorce. 
"So he tells you *one time* in seven years that he enjoys having sex with you and six sexless months later you're still hanging your hat on his words?

Look at his actions, because that's where the truth lies. This guy doesn't want a sexual relationship with you. The why isn't important. All that matters is that this relationship no longer works. You need to either figure out what needs to happen to make it worth your while to stay with him (an arrangement that allows you to get your needs met elsewhere, for example) or leave so you can find someone with a compatible sex drive."
"So what happened after she made implications? Did you say ""What do you mean?"" because that seems like it would answer a lot of your questions here. Just talk to your wife about her concerns. "

"These things always seem tricky because you want to tip toe around the transition. It’s okay for your conflict to be about the transition: that’s not what you signed up for when you started dating and it’s okay to not be okay with it for the relationship. 

I think you need to sit down and have a real discussion about the big issues here. If you wanted to live together sooner rather than later you need to say that. If you want to have biological children you have to say that. It is OKAY to say you want to be in a relationship with a man at this junction in your life. 

It is natural to mourn the person your partner was before a transition. That’s common and you shouldn’t feel guilty do it. 

Your partner has a right to know how you are feeling and you have a right to feel it. You’ll only hurt her more later if you don’t at-least discuss your feelings. "
"Find a good lawyer. Credit card debt wracked up in a marriage, doesn't matter whose name the card is under, is usually considered community debt and both spouses will be equally liable. However, there can be loop holes. Most debt in a marriage goes towards benefiting both partners, thus it is considered  community. However In this case the debt only benefited your husband. And if proven in court the judge may deem this debt as not community. Thus only your husband would be liable. "
"I recommend you tell J the next time you hear P express suicidal thoughts you will call the local non-emergency police number and request a wellness check for P, because you have tried everything else and you want him to get the help he needs. If he makes a threat that feels like an emergency (“I’m going to kill myself now”) then you will call 911 or the equivalent emergency number where you live. Hopefully your husband will support this decision.

Alternatively you can drive P to an appropriate place and ask him to check himself in for an evaluation, but he can refuse to get out of the car. 

I had an ex who made repeated threats to kill himself, some vague, some blatant, and I spent many months running to his side to make sure he was OK even though we were no longer dating.

Finally, after I drove to his place in a bathrobe with my wet hair wrapped up in a towel (he left a suicide threat in our open text chat while I was in the shower and didn’t pick up when I called), I warned him if did that again I would have to call 911. BTW, I found him laughing and smoking in the garage with a friend. He said it would never happen again, he will just kill himself instead of warning me. Well, a couple weeks later, drama escalated and he swore he would kill himself that day, told me how, and I called 911. A short time later a deputy called me back to ask a few sensible questions about the situation he was about to involve himself in.

I never saw my ex again, but not because he died. Whatever the police did for him, or said to him, made him realize he couldn’t manipulate me anymore with suicide threats. (I specifically told the deputy I never wanted to see my ex again, so that likely influenced what they said to him and led to the happy No Contact result.) "
"&gt;This lady sounds like the kind of mom

Whoa, you think OP is the mom? Did they make that clear somewhere?

"Ah yes, the classic ""No one should ever leave a relationship ever!"" advice that's just as much a stereotype of this sub as the break up advice. No matter how jealous, mean, entitled, controlling or manipulative a person is, and no matter how much they refuse to see anything wrong with their behaviour and take responsibility for changing it, their partner should never, ever consider leaving them. Shitty people must *never* experience the consequences of being a shitty person. Sorry dear, but you're doing that thing where you're pretending there are only two options; either put up with a selfish, manipulative, entitled ass or else that must mean you're unreasonable and looking for an unrealistic, perfect saint. There's a whole healthy middle ground between those two that people who identify with the shitty partners in these stories like to pretend doesn't exist. Yes, what this shows about his character is break up worthy. It's not on anyone to stay in a relationship with someone like this to help ""transform them into the person they were meant to be."" Jealousy, entitlement and selfishness are signs of someone to be avoided, not signs of a project you need to take on and the only people who think otherwise are the ones who identify with selfish, jealous people. And a relationship is about two decent people growing together and taking responsibility for themselves to become better. ""Growing together"" doesn't mean one person trying to redeem someone who's shown some pretty serious character flaws that need to be weeded out. People who don't want to be dumped for being selfish and jealous need to improve themselves to stop being selfish and jealous rather than using their favourite tactic which is to try to manipulate their partner and other people into believing anyone who leaves them or a partner they identify with is somehow the problem."

"Agreed! I don't know how more commenters haven't mentioned this. /u/JazzyMas this will definitely cause him to spiral, based on what you've said.

Think about 10 years from now, if your younger son graduates from this school with honors/an amazing job/graduate school lined up/etc., how will your older son be?

Someone who already actively tried to harm you will not be dealing with a moral wall to stop them from just out right attacking you.  They hire someone to curse you and they can just as easily hire someone to physically hurt you or do it themselves. 

I think you need to take this more seriously honestly.  Those who believe in that are not stable to begin with and show they will pay money and go out of their way to cause you harm."

"I wanted to echo this. I also think you should be cautious about just assuming that your relationship with your grandmother wasn't that strong because she apparently disowned you. The fact is, you have no idea what your parents told her. You may not think they'd lie and make up crazy things about you, but I'm betting you didn't think they would intentionally betray your trust for petty retribution over something that was none of their business, either. (Although I agree with the commenter above, I think they did this to hurt both of you.) Most people don't believe that parents would say anything negative about their children if they could help it, let alone things that might not even be true. If I were in your position, and you really did have a good relationship with your grandmother, I would go to her home and meet with her. Explain the situation and see if you can work things out face to face. By not confronting the issue, you risk a permanent rift between you, over a complete misunderstanding, or potentially a fabrication. I would also let all of your cousins and other relatives know what's going on. There's probably more to this than you know, and it's important to get out in front of it. Don't let your parents control the narrative. I'm sorry that this is happening to you. "

"It seems from your other comments that her family is don't expect much from each other. Perhaps this worldview of hers stems from having a very independent, or very untrustworthy, family. What you might see as ""having a good relationship"" with your parents, may be seen by her as ""friendly strangers."" It isn't anything against them, and everything to do with how each of you view what being 'family' means. 

Perhaps to her family, no one asks for anything because it's expected that they would pay for it. 

Another possibility to consider, if your parents do stay there with your wife's blessing, how soon would you be able to check on the house? Perhaps her asking for money is to ensure that if anything happens (parents forget to lock door behind them or leave a window cracked), then at least you have some measure of protection against the results. 

I don't entirely agree with people here who say she's being unreasonable. It makes sense, from her perspective. You should just bring your concerns to her and ask why she's so against it.

On the other hand, her argument that ""no one but us should stay in our home"" seems to indicate that there has been some bad experiences in similar situations in the past. Really just talk about it with her. No one is so strongly against something without a reason to be."

So all that matters is making the best life for yourself that you can, surrounded with people who genuinely love you and support you. "
"No, absolutely not. Not to be used, *ever*. "
"Yep, he probably was.

Sadly, this is part of the reason it's unadvisable for college students in a relationship to live together/cohabitate rather than live with roommates. If this was a roommates situation, she could list an open room on Craigslist. Instead, she's stuck with an apartment that she cannot afford on her own but works only for a couple, and with most of her time outside school monopolized by her boyfriend she now doesn't have close friends to fall back on.

Best for OP to check with her campus housing *and* scour Craigslist for roommate wanted ads in her budget. Don't help her Ex pack and see how much of the furniture she can sell. Once she is no longer homeless, OP should focus on healing and her schoolwork. Prioritize her leisure time spend cultivating healthy friendships over dating again."
"&gt; My wife is a stay at home mom and homemaker.

No, she's not. She's a graduate student. Make your own fucking dinner."
"&gt; Some people after being cheated on are hopeless.

Yeah. Being cheated on is incredibly hard and you have to come to terms with the fact that you cannot fully know what is going on in another person's mind.

But it is never an excuse to treat a future partner badly. While it is super unfair to be cheated on, and the cheated on partner is a victim, you actually do have to work on yourself to recover from it, not let it rule your future relationships and hurt innocent people. The same way that any other sad event or trauma from your past is not an excuse to mistreat people. I wish more people understood this."

They absolutely need to get a divorce. And your mom is going to be in for one hell of a rude awakening when she finds out that no judge is going to award YOU a single thing in a divorce between them just so your dad can't have it. 

Here's a tip - don't accept ANY financial gifts from your mother at all. Don't sign ANYTHING if she asks you to without looking over it very carefully. It sounds like she is going to try and hide assets or get rid of them out of sheer spite, and family court judges will see right through that shit. And then you WILL be dragged into this whether you want to be or not. Don't help your mom commit fraud. "
"Exactly. There's this weird idea here that women should be used as experiments to redeem men and see if an abusive man has *really* changed and his right to a second chance takes priority to her right to decide whether she wants to be the one to take the risk to be used for this experiment. How generous of other people to wail about ""second chances"" when they're not the one taking the risk if it all goes wrong."

Can confirm.

My dad was out of work for a while from a very specialized area (due to his time in the military).  Consequently, also due to his time in the military, he qualified for a grant to go back to school and become a nurse.  He had a job waiting when he finished his CNA, had an in-home care job lined up when he didn't like his prior manager, and is nearly done with his RN and will make another leap to better pay when he's done.

"As someone who has been your brother - elder brother to two sisters and parents who are not nice people, and becoming a pseudo-parent/actual parent - I can tell you this will be hard.

Personally, I sacrificed everything for my sisters, including my at the time almost fiancée - I never proposed because I didn’t want to drag her into a life of being a parent so young like me. Anyway, I sucommbed to addiction - alcohol and drugs. I would have died at a younger age than your brother, but one thing motivated me - what would my sisters do without me?

I was tired of taking care of them, being the one they depended on, and sacrificing everything for them. I hated that I was living just to take care of them. Then my baby sister, the one in your position (the middle child) told me she was scared. She was scared of me dying, not because she still needed me to take care of her, but scared that I would never find the happiness I deserved.

She told me how grateful she was about everything I did for her and our younger sister, and then told me it was my turn to be taken care of. She helped me get past my addiction - always answering her phone when I called, spending weekends with me instead of her friends. It took nearly a year, but she helped me recover. She and my youngest sister also showed me they were capable of taking care of themselves too.

It took awhile, but both of them showed me they would be okay and that they didn’t need me to be their dad anymore - I could focus on my life, and find my own happiness, and that nothing was ups make them happier than to see me happy after everything we went through.

I don’t have a definite answer for you, but if you talk with your brother and show him what my sister showed me, you may be able to reach him. And be there for him. Set up dinners with each other multiple times a week and make healthy dinners (hell, maybe teach him about some dishes he can make), and let him know you want him to live so he can find his happily ever after."
"&gt; That means that, if it is indeed an STD, I must have gotten it from her...and that means she must have gotten it from someone else.

That's probably true

&gt;""There is a chance that I have herpes and the only way that could have happened is if you cheated on me.""

This isn't true.  She could have gotten it without ever knowing it and never had an outbreak.  Most doctors don't do Herpes tests as part of the standard STD/STI tests, you have to ask for it specifically.

Or it might not be herpes - you haven't gotten the test back yet.

Definitely tell her that you're concerned about herpes, go with her and both of you get tested, and don't accuse her of cheating without more evidence.

If she accuses you of cheating and breaks up with you, then you're dodging a bullet."
Your (step)father sounds completely checked out of this relationship. He also seems like the kind of guy who after the divorce will wash his hands of you and never speak to you again. This relationship is over and no amount of fretting over small annoyances like him not telling where he is going to help it. You need to instead prepare for what to do without his income. 
"They attending doctor said bad luck, but husband and I have questions regarding the doctor who performed my hysterectomy. He seemed competent enough before, but he did dumb things after. 

His appt notes after my surgery said I have a normal sized uterus. They also made me take a pregnancy test after all of it was removed.  That was crazy. He also asked me if I planned to have more kids after everything was said and done. 

Husband and I think maybe something wasn't done right during the hysterectomy that resulted in the ovarian torsion. Both attending doctor and family doctor said there was no way to prove it, so it didn't matter. 

We'll never know for sure. Abscesses are no party either. I hope you recover quickly. Cheers.  "

I had a couple acquaintances as plus ones at my wedding that I absolutely would’ve invited if I had the means to invite everyone I knew. I’ve been to a lot of weddings and this is so common. It’s never been an issue as far a small I know.
"Yes, I’ve spoken directly with her about this. She’s somewhat understanding, but usually I just get “tough love” about how I need to take responsibility for my own life and feelings. Which I mostly agree with, but on the other hand she can be pretty needy too, and when she is, she definitely expects me to be there to help her. I don’t really think there is anything fundamentally bad about how she treats me, it’s just the disconnect between that and the way she expects me to treat her that upsets me.

As far as the baggage...it’s too much to get into here, but it’s mostly a pattern of her prioritizing her life over mine. She has a great, professional job and consequently I’ve gotten stuck with more parenting than I expected, and it’s had professional consequences for me, including her discouraging me from accepting a job I really wanted a few years ago, which I still regret (it was a singular opportunity, that I can’t get back, and it kinda haunts me). 

Also, there is some baggage about sex, though not really infinitely, but kinda feels like it—we are not totally monogamous (which I’m reluctant to discuss here, because I know it’s a can of worms on this sub) and there have been some important moments when she’s expected, and gotten, support from me about deepening other relationships. But then when the shoe has been on the other foot, she’s been unable to be generous and supportive to me, and has asked me to cut off other relationships to protect her feelings. In a vacuum, all these moments are fine—I was genuinely glad to support her, and it’s totally fine for her to ask me to prioritize us, when feelings are hard...but the imbalance in support and sacrifice for each other really bothered me, and even though it was a couple years ago, I’m not over it. 

We can and do talk about these things. And when conversation is good, she’s understanding and kind. But it never seems to translate into actual change. It often feels like my only options are to either get upset and fight about it, or be passive and accept it. I can’t figure out how to change it, and when I ask her to help change it, she either gets upset, or tells me it’s my responsibility."

They aren't. Really. But you've come to an age where parents and children can realize that they're just not going to be friends. You're old enough that they're taking your actions personal. 


&gt;if they want to be angry thats fine but they dont need to completely ignore me.


They are treating you more like an adult. Getting angry with you isn't helping. They tried that camp and you sabotaged that, they probably just decided their parental powers have pretty much ended. 



They still love you, it'll turn around. But try and connect a bit more with them like an adult. You can't go against them heavily in something and then expect to be treated as a kid with unconditional affection. 


Also, if you're really morbidly obese they're probably panicking a bit in that they can't help you. "

"Anyone who is employed in a service industry (and stipping does qualify), has to appear friendly, polite and receptive.  For a stripper it goes a bit further- they're supposed to be alluring, flirty and interested.  *Not* doing all that may mean they're fired or they don't make rent.

This girl does seem interested in you.  That said, she was giving pretty clear language that she's not interested in a relationship beyond friendship at this point.  Perhaps she wants to be certain you want her and not the private dances.  If you're really interested in her, mixing professional and private life isn't a good idea.  It would probably help if you stop seeing her in a professional capacity.  Meet away from the club and don't make out until you both agree to be more than friends.  Be equals and don't pay her way.  You also need to accept that she wants to build a friendship, or perhaps more trust, first.

At this point, you have a choice.  You can get to know her outside of the club and perhaps something more will develop.  To do that you need to listen when she says what she wants.  Then enforce boundaries for both your sake.  I think it would also be wise to consider that even if you get together, she probably won't stop stripping.  Can you handle that?"

ED isn't uncommon even in younger men and can be caused by a hormonal imbalance or something else physical, not a lack of desire for sex.  (He could also just not be that into sex, but that also can be a hormonal issue if it's abnormal for him.)

Assuming it is emotional, well, ask him to explain what you're doing that he interprets as ""pulling away.""  Also, even if you're not a fan of initiating, do it anyway.  I know, initiating when you're not horny in the moment is kind of awkward.  Lord have I ever been there.  But I find that I get there after a while, even if I don't initially feel like it.

"&gt; I more want her to promise she'll listen to me in the future if I point out when she's had enough 

That's the issue. She **can't** promise that. It's clear that alcohol has an *extreme* affect on her. 

Is your wife the kind of person to offer tittyfucks in public when she's sober? Does she go out pretending to be a prostitute when sober? I'm going to guess not. You are not her babysitter, nor should you be. So how can you (or she) ensure she never drinks beyond her control when alcohol affects her by destroying her self-control?

She needs to swear off alcohol entirely. It doesn't matter that she can have 1-2 or more drinks without going nuts. As you say, she's only ever a few drinks away from trying to fuck a stranger in public. 

&gt; ""TITTIES! Free titty show! Tits anyone???"" then ""tits on a platter, fresh hot titties!""

&gt; I also remember her asking a mutual friend if he wanted a tittyfuck!

"&gt; If you have record of her cheating, you get all the money!

This belief is surprisingly widespread and mostly incorrect, at least in the US. Just because someone cheats in a marriage does not entitle the cheated-on gets the cheater's share of the assets. She will get half of the marital assets, which most likely includes most of their things and savings. Cheating does not have any bearing on that. What's hers is hers, and in marriage that is half of the marital assets unless they had a strong prenup.

My friend's wife cheated on him and he was saving all the evidence so that he would ""get the house, the equity, and money"" and I had to gently tell him that it doesn't work like that. He didn't believe me until his lawyer was like ""lmao that's not happening"" and they quickly settled out of court with an equal split of all assets right down the middle. 

I say mostly incorrect because if a cheating spouse spent marital assets on the affair... like paying for hotel rooms, or going on trips, a judge can take that into account and deduct that amount from the cheater's share of the assets. Judges can also take cheating into account when assigning alimony, if any. So OP should save all evidence for those reasons.

"I definitely agree about talking about this when you aren't having sex.  My guess is that your boyfriend probably takes it less seriously when you say it during sex (in a, ""yeah, she's just saying that, but of course she wants me to keep going down on her"" way or something).  It's a pretty quickly formed thought.  If you tell him in a more sober situation, y'all can talk through it.  And, he'll have some time to think about/internalize what you said before you have sex again.

Edit: changed tense"
"This is both jealous, and controlling. You invited yourself to a group of people going out, and when they said no, you got upset. I'm going to be blunt - that's just plain stupid. I understand you want to hang out with your friends and boyfriend, but you set yourself up for this one. If you really wanted to go you could have driven, or someone could have brought another car. And if that is the only car, then tough luck, you better find something else to do.

You navigate this by realizing you can't legally sit in the trunk on this trip, so there was no other choice. You also navigate this by realizing your boyfriend needs to socialize with people besides you."
"Yup!

I'd add, you could go for full on ""gross her out/embarrass her"" and say ""Why are you always asking about our sex life? It's so gross!

If you don't stop basically asking how often we have sex it's going to ruin both our moods and we'll NEVER have kids!""

"Maybe this is a cultural difference but in my group of friends (men and women,) the default is not that strip clubs are fine for monogamous people until told otherwise.

Now, a lot of guys go temporarily insane when kids come into the picture. For a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with you.

It's not that weight and physical attractiveness don't have an impact on desire, but based on what you have wtitten, it is likely not the main culprit.

What can you do about it?

Set clear boundaries and keep your side of the street clean emotionally.  You need counseling yesterday to figure out how to do this effectively without going crazy.

Pandering to him and trying to make it easier is likely to seriously backfire as it will push you further into the mommy/caretaker role-NOT sexy.

The marriages that I have seen survive this were where the wife did not back down, but did what she could and required decent behavior.

You can't make him step up to being the Dad and partner he should be.  And many times this is exactly what is fueling the cheaty behavior-they can't handle the changes in their life so they are subconsciously trying to blow it all up.  But you can keep from enabling-which never goes well.

But be clear-in his mind he has already told you the relationship is dead.  

Not that it really is, but he is sure trying that reality on for size. But he may think in his mind that he has told you its ovr, so its ok in his mind, to start a relationship with someone else. 

Keep an eye out for hyper critical behavior of you. That is one of the main things cheaters do to justify their behavior-make it seem like you were just so awful that he was justified in leaving you.

None of this is conscious.  

Settung good boundaries can help make it conscious.

Of course, if you obsess on this, and indulge in regular fantasies about ""how wonderful your life could be right now"" you are completely capable of thinking yourself right into an unhappy marriage and eventual divorce.  **And make sure you stop following your ex on social media.**

Also, at 31 years old, unless your husband's skill set is VERY specialized, he probably doesn't have as much leverage as you both might suppose. (8-10 years of experience just isn't that much)  If he had been unjustly fired, it would be fair to ask for a raise, or if he's being brought back with the expectation that he will take his former bosses responsibilities; but given the stress his employment issue has put on your relationship, holding out or risking the position to try for a raise seems pretty silly."
"What are the differences that upset you or you think you can find better of in someone else? 

This kind of sounds like a grass is greener situation to me. 

When I was 22 I broke up with my fiance because of some some reasons I built up in my head to be big and bad. He and I dated for 5 years and never fought, we complimented eachother well and had enough of the same interests that it made me happy. I legit built it up in my head that I can't spend my life with him because we like different genres of anime and he isn't crazy about my favorite band. Like I wanted to dump him because he wouldn't get a tattoo of a band that I got. I was just searching for reasons to kamikaze the relationship, and I did. 

After breaking up with him I met a guy that had the same top 3 favorite bands as me (we met at a concert) and I decided he was my soul mate. That's what I was looking for right?! It took me a week to fucking hate him because he was an awful human, and when I ceased contact with him he threatened me with a gun, and he got a tattoo to match mine with my name on it. 1 fucking week. 

So the grass wasn't greener on that front. Okay. Well still my ex wanted to spend *too much** time with me, why can't he have his own hobbies?! I need me time. I dated a guy for a year that could give a shit about me. We fought every single weekend and whenever I wanted to break up because of it he suddenly loved me soooo much and would drive to my house and text me incessantly until I gave in. He stalked me and my mom when I left him for god and he threatened to kill himself on my porch.

I thought about my ex wantonly and cried over him for 3 fucking years. These guys I met after him that had what he lacked were just trash. 

I realized that I wanted to date someone with similar qualities to my ex. It took me 3. Fucking. Year. Of being miserable to realize I threw away a really good and happy and healthy relationship. 

On the bright side I met someone who I love more than anyone I've met. He doesn't like the same music as me and he's not a huge fan of going out like I am, but underneath all the shallow things he's exactly perfect for me. We fit like a puzzle peice. 

So on one hand I fucked up my breaking up with my ex, on the other it made me learn to appreciate the good things and not harp on the surface level bullshit, and it freed me up to meet someone I plan to marry. 

So, do what you need to do, but you might have a really hard time dating. Finding a compatible person in the cesspool of single people is hard.

"This is really strange, then. Is it possible she knows something about him that you don't?"
A hysterectomy doesn’t put you into menopause unless they also take out your ovaries (which they aren’t supposed to).
"I insisted we use condoms and we even tried at first but he insists, and showed from multiple attempts that he struggles with using them. He says it kills the intimacy. I wanted to keep trying but he gave up quickly and said he didn't want to use them."
No it’s not. Firing someone for sleeping with a previous boss is absolutely legal.
"This post had me absolutely sick with dread!! You deserve so much better than this. Your fiance straight up has another girlfriend! If I were you I would have a come to Jesus talk with him, either her or you. Probably before the work trip if possible, because you're going to be miserable for 8 days if not. He needs to know it's hurtful that he would share your special things with another woman. If he can't see that he's being a real toad, then he needs to go."
Because it will happen again. He will hurt you worse if you stay. Most men don't do this. Leave this guy and find a nice one who doesn't hurt you. You think it would be hard to leave? It'll be harder to leave if he puts you in a wheelchair.
"Your the only person here making it difficult. Tell him the truth. If it is meant to be he will stay with you if not then you know that in the future you shouldn't base your relationships on a lie. 

"
"This right here. When every I had a guy pal, I ALWAYS made sure I did stuff with the girlfriend too! Had our nails done, catch some lunch, and so on. Also....I would have NEVER used her clubs! I would have rented some at the course. But that's just me. "
"Exactly. If she was already a golfer and had all her own stuff, it would possibly be different!"
Yeah I've gotta say when you said he  has no friends and you work 70 hours a week that's a big red flag. He relies on you for social support and interaction and you haven't been around. He probably feels lonely and neglected and that's a big driving force for people starting to have affairs. He should have talked to you about that.

"This happened to me too, and I was a bridesmaid! Maid of Honour was supposed to be organising and everyone, myself included thought she had it under control.

Another friend of the brides and MoH realised nothing had been done and planned the hen party secretly to help the MoH save face. Forgot to invite me until the last minute!

I totally get why your feelings are hurt and what you’re feeling is valid. But like others have said, go to the party and see how it is.

"I've been in something similar and haven't been able to fix it yet.

I've been cheated on after 8 years together. It lasted the four last months of my pregnancy for our first and only child so far.I was completely lost as I knew what he was doing and he wouldn't stop. It ended a few days after our daughter was born. He quit his job too and stopped contacts with her.

I've chosen to forgive him because I love him and I wanted my daughter to be raised with both parents. But what I can telle you is that I haven't been able to respect him like I used to before. I'm still working on it though but it's been two years ago and not much has changed even though he's been doing the best he could with me.

Also I can understand how you want to flirt back. It's easy to think that as he cheated you've the right to do the same and show him how it feels. I've been fighting this since too and it's not realy easy.

I would also advise you to let things go and move on if you have the possibility. "
"A good friend of ours husband got drunk and punched my husband in the face.

He was banned from our home and we no longer hung out with them. That was three years ago.

I don't care if it's family or not. If someone resorts to violence, it's a dealbreaker and he should be ostracized.

You have to tell your husband about the assault. "
"Sorry but it is conscience, the inner feeling, conscious, aware and not in coma."
Exactly!! Like if you consider the whole thing a shackle why are you doing it? Your spouse should be your partner in crime / adventure / life. That’s why I feel strongly that OP should share the info. I get that not everyone sees marriage like I do but you should know the character of the person you’re marrying. And character should be the same regardless of the audience. 
THIS. Uncertainty can be torture. It's best to just go ahead and rip the bandage off. I know I wouldn't want to be deceived about something like this.
"Sue your mother and your brother, then never speak to them again."
"I'd recommend to continue spending time with her as a friend. 

Try to forget that you think she's attractive and focus on building a friendship and getting to know her. 

If it leads to something more than friendship based on mutual interest then you not only gain a friend you gain a companion, if it doesn't you've still made an very valuable friendship with someone who understands you so well. "
"&gt; Why sink your time and resources into someone closer to their expiration date?

Because in ten years she's going to wake up and wonder why she's married to some old asshole and file for divorce."
She has colleagues that can step in. Animals in tanks and cages are very different than dogs and cats in terms of how much the whole family has to be involved.

"You realize that fighting is basically THE problem in a marriage, right? I mean, there are a whole lot of awful marriages that could be described as ""good marriages except for the fighting.""

You have my best wishes and I hope counseling will help resolve your issues, but if it doesn't, please don't sacrifice years of your life delaying an inevitable split because you can't accept you made a mistake or want to prove something. Those are bad reasons to stay in a marriage, wouldn't you agree? Stay in a marriage because it makes you happy - not just the good parts, but overall. That's what's important. 

"
Me and and ex of mine were together for 6 years. Saw her boobs plenty of times. Never got tired of it. Never will get tired of it. I would donate a testicle to see them again. (not really but I made my point clear)
"I thought you were over reacting until I got to the part about him 'getting offended because you would need to get to know eachother before you jump back into a relationship with someone you 'dated' when you were 6' and the 'looking for you for years' part. Run forest, run. "
"Yeah, you definitely overreacted.

Federal law defines child pornography as any visual depiction of **sexually explicit conduct** involving a minor.

Is a video demonstrating a breast exam pornography? No. Because it's not sexually explicit conduct. It has a medical context.

A photo being taken in a medical context, ie documenting hives, is not pornography. If the kid was posed in some sexual way or photographed doing some sort of sexual act, that is extremely different both legally and ethically. I can't speak to what pedophiles get off on, but I sure as hell can't get aroused to medical images. Can you?

I'm a dad. My wife once received a similar image from a friend, I think to show some kind of complication her son had from a circumcision. She wanted an opinion on if something was wrong. Like another poster said, ""most people don't see their children in a sexual way and don't expect others to either.""

My wife let her friend know that she didn't feel comfortable receiving messages like that, and that was that. We were worried about whether or not that technically put her in possession of child pornography. That's when I looked up the law and found out that photos taken for medical purposes that *didn't involve sexually explicit conduct* were *not* considered child pornography. That was a relief, but we recognized that the mother probably didn't think of the implications there. No sane and normal parent sees their child in a sexual context.

Yeah, it was probably disturbing and inappropriate for work. But if it was indeed child porn wouldn't you have contributed to willfully distributing it by passing it on to someone at HR? That's probably a whole different charge on top of merely possessing it.

In my opinion, going straight to HR was already uncalled for. To say you now want to report him to CPS...do you think maybe you've complicated his life enough already by getting him fired? Now you're going to allege abuse *because a father is concerned with his child's health*? God damn. People like you fucking scare the shit out of me."
"Sounds like he's having an emotion affair with his boss. Sounds like he doesn't respect you and thinks you're ""ONLY"" a stay at home parent and has no idea how tough it truly is.

Why do you want to fix it? What happened with your ex (your child's dad)? Did he disrespect you, too?

I wonder if you have been put down over and over and don't know your self worth. "
I see a therapist currently biweekly but am bumping up to weekly. He is unaware of this as I felt “ashamed” and do it while I am at work on lunch break. 
Not showering in “a couple days” is what would concern me tbh haha
"Who does that?  I mean, I'm sure I tattled on my brother or a Friend when I was like 6 or so, but at 30?

Look, curse words are still just words.  My wife and I tought our kids it's okay to use those words in the appropriate place and situation.  Obviously not at school or towards and adult, but still... I can't get mad if they say 'hell', 'damn', 'ass', or 'fuck' when they use it the right way.

Kids that age hear (and see) way worse with their peers, from YouTube 'celebrities', and whatnot.

Tell the BF to grow the hell up?"
"I'm glad hubby is on your side!

Here's fun: you and hubby can refuse to speak anything but English."
"For the twins to be 4 wouldn’t she have to be pregnant with them while he cheated?

He cheated on his pregnant wife with 3 kids at home. That’s brutal."
"Honestly, I don't understand why anybody above the age of ten is concerned with ""snitching."" You wouldn't be informing her husband in order to cause chaos or start drama, you'd be telling him because you have empathy/compassion and it's the kind/decent thing to do. At the very least, I'd distance myself from A&amp;B as friends, but I don't see any drawbacks to telling him. If y'all aren't hanging out anyway, who cares if she gets mad at you?"
"I should clarify, I'm her step dad. 

No she's not saying I am one... she's saying what I was doing ""could"" get us/me in major trouble and I need to think about these things with everything that I do, and have major lines that don't ever get crossed. 

We've been together for 5 years. 

Basically I'm an idiot as that's way crossing a line.. maybe she's right, maybe she's 30-40% right.. idk. "
"She's threatening a minor. You should tell your parents something at least, even if you say he's just your friend."
Like my ex who would get really comfy with guys when he was drunk but when sober he was Mr. Catholic Faithful. It was kind of sad. But later on he told me all about his escapades with transgender women. 
"You don't need to have given birth at all to empathise with OP here.  I never have, but I can relate to having a painful, vulnerable experience and I can imagine how it would feel if someone I loved and trusted not only joked about it, but mocked me for it to his friends.  It would be devastating and not something I would get over in a hurry.  Maybe not ever.  It would take a lot to make me want to keep someone like that in my life, let alone trust them again.

I really feel for you OP.  I don't have any advice, I just want you to know that you're not overreacting and I think your husband's actions were pretty low, especially since he refused to apologise and basically ran away from the situation like a coward.  Does he often act like this?"
"You would have known if she had a still birth.

She would have been induced if no fetal heart sounds were found on ultrasound. That would have taken hours and her being in hospital.

If it was spontaneous, she would have been in hospital. If the baby died shortly after birth, she would have to register the birth, death and hold a funeral.

Either way, she would have had to deliver the dead baby in hospital. She would have been in at least a day. She may have had vaginal tearing. Even if she didn't she wouldn't have been able to have sex for few weeks. 

I take it none of this happened?

What a sick woman to lie about something like that. "
"This. One of the shittiest things about getting out of abusive situations is how it totally skews your view on relationships afterwards. ""Not abusive"" relationship is not the same as ""loving and happy"" relarionship, but when you've had someone treat you so badly in the past they end up looking the same."
I think that’s a risk worth taking if grandpa is being neglected.

"&gt; He told me that he would be fine with Kal presenting as a butch lesbian

I mean, he doesn't get a say in how other people ""present"" so he can shove his opinion, frankly. I'm baffled as to why he gives a flying fuck about someone else's appearance or gender. Maybe he should learn to mind his own damn business?

I also don't think it's Kal's job to try to talk to him or meet with him and teach him how not to be an opinionated asshole. "
"They love to call your bluff; they know that if you throw them out, you look like the bad guy

that and they just cant believe that their kids arent gods gift to us all and that they enhance any event they grace with their presence"
"You did nothing wrong. 

What's her angle?  That your daughter washing your foot was somehow sexual?  If that's what she's thinking, then that's a projection of her own hang-ups; I can guarantee that if things went down as your described, your daughter will have thought nothing of it other than ""I got stuff on daddy's foot, so I washed it off"".

Or is your fiance's angle something about a girl being subservient to a man?  I'm guessing this isn't it, but I've heard weirder things.  Even if it's this one, it's still off-base; parents are in a position of authority over kids, and that's just part of the dynamic.

Either way, your fiance is making a problem where no problem exists, and if she persists in this, she will end up potentially causing your daughter harm by embedding her own trauma into your daughter's perceptions of the world."
"As someone who is gay too, it is creepy to ask your GF those questions about your ducking cousin.  "
"Yup! Three weeks ago my husband and I had sex 5 days IN A ROW. We usually have sex 2-3 times/week but I was actually into it and initiated it every time and it wasn't just a quickie here and there - we're talking put on something sexy, do all the stuff. It was amazing. Then I got my period AND a stress-induced cold sore (sexy!) and we couldn't really do much for a week. By the end of that week I was like ""meh"" - take it or leave it. We did have sex last night and it was amazing so will try to initiate again tonight to keep the ball rolling. I mean - in my last marriage we didn't have sex for 4 YEARS (yep!) and by the end of it sex was the farthest thing from my mind. Divorced, met my current husband, starting having regular sex and BAM - back in the saddle so to speak."
"I was responding to a comment that is now deleted, but the deleted comment said that because she's slept with 500 women she might actually be gay. "

video of her doing embarrassing things?
"I know, it is utterly appalling behaviour. If I was the wife I would want to know why:

* a. My husband kept this secret from me for a year thus lying by omission and why he didn't shut it down HARD the second it started to happen.
* b. Why this girls feeling were my important than me, our marriage and our family

This is not 'weakness', this is cheating."
"If she miscarried at 5/6 months she'd have to have gone through a procedure, at that stage it's not just cells etc, I had one at 20 weeks and it was not easy and just oh you are bleeding. Also, my milk came in too. You are pretty naive if you believe she forgot she was pregnant and miscarried. "
"Yeah, and yours isn't his. So either get on the same page or write this off. If nothing else look at it this way - what have you got to lose? At the moment this is most likely dead. So what's he going to do, say ""no"" again? OR he might come around and you'll get what you want. But you don't get to half-ass relationships, and it's not his job to hang around waiting while your sort yourself out. Work on yourself *within* a relationship, or fix yourself entirely before getting into one at all. But don't expect him or anyone else to stick around while you try to figure things out. Life's too short."

"I would go to the police. They can help you get the images taken down before your family, friends, co-workers see them, if they haven't already and are too embarrassed to tell you.

Yes! I was editing to add that while you were replying!
"I was definitely thinking the same thing. First question, ok...general curiosity. People wonder similar type things about straight people they know too. 

But he got real specific with it - which leads me to think he is curious. 

I don’t think he’s being necessarily creepy, rude, or malicious. Maybe not even inappropriate (as some people are very open about that kind of thing).

"Just be ready to stop being friends with them. I agree with everything that you said but 90%+ of parents take it very personally when you uninvite Timmy.

"She is being petty and immature. You handled the situation correctly by telling her very transparently and positively that you were planning to correct it elsewhere, and she decided to take this personally. That sucks. 

If I were you, I would reach out to her directly and re-iterate the following:

* you appreciate the work she's done on your hair, and this incident doesn't change that in the slightest.
* your decision to go elsewhere to fix your hair was in no way intended to be a jab at her, you love and care about her but you also love and care about your hair and wanted to get it fixed by a professional. and you thought she understood that.
* you're incredibly hurt by the fact that she's turned this into some drama/rumor and is sharing it with other people. it's not how you hope your best friend would treat you. she is not being fair.
* you would like to meet with her and talk to her about this so you can put it in the past and move on (and so she stops telling people about it)."
"She didn't say she liked it to her friend. She told her what was good about it and what she wanted fixed.

The friend knew she wanted it fixed and wasn't happy with it as is. The friend knew it didn't turn out.

How was she supposed to react? Yell? Get mad or snooty? Called it horrible and blame her friend for ruining her hair? 

Pointing out that her friend didn't completely fail isn't handling it badly."
"I love when relationships offers up these solid legal gems without understanding divorce or even knowing about the couples finances, whose name is on what. But sure, keep talking with that tone of authority parroting those tired tropes. "
"There are some great answers here, tbh, so I'm going to hit on the one that I think is the primary reason you're not getting as many RSVPs as you'd like.

Nobody, except people you're extremely close to, want to come over and just ""chill.""  That is super boring and shows a lack of interest.  This is shit my family and my in-laws pull, and I hate it.  I make my husband bring bocce ball so at least I can do something instead of waste away just listening to boring conversations about anal polyps and Walmart sales.  If someone said, ""Hey, do you want to come over and hang out?"", I would probably decline.  I am very introverted too, so the thought of sitting in a circle and talking is very off-putting, and that's exactly what I picture when I imagine receiving an invitation from you.  You may be a really cool person, but if I didn't know you that well, I wouldn't show up.  Too much anxiety.

And as a fellow introvert, I know hosting a party is really stressful!  So it helps to have a plan.  You say your flat has little more than a computer; if you like gaming, buy one of the Jackbox Party packs so at least you have several games to play (everyone needs a smartphone or tablet or laptop - internet access, basically) without the need for a ton of space.  Or how about you DM a round of D&amp;D (or Shadowrun or Pathfinder) and bring people into your group?  Just do a one-shot to garner interest.  Make it a potluck so you get to eat yummy food too.  If you want to throw the party in the park, tell people what you want to do there: ""I have a set of frisbees for disc golf - anyone down for a match on Saturday?""  Or mini golf.  Or driving ranges.  Or go-karts.  Or find some local trivia competitions and get a team together.  Invite the SOs too.

The best part about what I suggested?  If no one comes to your house party, you're at home and, while maybe disappointed, you haven't wasted a bunch of time or money.  And if no one comes to the park, you've still got your discs and can play a round by yourself.  You won't be standing around looking sad and lonely; you'll look like you've got a purpose.

People like people who exude confidence.  I think people exude confidence more when they have a plan - not just in social situations but in life too.  It'll be tough at first, especially if you're dealing with the same people as before, but I think in time they'll start coming to your events if they have a better grasp of what's in store."

"Can I say, I’m not surprised she’d do shit like that. Your description of why she “apologized” spoke volumes about what kind of person she is. She gave you guys the check because not seeing her grandkids was “killing her,” so she figured she could buy access to the kids back for the price of the car, not giving a single shit about the emotional value of it to your DH. There’s no way she could have had no idea of how important that car was to your DH if he spent so much time on it with his father. It might have also been his escape from her craziness when he was a teenager, so her selling it out from under him was like her saying that he’ll never escape her, ever. Instead, she came over with a check and some half-assed “I didn’t know” excuse because she didn’t like dealing with the consequences of her behavior. I’d bet money that she didn’t have a change of heart and doesn’t have any increase in consideration for your DH’s feelings after the incident. 

Has your DH posted in r/justnomil? There are a lot of people that grew up in the dynamic the way he did, and they’re really supportive. He might just find his people who understand him in that way since they’ve been through the same shit. The lawn tantrum you described isn’t out of the ordinary over there. "

"This sounds less like your husband is into Kal and more like your husband may be questioning his own gender identity and worried about the consequences that would have on his life, particularly with you and your daughter.  Replace Kal with himself in all the questions he is asking: would my wife still be attracted to me? Would I still be attracted to my wife? Would my sexuality change?

It might be that Kal's transition jolted something in him, and his confusion and uncertainty are expressing themselves as anger.  

He needs therapy to deal with this.  If he's refusing therapy and continues to be violently transphobic, I think you'll have to really think seriously about the relationship.  "
"Honestly his behavior is pretty immature, but have you considered he may be depressed  like you said but also other issues? Him being withdrawn, having outbursts at seemingly irrelevant issues, having no motivation. My parents would have to ask me to do things simply because I wouldn't be able to do it without the motivation that they would be angry if I didn't do it.

It sounds like me honestly. I have had the same problems as him. From the outside it seems like you're lazy, worthless, and want to do nothing. But on the inside, its absolute turmoil. I would ask him about this, i would ask him about drugs, mental health, etc. Just in case you could have missed something.

There may be more to this than him just ""being a kid."" I think you are right about the him not knowing what he wants to do thing, though. That's what happened to me as well. Im still stuck in it, although i have some vague idea. It seems like after he had structure of school and then the army, now he's lost and needs that structure. Hopefully you can build a bond with him and understanding that you can be the structure and help him on his path.

The secret is communication. He might be deplorable to you but guaranteed there's things about him you should want to learn in order to help."

"Yeah exactly. They won't take your kid over a freaking nickname, lmao."
"This was smart to point out. Most people are ignoring the actual meaning of the word. That said, threatening OP's wife with CPS seems like an extreme overreaction. The teacher should have tried to get a sense of how the family views the nickname -- ""that dumb kid!"" vs. ""he just loves that cartoon!"" The boy is probably going to grow out of the cartoon and the name before he starts first grade.

OP and his wife may want to request a meeting with the principle."

"Sounds like either a cuckhold or hotwife type situation.  It's not super common, but it's not rare either - plenty of people get off on their partners being desired by and/or experienced by others.   I'd think about if you want a monogamous relationship, and if so talk with him and make sure he knows you will never do that and see if he's okay with that.  This could be a sexual incompatibility that you need to break up over, but not everyone has to explore all their kinks to be happy in a relationship so I'd encourage you to take ""yes"" for an answer if he's willing to commit to a monogamous relationship.

"For some context, given that it was VR Chat, I am guessing it was like an anime girl. Not saying that that is normal, but felt like clarifying it was not necessarily an actual 10 year old."
"I’m totally fine with used stuff. I shop primarily thrift stores, and I get really excited about saving money. If he had found the camera for half the price at a thrift shop I wouldn’t have been as upset. He spent the same amount of money I was trying to save for the one I wanted... but he bought something else."
Yes. Yes it’s break up worthy. 
"Not a popular opinion, but I feel that your spouse should (almost) always take priority over your child.

Without knowing the incident, you sound like you tried to be a good dad, and your daughter ended up being a bit of a brat.

I would try to sit my wife down, possibly in a counselors office, and explain calmly why you kept your daughter's trust, but that you will NEVER do that again. Then I suggest you tell your daughter, in front of your wife, that what she did was unacceptable, and your daughter has now lost YOUR trust, and at no point in the future will you keep secrets from your wife. Could that hurt your relationship with your daughter? Yes. But she has shown SHE can't keep a secret, and it wasn't like it 'slipped out'. Your daughter maliciously used that against you."
"I wish I could offer solid life-tested advice, but I can only offer solidarity and share my situation and perspective.

My boyfriend of 11 years went through something similar last fall with a former coworker that he apparently considered a ""good friend,"" with some differences being that he didn't talk to anyone about his crush, and she had confessed feelings for him before moving to another country. After she moved he re-initiated contact with her via email, which continued for a few months until she found a boyfriend and stopped responding to him.

I've stopped trying to define it as emotional cheating or not; I just call it ""inappropriate,"" and I feel that's enough.

He hid all of it from me; I didn't even know they were ""good friends"" rather than friendly coworkers, but I became suspicious when he started acting distant towards me immediately after she moved. I had also noticed that he had liked every single one of her Instagram photos for the past year, which I thought was significant because he did not like any of his other friends' photos with near that much consistency.

For the next three months he continued to be distant; for a few weeks he wouldn't even say he loved me, and he rarely initiated physically and turned me down a couple of times. He offered no explanation for this on his own, so I tried on a few occasions to talk to him about his change in behavior, and he blamed everything he could think of except for this former coworker. At the end of one conversation, he said he was concerned about me having access to his phone and computer even though there wasn't anything there. I hadn't checked his computer at this point, but after this conversation I was tired of his evasiveness and suspicious answers, so I checked and found that he had exchanged a few emails with her and had been simultaneously browsing porn and her Facebook photos during times when I knew he was in the bathroom masturbating.

I tried to work through my disappointment on my own, and soon my boyfriend got out of his funk and became affectionate again, but the feeling kept returning. I did finally talk to him about it a few months after their contact ended, and as expected he denied and trickle truthed, but I kept pressing. He still wouldn't admit having feelings for her, and I didn't directly out him about the evidence on his computer because I was concerned about him deleting and hiding things better in the future. So I just reiterated that I thought his continued contact with her was inappropriate after she had confessed feelings for him, and that I didn't want him keeping her as some sort of fantasy. I think that hit home enough that he insisted she was not important to him, that she probably wasn't a great friend since she ghosted him after getting a boyfriend, and that he has no interest in getting  back in contact with her. And he has since stopped liking her Instagram photos.

My boyfriend tells me regularly how much he loves me and how happy he is now. I want to just believe him and forget the past year, but it's hard. I still doubt his commitment, do to this situation and the fact that we've been in disagreement about engagement for nearly two years now. I've started taking an SSRI and seeing a therapist to work through this and address underlying issues with anxiety and depression. 

There's a good chance I will have to break up with him in the next few weeks, though I think it will be more to do with the engagement issue than the former coworker issue. I asked in April for a timeline for engagement, and he told me July. So I'll be talking to him again at the end of the month, but if his actions aren't going to match his words then I think I need to move on from all of this.

So I guess what I would say to you is to consider this in context of your relationship issues in December and your relationship in general. Is it all a part of a bigger pattern of communication issues? Is this something you would be willing to work through and improve communication about, perhaps through counselling? Do you think your boyfriend will be receptive to this and pull his weight to improve communication too, or will you have to carry the emotional burden alone? Will you resent him if you have to do that? These are the questions I've been asking myself and working through in therapy, so perhaps you could consider them too."
"Yeah, and sometimes just getting out of the ""background noise"" of a relationship can help you realize it's not working for you. "
"Tell her. If she doesn’t want to marry you, then so be it. I️ wouldn’t want to marry someone who cheated on me either. Marrying her and never telling her will literally eat you alive."
"This isn’t over. CPS involvement takes a while. Even if they clean, allowing animal waste to stay uncleaned for a long time means that smell has leaked into the floorboards. Once the social workers get in, they will be able to smell it. 

You did the right thing. Your brother’s kids are also blood - so you didn’t go against anything. 

You should know that CPS is supposed to try to keep families together if they can. This means parenting classes, cleaning classes and other services that could help them succeed. If your brother and wife don’t agree to services, that’s when CPS may take it to court. 

I know it’s hard and scary - but you did right by those kids. "
"Wow, really dude? Do you really not understand that you can't go around provoking people without consequences? 

You should find another job. She's going to have your ass anyways."

I thought the same thing! But then thought maybe that was a stretch — glad I’m not alone. 
"So you can only have sex in the afternoon or early evening, and you can only move past making out after 20-30 minutes? I’m guessing that after the 20-30 minutes of making out you move on to oral/handjobs/fingering (which *he* has to initiate, or else it’s not okay) before you actually move on to penetrative sex, so if I’m right about that, that means an hour at least ... so he’s limited the time of day when you can have sex, and then you have to be able to commit to 1+ hours or else he gets disinterested and huffy? And he’s complaining when he’s the one who’s applied all these rules to your sex life and isn’t receptive to any effort or change on your behalf? I understand that everyone has a right to their own preferences, but you seem to be trying to bridge the gap and be flexible/move outside of your comfort zone (esp as a submissive person working to initiate) in order to improve your sex life, whereas he seems unwilling to compromise. Has he always been like this, or is it a recent development?"
"I'm not bisexual. I didn't even know what I wanted back then and didn't have much interest in dating in general. I've always been more passive though and struggled to say no when an old friend admitted to having a crush on me and asked me out. Peer pressure from friends didn't help either as they all kept saying we'd be a good fit. 

I did like the guy and we had sex but honestly...Would not try again. I figured out after that relationship that many things felt wrong and that the answer had been right there all along. I just wasn't into guys. I came out as a lesbian senior year in high school. 

I think if we call it bisexuality then we'd be going along with her views that I'm not a true lesbian if I had sex with a guy regardless of circumstances. "
"He’s not whining because they’re his. He’s whining because he isn't attracted to her when she wears his clothes.

FTFY"
Yeah that's a bullshit double standard. He's insecure as hell.
