"First thing, this seems rather silly that everyone is all upset about pictures on a shelf. I think maybe everyone should take a step back and realize that this is not worth such upset and discord.

I'm getting the sense that Marnie has some emotional issues surrounding the fact that she is childless as compared to her siblings. It also seems that she feels some sense of inferiority to her sibling's families that have kids. I think maybe you should consider opening a conversation regarding that. I'm not entirely sure that this is exclusively about the dogs and the pictures..."
"Ok, I have 2 dogs, I consider them my children.
I call my and SO’s siblings and friends “auntie and uncle”.
Our parents are “granny and grandad”.

Even I can see Marnie is nuts and blowing this way out of proportion.

I understand this is hurtful to you but I’d just give her time and space to calm down and regain her senses.
"
"You don't really have many options. Your parents do, but they're refusing to take action and your brother literally doesn't care.  So yes, unfortunately you're left with either move out, convince your parents to evict him, or just deal."
At a guess your mother had reached some sort of breaking point and disappeared to some form of spiritual getaway - many of which are run in parts of South America. She was presumably unhappy. I wouldn't push for details really. Whilst is does concern you if it's something she wishes to keep private from you and your brother then you just have to deal with it. She'll probably tell you all about it years from now.
"Seriously dude most people who are *not* traumatized would not put up with this shit.

&gt;""Hey babe, it hurts when you do x."" He keeps doing the thing. ""Please stop, that still hurts when you do x."" He stops. Starts doing x again a minute later. Repeat.

Yeah nah, there would not *be* a repeat because what that would trigger is a healthy dose of DTMFA.

The guy is being abusive and has the gall to try to make it sound like there is something wrong with you for objecting to it. 

"
"I think you should let her go so she can find someone who doesn't think she's ugly. I would hate to know that my SO thought I was ugly and thought future kids would have no chance..

Breaks my heart just thinking about that. If you don't think she is pretty enough for you now, set her free. "
"&gt;all I want is a little 6k car and that's what I asked him for.

Why are you ""asking"" him about spending your own money?  Did he ""ask"" if he could buy each jacket???? "
"&gt;drop that piece of shit.

heh.."
"&gt;i havent told him so because i dont want to hurt his feelings

Yall really need to work on your communication because this marriage is gonna crash and burn.  "
"Absolutely dump her.  Any adult, who isn't severely disabled, and accepts that much financial support isn't worth your time."
jesus dude save your money
"That i think is what it was, she cant shake the image of me beating up the guy, she specifically said it changed the way she sees me. Now she thinks im some guy who beats people up instead of... idk, cowers in fear? I mean what the hell? lol "
"Aha. You’re in college. That explains everything.

Most guys in college aren’t looking for serious relationships. They’re looking for fuck buddies. It has nothing to do with you or your looks. They play the “hot” girls too.

Wait till you graduate and you will have a much easier time."
"Plus, kids are going to change that entire dynamic. I certainly wouldn't want kids with a woman getting cosmetic surgery like that, at 26. That sounds like all sorts of issues for the kids down the line."
"It is. Stop using an excuse of, ""but these women are hot and I'm not getting any!"" Talk to your wife, get therapy, and find out whether you two are still compatible. If you're going to cheat then end it. Don't be a douche. "
"Your guilt isn’t making you nicer towards your husband. The validation you feel from getting fucked by your boss or putting you in a better mood because you’re insecure.  Stop pretending to be a good person. 

He groomed you?  Are you kidding me?  Your not an 8 year old. 

Fast forward to a year later?! You been messing around for a year! Sounds like you’re just getting tired of your boss’ kinks and your afraid of what he’ll do if you dump him. 

Sorry but you’re not a victim. You a terrible person and you should redeem yourself by doing your husband a favor by telling him the truth. "
Why doesn't he have a job?
"&gt; This guy needs to fuck off into the heart of the sun.

stealing this "
"Beautifully put. Listen to this advice, OP. Everyone here has your back, something your boyfriend should be doing and absolutely isn’t. He’s not worth any more of your time. Find a guy whose values match yours and who isn’t going to want to put you at risk."
"After some looking, me and my best friend found her on Facebook. I think I will message her tomorrow morning (I'm in Australia and it's night right now) in case he's in bed with her and sees my message. I will update once I message her and confront him. "
"You're getting a lot of shit in this thread, which I think is pretty unwarranted, and I think his response makes it pretty clear what's going on. What bullshit. You KNOW if the baby was a boy you wouldn't have a say in the name (and you're fine with that).  You're in the right here. "
"I think your insecurity doesn't stem from more attractive girls exist, but rather how lost you are when you evaluation your own values. You should ask yourself (or your SO) about why you guys are together, why did he choose you in the first place, what does he like about you that led you guys to this relationship in the first place. I feel like once you grow confident of why he likes you, you won't be as insecure. 

Another aspect to this is that we all have to realize that there are better people out there for our SO's. To not concede this point and believe you are absolutely the best deal your SO will ever get is arrogance imo. However, even knowing this, you should not be discouraged because ultimately what you have may not be *the best*, but what you have certainly is *unique*, so don't sell yourself short. "
"You've got good friends and she may try some other antics. 

Don't give in. "
"&gt;I don't understand how he didn't get more details from the conversation. I don't understand how he didn't come to a decision while he was talking with his roommate.

Sometimes people aren't great at thinking on their feet and especially sometimes people aren't great at assessing if a request is reasonable or not in the moment. Establishing boundaries and finding the best ways to communicate in order to resolve issues is a big part of why this sub exists. People come here for relationship advice, that's the whole point and that's why OP is here, what's not to understand?

u/fuzzypickletrader IMO, after having had roommates for 10 years, what your roommate is asking is unreasonable and the way you are using the space is perfectly normal. The correct answer would be to acknowledge her concerns and then gently explain to her that you will continue to use the space in this way but maybe explore if there is some kind of middle ground you can reach. For example, maybe it would help if the roommate received more notice that there will be a guest so that she can prepare herself with everything she needs in her room and not feel trapped, if that's how she feels. In the end though if her introversion/social anxiety is so bad that she can't tolerate you having your girlfriend over so you can do normal things twice a week then she needs to either get her own apartment that she doesn't share with other people or she needs to explore those feelings in therapy. Asking other people to accommodate those kinds of issues at the detriment of the reasonable use of a living space they pay to use is not a reasonable request. Shes not over very often at all, you aren't sexing all over the couch, you don't seem to be making a ton of noise and what she's asking would impede on the reasonable use of your dwelling. You don't need to be mean about it but it's okay to firmly explain that what she's asking is in no way reasonable.  "
"Grow up, after 2 years in a new city, your mentor should not be this emotionally important to you.

Your dependence is way over the professional line, get 
your own friends, and a boyfriend and quit spending so much time with your boss, he is not your surrogate family......do the emotionally work and develop your own connections"
"The anonymity and community aspect of AA means that if someone were to disrespect someone's privacy, it could totally destroy their trust in the sobriety process and the role community plays in it. How can someone expect to be honest and open in AA if the people invited there cannot be trusted with their honesty?"
"Well, she is free to do watever she wants and have her authonomy. But she needs to learn that actions have consequences.



So dump her. You'll be happier and she'll learn an important lesson. Win-win."
It depends what country your in but some doctors actually recommend aborting one of the foetuses because the chances both twins will be born healthy is very high but the odds drop significantly with each additional foetus.  
So she brags about how well she manipulates people... while actively manipulating you. She must be pretty pleased with herself for holding onto her meal ticket this long. 
"To add to this- they should seek family therapy as well. Since her kids are minors, she's responsible for them for a few more years and it would be in everyone's best interest to work through this in as healthy way as possible. Therapy can help the boys understand why mom feels betrayed by them, and help mom realize that she can't hold the children responsible for what their (step)parent did. 

Assuming that OP and wife dated at least a year before getting married, these arguments have been going on for 2.5+ years now! It's absolutely time for professional help."
I wouldn't even say it's harsh.  It's the right thing to do--she clearly is not about making this a fair partnership.  She's looking out for herself.  OP is going to be ecstatic to find there are reasonable partners out there that will actually treat him with respect.
send her a venmo invoice. 
"A few thoughts:

1. This is a gross invasion of your privacy and that of your children without your consent. 

2. You don't mention if your wife provided explicit consent for video of your children to be shared on Youtube. My thinking is that if she did provide it, then she should have discussed this with you to reach an agreement on whether or not your children's images on youtube. If she didn't provide it, then her friend is sharing videos of your children without your or your wife's explicit consent. 

3. Posting images of children on social media takes control of their online image away from them. The friend is defining their social media footprint, and it is not her place to do this.  Not only did this friend post images of your kids without your consent, she did so without the consent of the kids. Very young kids won't understand the implications of their images being shared online (which is why it's up to the parents to step in), but kids have a habit of getting older and developing their own opinions on whether or not they want random people they don't know sharing their image online. 

4. Posting children's images online can result in identity theft or attract the attention of online predators. 

5. Who do these videos serve?  Certainly not your kids. Your wife's friend is using images of your children to bolster her online presence.  That is not okay. 


Personally, I would ask the friend to remove the videos of your children from her channel immediately, and if she refuses, perhaps look into legal options (i.e. a cease and desist). You are completely in the right to want to protect your kids social media footprint. "
"&gt;I've been called every name in the book, and I'm not really the type to fight back.

This is abuse.  100%.  Just because it's not as bad as your previous relationship doesn't mean it isn't abuse.  Just because you are responding differently doesn't mean it isn't abuse.  

For the sake of you and your daughter, you need to get away from this guy.  His behavior is already escalating and pregnant women and women of very young children are especially vulnerable.  If you end up with postpartum depression after giving birth, he will make it a thousand times worse.  Do you have anyone you can go and stay with?  A family member or a friend?  If not, find a domestic abuse shelter.  Don't tell him you're leaving or where you are going.  Pack a bag and go.  Then get a lawyer, divorce him, and sue for child support.  "
"Your boyfriend is a loser, a mooch, and doesn't respect you. Drop him like a hot potato. 

I mean, what 29 year old doesn't even have a bank account?! Loser with a capital L."
"He's a jerk and you can do so much better.

Listen: I've been with my bf for a year. Over that year I've gained 25 lbs. I feel horribly unattractive. All my bf can see is how the extra weight made my butt bigger. My point is, the right man won't care at all."
"To add to this, absolutely don't give him the ""I told you so"" treatment when he gets the sack. It'll bring you down to his stubborn level and make things worse. He'll have taken a humbling on all accounts and will need your support in building himself and your relationship back up."
"Exactly this. The problem is that Husband thinks he's ""come up"" and his ego is looking down on OP and treating her as less than. People like that would do it in any profession, its a side point that it happens to be the one OP also wants success in.

OP it does sound like there's a little bit of (understandable) ""why not me"" going on with you. Try to work through that, it makes sense to be a bit upset but just make sure its not somehow manifesting negatively. But other than that - your husband is being mean. Tell him that. Ask him to work with you to fix the respect issue. Whatever you are working on is just as valid and he doesn't get to say things like ""don't hold me back"". Not if he wants you guys to be partners anyway"
Can't cover up a dead dog
You said you have a child. As a young child seeing one of your parents mistreat an animal is upsetting and anxiety inducing. 
"As a health care professional (occupational therapist) who works with a lot of brain injured patients, I will also verify that helmets are serious things and should never be bought used--they go bad after a certain amount of time even if they arent used (i think recommendation is to change them every 5-7 yeas), and are no good if theyve experienced a crash."
Chivalry means he holds the door open for you and then you have to wait on him hand and foot once you're inside.
"&gt;  I felt like I had entered a competition where I didn’t understand the rules.

That's really what instagram is. It's all about the likes and comments, who has the most followers, etc etc. If this story is to be taken at face value (it seems a bit too much like a creative writing exercise for me to believe it), the ""pictures of her ass"" and the lingerie photos are...suspicious, unless she's trying to be a bonafide insta model. But if she's not making money off of it there's no point."
"Coming from a complete stranger, I am *begging* you not to subject a child to having a father like this.

I'll be blunt: if you want to stay and risk your health by listening to your boyfriend, you can do so. That's your decision and good luck. But do not bring an innocent, helpless child into this world with a father like that, knowing that your boyfriend could get that kid killed, when it could have been prevented with something as easily as a vaccine.

Even if you had the kid vaccinated secretly, this would be just the start of many things. What if your kid got ill and it escalated to pneumonia? Just look at statistics -- every day, that horrible sickness kills someone and can start off with a simple cold, then the flu. If it got bad enough that (s)he needed to go to the hospital, your boyfriend would probably protest. Something as simple as an infection can kill you, too, if you leave it untreated and develop sepsis. Sometimes just putting ointment on a cut doesn't work. This guy is gonna get your kid killed.

I can almost certainly bet that your boyfriend would try to stop you from getting your kid to a doctor. And, god forbid, your kid *needs* a doctor for something life-threatening like what you're facing...what if you have a baby girl, and she has the same problem as you? Your boyfriend would fight you on your child having surgery, or any other surgery. Kids rarely get through life without having some type of operation, surgery, or whatever. Heck, I had to get my tonsils out because they were ""suffocating"" me in my sleep and that was considered simple! Don't put a kid through that. Think about the far future and how this will affect you."
"Yeah we agreed to get rid of it. She showed me all these videos of wrestlers saying don't try it at home. We just told them together. Our 7 year old didn't take it very well because he wanted to be like the people on TV. 

We told him that the WWE wrestlers would probably have an heart attack if they saw a 7 year old jumping around in a ring. 
"
"Yeah I'd just refund it. How horrible would it be to know your money for a child with cancer went to a meth head? Even if it was not your intention, you look bad. Just return it. "
Have you thought about somewhere like Colorado or Utah? 
"There’s nothing you can do to change how many attractive girls there are out there or whether or not your boyfriend checks them out. But what you can change is how you value yourself. I am definitely in the same boat as you where I feel inadequate compared to other girls. But I find that it just gets worse when I let myself wallow in my own self-pity about how I don’t look like those girls. Of course you can change your appearance but making yourself look more attractive doesn’t necessarily make you feel more attractive. Remind yourself that you are beautiful and your boyfriend chose to be with you for a reason. If you recognize these harmful thoughts and behaviours that you have, take the next step and stop them from controlling you. You may see beautiful girls walk past you and fear that your boyfriend thinks they’re attractive but remember that it’s your hand that he’s holding and it’s you that’s in his heart. "
"Yeah I'm around her(?) age and the thought of dating anyone even 10 years older than me is beyond gross, let alone someone who could easily be my dad. Anything more than a 2 years difference and there's a huge difference in maturity/life experience. "
"She is either seeking for closure or she wants to keep you as a back up plan. I guess personally I would still respond to her email, but telling her to leave you alone and you will block her from now on. Not responding will just make her think you probably haven’t read the email yet and she will keep bothering you. But if you make yourself clear and have the last say, then you will kill any hope she has being with you. Sometimes it better to say it than to ignore it, or else they will never leave you alone. "
"Not to be rude, but why does that matter? 

You clearly are not comfortable with this. Other people’s experiences are not yours, you are free to do what you please. You didn’t go into the relationship knowing this would be your future, you’re right to be confused and any decision you make is ok. 

Do you want to try and make it work? Do it. 

Do you want leave the relationship? Do it. 

This is your decision and only yours, what other people do should play no factor. If you feel like you owe her the chance then give her a chance, but never sacrifice your well-being for someone else. Yes, a relationship is about love and sacrifice for the other person, but not if it makes you unhappy in the process. "
"One of the final straws I had for filing for divorce was that I had meningitis and when I was released from the hospital , my ex just dropped me off at the house and went to work (he was a salaried programmer who wouldn't have lost any $$ by working at home). I was too weak to get myself a glass of water -- I was released when I was only on the understanding that  had someone to take care of me, and if I'd known my husband wasn't going to lift a fnger for me, I'd have stayed in the hospital at least another day. 

This is a dealbreaker. He's not loving enough and helpful enough to be a life partner.

So sorry you were so horribly sick. I recommend you cut your losses with this guy."
Lol was hoping it'd make someone laugh!
"Taxi's are a thing.

She's an adult; she could have gotten home.

Break up."
"Oh, wow! I must admit that the image of your dead passing out at the doctor's office just made me laugh, though."
"Follow the plan.

Save for a car, drive his for free while doing it."
lmao check and mate on this one. She can't flip it around any other way.
So also Kara's friends? 
It sounds like you don't like her and want a divorce...so what advice are you looking for? It's going to be messy and some people will take her side but it sounds like you know what you want to do.
Dan Savage said that the victim of the affair isn't always the victim of the marriage. You don't actually know what their marriage was like. You already lost your dad. Try not to lose your mum as well.
ha ha i know right? OP is in a lot of denial especially for a 32 year old.  I would expect a twenty something year old to do this.  
"I'm not surprised your dad is friends with your ex, as he didn't really do anything wrong. Your view would be understandable if he had cheated or committed some other major infraction, but your father is under no obligation to end friendships because you had a major meltdown.
down and acted crazy"
"If it were just an issue of him eating your stuff out of the pantry, I would think that's a little silly to end a relationship over. However, you've tried multiple different ways, and gone to *extremes* to prevent him from doing it. At this point he is completely and knowingly disrespecting you - it's beyond just an ""eating your snacks"" issue. I wouldn't blame you for ending things with him over this. I mean, did you confront him about breaking into your safe? what did he say? I just can't even imagine what his reason would be."
"It sounded to me like she really wasn't interested in him but doesn't know how to shut it down. _She_ was the one who asked if other people would be there on the first dinner 'date' and suggested inviting people. If she had cancelled the dinner right then, it would have looked like a snub. I am her age, and I know exactly what it feels like to try to turn someone down but continuing out of politeness, which I know is stupid logic but that's just how you think sometimes. And when he asked for a second date, she blew him off. My guess is she will keep coming up with excuses every time he asks her out again. But, her motives are NOT the issue. This is entirely on your husband. You should not be relying on other women to make sure your husband is loyal. "
I had to reread the ages after the door comment... OP's normal is not right. 
"You know, this is a perfect time to give us a *shitload* more context...."
"I thought the same. That seems petty at that point. Well, having everyone tested seems petty at that point.

I understand OP wanting to prove it once and for all, but doing that extra would just add more drama. 

Especially since it sounds like they realize they were manipulated, and are trying to reach out.

Some sociopaths are very good at it. Destroying entire friend groups, or in like OP's case, alienating an ""enemy"" in a way. 


To OP: you have every reason to be hurt and take your time, but you said yourself you saw this girl for who she was before pretty much. Now your friends have seen that too, and they probably feel stupid like you did for falling for her shit before. 

"
"I think that if your friends want to reconnect with you, at this time, even though you are still furious, let them, with the caveat that they know, that you're still absolutely apeshit and will say things that you'd normally regret, except that, for the gaslighting by your ex friend, you're going to vent, so if your friends want to stand next to the volcano while it's errupting to prove how sorry they are, then they shouldn't complain if they get burned.

That said, I think it's fair for you to draw a line in the sand and make a declaration that if they want a relationship with you, Lee is effectively cut out of your life, and it's THEIR responsibility to make sure that there are no conflicts.  If Lee mentions your name in social media, or in group discussions, it's THEIR job to tell her to shut up or leave. If she contacts you, it's their job to tell her to back off.  You never contact LEE again, and if your friends want to be your friends, they're going to have to do the work of keeping Lee away from you.

You can't control who they're friends with, but if there is a group event, and they forget to uninvite Lee, they have to tell her to leave, or you will  be screaming angry for them not doing their job.

You're 32. FIFTEEN YEARS REMOVED FROM HIGHSCHOOL THIS BS SHOULD BE OVER AND DONE WITH."
"He sounds batshit from this post. He's really willing to use a toddler as centipede bait? Seriously? You absolutely did the right thing, OP."
People are telling you that you aren't ready because you're not. You're body might feel ready but until you're able to have a conversation with your boyfriend about sex you're not prepared for all the things that can occur when and after you have sex. 
"You cannot continue a relationship with someone who takes advantage of you, puts you in a vulnerable, unsafe situation, and above all, thinks it's a joke. They think drugging you is funny. 

DUMP HER

REPORT HER TO THE POLICE"
"Word. Yelling is an absolute deal-breaker for me, as is name-calling and swearing during a disagreement. There is no reason why adults shouldn't be able to resolve a conflict without showing each other contempt and disrespect."
She loves everything that is associated with her culture. I have asked my MIL for something I may send her
"Even if you’re (hypothetically) oblivious about your own inadequacies as a partner, she needs to sit down with you and talk to you about it instead of treating you like an enemy in your own home. 

Although I will say, if you’re sleep-deprived 2-3 days a week, does that mean she’s sleep-deprived 4-5 days a week? Sleep deprivation can be just awful for some people’s moods. Still doesn’t make her constant and open resentment of you healthy or constructive though. "
"As a man, we often discuss how strong a woman’s intuition is about this stuff. Trust in yourself and have the confidence to speak out. Knowing what you do and his defensiveness is enough of a giveaway. I don’t know about the pregnancy but he sure is cheating at least emotionally. Call him out! 

Being wrong is not a crime if he think it is m, fuck him (not literally because he doesn’t deserve that if he is cheating)."
Why did I just cry lol 
It's not going to work. He's a selfish person. He will continue to be one.
If it's that kind of work computer then even letting the boyfriend use it is likely a big no no.
"He sounds narcissistic, thought he could do better than her, and freaked when God forbid she picked up the pieces of her life and found someone more deserving. You shouldn't want this man at all, everything about him screams ""me me me on my time when I want however I want"""
I know they were. Op was just denying it was an affair and was calling it a friendship. 
"This is someone you're in a close relationship with. You should just straight out tell him, ""I don't think I could get engaged to anybody until I'd dated them at least a year."" Or whatever your minimum amount of time is."
"Oh absolutely I didn’t say it but that’s what I was thinking. In fact I’m 99% convinced she’ll be magically in a new relationship as soon as thanksgiving is over and OP will be left wondering “wow I drove her all break and she still dumped me” I just hope he realizes that she’s using him and doesn’t drive her during his break. 

She sounds like a terrible partner to be honest!"
"Gee, I wonder if this has any impact on your brother’s desire to have a close relationship with you? You were at least 21 when they started dating, so you were grown up when you pulled that nonsense.

You don’t always get take backs in life. That is the sort of stuff that sends people to couple’s therapy to figure out how to set boundaries with the crappy, boundary issue, drama causing side of the family. You get that, right?"
"Damn... thank you for this. 

I got into a bad eye rolling habit with my SO a little while back. He called me out on it and I've worked hard to change it, but I still mess up sometimes. 

I know all I should need in order to change is my SO telling me something I do makes him feel bad, but having this source is also a slap to the head that I think I I needed. "
"Woah. A lot of people will tell you to get over it and be happy for them, but I can't imagine what I would do if my best friend dated my ex. She could have at least run it by you first!! And the fact that she told you in an email, didn't even call you... Wow.

Is their wedding any time soon? Take some time to process and think about your feelings. Definitely don't commit to being in the wedding until you've seen them both in person and spent time with them. It would be perfectly understandable to not attend the wedding. If they are as amazing as you say they are they will understand. "
"Basically asking how to let her down nicely? I guess I'd like to preserve the memory of the video since it is a fun video, but I don't really have a relationship with her anymore so if our relationship sours it's not a big loss. 

Good to know others find this rude too. I'm pretty neutral and like to keep the peace so sometimes I let things go to far before cutting people out. "
"Your friends are swingers and they are testing your husband and you out to see if you are game.

Accept the explanation that it was an accident, because it gives you all an easy way to resume social interactions as they were before."
"&gt;he wants to go eat, we go eat, he wants to split it, I can't split it, so he pays and resents me for it and makes passive aggressive comments.

This guy has fucking horrible manners. Why are you still with him? he sucks."
This is harsh but I think OP needs to hear it.
"Yeah, like the fact he said hes planned to meet that women and he knows they both want sex? He just wants the comments to validate him. Either go to counselling with your wife or let her go so she can find someone who will do the bare minimum of not arranging to cheat on her. "
"I agree with this... $70 is a massive account to cover when you're not expecting it. There is also the fact that you paid her back, which probably intensified it in her mind. Not only did she pay this money she wasn't expecting to spend, but she genuinely needed it back and couldn't just tell you ""no big deal, I've got it"". I've been there, and it's embarrassing to not even be able to just cover it and not need that money back. I think she's making the jokes to make herself feel better, which is incredibly wrong, but I can see where she is coming from. "
"Came here to give you a piece of my thoughts, but everyone else already has. You are wrong, OP. 

&gt; told her to ""take a joke"" and that ""that's how all guys feel"".

Your brother (and really, yourself too) need to give your wife a sincere apology. This is not blowing out of proportion, dude - everyone on here is saying she is within right. Get the hint, and put it into another perspective without thinking he is your brother. "
"Yeah, it blows because my family is tight knit enough to expect that every cousin will be there. And they will likely all show, too, all 30+ of them. 

Lisa and her sister and brother, my other cousins, are extremely close, but I’m also close with them as well. Also, my dad and Aunt are close, and my step mom used to watch Lisa’s kids. "
She fears you having a good relationship with your father. That's messed up. 
"You’re right, I’d never expect to get an apology out of her! Ugh. This is good advice, thank you. "
"If he can’t be honest with you about why he wanted to meet her and what he hoped would happen then you are correct in being very concerned about your relationship.He has allready started trickle truthing you and lying by omission.To be honest it’s not clear in your post whether he is even remorseful or is he just sorry he got caught.You may think it’s terrible having to tell people that the wedding is off,better that than telling them in a couple of years that you are divorcing.If you feel the relationship is worth saving then you could try counseling but he seems very immature and careless about both his business and private life so you need to be very careful here."
"Great gifts for kids: Paints. Big jugs of tempera paint.  Water pistols.  Bells.  Xylophones.  Laser Tag.  (I want to say an exotic pet, but that's not fair to the animal.)"
"I think you're only overreacting if you've made how you feel clear to him, emphasized that it's a dealbreaker that will end the marriage. If you've done those things and he hasn't listened then you are justified. If you haven't, then I think you owe him a sit down to make it clear just how important this is to you. 

As an aside from this, are there other areas where he's like this? It does seem like you moved quite rapidly towards divorce if this is the only time an issue like this has cropped up. "
"&gt; H: Great! Want to grab a bite or go bowling? When are you free?

This tells me that, yes he is asking her out, but that they aren't having an affair...yet. Your husband is putting himself, and your marriage in a precarious position. He is inching his way to an affair...

"
"Either the close call put him into ""fuck it, I'm going to metaphorically flip the bird to the risks"" mode, or he's one of those people where the possibility of serious illness isn't really ""real"" until it happens.

Neither is an attractive quality in someone who's supposed to be a reliable partner and a good example to your children. 

Same goes for him vanishing right when he was supposed to take your kids to the movies - does he do stuff like that a lot? I smell an overarching problem with responsibility &amp; impulse control."
"It's hard to have a relationship without trust. She clearly has overstepped the boundaries and disrespected your relationship multiple times by letting this go on. It's up to you, whether you want to believe her but who's to say whether or not this won't happen again next time she gets ""bored"""
I've seen it happem several times but the non-trans partner is usually queer or bisexual themselves.
"You turned your friend down when she was single and interested in you. Now that she's in a relationship and unavailable, you want her. You acknowledge that you do have other prospects, but you can't get into them.

The time you're investing in winning this woman over would probably be better spent on figuring out why you're attracted exclusively to what you can't have."
"Don't do it. It's your wife's house, her family heirloom. Respect what she wants to do with it."
"My asshole slammed shut at the thought of large dogs in a house like that.

Her fears aren't unfounded at all, you're being quite dismissive of them.

Whether the dogs would *intentionally* destroy things or not is irrelevant.

What matters is that the dogs WILL accidentally damage and destroy things. Dogs aren't graceful, especially large dogs, that's just a fact.

Even modern buildings/apartments are guaranteed to get damaged if pets live within them.

I can totally understand why your wife doesn't want to damage a family heirloom so she can provide a stepping stone for your sister."
"So you put your one-sided, utterly ignorant wish over your wife's decision to separate herself from her mother/family of origin?! What the hell? How could you not realize how selfish and self-centered that was? 

It sounds like even now you have no idea even now how badly you've fucked up. I have been married for over a decade to a man I love and respect with all my heart. If he betrayed me by talking behind my back to a family member of mine with whom I'd gone no contact, the best case scenario for us would be going to couples counseling to see if we could save the marriage. The lack of trust in my judgement, the deception involved in going behind my back, the lack of consideration and respect given my pain, might very well destroy our otherwise healthy and happy marriage. And I only had to deal with a parent who was manipulative and emotionally abusive. I didn't have to face religious abuse (and potential sexual/physical abuse) the way it sounds like your wife did.

You want advice? Call multiple marriage counselors, do all the legwork investigating whether/how your insurance will cover sessions, and give your wife the information and the choice of whether she is even willing to pursue marital counseling with you. Then stand back and give her space. If she decides she simply wants to separate, then you respect her decision (for a change). If she gives you a chance, you give thanks to your deity of choice, and you put in the hard work of learning to be a decent, respectful partner who doesn't feel entitled to patronizingly overrule his spouse's major decisions. You will never (re)build a relationship worth having without doing that work and learning those lessons. "
"&gt; when I was avoiding pregnancies, which was ALL THE TIME, I never forgot my birth control. 

Eh, I've been taking birth control pills for 10+ years and still forget sometimes. But, I have never forgotten multiple days in a row, and when I forgot for ONE day, I take it as soon as I remember (usually the next morning), use other forms of birth control for a month, and use plan B if I had unprotected sex before realizing I had forgotten to take it. 

I'm also not buying that she didn't do this at least a little deliberately (maybe she did really forget, but then didn't take any extra steps hoping she might get pregnant)."
"I'm not sure if English isn't your native language or if you worded it poorly, but you mentioned the screenshots directly in relation to his friends being alienated. Which means those conversations weren't innocent and it wasn't them being driven away because he didn't confide in them. "
"Ummm? Welcome to university? Your 'friend' said he's great in bed, you say he's a great person... whats the problem? I assume you're going to tell him you don't have experience and if he is that great, why's he going to care? "
"Yeah I mean, OP needs to accept that her relationship didn't have the most auspicious of beginnings and that it's going to take a long time (like years probably) for the kids to accept her. As for the husband's attitude towards his ex-wife... that's what happens when you jump from one relationship to another without giving yourself time to move on."
"Private practice tends to be more out of training than large facility staff. She wasn't willfully negligent nor trying to deliberately harm your daughter. And ofcourse when symptoms escalate it is much easier to give a more specific diagnosis. I mean if you think about it, you personally agreed with the diagnosis everytime you took her in - that is- her symptoms were apparently minor enough for you to accept that answer and walk away.

If you are simply anxious about seeing her, I would say just go to thanksgiving, otherwise you will only prolong the dred. See that it's not that bad. You don't have to talk to eachother if you don't want, but you shouldn't feel scared to be in the same room. It wasn't a personal attack, it was a genuine misdiagnose and I'm sure she feels terrible about it. 

All that being said, I remember how I felt when my doctor ignored my concerns, and if you are PISSED OFF... Then don't go. If you can't be around her without being angry, now is not the time to confront it. "
"Yeah, it is harsh, but when her motives are so plain it's hard to be anything but. She wanted him contributing as much as possible and her as little as possible, both then and now. The only things that's changed is that she can no longer hide behind equality to take advantage of OP.

Oh, and OP, I'd stop paying for your date nights every time. You don't have to split each one, but you should definitely alternate."
"OP's friends are some backbiting jerks.  

And, uh, they seem to have some crappy marriages.  Don't think that I'd be envious of their lives given those comments.  "
"OP, your SIL is a GP. She is not specialized like these other doctors so maybe she feels guilt because she wasn't able to help in a way that she could. For every good doctor there are thousands of bad ones. Don't take it too personally."

"OP addresses it elsewhere. She had a series of tantrums. It was the only way to get her to agree to attend the wedding at all, since she was angry she wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid. (Because she tried to break up Rachel and her brother.) The happy couple allowed her to bring Kara as her plus one because that was the only way she would agree to attend period. 

Now we know why Rachel and OP's brother have pulled away from the family."

"This girl isn't your friend. I'm mixed race too. I live in a country that is pretty multicultural however the rural areas are very racist. I lived in a rural area for 5 years when i was younger and made some ""friends"". Most of them knew being outright racist (using the n word, drawing swastikas etc) was wrong and they preached a lot about how they HATED that kind of thing. However the also knew they could get a few cheap laughs if they repeated softer racist jokes at my expense (like stuff you'd hear on South park or stand up comedy). I did NOT find this funny. I did not appreciate being called a little monkey or having my name deliberately mispronounced. I cut these people off and moved to a more multicultural area and I am so much more confident. Your friend knows what she's doing is wrong. You haven't lost a friend. She was never your friend to begin with."
Not the op that's coming across as hostile.
Where did you boyfriend go to medical school and where does he practice now?
"You were pretty condescending, dude. You implied her side effects were all in her head and his sexual pleasure was more important than her discomfort. You implied that you, some dude who skim read her post missing important details, knew more than her, someone who’s tried multiple types of birth control and she should just try more.

That’s why people are being hostile."
Yes. This is decades of frustration at having a dad who puts his addiction first and a mom who is more focused on enabling Dad than protecting her kid from a worthless parent. She blew up because she sees a dad slowly killing him self and getting away with it for years. 
"But how will it learn to be a good dog? I mean, you can't even talk to it like you could a child."
"I hate that reasoning so much. Do people like that also think that women should smoke while pregnant, no one should wear a seatbelt, and we should use lead paint on playgrounds? Just because people survived doesn't mean it was good. For Christ's sake, it's not a judgement on how they were raised. But conventional knowledge changes. "
Absolutely feasible in a group of drunk people.
"&gt; I have a dependency on pornography, but that’s separate

No, it's not."
It’s absolutely unacceptable for her to go down on you without your consent. You should never have to say no or stop more than once. She is not a good person.
"Because that would mean he respected her and that they are equals, and he clearly doesn't feel that way. "
"Honestly, you guys should consider therapy. "
"I lost my mother very suddenly when I was 23 and it's fucking terrible beyond all imagining. That said, you need to break up with him. You're not doing him any favors by leading him on. Yeah, people will say that you can only break up in person, but that's just not true-breakups suck no matter how you do it. I know you don't want to hurt him, but you have to accept that there is no way to break up with him without hurting him, and the faster you do it, the better for you. You have to rip off the bandaid.

Good luck!"
This so much. The bridesmaids and groomsmen are right there with groom and brides mother/father on the importance scale. There must be dozens of others who could of taken that bullet.
Just be polite but not friendly. You don't have to bring it up. It was dealt with at the wedding and it doesn't sound like you'll get an apology. You can ignore her as much as possible and fake nice anytime you have to interact. But if you want to be a little petty be really obvious about your fake nice. 
"Even if she somehow ""tricked him"" into sex, it's not worth committing to spending her life with someone because she feels bad about a mistake she made, no matter the magnitude. The punishment in this case would not fit the crime."
"&gt;  start up a new bank account and then have your pay direct deposited there instead.

This is the best option either way.  
An account only you have access to,  to be honest you may not even be listed on the current account that they 'opened for you'.

Also,  find your papers.  Birth Certificate, passport (if you have one), anything else that belongs to you. then do a credit check on yourself to make sure there's nothing else opened in your name.

"I totally agree. This:

&gt;He said that he and Anna had been putting up with her “BS” (although he didn’t use the abbreviation) 

Was so utterly endearing."
"As someone who's childfree, I don't see it at all that she wants to be a mom to humans. Maybe her other siblings are getting together and doing kid things and she is always left out because she doesn't have them. They probably wouldn't even think to ask her to join them. Do they have just sibling get togethers? Or could they ask her to join in more to the family? Does she get invited to the kids sports games? Maybe she wants to be seen as part of the family but because she doesn't have kids she's excluded from events. Most of my friends have kids now, and do I want to join them on playdates and such? Not a chance. But what is nice is the camaraderie of those playdates. The social aspect. "
"I'm like this. 

Your wife doesn't want to be this way, and she probably knows that it annoys you.

The problem is that this type of behaviour WAY easier than stepping outside of her comfort zone and sitting in an imperfect home.

If I'm sitting on the couch and notice dust on the coffee table, I stop everything and clean the coffee table. Because once I know it's there I can't relax.

Therapy would help her, these obsessive tendencies likely resonate elsewhere in her life. For example, if I plan to leave work and do groceries and be home before 6, and I get home at 6:10, it frustrates me to hell.

Therapy helps, and I would suggest pointing her in that direction. She'll feel SO much better when she's able to walk by a smudged mirror and ignore it.

It's something she can shake if she's willing."
It is a bold move to book a venue without the bride knowing she's even a bride...
"My 74 year old Dad does this - and similarly, he’s done it my whole life but it’s gotten worse (or maybe more obvious since I’m a grown ass and reasonably independent person now instead of an insecure kid).  My only solution has been to address him very flatly whenever it happens.  

“Why are you getting ice cream?? There’s perdectly good pie that needs to be eaten on the counter!! Put that back and eat the pie instead!!”

“Because I’m a grownup and I don’t have to justify my choices, Dad.  Thanks for the suggestion, maybe I’ll take the pie for lunch tomorrow.”

And then end of discussion - anything he says after that on the same topic is ignored or gets a one-word answer.  After maybe a year, it’s pivoted into a joke - “Why are you doing that?  I know, I know, it’s because you’re an adult who makes her own choices BUT I STILL THINK...”. which is at least more palatable to me and we can laugh about it.  But I def find saying, kindly butnin so many words “because I’m an adult and am comfortable with my own choices, thanks” has made a big difference even if it feels a bit awkward at first."
"Maybe I am being too curious,but is she not using any form of borth control? Most people who try do not get pregnant so easily."
"He doesn't have to sugar coat things for you. My boyfriend and I talk about our education and career goals. This is how we support each other without sugar coating things.

""Hey, I'm thinking of doing X.""
""That's cool, but are you sure X would be ok? Do you think Y and Z might help, or be different?""
""Nah, X is what I want.""
""Ok, cool! I'm excited for you to do X.""


It's as simple as that. We voice our concerns and our opinions in a respectful manner that isn't telling the other person what to do. The other person is an adult fully capable of making their own decisions, so whether they listen or the advice or not, we simply support one another in our own decisions even if we would do it differently. 

I mean, you're not a child, you're in graduate school, you clearly have a plan set out for yourself and are working for it. It isn't right for your boyfriend to be bringing you down by making you feel inadequate. You should never be afraid to talk to you boyfriend about the things that excite you. He is the one that needs to fix his attitude here. People have a big thing about ""being honest"" but that doesn't mean you get to be mean, you can give your honest opinion in a respectful manner."
so any chance your best friend is also your stalker?
"Hahah nope. Nice try, but when you break up obligations around rides like that end."
"&gt; You don't have a SIL/Brother problem. You and your family are the problem

Exactly. This is the classic nightmare family scenario, from the POV of one of the nightmare family members. One who is utterly lacking in self awareness and who refuses to take responsibility for her and her family's bad behavior.

Otoh, it's lovely to hear that once the nightmare wedding was over -- where OP pitched a tantrum and insisted on bringing the groom's ex as a plus one -- Ben went very low contact with his family and threw his support behind his wife Rachel."
"Ah... no.  Two seconds to say “I’m not feeling it tonight, let’s talk tomorrow,” is not going to take any skin off anyone’s back.

I am a woman and I get to where I want to be left alone all day too, but I at least tell my husband, “you know, I need some me time” and he gives me that same respect."
"Ohhhhhhhh so you lied to her and didn't tell her you were with a PREGNANT woman?  Wow, you get worse and worse.  And she stayed with you....poor woman.

&gt; My ex has threatened to beat her up, and my gf still takes the high road and ignores her.

That's not taking the high road.  That's realizing that she's a shitty person and keeping her head down because she knows your exes anger is justified.

You are super delusional about this whole situation."
Also uncomfortable to sleep with
Just curious but why was she seeing a pro life counselor? There was no way she would come out of that not feeling like a complete piece of shit for thinking about anything other than having the baby.
"Yes. OP is 20 and can make plans to move out reasonably soon. Sorry, I can see that could have been taken both ways."
"I'd be so fucking done with every one of these assholes including your husband that I'd take out a full page ad in the paper telling themselves to go and get royally fucked and I hope they have shit lives. But hey, that's just me. Perhaps you'd be happy with a full page grovelling apology in the same paper paid with all of their full names included. 

&gt; When they tell me that they're sorry, I want to say - I don't believe you, why don't you go to a lab first and prove to me that you're sorry?

At the very LEAST you should do exactly that."
"Just refund the money, if your siste gets visibly upset or mad you’ll know that she wanted it for something else."
"&gt;You did the right thing there.

Yeah maybe for her niece, but not for all the other children and pets who live in her building. "
Why don't you inform your co-workers? 
"People are upset because it was Pokémon but the reality is she went to go ""attain a measurable, specific, and also rare goal within a hobby which occupies a considerable amount of her chosen time and energy."" Cool, still disrespectful to run off without consideration to her partner and not even feel bad that they were put off by it. That being said, I would personally not leave mid-sex for a Pokémon BUT might head out for a Unown pre-sex if I happened to see the notification, with loads of apologies and promises to be right back and turn my phone off after. Then again I usually don't answer my phone during sex or pre-sex activities (undressing, foreplay) unless I'm expecting something important (aka my job depends on it)."
"Really, at age 3?  Wow.  Either he’s just naturally a rule follower or y’all have done a good job of explaining the “big rules” to him in a way he can understand, or both.  Either way good on y’all.  Give the kid a reward, it’s huge that he could resist grandma at his age.  I expect that more at 5-6yo."

"&gt;Am I at fault here? 

Are you serious? Yes, you're at fault here.

&gt; I don’t understand why they are reacting with such animosity years after

Because this is brand new to them. You've had years to sweep it under the rug and clearly never ended your affair. They dealt with confusion and hurt and anger and abandonment over a divorce that they didn't know the reason for. You just flitted along in your charmed life while everything changed for them.  They are allowed to be angry. You did destroy their home life and stability. It sounds like your husband took care of everything and you shoved it in his face. It really sucks to see someone you love and respect be treated so poorly. Their feelings about you are going to change. 

I don't really think you should go visit them if they don't want to see you. Forcing yourself on them isn't going to help this. Also, they were going to figure it out eventually.
"
"I mean, he almost had to assume that, right? There's no way you hear ""raised in an awful cult, ran away at 18 and don't talk with my mother EVER"" and go ""sounds good, no problems there, full speed ahead with calling mom and inviting her to meet her grandkid"" if you *actually* believe your wife when she says those things. "
"""Ok that's fine, I'd actually like to see XYZ movie too, so I'm gonna tag along. Where should we grab a bite beforehand?""

She will either:


A) Freak out/tell you that you can't come. If she freaks out and tells you that you can't come, then you have a real problem. If this is a platonic friend (in her eyes, I mean, he quite obviously wants to bang your GF) then she should have zero problem with that. Hell, I'd be ecstatic if my SO wanted to spend more time with my friends.


or 


B) Tell you ""sure, sounds good!"" and then you have nothing to worry about.



If it's Option A then she's definitely doing something wrong and she knows it."
"Yeah. It sounds like some folks may not be experienced with a friend/loved one who has bathroom issues. I had a relative who used an ostomy bag and there were definitely some ""OMG can they really STILL be in there?"" moments. At the same time, you need to check yourself and realize that if you're waiting around, you still got the better end of the deal than the person who is in the bathroom dealing with medical issues."
"Your boundaries and self respect will make guys who don't want to date girls with self respect run. Boundaries and self respect will not make guys worth dating run.

What I always told myself was ""Would I be turned off if someone did this to me?"" Like being the first one to text. Is that a turn off to you? No? So why would that be a turn off for someone like you who you want to date? You want to be with not just anyone. You are looking for someone you are compatible with. If a guy can't handle a strong girl who know what she wants, he isn't the guy for you, a strong girl who knows what she wants. If you being you is a turn off, he did you a favor by not wasting your time so you can keep looking for someone better."
"In a way, it actually is her fault. Not only did she forget to take her birth control properly, she didn't even inform him. Had he known, he probably wouldn't even agree to have sex without any other protection. So no, he didn't ""knock her up"". She's the one who fucked up, TWICE; failed to properly take her BC AND didn't tell him. What reasonable person wouldn't inform their partner about such a thing? Especially since they've already had an unplanned child. 

Now, because of HER mistakes, he's in a dreadful situation that he has no control over. That's why it's unforgivable. It wasn't an accident. It could had been easily avoided, had she been responsible and communicative. "
"Do you have reason to believe that his mother won’t take good care of your son?

Your husband is allowed to have needs too. Not just sex, either. It sounds like he wants some of your time and has made some suggestions about how to make that happen. "
"ya thank you!! Also ""guy talk"" not an excuse.  Let's single out what V responded...
V: what is she wearing? 
[she's perfect] V: I agree, I’ve always thought so 
[go for it] V: she’s engaged... but if I had a chance 

why are you asking what she's wearing? or if you had a chance...? 

this is completely inappropriate, and while it maybe isn't break up worthy (especially if this is the first time something like this has happened) BUT, it definitely warrants a conversation, and I would probably discuss some boundaries with this female friend.

"I'm gonna add that when you SAY ""you need to brush your teeth more"" not EVERYONE will realize you ALSO mean the tongue.


Apparently not everyone is taught the *CORRECT* way to brush their teeth, which includes a vigorous scrub of the tongue.


So you need to say something more like. ""You need to brush you teeth *AND TONGUE* better and more often than you are doing.""


And if that doesn't work he may have a fungal infection he needs to see his doctor about."
"You should not be offering it in this case. I think the above is an example of people who are in two very different situations &amp; him helping her when *unforseen* small things crop up. 

You're both studying, you've both worked some while studying (and for some reason she can't do more or won't?). So it's not like you've already graduated and will be working full time from now. 

Unforseen. She I assume was aware that uni is not free? What was her plan if she was not dating you? Would she still expect a friend or someone else to pay? Or was her plan to take out a loan like everyone else? Did she quit her job thinking of your money as her money? 

Nope, this isn't her nicely asking for help. This isn't you offering up some of your savings as a lifeline when she's hit with a bit of bad luck. She absolutely has the ability to sort this out herself but is trying to make it your problem. Don't let her. "
Nope. She can do whatever she wants in dating. 
"&gt;all I can think of now is him eating some stranger out. The thought of him disgusts me and I am filled with rage.

Honestly, it won't go away :( it sucks but it's hard to get past these issues because it's just a breeding ground for resentment. Do you want a partner that has treated you so badly and has given you such bad memories? I couldn't move past it either but took me 1.5 years. I understand it sucks when you've spent so much time and it looks like things are on track but that's so gross. He was so0o0o0 drunk but he was able to do all of that stuff? Yuck. You can do better!"

"My folks considered an apprenticeship a type of ""paid"" vocational education. There is a chance your aunt may feel the same.  I say ask her.

My sister wanted to drop out of high school when she was very young becasue it was hell for her (bullying, poor teaching standards etc). She had a plan to go to a local college to finish her education and work part time, in order for that to work she would have to move in with me for a little while until she got her own place as my folks made it clear she could not do that at home. 

I was sooooo very against it to start with but I sat an listened to her plan and made it clear that I was most interested in her getting an education so she had 6 weeks to prove to me she was serious about it and show me that she could balance both. 

I am so glad I gave her that chance. Last weekend she moved out into her own place. She's a couple of weeks off graduating with incredible marks and her bosses think she is the best thing that ever happened to them. She has grown into a woman who I can respect and admire more and more every day.

My point is even if your aunt is skeptical about it if she cares enough she'll get on board and if you work you butt off she'll never regret it."
"These things, together with what you wrote, seem to me like warnings that he’s getting cold feet on committing to anything long term. That email he sent you about sacrificing independence and stuff sounded more like him trying to convince YOU that moving in together is a huge sacrifice and hardship.  Why?  Because he sees it that way and he’s not sure he wants to do that.

Moving in together can be nerve wracking because you hope for the absolute best, but it shouldn’t be THIS much of a struggle.  Moving in together should also, as a counterbalance to that nervousness, be genuinely exciting since you get to share your life with someone you love (and now rent costs half!).  I feel less like he’s nervous or being cautious and more like he’s a cat being put in a bathtub.  

I would make a plan B just in case his arbitrary five months happen and he still doesn’t want to move in together.  You’re moving to a new place, meeting new people, etc.  There should always be a plan B in case your plan A doesn’t work out, especially when fallout from Plan A could be super expensive."
Song as old as rhyme. 
"Also another reason to sit Thanksgiving out is that after a spell in hospital and a serious medical procedure, your immune system is borked and it's not a good idea to be around a tonne of people in a confined space at the start of cold and flu season.

Genuinely for the kid's physical health and the family's mental health I vote the OP stays home. And if the wider family make a fuss that a recently seriously ill 7 year old isn't up for socialising because she's convalescing, then that gives the OP more information about the situation.

The whole family should be prioritising the recovery of a sick possibly traumatised kid over the 'traditions' and social conventions of the wider family. 

Disclosure: I come from a family who prioritised small talk and turkey over my serious childhood ill health. It left me permanently disabled and immune suppressed with life long consequences and I don't have any communication with my entire family as an adult because they didn't care about a vulnerable kid.

OP, you do care about your kid. So remember not to make her feel responsible for not doing Thanksgiving or the adults being angry (kids often take responsibility for stuff like this like parents arguing and blame themselves and illness brings a lot of guilt and fear too.) 

Suggest that you Skype the grandparents/cousins if you stay home and maybe arrange a mini Thanksgiving afterwards or treat for the kids so neither son or daughter feel they've lost out on a holiday they love. This can make the sick kid feel like a burden and the healthy kid feel left out like no one cares about them because they aren't sick.

But yeah, sit the big family event out and concentrate on your nuclear family. Both your kids need a bit of fuss and you and your spouse need some breathing space.

Don't do this. If it's smart lights, it's likely the electrician won't even know how/what to fix; you'll just be wasting your money, because the problem is with how the lights are configured or the software. It also doesn't fix the root problem, which is how your husband is treating your concern."

"Your mother was explicitly clear.  She doesn't want to meet your gf, now or ever.

Why haven't you told your gf this, just as explicitly as your mother told you?  She deserves to know exactly how much your mother hates the idea of her existence.

Regarding the trip to get your car inspected:  You don't have to go to your hometown to get a car inspected.  You can cross the state line and go the nearest inspection station and get it done.

If you decide to combine getting the car inspected with a visit to your mother, *please* do not go there and pretend everything is fine and pretend your don't have a girlfriend and pretend your mother isn't insanely prejudiced.  Please don't fall for the ""it's my birthday so you have to act the way I want you to act"" ploy.

Before you go, you have to have a conversation with your mother about respecting your choices and keeping her ugly comments to herself.  If she responds with more drama and insults, you should rethink the idea of visiting her.

"All of this, except I would say don't judge any friendship with the doctor on whether or not he gives you a heads up because he's probably not allowed (and certainly not supposed) to give you a heads up. 

Honestly I'd seriously reconsider your husband in this situation.  He allowed your child to get injured (it sounds like a broken wrist?) doing something incredibly stupid -- trying to juggle your 3 mo old with the bags like he's the gallon of milk with too many bags of groceries. Most parts feel completely awful when their little babies are injured rather than thinking it's hilarious. Just to check, do you feel completely sure his version of what happened is the truth? If he dropped the 3 mo old while the 3 mo old was in a car seat, they usually recommend replacing the car seat. "
"You seriously need real therapy. Based on what you've said here, you are abnormally closed minded, unempathetic, callous, selfish, and scary jealous.

"Adding to u/imsmellycat's comment- you are being used as a pawn in a game that should have ended years ago. It's been almost fifteen years, and your mother has remarried. It's time for her to shut the fuck up about it and be an adult. 

It sounds like she's old enough that at this point, her changing is unlikely. I, and most people here, are going to recommend the same thing to you: that you distance yourself from the idea of a parent being someone that you love and support unconditionally, and distance yourself from her. Your dad many not have been a good husband, or even a great parent, but he is being a much much better parent now. Accepting financial help from him doesn't mean you condone cheating; it just means you're dedicated to getting a great education. Congrats on getting into school, OP! College is awesome :)"
He went into her room without permission and got under her bedcovers without permission in only his UNDERWEAR and asked her to have sex with him. I think it would be pretty reasonable for Michelle to have assumed he wasn't going to take no for an answer.
"&gt; During my pregnancy my husband frequently reminded me he didn't want the baby to change everything or become the center of our lives

Yeah, um, what? Of course having kids changes everything. You can work really hard to still get date time and friends time and whatnot, but about a month after giving birth? Of course your body and your mind aren't ready for too much social stuff yet!

This strangely reminded me of the Waitress film/musical, where a girl is in an abusive relationship, her husband gets her drunk and pregnant, she hides it and when he eventually finds out, he goes on and on about ""promise me you'll never love that baby more than you love me and I still come first"". Not saying you're in an abusive relationship, but his expectations of having kids sure don't seem to align with reality."
"Side with your wife.

I don’t know how true this is. My brother is child free and I 100% agree he’s not a person that should have kids. I’m a kindergarten teacher and I love children. I have 2 and one on the way. He’s is the best uncle I could ask for. He baby sits from time to time. Hangs out with my older child playing video games. We respect each other fully. Parents and child free people can completely get along when both people respect each other. SIL doesn’t respect OP. 
"My first impression upon reading this (and I could be completely wrong!) Tina has very low self-esteem. She enjoys the attention from your friendship and could possibly even considered trying to make it into more (again, I have no idea) Like you said, she has been very persistent and she initiated the contact to begin with! 

What concerns me is she rather controlling and possessive of someone who is a CASUAL friend. Additionally, she is attempting to control who and how her girlfriend interacts with others. Maybe she was worried Bette would get the wrong impression if you two really talked/hung out. I.e she may be worried Bette would conclude she had been trying to cheat? I'm thinking along the lines of Bette asking how you and Tina reconnecting and Bette feeling a little confused as to why her girlfriend is texting you constantly and seems determined to keep you guys separate. 

Another route... Tina likely knows that you and Bette would get along great (and then witnessed it) This is likely very threatening to her and she's just plain ol' jealous. I don't see any ill will with Alice. She just seems like she sees great aspects in her friends' personalities and enjoys bringing people together(I frequently do this with people I meet!)

All that being said, you are all adults and you can spend time with whoever you please! Like you've said, you have no malicious intentions and you actually like Bette as a potential friend! You don't owe Tina anything. In fact, it speaks volumes of how considerate and caring a friend you are that you were vigilantly worried about Tina's feelings the entire outing, despite you guys not being that good of friends! 

Bottom line, this is about Tina, not you. You and Bette are ""allowed"" to be friends! Good luck :)"
"Stop sharing gifts, or ask her to pick things up and tell her you'll pay her back, or tell her money's tight so you can't cover her share and need the money transferred first. Especially with things like a gift card she could order it online and do it herself.

Alternatively, just ask her! She might genuinely have forgotten and be mortified she let it slide - you're absolutely entitled to gently say ""could I could get your half of the money for Mary's gift card?"" While yes, the person ""borrowing"" money should remember and pay it back without asking, we live in the real world, and you've got to make at least a tiny effort to chase her up. Her reaction may well speak volumes - any version of ""of course! Sorry for the hold up"" followed by prompt payment, no worries. Any sort of delay/excuse/similar...OK, write off that amount, but then the next time she asks just politely decline, reminding her that last time you never got her share if you're feeling brave. It's not your job to be her piggy bank."
"To be blunt, you're basically asking if you should selfishly lead someone on by letting them think you see a future with them or if you should be honest about your feelings and let them choose to end things and find someone with compatible goals. The moral answer is pretty obviously the latter. "

I'd probably say something like ""Hey, you know, I feel bad that you guys are so stressed about all these extra people coming. I've decided not to attend then you will have an extra spot.""

Like others have said, something's not right about this, you don't uninvite someone with such short notice. A month would be shitty but understandable. But 4 days? No. They aren't being honest about their reason. 

I think you and your girlfriend should go have a nice night out instead!"
Wait so were you two talking before they even split?  You mentioned that she screen shot all of your conversations.  Was he cheating on her with you?  Also why would you get involved with a married man?  Why on earth would you even want to be with someone that left his wife of 15 years high and dry for some new chick?
"Man, internalized racism sucks.

Ultimately, though? It was a short relationship and she showed you that she was racist and primarily concerned with money, rather than building a sustainable, caring relationship. Being broken up is a good thing, because it will allow you to find someone who loves you for you."
Then it's a fair fight.  This is the only solution. 
"It kills me because I am such a tolerant person - so it kills me listening to this.

"I agree with you. I just think I have to have a conversation with them first about it and see how they feel before I could possibly explore the option of him meeting them. 

Another thing is that my parents don’t believe in dating, only courting. You should only be dating to get married, not dating just to date. If I bring him around, it should pretty much be because we have talked about marriage and want to do it. 

We want to spend the rest of our lives with each other but we haven’t spoken in depth about marriage. I just know that I’m happy with him now and I can see myself being happy with him for a while.  I wish that were enough."
"I'm appalled by some of these comments.  What this girl did to you was not okay, and being drunk does not excuse her actions.  Seriously, wtf.  That's fucking creepy as hell.

I'm a girl, and I'm not sure that I would necessarily confront someone who did this.  It depends on the situation, which you know better than the rest of us.  Is she a shitty person in general, or is this out of character?  Maybe it really was a one-off incident.  But I would for sure be on the lookout for any other weird behavior from her, and I would lock my door when she sleeps over in the future.

If she does suck, I would just bring it up in front of her boyfriend the next time you're hanging out.  ""Hey Sammy, remember when you tried to get into my bed that one time?  That was fucking weird.  What did you think when she told you about that, Tom?  Oh, she didn't mention it?  Weird."""

"This post was so upsetting. OP, you can leave. It will be awkward and painful, and then you will be *allowed to be alone sometimes.* You’ll be able to see friends on your own.

Please, *listen to your terror.* It is giving you valuable information. "
My sister had an ED (I guess she's still technically in recovery but she's doing well now) and she used to do this. I would find plastic baggies of chewed up food in her room. It's definitely disordered eating (my sister's ED caused a lot of health problems and she was alarmingly underweight). You can express your concerns but ultimately she needs to deal with this (or not) on her own. I can say it sucks to watch someone do stuff like this and it was really scary for me when my sister did this.
"This happened to a close friend of mine (she was the next girlfriend). Her husbands ex girlfriend broke up with him after 10 years because he was never ready for marriage. He got married to my friend after a year.

Honestly, Idk how you let this drag out for 10 years if marriage is important to you. You guys should've known where things stand. Marriage doesn't change anything, if you're happy, living together and have jobs, what's the deal about not being ready? You guys are going to go back to your same lives and routine except you're now husband and wife. 

My current SO doesn't believe in marriage too, for the same reason, saying its just a society thing and it has no point. I made it very clear from the start (like after dating for 2 months lol). I told him I understood how he felt about marriage but it's important to me and I want to get married one day, if it was something he couldn't accept that we should end things. He accepted it and said that if it was something that important to me that he'd do it. "
"I agree with this comment!

I worked at my first job with a girl who was very sociable and bubbly. I really disliked her at first, because I thought she was super fake – when she spoke to people she would always sound so *interested* and asked so many questions, even if they were just talking about boring shit, like they'd say 'My husband works as a bricklayer' and she'd say 'Oh cool, does he like his job?' and I would think 'You can't possibly care about this person's husband and his stupid bricklaying job!'

Guess what? After about six months most people in the workplace loved her and helped her out when she needed, while they all hated me and thought I thought I was too good for them (which, in hindsight, I definitely did!). Once I started copying this girl's behaviour – basically just asking questions and acting interested in what other people had to say – I started to get along *much* better with others and do better in the workplace. (I also learnt that *maybe* at 18 I didn't know *everything* and that other people had valuable insights and opinions and interesting things to say...)

Anyway, I might be off base here, but in my experience a lot of people who struggle socially are invested in this idea of sincerity or authenticity – they see it as dishonest or deceitful to pretend they're interested when they aren't, or ask questions about things they don't really care about just to be polite. Someone's who's socially extroverted might not always be as 100% interested in whatever the other person is saying, but they're making an effort to make the other person *feel* like they are, because often they're more interested in how the other person feels than in how *they* feel.

Anyway, OP: being introverted and enjoying independence is totally fine. Like other people have said, though, it's prudent to think about how you're perceived at work and how other people are reacting to you. It seems silly, but when I was 18 it was *such* a revelation to me that simply 1. asking question and 2. acting interested in people's answers made a massive difference to how I was perceived and treated at work. I had thought that so long as I did my job well I'd be fine and that would be it, but I hadn't factored in the fact that I would be working *with* other people, and that the bonds I formed with those people were *crucial* to any success I wanted to achieve. 

If that sounds mercenary to you, I think it's better to think of it like: when I was being 'authentic' about what and who I was interested in, I was hurting other people's feelings and making the workplace less enjoyable for them; when I was more considerate of other people's feelings, I was making it *more* enjoyable for them. You don't have to switch to being bubbly social butterfly extrovert overnight, but if ay of this rings true it might be worth making a bit more effort to get along with the people you work with!"

"Everything you're saying is hitting home for me. I know this isn't realistic or going to solve my problems, but what really discourages me is that he doesn't even notice.

17 years old is hardly someone irresponsible for their actions. At 17 I was living on my own and attending university, owned a car, traveled internationally, etc. 

The trust isn't gone because the sister 'liked' the makeup, it's because she stole the makeup and lied about it. 

I don't know that it warrants a police response, but it certainly warrants her financially reimbursing the girlfriend, being grounded, having privileges removed (cell phone, car, activities) and a curfew. This is especially true if the makeup was as expensive as OP implied. 

But no, according to devil's advocate here we should though her a parade. "

"I may be a cynic, but I'm wondering if your brother has ""changed"" and wants his sister because he sees that sister giving out money to mum and dad and thinks he might have someone new to bankroll him, yay!

Honestly, yes: tell him how you feel. It doesn't have to be a screaming match, you could write him a letter if you wanted, but there's no need to hand over your emotions to him like your parents handed over their cash. There's a decent chance that, like before, all he'll do is squander it.

If you want to know if he's really changed, ask him how he's planning on paying your idiot parents back for draining them dry. You say he has a job now? Does he have a payment plan to return a decent proportion of the sums he lied to get? If not... no, he hasn't changed. He's just pretending to because he wants something.

And stop giving your parents money. 10-12K! Your brother can give them cash if they need it. They're treating you like he treated them... as a bank. It's not sustainable, and resentment's only going to grow. If they're that apologetic they can go sit on your brother's doorstep to keep from starving, if necessary.   "
"Okay OP, there are a lot of ridiculous replies to this. No your bf doesn't have autism - he is just into ""shit memes"" aka internet jokes that are funny because they are obviously trolling the person receiving the joke. 

The outsider circle would be people who think these kinds of jokes are funny. Maybe look up fuckjerry on instagram and follow similar accounts and you'll start to get it as you get deeper into meme culture.

Honestly, you're being uptight. You don't need to understand every aspect of your boyfriend's humor. I don't think it is dismissive of him to say ""if you don't know, don't worry about it"" - you're not going to understand why the joke is funny, and the joke *is not serious*."
"There is a huge range of condoms to experiment with. Hes never even tried them. 

There is also a huge variety of non PIV sex that has no risk of pregnancy. Some women prefer them because they can be more focused on female pleasure. If he absolutely wanted no condoms you two could still be sexually intimate.

That he is telling you no sex without hormonal birth control is just selfish and unreasonable.

Its really hard to believe that a genuinely caring man in every other area could be a selfish lover. It seems more likely that he is ""caring"" as long as your needs dont interfere with his wants."
The idea isn’t to live in the shelter permanently. They want to help you find a job and a home so they can make room for the next person in crisis.

"&gt;she’s basically calling me a fraud

With all due respect, if I had donated and the money was no longer being used under the circumstances described, I, too, would be calling you a fraud.  I would find it very disrespectful for you to not honor my intentions.

I do not think you need a legal consultation. I think you need to give the money back to the people who donated it. As someone else in the thread has already said, you would be legally and morally absolved."

"It's not your appearance if you're getting a match a day on Tinder. What are your asks like for first dates?

Also, you should expect a super low 2nd date rate. I think a few years ago I was on OkC and out of around 30 meets, only 6-7 had a sequel. Most of the time we met and there was just no connection."
Who the hell tells someone to get tattoos to attract a date? That’s bizarre. 
"Yes! This is really important. My boyfriend was worried about my sleeping habits as well when we got together. I ignored him, but later it turned out I have a mild degree of narcolepsy. So he was right.

He was never angry at me though - sounds like you're actually blaming her for being tired..?"
"Yup. Historically speaking most people didn’t live with separate bedrooms until relatively recently. Even the king and queen had people walking through their bedroom and used the curtains for privacy.

"I agree that OP telling him about things could come off badly. Also, what is he supposed to do with this information?  She doesn't have any insecurities about it and even if she did it's not fair to make somebody apologize for their past sexual experience.

You don't have to explicitly tell her you know she bated next to you-just have a casual, open discussion about sex, maybe something you'd like to try that you think she's be open to doing, etc.  "
People like you should simply not have kids. Your daughter has every right to be upset. Stop making excuses for your husband and care for your daughter.
"I think that's fair enough. Theoretically, if I got the youngest three all asleep at the same time, a daytime nap could be in the cards. 

I hear.. whiskey works well? :)

I think the bigger issue is that I *feel* (not necessarily what is occurring) that as he is moving up conventionally he is finding ways to disengage and minimize interactions with family. The deprecating comments are certainly new. I was even more surprised he implied that our 6 yo shouldn't need to pick up his dirty clothes. He has a mom for that, and he is clearly the son of the great and powerful Oz and all should bow to him. 

I mean, I made him. For DH to imply that he is too good to hamper his dirty shorts and instead tell me to take care of it is just... insulting, not to mention out of context and unnecessary. "
"I read all your responses and I’m sorry to say but, I think this is dead in the water. Locking her social media down while simultaneously claiming there’s nothing to see there? No. But the biggest thing is, her mother knowing about this all along. She is not a friend of your relationship. Can you really see this going anywhere knowing her mom was complicit in this? Like, how do you see that panning out in the future?"
Id phrase it as stress-its putting stress on you and on the relationship and causing you to question the delay.
"Your husbands plan makes absolute sense. You not in a position to contribute to the household yet, or pay for your own car. So far he's doing all the financial liftig in this relationship.

Take and drive the CRZ until you actually need a family car, by that time features/models will have changed and you're going to get more for you money. Right now you're sounding like a gold digger.

break up with him (seriously, relationship should NOT look like this. If he's annoying you that much after two months then it's a huge red flag that you're not good with each other. Also, he doesn't even care about your day and is not interested in conversation with you)
work on your mental health before another relationship /go to the therapist /whatever helps you, but do not make your happiness someone else's responsibility, because that's just the wrong way to do this.

"I completely agree with his wife about her thoughts on rehoming the dog. As someone who fosters animals,  it's so upsetting and infuriating to see so many people just rehome their animals in their senior years, as if it has no impact on the animal. Can you imagine what it would feel like to live with a family your entire life and then just be thrown away into a new home. How awful. Animals are attached to their owners, it is a sad thing to rehome a senior animal. Not to mention, not too many people want to take on senior animals with their issues. I say this as someone who fosters special needs and senior animals. Why do I end up having a ton of older foster cats? Because no one wants them.  Also, it's really not that hard to travel with pets. I grew up overseas and and in every country which we lived, we accumulated another cat or dog. We were the family that had six dog and cat crates during a move from South Africa to Germany.  I'm not so sure I would recommend that with an older dog, but the younger ones can definitely swing it. Anyway, her email was completely uncalled for and I suspect that this has way more to do with things beyond dogs. And honestly, if it was solely about the dogs, she completely lost them with the delivery of her message. She was hoping to have them "" see the light ,"" she can forget about that."
"You're an idiot. 

&gt;I tell her we should break up amicably because we only just started dating and going from just started dating to long distance immediately is a tough situation to be in. We mutually agree on this.

This? This was smart. This was the mature, intelligent, responsible approach. 

&gt;The entire time I will talk to her for maybe 15-30 minutes a day because I'm trying to maintain a friendship with her.

This is where you are an idiot. 

People cannot jump from ""romantically attracted"" to ""platonic friendship"" in an instant. This person was **clearly** and **obviously** still enamored of you

&gt; we are still talking 2 or 3 times a week and both somewhat affectionate with one another however we aren't dating.

Again, you're an idiot. Or, you were getting an ego boost from stringing this girl along. Either way, this is **obviously** not how you treat your other friends, and while you clearly enjoyed the attention, it was also clearly not in keeping with your previously smart idea of breaking things off with her. 

Idiot or jerk, I guess. Your call.

&gt; She then gets into a rage and the next hour is spent over the phone trying to calm her down (honesty, in this case, screwed me)

Tell me, if *any* of your other friends flew into a rage at you over something so trivial, if any of your *other* friends insisted on controlling your friendships, would you give them even 5 minutes of your attention before hanging up? Or would you say ""Hey, you might be my friend, but that's out of line. Call me when you're not being a jerk"" and hang up?

Because right now, ""jerk who strings along a woman for an ego boost"" is pulling ahead of ""idiot who just doesn't get women"".

&gt; The next day she calls me again to pick a fight, and we do. The next day, the same

So at 32, are you experienced enough to know when someone's trying to pick a fight? And if you are, why are you going along with it? Why are you fighting with an ex-girlfriend who's going to live far away and who you dated for less than 6 weeks? 

And after the first time, why fall for the same thing a second time in a row? Nope, it's pretty clear you're getting off on the attention and the drama, that you're stringing her along. Because there's no other good reason why you wouldn't block her number and move on with your life, except for the gleeful rush you get of toying with her emotions. 

&gt;Recently over the course of a week or so we get back into pleasant friendly terms over phone calls.

Yup. You're a douche-bag, not an idiot. 

&gt;Now I'm an asshole...

Yup.

&gt;... my ex feels like a ""fool,""...

...because you kept stringing her along with no intention of dating her, yeah. 

&gt;...I'm still getting phone calls and texts...

...because you're too stupid to block her number, or because you're still getting off on watching her dance around to your tune. 

&gt;...I genuinely care about my ex...

No you don't. If you genuinely cared, you would have broken up and not kept talking to her. If you genuinely cared, when she blew up at you, you would realized her reaction was inappropriate because she wasn't over you, and you would have hung up and blocked her number. If you genuinely cared, when she called to pick a fight, *you would have refused to do so*, and told her to stop calling. 

You're like a kid tormenting a fly that's had a wing pulled off. You just keep poking and prodding to watch it twitch. 

Block her number. Stop answering her calls and texts. Block emails and any other form of contact she uses. Walk away."
"Not shitty per se, but you knew they knew each other, and got involved regardless, and...well, actions have consequences. You have every right to sleep with whoever you want, they have every right to be pissed about it. And if you KNEW they worked with your ex husband...well, what outcome were you really expecting? The only damage control you can really try is apologising to them both, but I'm not sure how genuine that will sound given it was hardly an accident - you're not sorry you did it, you're just sorry they found out and got mad.

"Nah, i'd end it. Your fiancée could've called your mom and ask her to help out if it really was an emergency. Instead she actually left your pet in filth, with the thought to clean up on the last day, so you wouldn't see the evidence of her neglect. 

This is not a case of someone who never had a pet and doesn't know better. This is someone who was deliberate in her planning, it would score her some bonus points with you and the dog wouldn't bother own dayplans. That's a psycho.

Break up, maybe Maya can help her out with it. "
oh man..... I am so sorry. I cant imagine if someone did that to my dog. I hope he pulls through. I am just so sorry that you are having to deal with this. 
"Dude, this a terrible story but your friend is a trainwreck and no catcher in the rye can save you from yourself. He will either choose to change his life or die but nothing you can do will change his course. Sorry about that."
"I really disagree with this. As a kid, my parents didn't tell me much of what was going on because they didn't want to worry me. This left me confused and frustrated in difficult situations. I just wanted to understand what was going on. Be upfront with the kids now, and be completely open and honest with them. Let them ask questions, and answer them truthfully and bluntly. They will appreciate it in the future, even if they don't now. If you don't want to do it, at the very least answer their questions when they ask, because they will at some point. "
"I can tell you with absolute certainty that if he’s worth it, he won’t care. I feel like as soon as the first fart slips out in a relationship, that’s when the real comfort sets in. I held them in for months and it was so painful, but now my partner and I joke and laugh about it."
"Yup. He likely is not allowed to have this thing in the building. Possibly not allowed to own it in the state at all. OP and her boyfriend could be looking at eviction and possible lawsuits from any bitten neighbors. Any dead pets may also be looked at with suspicion. 

Dumb pet owner all around."
There are bad lawyers as well as bad doctors. 
"Sister works for low-pay at a non-profit, husband is an intern, and they can't afford to rent this place with their own money.  There's as close to a 0% chance as you can get that they'd be able to adequately be able to pay for full restoration costs from damages caused by their dogs.

Not only that, but it's really pretty absurd to knowingly put a historic home like that in a situation where it WILL suffer damage and disrepair, and it's pretty rude and inconsiderate of OP to ask this of his wife.  "
"She doesn't want you, but she also doesn't want you to think she's a horrible person. "
"The daughter has probably very conflicting feelings about whether OP has done enough to shield her from the abuse. That's perfectly normal and perfectly understandable, and does not mean the mother is guarding some kind of draconian secret."

He's physically abusive. Dump him. You deserve better.
"&gt;and I am incredibly upset that she would do something like this

This implies you're surprised.

This ""friend"" of yours has, by your own admittance, never had very much respect over your ability to choose a mate. She not only is constantly trying to hook you up with people, she *actively dismisses your own choices* to the point of encouraging a creepy guy to cling to the idea of you.

She doesn't think you're capable of making your own romantic decisions. She doesn't respect your opinions or your choices. 

That is not a friend. A friend respects you and your decisions and doesn't try to go around them, much less in such horrible childish and downright gross ways."
"There are lots of MLM horror stories, but the long and short of it is that they actually encourage this sort of behavior. You're supposed to sell to your family and friends and if they don't buy it's because they don't support you and blah blah blah. It's really toxic. "
"&gt;She stormed into our apartment 2 hours ago and looked devastated, almost as if her family member died or something and locked herself in a bathroom. 

I don't think he's the only one creating drama"
"OP, I didn’t even get all the way through this before I became mortified on your behalf. Your boyfriend’s genuinely a loser. 

Wouldn’t you rather be with someone who’s significantly less embarrassing?"
"I think those things are way beyond triggers - isn't he just repeating the abuse? You asked him to stop and he carries on doing it, that's horrible. That's abuse in my opinion. I know you want to normalise it but as an outsider it sounds really bad to me. :("
"Sounds like cats. Lazy as hell all day and then run around like they're being chased by demons, then back to sleeping. Twice a day, at like dawn and dusk."
"GO TO YOUR DREAM SCHOOL. There is nothing that should stop you from getting that leg up in life. No sane parent would want thier child to be deprived of opprotunity. Your mother is not acting rationally. Inform your step-father of your choice before you tell your mother. When you tell your mother tell her this doesn't change how much you love her but if she chooses to see it as a betrayal, there is nothing you can do to change that.

Consider getting her committed like others have said but i feel like your step-father should take the lead on those choices because he has chosen to be with your mother for better or for worse, sickness and in health yadda yadda yadda.

"So every time you now have an issue with your wife , you go and sleep with the classmate? "
It's probably going to be very hard for his children to ever come to terms with their relationship when OP and her husband act like they did nothing wrong and that it's the mom's fault and the kid's fault (and everyone else's!) that things aren't great and people don't accept them.
"I can't think of any other times she hasn't believed me about something. She follows rules with the kids like they are carved in stone, she even tells her other kids about our family's rules and tries to get them to follow, because she thinks we're such great parents. It's kind of sweet."
She shouldn't be living with roommates in the first place.
I know it sucks. It’s really sad. No one here knows 100 percent but I would follow the advice above by not admitting how you know or how much you know and start from there. He will admit to some things or act like he doesn’t care at all. Either way you’ll have your answer. 
"I think you're being rather unreasonable here. Your first baby is very young, you have plenty of time to try for another child after this trip, and the more kids you have, the less you'll be able to travel! It's kinda crazy to me you wanna back out of the trip just because your extremely rigid ""children two years apart"" is not panning out exactly as you wanted it to. "
"Gifts are a powerful way to manipulate people. Gifts can make you feel indebted, honestly. My best friend berated me when she felt that I wasn't prioritizing our friendship ( knowing that I was busy and ill ) by saying ""I hope you enjoy all the shit I got you."" I immediately shrunk and felt terrible for trying to ... stand up for myself?

If your boyfriend brings up gifts when you argue, chances are? It's a way to control you --- it's an attempt to guilt you. He may not be aware of the way he treats gifts in a relationship. When I pointed the behaviour out to my friend, I got an apology and total understanding when I chose to put the friendship on pause because of my discomfort. I would try to point it out, but be safe.

Also, I can't even touch on the boob job thing. Have you expressed insecurities about your boobs? Is this something he just ... decided for  you without knowing how you feel?"
"It's shitty and unfair, but I'd suck it up for the ride. But another conversation has to happen. He has to realize that even if it doesn't seem like a big deal to him, these are big issues to you and if you don't start seeing changes that it could negatively affect the future of your relationship. 
I'd suck it up for the ride because if you do see a long term relationship with him, it'd suck to do that to childhood friend. Plus, you can look at it as a silver lining kind of thing and get to know him (and by relation, your boyfriend) better."
I live in SF. You cannot be thinking of giving up a rent controlled apartment within walking distance of your work for this guy. 
"You need to make an appt with an attorney who understands military divorces. Certain rules are in place to protect deployed personnel which might work against you. A lawyer can tell you what you can do while he's deployed. It doesn't matter when you divorce as he'll blame you and deflect so just get it done. 
He's totally deflecting on you during calls due to his own personal issues. It's not you, it's him. Plus, you don't need to talk about such daily mundane stuff or even communicate every day. You have total control over communication. He is intrusive or coming at you, hang up, click off Skype or whatever. Take control. You'll feel a ton better. Hang in there and trust yourself to get through this. Know your rights and his responsibility to the kids. "
"Try to come up with other ways to honor her memory. Maybe a jewelry box you can gift your daughter with late MIL's photo, something nice. 

Your child is not going to be a living, breathing memorial to this woman and it's unfair of him to expect you to settle with a name you're unhappy with. You offered a compromise and he shut it down. Naming your first child is a huge deal and he (and his fam) should not get to take that away when it should be a JOINT decision between you and husband. "
"You seem not because he would have to walk back alone, putting him in greater danger than you were. "
"If he owns the house, you need to secure your next living situation. You *absolutely do not* have to confront him about this in a timely fashion; you have the upper hand and you should take advantage of that.

Sit on this for a while but get ready to move out; get yourself off the bills, slowly move things out when you can (small things, out of season clothes, documents) and then, when you have a spot locked down to move into and you're ready, confront him about his cheating. Because he is. You know he is. We all know he is. But if he's the last to know that you know, you can better protect yourself.

Good luck."
"There's no convincing someone who thinks they have the world before them. He thinks he's going to live the good life and fuck who he pleases. Let that sink in. Any thought of you went out the door the moment he realized this was an option. It also reveals his character. No, he decides he can't exercise self control and be faithful, he'd rather go for the shallow and meaningless and ditch a good thing. It's hard to face when it's been a long relationship already, but take it as a sign. He's willing to abandon you when the first real temptation comes along. Not good relationship material."
Did you only move in together after getting married?
"Second this. Have video, voice recording or someone over. Her word against yours and chances are she’ll say she was the one being abused. "
"Yeah, that was pretty shitty of him. No pun intended. Only exclusive for 2 months? That's a dealbreaker ladies."
"He sounds like a really self-absorbed guy.

He immediately assumes you're trying to manipulate him - you did nothing to deserve this. I wonder if he's projecting.

The ""just being logical"" part also rubs me the wrong way.

How would you even go about continuing the relationship after he did this? Are you going to apologize to him for being sick? If you just continue like nothing happened, he'll take it as you admitting you were trying to manipulate him. What is he going to do the next time you have a flare up?

I wouldn't be able to trust him after this."
Both of these comments made me cry with joy for you.  What wonderful SOs.
Yeah. They sound like he's military. He's got a typical first or second enlistment car and he wants his wife to drive a piece of shit so he can do what he wants. 
His dad made his mom cry and suffer. It appears he talked to you about things he shouldn't have concerning his marriage. You shouldn't be surprised that his son doesn't like you.
"Yeah, I used to be like this guy. I liked trying out new gadgets and had an incredibly high tolerance for troubleshooting, so the headaches she describes were worth it to me.

"No 18 year old is going to be psyched about their parents getting married. My parents divorced when I was around that age and I was SO FURIOUS when they started dating and took it so personally.

&gt;She said her whole life had been this game of what's with mom and dad today,

From everything you've said, this is true. So why not support her in her desires to go to school somewhere with distance? Help her find her own identity outside of your drama and become her own person. 

&gt;we thought this wedding was like a new beginning.

It's not for her. She's an adult now and her childhood will always be the crappy one.

I think if you don't want to lose your relationship with your daughter you need to ride this out and support her with whatever she wants to do. She's an adult now. You can't stop her from making whatever decisions she chooses to make. Don't act injured or heartbroken that she's asserting herself as an adult and trying to gain some independence from you."

"So you had consensual sex with your boss to get more perks at work, kept having sex with him for a year because you knew you would get raises and other things. And you're the victim now? He didn't ""groom"" you, you're a 29 year old woman so take some responsibility for you cheating on your husband.

You chose to take him up on whatever he offered you for sex because it put you ahead, not because he ""groomed"" you. With the way the world works, you'll probably lose your marriage but sue your boss for a few hundred grand. Your husband is the only victim here and I hope he leaves you as soon as you tell him so he can move on and be with someone else."

Stoic does not necessarily have to mean ""without an understanding of love"". My partner is incredibly stoic and slow to warm up to people, but communicates every day how much he loves me. There is no doubt about his feelings. If someone can't even express that after three years, staying for another 3, 10 or 20 isn't going to change that. He will not suddenly warm up and open up like a flower. This is who he is. And you deserve better. "
"You're not being unreasonable at all. If you don't want to have sex with him, then don't, period. Don't feel guilty or selfish. You explained to him why you're not initiating, and he's done nothing to hold up ""his end of the deal"" so to speak. "

"&gt; He loves the size of your chest

Have you seen a cows udder? The only thing his nickname implies is saggy, its a loathsome disgusting nickname with negative connotations I'm not sure how you're trying to spin this.

&gt;I give nicknames for my dates in order to differentiate them to my friends and brother.

That's why they have names, degrading the people you sleep to the other men in your life based on their physical assets is objectification and you're flexing your ego when you emphasize their physical traits. You really don't have to label them anything you wouldn't say to their face.

&gt;Tell him you learned that he nicknamed you Cow Tits and you hate the name, especially because you're sensitive about the size of your chest. 

No, because its derogatory. This is not a problem related to her self esteem, this is a problem with how he views women and how its affected the woman he loves and compounded her humiliation to ALL the men in his life and reduced her to a pair of breasts. 

You're trying to downplay it, the occasional nick for the occasional date is different from a nasty nickname you've kept for your wife of 6 years. And one even your dad is privy to, he does not respect her, he is not the man she thought he was."
"In the very least your sister should have to apologize to your girlfriend. Stealing isn’t a good thing to sweep under the rug, shes not a child.... she’s almost 18. If she gets caught shoplifting/stealing she will face fines and consequences.

When you say your girlfriend works for a makeup brand as a “distributor” do you mean she works for an MLM makeup brand? If so, I’d imagine she’s probably still paying for all of that stuff. Even if she has plenty of makeup, and even if she got it for free from her company, it’s still theft. "

I do. ""Sorry I got caught"" is not the same thing as ""sorry I did it""."
"His message ticks me off. It's as if he's demanding your time. And his tone does not imply reconciliation or truce, he sounds hostile and demanding. I would just ignore the message completely.

"This astute observation is exactly what I wanted to say.  When husband and OP began their relationship he wasn't looking for a partner or an equal, he was looking for confirmation that his ex wife was wrong.

"1. I have a bachelors degree and professional certification in the field I wanted to work in. I lived in a big city and got calls for interviews, and my career would/should have taken off. But in order to stay close to HIS family (with sisters who do not give two craps about us and never meet us or socialize with us), we moved to rural town in pennsylvania. I was unable to find employment here suited to my background/education. That's why I've been home. 
2. ""sent to daycare part time for some reason"" came off very judgmental. We had a colicky baby who has now turned high needs. we send him to daycare because he gets bored and restless at home and extremely cranky/fussy and can't get anything done around the house. he enjoys the time he spends there and it's good for not only me but him as well. I don't sit on my butt while he's at daycare either, i'm either cleaning, doing, laundry, doing groceries and catching up on other duties. keep in mind, we have no help with the baby. his mother acts like she's doing us a huge favor for watching him, and that's why we concluded to send him to daycare.
3. i don't have a problem with him helping his family out, what i have a problem with helping is their attitude towards to him and how his sisters have NO respect whatsoever for him, and this is deemed perfectly ok/normal in the house, and yet they stuff the ""you're the eldest son so you have to help pay for their weddings"" down his throat, without making any effort on their part to help fix the relationship. when we're fighting, they constantly ask us to come over. but when we do, no one bothers to ask them to come downstairs in their own home in our presence, why?

"I think you are wrong.  The relationship can be good and solid but an asshole will cheat because he wants it all, the social standing of a husband with an adoring wife and child and he wants the thrill of an illicit affair.  .  Cheaters, liars, they do it for the thrill of it.  Scum of the earth."
"Hey OP, on top of everything else that is going wrong here, don't ever let him pull the 'I paid for it' card over it again. You are raising his 2 young children, and with very little help from him by the sounds of it. Next time he pulls that hand him a bill for 2 years of Childcare.

I'm going to be very very blunt with you, you have no say in this. This is not your house, your parents don't have a problem with it, so you need to either suck it up or move out.

"Defining cheating is up to you, but no, I wouldn't consider a peck to be cheating. Not for me, anyway. I give my family members pecks on the cheek.

"&gt;Did I completely overreact to what he said?

You didn't overreact to what he said, that's really shitty to hear. But you also care too much about what he thinks. You don't need a proper goodbye or apology from an asshole. Keep your head held high and move on. 

You admitted to being more into this guy than he was into you, and I don't think that's a healthy dynamic in a FWB situation anyways. He's asked you to stop texting him, and I would happily oblige. "
"I see so many red flags here beyond the actual porn. His anger/breaking things is another sign of a lack of impulse control. I also find how you said ‘put him on a pedestal like everyone thinks he should’ concerning. That sounds a lot like narcissism. Plus, your sweet mom deciding to cut you off? Do you think that was purely her decision and thought processes that lead to that decision? 

You are clearly in a lot of distress. You’ve been pushed into making a decision that will lead to hurt no matter what. You reaching out like this I think shows that you can’t just bury this and pretend it never happened for the sake of keeping the peace. That’s a good thing. You have strong morals and even at 11 knew to trust your gut. Trust it again. I think speaking face to face, just the two of you, would be the best. You need to see his facial expressions and body language. If it’s that important, make it happen. 

I wouldn’t be accusatory or angry when you speak to him. Don’t frame it as a confrontation. Just say dad I saw what was on your computer when I was a kid and I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind since then. Gauge his reaction and go from there. Be silent. Let him speak. If he gets angry or denies it try to stay as calm as possible and just keep repeating ‘I know what I saw’. Don’t waver. Be strong. His reactions should tell you everything you need to know. Prepare yourself for lies and deflections. Prepare to get disowned. It’s going to be hard and it’s going to hurt.

A lot of times doing the right thing hurts you and not the person it should. But know there is potentially a lot of hurt you’re preventing for innocent children. If you can’t get over this and have a relationship with your father that is ok. You, your feelings, and your mental health are way more important than protecting the feelings or reputation of someone that has done such horrific things. 

"
"So you've explicitly made it clear to him that this is something that you're willing to consider divorce over? If you have and he hasn't listened, then you're free to follow through. He's the one not listening, here. I have a feeling he's probably not taking it seriously. "
Stop trying to have a talk. You aren't going to get through to him. Your dad is a toxic and abusive person. Realize his talk and threats as the manipulation it is and don't hesitate to call the police if he threatens anything dumb. Make plans to move out and follow through. I promise you'll start feeling better as soon as you leave your dad.
You are an adult who can hire a lawyer yourself. Leave your dad out of it but it sounds like you have your own case.

"&gt;I feel like telling Ralph about Hannah's past would be a gross violation  
  
You are correct about that. That is for them to discuss between themselves.    
  
&gt;but does he deserve to know?   
  
Do you think knowing about Hannah's past would be a problem for him?  The main thing that stands out to me is that she was being irresponsible about protection.  Otherwise, getting drunk, hooking up, having FWBs in your 20s are not things to be ashamed of.  Plus, it sounds like she hasn't been acting that way for a few years now.  I mean, would telling him be an attempt to sabotage their relationship because it feels icky to you?  
  
&gt;Moreover, is this really freaking creepy or is it just me?  
  
I think it's just you. And, I can understand from your perspective why it might feel creepy if you really feel like you are siblings.  But...you're not, they're not.  And it sounds like your brother wasn't as close with her through the years anyway.   If they are happy together, you should let them be happy. "

Now he might be enjoying your pain...but he still chose to stay.  So there must be a spark in there.  Insist on some marital counseling to see if you two can bring your relationship back to a healthy one.

Otherwise...seriously get divorced.  Sometimes the damage is too great and there is no coming back."

"Did you tell Molly you were going to hang out with Paige alone? Seems reasonable for someone to think the other is sneaking around if they aren't being completely transparent with them. Sounds like Molly is a little jealous/worried, so showing her that she's the only girl for you would certainly put her mind at ease. But also, if Molly feels uncomfortable about your relationship with Paige, then you should probably not hang out with Paige alone out of respect for Molly. And if you don't think you can do that, then maybe this is a sign of deeper problems in your relationship."
"&gt;Can someone just please tell me if I'm crazy?

Uh, no. If anything, you’re underreacting to what is an incestuous relationship. Their relationship is definitely emotionally incestuous (they treat each other like husband and wife) and I wouldn’t be remotely surprised if it was physical too. No normal man calls his own mother a MILF, buys her lingerie or discusses her breast size. 

Divorce Norman Bates as soon as you can. None of this is normal or acceptable."

I know!  It's doubly weird because I asked for advice about how to talk to her about it!
"It'll probably be a TIFU post. ""TIFU by killing my step-mother with a condom"""
"I think their sudden interest is suspicious- sounds like they see how well she is doing and remember how much money they received for her care - might make it worth it to try and gain guardianship over her to have a source of income they don’t have to work for. Especially since you mentioned a loss of job that your father had and that he was too stressed to find another because of your sister. 

It’s also suspicious that they suddenly wanted to be in your sisters life again see how “changed” she is. As if they couldn’t bother to be in it when she was “difficult”. 

You can do a wait and see - invite them out to the park for a visit - etc - but I would be very very very careful - I know the son in you wants to believe that your parents can be good caring people - but you have to look at their past actions - as well as their current behavior if you do let them back in. 

Just because people are parents doesn’t make them good people. They still have to adhere to being decent human beings and being your parents doesn’t give them a pass on shitty behavior. 

It’s awesome that you are taking care of your sister and that she is for the better for it. Good luck with this situation- I wish you and your sister the best.

She's likely depressed from feeling rejected. "
"You are worried about what your co-workers think, but what you should be worried about is how you are ever going to leave your son with his idiot father again. You need to handle this in a way that gets his attention and doesn't result in him trying to joke it all off. Seriously."

"This is certainly a stretch, but is there any way he's gotten his hands on performance-enhancing drugs? It's normal for an adolescent boy to have outbursts, they are basically giant bundles of hormones, but for it to be going on this long suggests maybe something else is in play. It could just be that he's having a hard time at school or with friends or a girl.

Regardless, if this is new behavior I think you need to sit down and talk with him about productive ways to express frustration and anger. Also give him the opportunity to tell you exactly how he's feeling. He may still be raging because he hasn't been able to express his disappointment and he's dwelling on it."

It wasn't. Don't let this turn into you being wrong for snooping. Randomly snooping on your partner's phone is wrong, but this wasn't random. You had cause - a series of suspicious actions - and the fact he's got her name in his contacts under a code is super shady."

"&gt; I am scared she'll be mad at him and hurt and not understand

Yes, she probably will be confused at the very least. But kids are extremely resilient and adaptive so she will adjust. She’s not going to be mad at her dad at 16 over a woman he dated when she was 6. (I don’t mean that to trivialize your role in her life; you’re obviously very important. But she will move on and forget and make new memories). 

I totally get why you’d feel guilty but there isn’t any “wrong” decision here. 

&gt; What if he does get married and she gets a step mom and she bonds with her and is over me.

I wouldn’t worry so much about her bonding with someone else, as kids can love more than one person. But I think a new step mommy might be tempted to create some distance between you guys. And that’s going to be tough on you. 

&gt; I also am worried about seeing him with another girl, but that mainly my own jealousy, and I think I could work through it for Sarah.

Well, if you’re up for it then you can try! I’ve never been able to get over a guy without cutting contact, at least for a little while. That’s just how I am when I love someone. But you may be more capable than I am in that area!"

"Since you've already panic-lied, I think that the best way to handle this is head-on. It's always better to tell your own story, where you can properly frame it, than to wait to be caught out. Rather than waiting for him to bring up your family again, pick a quiet evening and sit him down and say something like:

""John, this is a very difficult topic for me to talk about, but you're becoming very important to me, and I don't want this to come between us. You've asked about my family, and in the moment I panicked and told you something that's not true. The truth is that I had a difficult childhood and I'm estranged from my family members because they were involved in some bad and illegal things. It was so ingrained in me that this is something that could never be talked about, that it's hard for me to open up and discuss what went on. They don't live in Florida, they're in Queens, but I've done my best to leave that life and all that went with it behind. Opening up about this with you is scary for me, and I don't feel ready to go into all the gory details, but I wanted you to know why I've been evasive and to come clean about the fact that they are not in Florida.""

And here's the wonderful news, OP: This nice man is a child psychiatrist. There is no better person to understand the kind of pressure you've been under all your life, and the reasons you had for your kneejerk lie about Florida. He's seen children from difficult backgrounds his entire career, and he will know the kind of scars that are left and carried into adulthood. I don't know him and I can't promise anything, but if I had to bet? He absolutely won't judge you for your family's actions, and he will appreciate the bravery it took to tell him the truth. 

You also don't have to dump all the info all at once! As he proves himself a worthy and understanding confidante, you may feel more and more comfortable opening up about the past. But it's totally acceptable to give him the barebones, broad overview and then wait until you feel more secure to decide to share any more."
"&gt;he tells me that fighting with me makes him want to kill himself as I'm selfish for wanting to live on our own.

That is a **bright red flag**. Family issues aside, he's either mentally unwell or incredibly manipulative. And he proposed as soon as you met?! Yeah, this is all kinds of unhealthy."
"I know everyone is jumping to call him sexist. But... 

You made a pretty big decision with your dad, not him. I know if my husband did the same, I'd be pretty miffed that he didn't talk about it with me, his wife, first. Not that I would have said no... but I don't like the feeling that he makes big decisions like cars with his parents, rather than me. Maybe that's what he meant by saying you were married.

Also, is it possible he grew up with the understanding that accepting gifts makes him indebted to that person? How is his relationships with his parents? Did they use money and gifts as a power play? 

"
"Personally, I think you're spiritually projecting your own self-loathing to these other people. You have to understand, that as a traveller, you're going to be leaving people and meeting new people so that's part and parcel of travelling.

"Right? Of course he wants his daughter out of the house! She’s the only sane one in this family, and the only one willing to call her father out on his addiction and all around awful and neglectful behavior. If she’s gone, then he can continue to live with his addiction in “peace” without anyone  making him feel guilty (as he should) or exposing him for what he is (a horrible father and husband). 

I don’t think a Reddit post has ever made me so angry. Either OP is a completely clueless idiot or is horribly codependent, or both. Her level of denial is astounding. Getting kicked out of that house might be the best thing to happen to OP’s daughter, but I’d bet good money that if that happens, mom and dad won’t be hearing from her for a long time, if ever. 

This is what the flip side of r/raisedbynarcissists looks like. Jesus, this poor girl.

"A concerned husband who trusts the word of a liar over his wife when she explicitly warned him about Lee.

On top of that he, despite knowing how Lee had fucked his wife over in the past, pulled some lets-give-everyone-yet-another-chance literally as if his wife's past experiences weren't as shitty and potentially traumatizing for her as they were.

Personally, he's a damn idiot and I'd be serving his ass with papers as soon as I could.

Probably would have been *less* of a fuck up, or really more forgivable, had he cheated. "
"You not noticing the manipulation is not because you’re not smart. It’s because it started small and has grown over time. You presented us here with the end result of that. That’s why it’s so obvious. 
You really should see a counsellor yourself. No matter what you end up doing. It will help you sort out your thoughts and work out where you want to be in life. 
I think it’s fairly clear you shouldn’t marry him as things are now. And you are young, you can start again. I’m sure your family and friends will help you sort out the living arrangements and furniture side. Yes it’s daunting but nothing you can’t do. 
"
"It's not about cat litter, it's about respect. He doesn't respect you. 

Don't be with someone who doesn't respect you. "
"Mongoose. Or you could go whole hog and get a Honey Badger.

But you have to be cautious with a honey badger. Because honey badger don't give a shit and will eat your baby neice. And probably you. And everyone you love."
"If it were me I would not mind one bit. Pick up some soup on the way, or if you’re that worried that you don’t want to stop go there and order some."
"I don't sleep to the extent the GF does, but I do tend to need more sleep than my boyfriend because a) I'm a very light sleeper so if he so much as twitches I will wake up and not fall asleep again for a while. And b) I have horrible nightmares that are physically and emotionally exhausted.  Basically it's rare for me to get a good night sleep. I used one of those sound recorders and normally have 60-70 recordings of me rolling/flailing etc. 

"
"Not the commenter you replied to, but at the very least they will damage the hardwood floors with their normal walking. Who knows if they have any behavior issues like chewing to add to it. I have a small 20ish pound dog and that alone is heavy enough to cause damage to the floors."
"Simply dont hang out with them?  Also I dont think ""talking about your holidays"" is ""rubbing it in our faces"".  If you feel jealous that's really your issue."
"""he shouldn't have went out with me""

""he shouldn't have gone out with me...""  You two are really not compatible, IMO.  My SO and I still can't keep our hands off each other and it's been over 12 years.  I think you are both settling by staying together.  You will get advice here that differs a lot from mine -- people will tell you to schedule intimate candle-light dinners, romantic settings, etc.  I think that may work for a very short while, then you'll revert to the status quo.  You are too young to be settling for this."
"Absolutely, massively self-absorbed. OP, try and think for one minute about the concept of empathy, of putting yourself in another person's shoes. 

What do you think it would take for you to cut off your own mother? Would you do it for a silly, petty reason? Is your wife a silly, petty person? Does she cling onto minor grudges forever? My guess is not. It would have taken literally 2 seconds of thought to come up with any number of possible GOOD reasons for your wife to cut contact, but you didn't give her the courtesy of even those two seconds. Your entire thought was on how important it was for YOU to act, because she couldn't possibly know better than you - even though you never experienced her life, even though you never considered FOR TWO SECONDS what that life could have been like.

The callousness, the sheer arrogance and disrespect and distrust you've shown your wife is enormous. Your only hope of fixing it is to realise, down to the very marrow of your bones, what a poor husband you have been here, because unless you do there's a chance you'll fall into the same arrogance and dismissiveness again."
"&gt; gf, it has come to my attention that you seem to be expecting a proposal. I love you and I do want to eventually marry you, but I feel I am not ready for it this close after a break. I feel we need to grow a bit closer and work out our past issues before we commit t9 each other like that."
This is very rude and a great response if she wants to lose all her friends.
This doesn’t make a lot of sense. No sane person jumps from “wow they are taking awhile” to “they just be cheating!” I just think she’s dating an asshole. 
"Honestly I think she needs to hear it, even at the expense of their marriage, while there is still time to abort"
"I feel like I make him a priority, though. I want to understand his feelings but it's hard. I still have sex with him when I feel gross and exhausted. I've let MIL watch the baby. I compromised and moved the crib into our room. I feel like I'm making a lot of compromises tbh. "
"You even say *you're* ""only hearing..."". So maybe he *is* saying it, but you're shutting it out because subconsciously you know it would mean spending less time with your baby and having to have more sex with him, which you've mentioned right now you don't enjoy (which is ok, that's not uncommon so early after a baby, and I think faking your way through it is causing you to become resentful). "
"At least put a password on it first. He might be so deep into his gaming that he could retaliate at the knowledge of her removing access to his games.  And retaliation could affect her clients and career.  

No, do not give anyone who has access to your work computers heads up before removing access. She can always give him a moment to save the games and whatnot after she's locked it. "
"ooooh my goodness, never tell her you find her touch repulsive. i’ve seen some bad advice on this sub before, but this is next level. you will ruin her self image and possibly hinder her from pursuing another serious relationship. you describe her as a wonderful person, so why would you want to needlessly hurt her? her touch repulsing you is YOUR problem, and not something she can work on. telling her will not help her in the slightest. there’s telling the truth, and then there’s just being cruel. "
Does she choose to not believe you in other areas of your life? Does she follow all of your rules with the kids?
"*Usually* the norm around here for a spouse/MIL problem is that the problem at hand is the tip of the iceberg. In which case, the ""you have a husband problem"" type advice is usually appropriate.

But if this is really a one-off problem where you really have a good relationship with healthy boundaries and mutual respect, I think this is great advice. In this case, MIL probably just wants to do something nice for OP, and is super attached to one belief about how marriage should be (husbands buy their wives jewelry). This is a good way to handle it."
"They are old enough to make their own decisions. They don't need to be babied anymore but it seems like your ex wife does. 

No need for you to interact with her."
I've had both types of abortions (surgical and the RU486 pill). PM me if you need support or have any questions about the experience. I'm so sorry you're going through this!
"What the fuck, she's pissing on the floor like an animal? Why haven't they evicted her? This girl needs to be in a fucking home! Has no one contacted her parents??"
"You drive, he walks? Then he gets a ride home up that hill...."
I think this has nothing to do with her post.
"I think people have the right idea to have a fun 'bachelorette party' at a bar or hell, even at someone's house or at a chic brunch place if bars aren't little sister's style. 

Also consider that older sister might have some regrets that she wasn't closer to you when you were younger. While not true for every person or family, some LGBT youth feel very out of place (and the family) as kids. So your trans sister may have struggled with how to interact with her cis sisters, before realizing she was trans and that was something she could be. 

That doesn't excuse that you aren't close, and your sister should be allowed to have her camping trip with her close friends. So do that! But then also have a small mimosa and cupcakes gathering and watch a favorite movie with the girls! It will make your older sister feel included. She may feel like she missed out on a lot of bonding when you were young, and would like to catch up in adulthood. Good luck!"
Aww. You folks are great. Keep on inspiring.
"&gt; a whole lot of money, effort, travel, stress and time

Erm, it really doesn't have to be. The last one I went to consisted of Chinese takeaway and naughty party games which the bride had downloaded and printed out. It was so much fun! The one before that was a pub crawl (less fun, mostly because they're just not my thing), we wore cheap pink sashes and the bride had a pink tiara.

This idea of bachelor/ette parties (and weddings in general) absolutely *having* to cost an arm and a leg, regardless of the wishes and means of the participants, is really unsettling.

(Also, as far as I can see, it's older sister who has a problem, it's the whole family who are concerned, and not unreasonably from what I'm reading.)"
"&gt;I would also request she do it in an area where nothing relating to where you live is in the background

Part of the problem is her friend openly shares where she lives. Not the exact address but our town and general area. "
That's when you tell him your DOCTOR is trying to look out for you by prescribing medicine for your ADHD. If you want to be sassy you can ask him when he finished med school but that might cause trouble.

"100%.

OP, as one Aussie lady to another... you are gorgeous and deserve someone who adores all of you."
"I would consider grabbing you, twisting you, holding you, overpowering you absolutely are violent. It probably hurt when he squeezed you right? Violence doesn't necessarily mean he punched or cut you, squeezing someone's arm is violence."
"Regardless of how people feel when it comes to rehoming pets for whatever reasons, noone is their right mind would tell a couple who lost their child that they deserved it, that it was a good thing for them to have lost their child. That is cruel and sociopathic. I would be considering divorce over this. This is something your sister and her husband will never forget. Your wife just burned all the bridges between them. If you stay with her you probably will never see your sister's family again because you are indirectly showing her that you support your wife's reasoning. "
"Wow I kind of missed that part, he was out doing those risky behaviors, at the cost of breaking a promise to spend time with his kids to boot! I agree, this doesn't just sound like laziness and annoyance at his new reality, this sounds like he's regularly pretty selfish. I sincerely hope she can get him to see how close she is to leaving over this. 

Side note, what's your favorite fake tan? I'd love to get into that but I've never been able to get it to apply and not streak. I can never tell if it's me or the fake tan that's failing miserably."
"Well, this is embarrassing, sorry.

But yeah, hope you will find the best solution going forward."
"I would definitely second the writing a letter. I know in a lot of situations you can send your dog with a favorite toy or whatever, so I don't see why they wouldn't pass along a letter. I also agree that if the sister is going to act like that, it is probably not safe to have an animal in the house. That is ridiculous behavior that could, theoretically, have escalated to abuse, and the poor dog is better off without that. "
"Hey I'm adding to the top comment for visibility. This might be a troll post, OP has posted this same story from both the husband and the wife's perspective... Is OP the wife or the husband?

&gt;  I Secretly Love Doing My Wife's Make-up (self.confession)
&gt; submitted 1 month ago by Muphenz to r/confession
&gt; So a few years ago, my wife was really sick. So she decided to feel better by taking a shower and putting on some casual clothing and could hardly do her make up. She said she couldn't do it right because her arm was shaking so badly. So I offered a hand. After about 2 or so hours of constantly removing and perfecting her make-up it became right. So from now on, every once in a while she will allow me to practice or ask me to do it for her if we go on a casual date or something. I'll pick the colors for her eyes or decide how bold the eye liner would go, or pick an outfit i think would look best in her. I don't know why I like it. I have no art ability, my profession is in business. I don't want to do this to any other girl but my wife. I guess I just like the bonding time.

&gt; I think I win the biggest husband douche aware. My wife is finally getting what she deserved. (self.confession)
submitted 2 months ago by Muphenz to r/confession
&gt;My wife F25 and me M23 have been married for 5 years and been together for 8 years. The relationship is amazing, we have everything in common, when we fight, we don't put each other down, and we've known each other since high school.
&gt;Don't get me wrong she is my best friend, but the last few months she has been depriving me of sex. I've tried so many times to nicely talk to her about, cook dinner for her, surprise her with gifts, and once even surprise her with candles in the bedroom with rose pedals, her favorite flower, around the bed. All attempts failed. So I'm getting it about once every two weeks.
&gt;So now I just got to point where I would ask because I was always told no and it would hurt my ego. So after a while of me not asking, she noticed, and came onto me. Well I decided to say no, she didn't understand.
&gt;""You always ask 24/7. Out of all the times sex is on your mind, now you're not in the mood..."" is basically what she said. She got pissed and went to the bath room.
&gt;For the last month or 5 weeks, my wife has been asking me for sex and I've been saying no. It's amazing how much she cries, tells me how sex is important, and she feels unloved and unwanted.
What I find amazing is I said all those exact things when you turned me down. I find it amazing sex is only important to her when she is in the mood. I'll probably keep this up until I feel like she truly learns her lesson.

"Refund refund refund. Putting it in a trust is misleading to the donors.

But on the relationship side, it's offensive to your sister. She sees it as holier-than-thou.

Putting it in a trust tells her you think you are more capable of taking care of her daughter than she is.

So no wonder she's pissed... Refund it."
"&gt;our mum has always been our emotional support.

And yet in return you completely disregarded her emotional needs and support?"
"&gt; tl;dr: Boyfriend had anal sex with me

So you do understand that what you've described is rape right? I really hope you're actually reading these comments and I really really hope you've kicked this guy right out of your life and seen a better specialist. Report him- this should absolutely not go unpunished. Reading this infuriates me and I can only hope this gives you some clarity on a terribly abusive relationship."
"I can't imagine a world where 5'11 and 118 is heathy. ""Looks great"" isn't necessarily healthy."
"I'm not saying they're entitled to opulence, nor was I commenting on the skill of this doctor in particular. There's not enough information here to even know if the doctor is indeed at fault. I'm only pointing out that it's possible that a doctor can be financially ruined just as anyone else can. 

If I come off as sympathetic towards the doctor, perhaps you're projecting on me, since my statement is meant to be neutral."
"Yeah, I'd be seriously hurt too about the photo. All the negatives and critique is a total d-bag thing to do to someone that feels connected enough to you to send one of these. I don't know how you two would fix it, but I feel for you. That was mean of him. "
"How? You're rejecting every opposing view but playing it off as ""doing your bit"" by even posting.

You are trying to be incredibly manipulative towards us, I can only hazard a guess how you treat him. "
"And yet you insist that there's ""nothing you can do"" about the issues in your marriage or that your motherly instincts are impossible to press pause on for a couple hours so you can go on a date with your husband. 

You can't just beat yourself up for not doing everything right and then blatantly refuse to make any changes to improve the situation. If you keep this up it's very possible that you'll push your husband away and slowly chip away at your relationship until you're both miserable or divorced. 

I understand you're in a shitty situation but if you won't make any sacrifices or push through some mild discomfort to improve it, guess what? The situation stays shitty. "
"A man who has already shared your private video's seems pretty likely to go the revenge porn route after you break up with him.  He's already shown he has no respect for you.

Try to make sure he deletes the videos, and at least look into if it's illegal in your State.  Then you can at least let him know that its illegal for him to post the video's anywhere or show anyone else.  "
"&gt; you do need to get on the same page in terms of what kind of decisions and transactions your level of trust says you should be talking through first.

Thanks. I agree and I think we need to have a more serious discussion about this so he knows I'm not planning to do anything like this without his input again.

My dad doesn't give gifts with strings attached (since people have asked). He has his own life and doesn't get over involve himself in my life. He just likes to do nice things for his kids (w/o expectations)."
"Ew ew ew ew ew.

This isn’t about your son’s needs at all. This is 100% your husband trying to fix his own issues vicariously through someone over whom he has power. Your husband is clearly hung up on his “insufficient” experiences prior to your marriage and is making up for lost time by telling your son to do what he wishes he could do. 

You need to shut that shit down *now*. I don’t know how you’ve stood it this long. Your husband needs to back 100% off your son’s social life (which is entirely on your son to manage, he’s not 5) and seriously re-examine his parenting priorities. 

“Not hitting” isn’t a priority, it’s a bare minimum, and one whose mention makes me wonder how skewed your normal-meter is. Is “doesn’t hit us” your standard for a good relationship? "
When I do that he tells me that he's being practical and he can't sugar coat things for me
"Wel I'm sorry... But I would NOT be civil with the woman who I see as responsible for crashing my parents marriage. 

I would be out there making her life a living hell on earth. 

Source? I was a teenager when my dad cheated on my mom. Believe me I saw him as a villain, but I saw the woman he cheated with as a villain too. 

It sounds like you guys were having an emotional affair (judging by the questions you conveniently do not answer, and your other answers), so why would you expect his kid to be civil? "
"He sounds like my dad, who would only allow Linux computers in the house when I was growing up. (2000 was not the year of the Linux desktop, that's for sure.)

He's being really unreasonable. You don't share this hobby of his, and his expectation that you file bug reports in the dark is ridiculous. "
"And if TV is interfering with relationships in his life, he should re-examine it......

"
Agreed. I honestly just wouldn't run at all if I couldn't run at 5am. 
"... no. No, I’m pretty sure it’s her fault too."
"Imo, that sounds like something much stronger than Marijuana. "
"Yeah, get therapy.  That is the right answer here."
"These kinds of comments are driving me nuts. The only reason to have a baby is because you genuinely, deeply want one and you are prepared to care for one, not as a motivation to ""grow up"" or ""stop slacking around.""

A baby is a complete human being who has to live in the world; nobody should create a new person on a whim. FFS."
She's a bundle of blame. This chick takes accountability for NOTHING.
"&gt; EDIT: Actually, wait, I just remembered that when we put on The Nutcracker when I was a kid at my ballet school, we didn't even have a boy taking classes! Someone's younger brother was recruited and had his part heavily edited down to just the plot necessary nutcracker breaking – he didn't even have to know how to dance at all to get a solo part! Oh man, I remember being so mad...

Why don't they just have a girl dance the part of the Nutcracker in that case? It's not uncommon for male roles to become female (and vice-versa) in theater when it is needed."
"Actually he is abusive. Very subtly for now. He is invalidating your needs. You state a boundary and he calls it ""worrisome"". That shuts you down, turns it into an attack on you, and is meant to dissuade you from stating your needs. That is NOT okay. Any decent partner would hear ""I need some alone time"" or ""I want to spend more time with my friends"" and say ""of course, have fun!""

This sounds really toxic. That a 22 year old felt the need to prey on a 17 year old with a history of abuse isnt a goof sign, either.

"&gt;He will change his tune when he sees this is non negotiatible.

Not always. My guy went literal years without sex when I went off birth control because he flat out refuses to use condoms. "
"IMO you're projecting a lot based on the fact he has money now, and I think that's a bit unfair. "
"Have you ever read about Bowlby's attachment theory? I don't have daddy issues but damn, a lot of your post described my family. My family is Italian and there were no hugs or I love you's. Saying I love you is physically painful. My dating life? Beyond painful. I'm just not like normal people and I believe it's because of how I was raised. I have a son now and he's the only one I can say I love you to without breaking into a cold sweat. I've tried really hard to break the cycle with him and I think it worked. He tells me he loves me all the time and I him. I have worked with kids for more than 20 years and I once read kids need at least 26 hugs or some type of emotional touch every day to feel loved and valued. I read this when my kid was still a toddler so I'll be damned if I didn't hug that kid all the time. He makes fun of me now after I hug him and he'll say ""okay, only 25 more times to go."" I digress... I recommend reading up on Bowlby's theory of attachment and it will explain a lot of how you feel. "
"Man... There’s a whole lot going on here. 

If you don’t mind me asking, how did you guys decide to have so many children? Did you always envision a big family?"
"So I used to date a guy in college for 3 years. First six months was AMAZING! Great relationship. Wonderful connection. Then, we had a conversation about us falling harder for each other than we have ever before. 

And then the BS started. He used to get super jealous every time I even looked at a guy. I couldn’t even have my female friends over. If I was late in responding to a text (as in 10 mins after he texted me) there was war. 

I put up with it for 2.5 years. It sucked the joy out of my life. **And it never got better.** No matter how how many conversations we had about his jealousy it never got better. 

We never spoke after breaking up, so idk how he’s doing now. I know he’s married, but idk if he’s happy or whatelse. And I never tried to find out. But I’m so much happier now. With a wonderful man. 

So I’m a little biased on the longevity of your relationship. Your bf and my ex are both emotionally abusive. In your bf’s case, it’s because he grew up in an abusive situation and has normalized this behavior. It’s going to take years of successful therapy for it to changes &amp; he might even relapse if he stops therapy. 

Do you want a future with someone like that? Do you want kids with someone like that? 

Nobody can change another person, so you can’t really fix this on your own. "
"The loud bass, yes. The yawning, clearing his throat, and whistling no."
"That's because even when you think about it, without asking the internet, you know that ""I'm not ready"" is a total BULLSHIT excuse after **10 YEARS.**"
People still do this? I would have thought the extraordinary cost of getting a college degree and stupid amounts of student loans would make it a financially stupid decision
"&gt; Do you want to let her win?

That is absolutely the wrong way to think about this. It's not ""letting someone win"" but cutting out the people who would believe you have a drug problem based on lies, it's beneficial to your mental health. "
"tbf, I don't think OP knew they'd slept together, just that this chick knew him, so it was probably more of a ""Hey, you know this guy, is he actually as cool as he seems or should I run a mile"" kind of a thing than ""Hey, I'm dating the guy you hooked up with"", which would be random and weird."
"18 and doesn't know how to take the bus? Sounds like a parent problem, not a kid problem. Let him figure things out for himself."
"I don't even do this to my kids. I use my words and don't try to control their body. 

OP, does he also slap your hand when you reach for something he doesn't want you to have, or push you back down into your chair if you stand when he doesn't want you to? This is the same kind of thing. This is not something you do to another adult, spouse or not. "
"Thank you so much for taking the time to write all this. It’s so helpful to hear from someone that has gone through something like this, and your practical advice is so, so helpful. You’re absolutely right that I’m still caught up in the whirlwind of emotions flying at me from everyone direction, and I need to take the time to step back before making any decisions.

As far as the dynamics of our relationship, I started typing something up to give more details, and the more I thought about it, this issue is just the last in line of ways he has treated me badly over the years. I’m finally realizing how little respect he has (and has had) for me and for our relationship.

Thank you so much for your kindness and support!"
"Yikes these comments. A lot of my friends download it for fun. It feels good to swipe and get matches. Sure your gf fucked up but if she understood why you were upset and deleted it, I️ don’t see the issue. "
"do u even know if she wants to save the marriage? she slept with the guy, twice and kept it hidden for god knows how long.....even when u caught her she didn't sound remorseful or guilty.

"&gt; No your bf doesn't have autism - he is just into ""shit memes"" aka internet jokes that are funny because they are obviously trolling the person receiving the joke.

"He’s great with money.  He’s lived rent free for 6 months and has a kid that costs him maybe $100 bucks a month.  You are bad with money because you’re spending money you don’t have on him.  He has all the financial sense in the world and is doing what he’s doing because it works for him,  you need to take more after him and arrange your finances in a way that works for you.

"Thank you! This question never makes sense to me for exactly that reason, and your analogy captures exactly why. There's a difference between purposely bringing forth a child who will have a short life of pain purposely and with foreknowledge and mitigating the situation should it unavoidably occur. "
Oh god you're as crazy as she is.
"Jesus Christ all of you please never speak to my wife.  I'm exactly like your husband.  When I'm pissed I need to be left alone to stew and cool off (doesn't need to be literally left alone).  Rational communication time is to take place post cool off period.  You obviously understand that your husband operates this way and are fully aware of the your behaviors that lead to this outcome.  Just tell him you'd like to talk once he cools off, set a timer on your phone For and hour or two and circle back when he is ready.  Then the conversation can be about the real issue to be discussed and not an endless rehash of the coldness issue.  "
"This is YOUR HOUSE, you stay. Who needs 3 days to move out? Tell her to grab a friend(s) and move out in a day and stay with them. You can stay out her way but you're not going to disappear from your house just because she wants some space."
"Are you still breastfeeding and thus the only person getting up with the baby at night, or is he taking some of the night shifts as well? If he's not taking her at night at all, he probably does not understand how exhausted you are - sleeping poorly for months on end will cause you to prioritize sleep over everything else (rightly). 

Secondly, sex at 2am when you're exhausted is a stupid idea. It's perfectly fine to tell him that you are absolutely not having sex with him after a certain time because you've gone to sleep. 

People suggest that it's not sexy, but I suggest having a conversation in the morning with your husband about when and whether you want to have sex that night. Being a parent means you have to be more organized about things if you're going to get everything done, especially while your child is still young and you're exhausted. You have to proactively communicate about what you both want, not spring things on each other when you're already exhausted from your day.

And lastly, sex is not a physical need that he can't gratify on his own at 2am. If he wants to have sex with you, it needs to happen earlier. Before you've gone to sleep. That's the basic minimum of thoughtfulness that needs to be happening here."
I actually laughed but then it made me really sad seeing as this is literally his reality right now. 
"Bringing it up would just draw attention to it and make it more awkward.

It's going to be weird for a little bit, but pretending it never happened and waiting for things to blow over is probably the best way to go."
"Is there anyway you can consider compromise? For example, is there any way you can go to Europe sometime within the next 6 months? If you can visit Europe, and have a wonderful trip, and cross that off your bucket list, maybe you can start planning for a baby a little bit earlier then your timeline, and a little bit later than hers.

I think that if you show that you might be willing to bend a little bit, maybe she can bend a little bit too.

I think a lot of people want to wait for the exact perfect timing to do things, and unfortunately, there really isn't great timing. Maybe you don't have the money to go to Europe this year, but you're not going to have it next year, either. Or the year after. So why not just go this year? Maybe, instead of spending three months there, you can spend two weeks, and while it won't be the dream trip you've always wanted (maybe when you were younger envisioned a different future for yourself) it will be a great trip that you, as an adult, can afford, and thoroughly enjoy.

This sounds like a lot of new, damaging drama. Considering her daughter doesn’t want to speak to her, I’m not sure what OP is trying to achieve with this painful knowledge (—- knowledge about letters that clearly weren’t taken seriously by the judge). "

"If you're enjoying the DnD with them, why not just compromise and go with it? I don't NEED to sit next to my bf, I prefer it though. But if you're not uncomfortable with them, why not just move seats?

I do think it's a bit weird, you not being allowed to just hold hands or something, but you don't know how it looks to them or maybe you do more than that what you wrote here, but still.

Otherwise talk to them about it, what is it that you're doing that is such a bother? Typing this, this would actually be my first thing to do."

"You are her second choice, I hate to say it but your her back up plan.

She may not be physically intimate with this man yet, but the thoughts are there and she clearly has feelings for him. Her comments about ""choosing"" = you're her back up plan if it didn't work out wirh this other man. 

She's going to change her mind again, if she doesn't just go ahead and cheat so you don't leave her so she can ""explore"" her physical intimacy with this other man.

This is disrespectful to you. I would save your time and heartache and move on from her. "

"There isn't really any such thing as a ""trained emotional support dog"" or any places that provide them, at least that I'm aware. Emotional support animals by definition don't require any special training; they help with the person's disability just by being a comforting presence, or a reason to get out of bed in the morning, or whatever. The ""emotional support"" thing only really matters in limited circumstances, specifically housing (the Fair Housing Act requires qualifying landlords to make reasonable accommodations for them, like allowing them in housing that normally doesn't allow pets or waiving a pet fee/pet rent; and some transportation act that I never remember the name of allows them to travel in the cabin of planes if they can safely be accommodated). So the OP's wife would likely be able to get a legitimate letter from her therapist or doctor prescribing an ESA, but it doesn't sound like it would be particularly helpful for their situation.

Psychiatric service dogs are also a thing, and they are specially trained. There are also agencies that provide them at a subsidized cost for people with PTSD in particular (I mention the subsidized cost thing because service dogs are very expensive to train and purchasing a fully trained one from a private seller will likely run you $10,000+), but there can be a years-long waiting list. My husband has a service dog for PTSD and mobility issues, and the last time we had to look into it, we were getting estimated waits of 3-4 years. It was easier for us to train our own dog.

Not saying your advice is bad, just some realities to be aware of. And it's been awhile since we had to look into getting him another service dog, so things may have gotten better."
"Just tell them you really prefer to write anonymously and you feel you wouldn't be able to express yourself if you had to worry about what your friends and family thought about your writing. Basically, tell them the truth..."
"Wow, you are seriously fixated on what you *want* this guy to be, and not on what he actually *is*.

They say actions speak louder than words. Let's look at both.

His words: 

* he's been extremely vague about ""our future""...and has never said the words ""I love you"".

* he gave a long-winded answer 

(ahh, the long-winded answer, where they waste a shitload of time to make an unpleasant answer, ie, ""I'm not that into you"" sound a little more palatable)

* about how he only will do or say something if he's 10000% sure of it, and he thinks that people that use the word love do it flippantly and without meaning. He said it may just be something that he'll never be comfortable doing

* I asked him where he sees our future going, and his reply was that he doesn't know

* We discussed living together...he wasn't very excited about it

Let me be clear: the ONLY time I have heard guys say something along the lines of, ""I don't feel comfortable using the word ""love"" flippantly,"" is when they don't actually love the girl they're talking to. Love is a word, it's not a contract. You can love someone, and then not love them at a later date. There is not a single guy on earth who refuses to use the word ""love"" who is well-adjusted in all other ways. 

His actions:

* He's rather stoic and unemotional

* now he is suddenly gung-ho about finding a place together

He was in NO way interested in co-habitating with you when it meant leaving his place. Now that his commute has gotten longer, suddenly he's done a complete back-flip. This isn't a guy who said, ""I'd love to live with you but the timing is wrong."" This is a guy who didn't want to live with you until he was put into a position where he's realising it would benefit him to have a housemate he can have sex with, at the cost of your convenience. 

I feel like you really want to be in a long-term committed relationship with this guy, and you're pouring over his words and actions with a fine-tooth comb, hoping to find some evidence that he wants the same thing. Instead, you need to look at the big picture about what he's telling you:

* He doesn't know whether he sees a long term future with you

* He has never said the words ""I love you"" 

* He had no interest in living with you until it suddenly seemed convenient to do so. 

This strikes me as an issue in not just how he sees his relationship with you, but as how he sees his life in general - as something he has no control over, but as a series of events that just happen *to* him. He sees no future with you because he has no interest in *making* a future with you. He just wants to see if a future with you *eventuates*, but isn't going to lift a finger to make that happen. 

Romantic partners are just that - *partners*. They work together to actively build a future together. Your guy is living his own life and is giving you the option to come along for the ride of *his* life, without offering you any security of an important role in his life. 

To sum up this very long comment:

&gt; Maybe this IS truly how well-functioning relationships go

No. No, it really isn't. No, your relationship isn't well-functioning. You've just set your standards incredibly low. "
"The problem is that right now you're stuck in a catch-22 - you don't have enough information to make a plan. You don't have any general sense of what cities you both might be interested in or moving to, you don't have any general sense of how easy/difficult it will be to get jobs, etc.


I mean, the MidWest is a big geographical area. One - or both - of you may find jobs close enough to commute to. I drive an hour west to City A, my SO drives an hour south to City B, and we live midway in City C. That could pretty easily be what happens with you, but you have no idea if that's even an option without knowing what kinds of bites you both will get to your applications. 


And you both need to take into consideration things besides the job - What's the cost of living in the theoretical city? Do you even enjoy the city/state and want to live there? Those kinds of things, and you can't take them into consideration until you have a better sense of what pans out.


&gt; I feel like if we don't end up with a plan to start out with, we could both end up with jobs we really like


Right, but that's why I stress *constant communication*. There are so many steps between putting in an application and actually get a job offer. You both would be assessing together how good the potential job is, what the potential future is there, how it would potentially affect the other person, how much you'd like the potential city, etc. Those would be multiple conversations happening over the course of time, and none of those conversations can happen until you two actually start applying.

"Please tell me that you and your boyfriend have called it quits. Because anyone who told me ""A cat or a dog is just an animal."" would have absolutely NO place in my life whatsoever. None. You are undeserving of this kitty-loving guy."

"(Throwaway bc I don’t want to post family drama with my main).

Unless you have a reason to think your sister will harm your child or will attempt to manipulate your child into disliking your wife, I strongly urge you to reconsider. 

I feel like most of the comments will be like ‘yep family is a package deal, no relationship with mama, no access to kid, sister needs to deal’, but hear me out. 

I was in your daughter’s shoes as a kid.

They cut me off from my beloved aunt and I’ve never forgiven my parents. They used me as a ""weapon"" in their fight with my aunt without caring about how it would affect *me*. 

My brother was never very close to his older by 2 years sister.  Let’s call her Aunty Kate. They were basically chalk and cheese siblings that were never close. Kate graduated top of her class, my Dad dropped out of school. Kate was a bookworm, my Dad thinks reading is for ‘nerds’. Dad loves sport, Kate can't stand it. Dad loves to party, Kate hates it. Kate is an investment banker, my father is terrible with money and has tons of debt. You get the idea. Nothing in common and they were just two people who'd never have willingly chosen to be around each other for more than five minutes. 

But even though they were not close, Kate *adored* me. She was the textbook cool aunty who loved kids but want have her own and was tons of fun and would have done anything for me. 

Kate and my mum *never* got along from the moment they met. It started when they went to dinner so my Dad could introduce them to my mother. They ordered wine. Kate was asked for ID. My mum was not. Kate was 28. My mum was 21. From what my grandmother has told me, Mum apparently didn’t handle it well and made it clear Kate could DIAF. Kate is very much a ‘take no prisoners’ kind of lady so when my mother would be snide to her, Kate would give it right back. 

Eventually one day when I was 6, my parents got sick of Kate standing up for herself. Kate turned around and told my mother she “ruined” the family and the “worst thing that happened to my life was you entering it” (my grandmother confirmed this). 

All of a sudden, I was forbidden from seeing Aunty Kate. She was in my life one moment, gone the next. 

Kate asked several times to still have a relationship with me separately from them and my grandparents told my brother they should allow it. Dad refused because “she doesn’t like my wife”. Of course, it was fine for them to dislike Kate, but she had ‘no right’ to dislike them. 

It was absolutely heart-wrenching **for me**. 

I remember crying when I’d ask my parents when I’d get to see Kate again and their answer was “never”. 

I feel like my parents used *me* as a weapon to hurt her in *their* argument - an argument that had nothing to do with me. 

As an adult it makes me so angry. 

That argument was between Kate and my parents. It was not between Kate and I, but they still punished me with the loss of that relationship because they prioritised “sticking it to Kate” by taking away her relationships with me and not caring that I was also basically punished by that. 

I have a cousin who is my age. We’ll call her Sarah. She is the daughter of Kate and Dad’s half sister. I had to hear Sarah tell me about all the fun things she’d do with Aunty Kate. Aunty Kate then moved to Switzerland a few years later when she got a *really* well paying finance job there (we’re from Australia). She’d pay for Sarah to go visit her in Switzerland every year and she’d take her to somewhere like Milan or Paris or London. Cousin Sarah and I both studied German in high school – and she was always so much better at it than me because she spent 5 weeks in the German speaking part of Switzerland every year. Kate and her native speaking Swiss husband would help her learn. Kate told my parents the invitation was there and they refused. They told me Kate didn’t care anymore. By the time I was about 14, I started to think Kate had stopped caring about me. That made it even worse for me. Kate loved Sarah but she “stopped” loving me. Sarah is near fluent in German now - I'm not. 

A couple of years ago, I reached out to Kate on Facebook and she was delighted to hear from me and told me that her ‘greatest wish’ was always that I’d want to reconnect one day.

I’m now 22 and we have a really good relationship – she even flew me out to Switzerland after a year of talking and facetiming. My parents were furious, but I don’t care. I’ve never forgiven them for what they did – I grew up without an aunt who adored me for over a decade because my parents were more interested in “sticking it” to my father’s sister than caring about what was best for me. 

If you don’t want to talk to your sister, that’s one thing. But I would urge you to consider your child. *You* may not like your sister, but your child does. You're not only going to punish your sister - you're going to punish your child too. 

Sidenote: I think you’re being a bit unfair to your sister’s initial reaction. I wouldn’t want to add my brother’s pretty new girlfriend as a ‘sister’ on Facebook (I'd be creeped out tbh) and I can appreciate why a 23 year old wouldn’t want to go clubbing with 18 year olds. 

You say if your wife wants to love your daughter, she has to love your wife. I think that is not fair. You love your wife and chose to marry her, but your sister did not get to make that choice.  It would be nice if they liked each other, but they don’t HAVE to. She can love her niece without loving your wife.  

"
"So, you know what you're doing wrong. Now, it's time to try to stop doing it wrong, right?"
"Yup, they're being racist assholes. Take your girlfriend, stay somewhere nice &amp; introduce her to old friends instead. "
"Yeah, as a pbsc donor, this didn't make sense at all. Unless someone majorly dropped the ball on their side of things, they shouldn't know who the donor was, except for maybe gender and age. 

There's a process for making non anonymous contract, but that's on a 3 to 6 month timeframe. Not the next day.

When I donated, they told me about a few schemes of people trying to give identifying info through anonymous notes, and those are thoroughly screened out by donor network staff."
"Hi there.  I've worked in bars and restaurants for 15 years, some of which closed.  It is not customary at all for servers and bartenders to receive severance packages.  Why should your boyfriend be held to such a thing that is not industry standard?"
"You'd be a single mom. 

You don't even know if you are ready to be a mother, let alone a single mother.

Abort mission."
"This. 

Honestly OP's ""he was grooming me"" comment kinda upset me bc she's not a child or mentally disabled. She's a 29-year-old woman who made a really bad decision and is now unfortunately getting blackmailed for it. Also, using her bad marriage as an excuse of being ""vulnerable"" to cheating.

Everyone knows not to deep your pen in the company ink bc of shit like this. But the CEO is definitely a complete sleaze ball. 

OP, talk to a lawyer before you talk to HR. Talk to your husband as well, he deserves to know."
"This is a great idea! I also was thinking that, though I love statement pieces, I rarely wear them because I can't stand that heaviness around my neck or in my ears. (Rings are different story, lol.) So that could be another example - ""After I wear it for a couple of hours, the weight becomes very distracting/uncomfortable."" "
Uhhh so she doesn't have any sort of job or career I guess? She just expects other people to pay for her? Attractive. (Not to mention the current situation.) This is the kind of person you want to raise children with? She can't even function...
"In this particular situation I think it's best to reign on the best friend and integral to your personal life part. A mentorship in a professional setting  (especially in the m/f dynamic) should never really progress to the point it seems yours has. I would respect the wife's feelings here and try to keep your interactions with Jim professional and in the workplace. 

I also recommend finding other mentors and friends to fill the gap that will be left there. Also there is no need to do guess work here. Just ask him briefly and concisely in an email. 

""I value your mentorship and friendship but I don't want to cause any problems for you at home. Please let me know what is appropriate going forward and what changes in the dynamic of our friendship is necessary"""
"I'm really sorry, OP. Your bf is being immature and a jerk.

I do agree in principle with some other posters -- both parents deserve to have an equal say in naming children. 

But at the end of the day, a child can only have 1 name, it's not always the kind of thing where you can meet in the middle. Some couples manage to find names they both love, but many couples make agreements where one gets to pick the first name and the other the middle name, or one names the girls and the other names the boys. You've been upfront and honest FOR YEARS, have had a standing agreement FOR YEARS, and he is now just throwing it out the window because he's disappointed he's not having a son, and wants to punish you for it. 

You have every right to be pissed. Stand your ground -- this isn't about you getting your way, it's about him upholding an agreement he agreed to. Pull the nurse card if you want to."
"That's something your enemy says, not your partner."
"I'm torn. I definitely get not wanting to be the third wheel. But also find it odd how adamant he is on making this happen, like buying two sets of concert tickets. There's also other solutions than not going, like inviting another friend along so he's not the third wheel, but he seems disappointed that it's specifically not just the two of them.

Also there's the whole ""with her in the room I can't speak on her behalf"" comment. Which implies that if she wasn't, he would have told the boyfriend that she doesn't want him to go, despite that not being true."
"He's going to take you out for a fancy dinner as an apology?  And what has he given up for you, is he actually married with 3 teenaged kids?

OP, I'm so sorry this turned out this way for you.   But please, do not let this man make you feel guilty for trusting him.  If that manipulation can roll so easily off his tongue I can't imagine what else might be in store with him.

I'm a little worried for you, if he might still show up, do you have a friend that you can stay with for a while?  I'm thinking since you talked everyday he might know your schedule, I'd shake that up a bit.  Please take extra precautions and stay safe.  "
"So he covered your mouth to shut you up from begging him to stop and kept thrusting into you for a few more minutes?

Ho.ly.shit. That is fucked up. How do you NOT see that that is WRONG and you were essentially raped?? You're still with this fucking piece of shit?? Go go the police station NOW and tell them every thing!! "
"Even if this were true (I'm having an extremely difficult time finding actual evidence) the fact that HE ALREADY HAD TO HAVE SOMETHING REMOVED totally negates any slight risk of cancer that sunscreen can provide.

That's like telling someone not to tourniquet a limb when a major artery has been severed. Yeah, it runs the risk for losing a limb, but it's better than DYING"
"If anything, actual sex wakes me up and makes me want to cuddle and talk, not dooze off to sleepy land."

"Yeah you nailed it girl! Keep up the no contact and keep living your awesome new single life. This guy is bad news and will only keep dragging you down.

I think you handled everything perfectly. Hopefully he got the message and will finally leave you alone!"
"I am glad you will make other plans for the holiday. However, this is still disconcerting:

&gt; No, the statements are true.

You should **not** be best friends with your boss/mentor who is 12 years old and married.

It is inappropriate to blur the lines between friendship and personal life with work, business relationships, and a professional mentor/mentee  dynamic.

* If he's your best friend, he cannot be your mentor. His ability to be objective and professional is compromised.

* If he's your boss, he cannot be your best friend. This is a conflict of interest.

* If he's married, his wife should be his best female friend. Not a work colleague. "
"You apologise profusely, take whatever blame and anger they throw your way and accept that actions have consequences. Those are your next steps. Whether your kids accept this is down to them. This will probably alter the way they see you and you’ll just have to live with that unfortunately. "
"When someone cuts off a family member there is always a reason, and the reason is most often abuse of some kind. You may not agree with your wife's decision (and for real, I cannot fathom how you could look at her reactions and her responses to talking about her childhood and think ""Well, I can fix this!"") but you are 100% obligated to HONOR it. "
"Your mother feels betrayed. Not only did her husband cheat on her, but her three sons knew of the affair and didn't say anything. Give her and your sisters time. "
"So, you're 26.  The older you get, the older the woman gets, the more of a past you're going to have to handle.  This is a you issue, so get some therapy.  The sum of her life experiences make her who you love.  All of it.  Either figure out how to accept it or cut her loose."
"a random # she got while on a trip with her friend, she is texting and deleting all of the texts? either she a drug dealer or she cheating. 

you really have to either leave, confront her about it(which u got to explain why u were looking) or stay and most likely get burned.

"
Already done that!
"&gt;I feel like he should say this if it's how he feels.

Definitely, but keep in mind it's you + him vs. the problem, not you vs. him. Even if he is communicating his needs poorly (which he totally is), it will serve your marriage *so much more* to get to the true root of the problem.




After, you very much should discuss why he approached it this way, because it's not good. My hunch is that he feels like he doesn't or shouldn't *need* alone time with you because that takes you away from the baby, so his ego is trying to rationalize it as ""better for the baby!"" 




He has a leg to stand on, but it unfortunately isn't the argument he's trying to make--*but it is better for the baby if your guys' marriage is strong*. Maybe one-on-one time is a requirement for that"
"If this was the 70s some of that would be valid but she's just being selfish. Maybe I can help explain the electric instruments element. 

So all composers use programs like ProTools and Logic, Reaper or Cubase etc to record their music, but generally they don't use actual instruments, they use samples. All of these programs (besides Reaper maybe) come with sample libraries, which are basically a range of instruments, but if there is a sound or instrument that isn't there then you can buy or download or torrent enormous sound libraries for basically every sound or instrument you can imagine. The money she is spending on soundproofing your office is better spent on buying a decent sample library as there is now way she is good enough at playing all these instruments unless she did a degree in them to submit to any client anyway. 

I don't know where you live or if she's done this before but it would be an excellent idea if possible to shadow a composer for a month or so on the weekends so she can learn how to record using a MIDI keyboard and pre-recorded sound libraries. I live in LA and my neighbor is a singer songwriter, I'm a musician, my partner and roomie are both composers and we all keep different hours but midday to 11pm ish are when we ALL play/practice/compose without headphones or blast with speakers (sometimes you have to for movies to understand how it will really sound) and the rest are quiet hours because it's simply not fair to force everyone to hear the cruddy beginnings of your music at all hours.

Let me know if you need any clarifications or recommendations on software or samples. Good luck!"
"OP, you say here that it’s the lying that gets to you. But elsewhere you say it’s that she still talks to him at all. I do think if you want to repair your relationship with your mom, you are going to have to get clear on which of those it really is. That may require more information than you have right now. But I’d suggest going to a therapist yourself and getting to a place where you can have a calm conversation with your mom asking for that information and explaining why it’s important for you to have it."
"Drop the backwards ""man pays for everything"" rubbish. Talk to her about it, if she earns then she pays proportionately to those earnings. "
"This really does not sound like a MIL problem but a husband problem to me. You going straight to MIL would probably not be a good idea, he needs to take responsibility for his mother and her impact on your relationship.

He should be able to tell her ""No, she does not really appreciate jewelry""... And if he cant, i cant see you getting in the middle of this as working out to well. "
"she lied to your face multiple times already, why do u think she telling the truth now???

Also most men who fight for custody do get at least 50/50"
Really. I’d be thrilled for my husband if he came home with a fancy new free car. And I’d be driving it too and thanking the in laws. 
"I think it's because other people realize that he's just being a controlling asshole and she has a much bigger problem than not knowing what time he's getting home, like you said. 
"
"Here's the thing..your relationship isn't seemingly perfect.  You have a a great friendship with him, not a relationship.  I don't think a break would work because honestly, the issue isn't stemming from him needing to work things out.  The fibers of his character are such that you don't really find him desireable.  No amount of space could change that.  And he really shouldn't change for you.  Someone out there will want him as is.  The same goes for you.  Go find someone you actually want intead of a milquetoast boyfriend that plies you with perks.  You deserve passion."
yeah he sounds like a scumbag. not worth ops time
????? You’re still the one sexualizing a toddler.

"""I go back to my sister's house to find a giant plant with pink bows. My parents went to my sister's house, without permission, and left in her bedroom (the most private place you can be). ""

I can't get over the fact she gifted a fucking plant. Who does that? Like ""hey! congrats on the baby. Have some shrubbery."" 

Honestly I'm with the other poster who said to take away Jane's phone. She just gave birth. Her emotions and hormones are high. The last thing she needs is to deal with this stupidity. Tell her that she needs to focus on baby and mom bonding time and put up a message on FB stating ""Mom and baby are doing great. Mom and dad are taking a social media break to focus on being a family. If you would like to see Baby please contact OP or Husband by phone."" Then both of you screen her calls and don't let your witch of a mother through. Use that time to explain to sister that she is the holder of the grandchild, there fore she is the one in power. Unite against the evil narcissism. "
"It seems like this friendship has been pretty one-sided right from the start.

Has there ever actually been a time when SHE supported YOU instead of the other way around? It seems like she's mostly just talked about how she would/could be supportive. And talk is cheap.

I give you full permission to start ghosting.

Or end the ""friendship"" in whatever way seems the most natural/easiest to you.

If you want to give her a heads up, you can. But I wouldn't do more than a text: ""Hey, we've been drifting apart for a while now. Even if we're no longer friends, I wanted to let you know that I wish you all the best with Laila.""

If you'd prefer to just ghost her, and then she asks you what's up? Feel free to be brutally honest. ""Our friendship has been one-sided for a long time. I've been supporting you, and haven't had any support in return. I've had enough, and we're no longer friends. Goodbye."""
 There’s a chance that what they did was illegal. What was the agreement for your apartment? It sounds like you were illegally evicted 
"Well, that's nicer than my suggestion of switching everything to laxatives and then breaking up with him. "
"It wasn’t a joke. 

The truthful statement was when she said she was bored. Your girlfriend flirts with other guys when she’s bored. She probably doesn’t have much going on and is used to getting all her feels from men.

This is not the kind of girl you want to get in a serious relationship with. Personally I would just start looking for other girls and working on myself more while still enjoying her company but leases/commitments/marriage would be forever off the table.

If you’re not a player and don’t like that shit then break up, no contact. This girl will eventually cheat on you."
"He’s actually a lot closer to his expiration date now. If he moves to New York like he wants, he will be in for a rude awakening. Now is the time for them to planning on what comes after dance. "
We only started kissing when he stopped it and told me - so his dick did not get wet. But your point is still valid. 
"Sounds like you need to have a frank discussion about what you like sexually. I think on the grand scale of sexual experiences, mutual masturbation is pretty vanilla and usually an easy pill for people in healthy sexual relationships to swallow. Just tell your partner ""you know what I think would be so sexy...?"" Or ""I think you're so beautiful I would love to see..."" then follow it up with ""and what is something I can do for you?"" Hopefully she'll be able to have a discussion with you. "
"""Atypical"", I like that. It's a bit more forgiving than my hyperbole. Thank you."
Sounds to me like you've just agreed to get rid of it.  Is that a tap out I'm seeing?
"Yes, this is a situation where ghosting is appropriate. "
"Update: She wound up crawling in my roommates bed and he woke up to her in it with him. 

She also peed in his closet. 

Chalking it up to sleep walking mixed with drugs/alcohol. 

Everyone knows she’s wild when she parties. Since everyone knew she got in my roommates bed in the middle of the night and were laughing about it, I decided to tell everyone where she stopped first before ending up there. 

We all laughed about it. I’m not creeped out about it, I can handle myself and as I said, I wasn’t going to let it happen. It was weird as hell though, and definitely left me uncomfortable for a few minutes before I fell back asleep. "
"Happy to help. A lot of women internalise blame when a partner cheats, but you must remember *they* went through with the action. He could have spoken to you about the lack of oral sex, get a conversation going and maybe tried to reach a compromise. But he chose not to do that. That's on him, not you. 

I wish you the best x"
"I nannied and would never have brought friends or a bf over.  Even if the boyfriend is a totally awesome guy who would never hurt the kids, he'll still be taking up her attention which means less attention for the kids.  And, as a nanny, attention for the kids is kind of her job."
"Yes, yes, yes. This is the biggest point on the thread. This is such a bigger problem than OP or her bf realize."
"My mom had the same surgery and it was pretty minor and mostly painless. She was walking pretty quick and felt great pretty fast. It doesn't seem overly invasive or major, so I'm sure you'll be fine. As for your bf though... girl, he's anti vax and wants to use essential oils for possible cancer? You could do sooo much better. It's obvious he's not the brightest and he's willing to put you and your potential future kids at risk because he thinks he's somehow smarter than medical professionals? Run chica, and don't look back! "
"Agreed. When I was reading this I thought ""makes sense if it was an unown."" She could have been nicer about it tho "

Holy shit I hope you don’t have daughters because soon he’ll be telling them they’re responsible for cleaning up after their brothers. 
That was so beautiful. I loved it.
Why didn't you put that you are married and undercover poly in your post?  This changes the dynamics  and the advice reddit should give you. 
"‘I’m worried about you. How are you feeling?’

Their depression has a clear hold on them, and living in absolute squalor is quite possibly a vicious cycle for them. They feel like shit, so they can’t clean, so they live in filth, which makes them feel like shit. 

So invite them out, buy them a tea/coffee/whatnot and listen to where they’re at. Be a supportive shoulder, if you’re able. If it’s helpful, share any techniques or resources from your own therapy sessions and, if you have the time and inclination and can stomach it, offer to help clean up. 

If it was any other situation, I’d recommend you just tell your friend that their flat is nasty, but in this case I don’t think it’d help. 

If you do decide to help clean up, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just suggest it, put on some great music, and set out a groundwork for the cleaning while still allowing them to take the lead in case their anxiety is triggered by you touching their stuff. ‘How about I take the kitchen while you do the bathroom?’  

Hope it helps!

"That's a disrespectful thing to do. Leave your friend in the washroom while knowing they had IBS, because you felt ditched? Not only does it show that you'll remain ignorant to a friend's (in this case, girlfriend's) medical conditions, but you disregard them because of your own personal hang-ups. It's immature. "

"If someone doesn’t work in the medical field they truly have no concept of how it works.  They think if they go in and tell you x,y,z symptoms then you should be able to nail the diagnosis right then and there.  They don’t understand that yes while the reported symptoms can help point you in the right direction of what to look for it’s still not a be all end all.  Lab values can remain wnl for a while before revealing and underlying issue same with imaging.  Working as a nurse in a level 1 trauma in both the ER and a part of the ICU float pool has illuminated so many misconceptions patients and families have about hospitals and medical professionals in general.  Everyone thinks they get it and they know better because of google this or that etc.  No one grasps that the body is a complex machine who’s body systems all work together and whatever they are reading online barely scratches the surface of what could truly be going on or what else to look out for."
A wife and children can be your family. You expect more from friendships than is normal. Hanging out twice a week is a lot for adults.
Really? He is not being honest. He was caught doing a shitty thing and he's trying to dig himself out of the hole. 
"We've been talking. Which is why I've come to the conclusion I want a divorce. She lied to me for the entirety of our relationship. Am I'm the selfish one? If I could carry the kid I would. But since biology kind screwed the pooch on that one I'm left at the mercy of my wife. She knows this. She lied to me. 

If my wife had sabotaged her birth control and gotten pregnant would you be telling me to not be so selfish? ""She just wanted a child. She was scared you would leave her if she told the truth. She was scared of saying out loud that she wanted a child *so* badly."" "
"My Grandma used to say to me ""I'd rather be alone than wish that I was."" It's now my mantra when it comes to relationships. You may want to apply it to yours.

Being in a relationship should enhance your life. You should never have to fight for to right to simply be yourself to your partner. Your partner should love and appreciate you for who you are. Not belittle you and make you feel small, and constantly remind you how you don't measure up. (also the all Muslims are terrorists thing? wtf. what a bigot) If he wants a perfect girlfriend, he can go get himself an anime body pillow.

You, on the other hand, should start prepping yourself to leave. It's going to suck, to be sure. But trust me, three months from now, you'll feel so much better. (Listen to Rilo Kiley's Breakin' Up on loop if you need the extra strength, it helped me leave a similar shitty relationship)"

"There’s a great, old-fashioned phrase for just this occasion.

I don't think it would be crass if they were both adults and in a long-term relationship or something. But a 16 year old? You don't give a necklace worth $7k to a 16 year old.
"It's your decision. Personally, I wouldn't be able to deal with this drama.  I have enough on my plate and I would be stressed out if a friend of mine was trying to get me to cover up for something like cheating and repeatedly lied to me and whatnot.   You are not a bad friend for dropping her.  You are just not the friend she wants and that's okay."

"Most of those can be symptoms of a viral infection. Very common in kids. Most viral infections are self-limiting. They suck, but there's really nothing that can be done other than sending the kids home with directions to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and use OTC meds to control any fever or pain (muscle and joint aches). 

Coughing up blood is not what it looks like in movies, it doesn't necessarily mean someone is going to die in 5 minutes or has ""the consumption."" There is a long list of differentials that results from that single symptom, which can include such common occurrences as acid reflux or, if a kid has had a viral infection, *irritation of the throat from a lot of coughing*. There's a difference between a little spotting on the tissue or in sputum and coughing up mouthfuls of blood at a time. The same goes for blood in the urine or stool. Vast list of differentials, not nearly as serious as movies and TV make it out to be (most of the time, depending on *a lot* of details). 

Kids, and even adults, can take a turn for the worse unexpectedly when they're sick. It doesn't mean that they have been *that* sick the whole time, or that a mistake was made. I was working in emergency medicine last month and there were patients who were sitting up talking to us one minute and later were unconscious while their O2 sats dropped and nurses rushed to grab an intubation kit. When I was working in internal med, there was a patient on my service who was being treated for pneumonia, not a big deal, completely standard of care. Out of nowhere one day the infection just took over (very generalized description there), and whereas a day beforehand we were talking about discharge options, the day after we were talking to his family about end-of-life decisions. Again, neither of these patients showed outward signs of anything grossly unusual, there was no negligence involved, no one did anything wrong. Medicine is hard, it's why people go through undergrad, years of med school, +/- fellowship, and then a multi-year residency. 

It's very difficult for individuals outside the medical field to understand the unpredictability of medicine, and how quickly things can change. We use terms like ""routine surgery"" as if we, as human beings, have some control over the universe, but we don't. Our technology and treatments have developed to a point where *any* negative outcome, because of the sheer volume of positive outcomes, is immediately suspected to be due to a mistake. Sometimes the human body plays by the rules, and sometimes it doesn't.

"My brother was the GC &amp; I didn't even realize it until I was in my 30s. I'd just assumed I deserved to be treated the way I was. 

When we got older, he would suggest books to me about emotionally abused kids and I still didn't really pick up on what he was trying to tell me. 

It turns out he saw how differently he was treated &amp; it made him feel uncomfortable (and sad for me), but he was a kid &amp; didn't really know what to do about it. 

Just like it's not OP's fault her mother treats her &amp; her other sister like trash; the GC isn't responsible for their mother's actions either. "

"(((hugs)))

You're having a really tough situation right now, and I can understand the visceral feeling of grossness that you're experiencing - I figured it'd less about polyamory itself, and more about him telling you that something you've never had an interest in is ""for your own good"". That *is* gross.

Honestly, it's really heartening to read that you do know that this isn't for you, and seem very strongly to feel that ""trying it out for him"" is NOT an option for you.

I cannot tell you how many people we see in r/polyamory to decide to try it out ""for the sake of our relationship"" and end up even more miserable and frankly, sometimes feeling violated or really abused. Which makes total sense, because forcing yourself to have other relationships for someone else *is* a violation of self. 

I wish you all the best in this, and I hope that whatever the resolution ultimately is, it is one that allows you to stay true to yourself. "
"Short answer:  
Therapy. Your self-worth is shattered and you have no confidence. You are not ready for a relationship.  

---  

Long answer:  
You come off as an absolute loser. But I think you already know that.  

* Only a loser freely talks about how his girlfriend is 'out of their league'. 
* Only a loser watches helplessly as his girlfriend dates another guy.  
* Only a loser openly admits that he literally 'cannot' get his life together.  

You can't get into a relationship before you're a healthy robust functioning human being on your own. Having a girlfriend won't cure you or change you into something better. So when your girlfriend started dating another man, the obvious answer should have been to dump her, but instead you're beating yourself up about how the other man is 'better' than you and that you suck.  

Don't be a loser.

"You're a woman. You shouldn't have to go to a family Christmas as somebody you're not.

If they decide 'keeping up appearances' matters more to them than your presence... well, that's their loss."

"I think it is definitely a possibility, too, though not a certainty. The fact that she's being honest about skipping the pills (instead of just saying it was a fluke) suggests that maybe she is telling the truth and it was an accident, but at the same time, it is fishy. Forgetting on a couple random days isn't a huuuge deal, but a couple days in a row is where you get in the danger zone. If I were OP, either way, I'd take the birth control into my own hands somehow (condoms he supplies himself) in the future."
He could have made her sleep on the couch. Or the floor. Or called her a cab home. Or driven her home himself. Or hidden her keys and let her figure it out herself. There are so many things he could have done that didn't involve sleeping in the same bed as her.

"I'm certainly not saying that solo time isn't important - it absolutely is.

I'm not even saying wanting to play an hour or two of video games is unreasonable - couple of nights a week it certainly is not.

I think the problem I took away from this whole post is OP's attitude on the issue. He seems to be resentful towards his wife that she wants to spend more quality time with him. And honestly if you go through his line of events during the evening his only real ""quality"" time with her is watching Netflix or in the lead up to sex. I would be unsatisfied if that was all I got from my partner.

And he says this

&gt;I'm a pretty chill guy, but I do not like being told what to do, particularly by someone who is supposed to be my equal.

This seethes resentment. In context with the rest of his post OP makes it sound like ""I've checked off enough boxes as a partner, I should be able to do what I feel like."" 

I think the truth here is that once you enter into a marriage or relationship, you are giving up being able to decide everything you do 100% of the time. That is - sometimes you do stuff your partner wants to do, even if it's not what you want. And it's a 2 way street.

Maybe OPs wife just wants to spend more time cuddling on the couch - so some nights OP should not play video games and do that. It's not unreasonable.

And maybe OP wants to just play video games, so some nights he does that. That's not unreasonable either.

The answer lies in the middle. Unfortunately OP is going to just have to accept that when you are married, if you want to maintain a healthy relationship you may not be able to play video games every night. Just like OPs wife is going to have to accept that you have to let your partners engage in their hobbies even if they dont interest you"
"I totally agree.  I have ADD and my first thought was ""sounds like ADD"" while I was reading this.  Most likely, the thought of starting these activities (especially talking on the the phone) feels really overwhelming for her.  ADD is an executive functioning disorder.  The way I think of it is: she may like these activities and want to do them but carrying through and ""executing"" that decision can feel impossible.  Also, ADD can be a HUGE source of anxiety, especially for women.  I would advise OP to look into the symptoms of ADD/ADHD for adult women.  ADD can look so different in women that it appears to be something else entirely.  I would suggest going to the doctor with her and maybe talking about some ADD medication which could relieve some of that anxiety."
"Umm...  It isn't wishful thinking to have someone apologize and take their hands off of you no matter how heated the moment is.

I mean, yes people are upset and tempers run high in an argument, but that doesn't matter when it comes things like don't grab my face.



You are right about the best time to bring it up being outside of an argument, but if she can't tell her husband that she doesn't like him moving her face in the middle of an argument because he would act out, then well, the only advice she should be getting is to find a better quality guy!"

"Yep. If you don't want to be on birth control and your husband is unwilling to use condoms, then the only way you can prevent having a baby is by not having sex with him.

But, you can't force your husband to use a condom if he doesn't want to use one."

Blindly listening to someone you love when ""evidence"" points to them being in trouble is not loyalty.

Yes, it sucks, but trust me when someone IS an addict they will swear black and blue they are not. 99% of stories told and googled will not end with a clean piss test but with years of lies spilling out.

"welp, my time (sadly) to shine. i will probably delete this after a bit, even though i don’t think she looks are reddit at all, just in case.

my partner and i have been together 4 years, and she came out to me 2 years ago. the first year was fine - she was still the person i fell in love with, tho shifting. she wasn’t involved at the time in trans groups, was pretty stealth still, and took HRT pills but things were really slow to change. So we got married, as planned, and then ended up long distance. since that happened, everything has changed. she got facial surgery and suddenly that, coupled with being out full time, and heavily ramped up hormones - she changed so much. qualities about her personality shifted, she got heavily involved in trans groups and it’s all we talk about most of the time (despite my struggles to make it not, while still supporting her), and frankly it’s so hard to look at a strangers face that while objectively is super hot, isn’t my person. 

All this to say i tried, really hard, but i can’t do it, and i’m breaking the news to her next week. and i’m so sad, because it’s nothing either of us have done, or rather, nothing either of us should have done differently. i’m so glad she had the strength to do this, and that i could give her support and care during it, during her surgery, but in the end i’m heteroromantic, and i do not want this to be my life, and i don’t want it to be hers, being with someone that doesn’t embrace every aspect of her with a resounding fuck yes. 

is it the beginning of the end? it doesn’t have to be, but also it can be. you gave her a safe space to discover who she really is, and it’s ok to not be able to make this leap with her. someone out there is going to be that person for her, and part of loving someone is realizing that you can’t be what they need.

"5 or 6 first dates isn't a whole lot,  it wouldn't be unusual to get that many without a second (especially newish to dating). 

When you're on a date how do they normally go? Is it 50/50 or do you/they speak most of the time, what sort of subjects do you talk about, is there any sort of physical touch? 

When you ask people out how do you do it,  and what sort of date do you ask people on? Give some examples. 

You might need to push your friends to be brutally honest (it's really awkward telling people they come across as creepy/ugly/weird). If you're comfortable you could try asking some more direct questions e. g. ""I'm dating and I want to improve myself.  What do you think are my worst qualities?

"You two are incompatible. Sticking around and hoping she, or you, will change your mind is a terrible idea. This is as basic as dating advice gets and there's no ambiguity, if you want to settle down with kids soon, don't stay with someone who doesn't want the same life goal and just hope things will change.

Also, you're thirty. That's not that old. Sure you want to settle down soon, but take off some of then pressure so you aren't settling for a bad match. "

"As weird as it sounds, you got incredibly lucky that your abuser left you. That doesn't happen a whole lot. 

I know that you said you don't have a great relationship with your family, but is it possible to reach out to them at all? Can you handle living with them long enough to get back on your feet? If it's not possible, I understand, then do you have old friends that you could ask for help? 

Also, change your number/block the guy. You need to separate yourself. "
"Bring up that he doesn't know how many people are using it to treat their illness, he only knows how many are using it as a drug?"
"I have a huge intolerance for people without any medical training thinking they know better than a doctor. That’s how we have this idiotic anti vaccine movement.

I used to work on a pharmacy. You can abuse pretty much any prescribed medication if you want to. I’ve seen people abuse anything from cough syrup, antidepressants to painkillers.

In fact abuse of painkillers is a *big* one. Does he take painkillers for headaches? Cos’ you could flip this whole situation right back round on him by telling him that ‘people abuse pain meds’ all the time so you’re not allowed to take any whilst you’re with me otherwise it’ll put a huge strain on this relationship’. That might make him think.

You might not be able to get through to him since he’s doing some pretty interesting mental gymnastics here. Your health is *priority*. Lock up those meds and if you have to ditch his ass."
"Enjoy the experience while it’s happening! Don’t think about never seeing them again. Focus on what’s happening now. 

You also don’t know for sure that you’ll never see any of those people again. Your best friend could be out there right now, but you’ll never meet him/her if you stay locked in your room."
"Marijuana doesn't affect people the way you're describing unless it's like... Their first ever time smoking it and they have zero tolerance to the substance. 

I'm sorry, I know it's not what you want to hear but it sound's like he's taking harder drugs, possibly pills. Maybe opiates. "
"It might be one of those times that you forgo school until you get on your feet. Not going back to Syria sounds like a priority and that means sacrifices. She can't force you on a plane, you're an adult. So take some steps to separate yourself from your mother. That might include putting school on hold and getting an apartment."
I think you should take up a musical instrument. Like... the bagpipes. Fuck that guy right in his face. 
Definitely let her know before they end up with kids. It would be far harder to deal with then.
"Is there any way to set up a transfer for the amount he needs to pay the bills, so that his Uber expenses can only come out of what's left?"
"You're talking about the people who raised OP's sister.

Obviously, there's something wrong with them."
"So you need to tell your boyfriend. 

However, you also need to guide your boyfriend.  You need to make sure he doesn't fly off the handle or jump to any conclusions. 

It's possible that his parents have an arrangement (which they would be mortified if their son knew about). It's also possible that, as Esther Perrell says, ""The victim of the affair is not always the victim of the relationship.""  Maybe his wife unilaterally ended their sex life, but they don't want to get divorced for financial reasons or because of the kids, and the only way to keep the happy home together for the kids is a discreet affair. 

Maybe they're loving and devoted to each other *because* they aren't strict about monogamy.  (Many open couples find that being open makes it easier to be good partners to each other: it takes the pressure of being their partners only sexual outlet off, and let's them enjoy each other's company). 

And, of course, it's possible that his dad is a deceitful cheating scumbag - and there are hundreds of gradations in between. 

Before your boyfriend goes running to his mom with this information, he needs to evaluate a lot of things. Is it possible she's happier not knowing? Would she be okay in the event of a divorce? That is to say, his first responsibility isn't to tell her, it's to her larger welfare. These are not easy questions, and he should think about them before he acts. 

It's also important that this not destroy his relationship with his father. Infidelity is a human failing, and monogamy is hard.  Contrary to what a lot of people say, it is possible to love someone dearly - and cheat on them. It's possible to be a good person, and have an affair.  Humans are complex and we're never more complex than when it comes to sexuality.  So, again, your job is to make sure that your boyfriend doesn't burn any bridges in his first reaction to this uncomfortable information.  He needs to think, consider, evaluate ... and *then* act. 

I would strongly encourage you to do some reading (and find some good articles to refer him to) about infidelity. Dan Savage has written on it a lot. Esther Perell's ""Mating in Captivity"" is valuable read. 

Good luck. "
Cut contact with him. Who knows what else he's lied about.
"The cat is helpless and dependent on humans for help. If you see him neglecting her and don’t do anything, what does that say about you? The cat is old and sick and in pain. Please have mercy on her, even though you’re rightfully furious with him. 

You would have probably paid less to get her checked out than you will on replacing everything she ends up destroying. The cat isn’t the problem. Your boyfriend is the problem. Please remember that. "
"You made plans, you bought a plane ticket, I have broken up with people for less than this.  I am extremely sorry. You have every right to be upset. You are entitled to your feelings. What he did was thoughtless.  

I read this part: ""he hangs up the phone angrily""

And my advice is, you deserver better, I am very sorry."
"Boyfriend and I both play Pokemon Go. Boyfriend and myself would probably both stop sex if we saw a rare pokemon was nearby. 

We would probably celebrate with even more enthusiastic celebratory sex. "
If the kids get hurt or drown in his pool guess who is getting sued? Also why is she entitled to that? Considering that they are childfree their house isn't childproof and probably isn't safe for the kids. They don't want family over in their property and honestly there's nothing wrong with that. Their house their rules. These people aren't entitled to it just because they are family.
"&gt; She also locked her accounts so I couldn't read anything on her Facebook or Email. This just seems like I am not knowing the whole truth and something else is afoot and need advice.

Your guess is right. You're not going to be able to move past this when she's still keeping secrets from you. You might as well start the divorce process now, if she's not going to be level with you and put her cards on the table then it's not really a marriage anymore."
"You and I already discussed this. You can't make this decision out of revenge. Your relationship issues with your mother and your decision about your brother need to be divorced entirely. It's fine to not have gf in your pictures but not *because* your fiance wasn't.

You're right that your mom is behaving inappropriately and you did a good job laying boundaries with her and saying no. Just keep doing what you're doing."
"&gt;I am hoping that someone out there has been in a similar situation and provide me with some positivity or guidance.

So nobody that's been through the same situation is going to be able to give you instructions on how to make him propose. At this point it's clear he is never going to marry you. You have zero reasons to think he will or will change his mind.

What are your thoughts on children? If you want kids I'm concerned you are holding out for the impossible, if you waste another 10 years with this guy you will have lost your window. You have just enough time now to find someone new and not need to rush it if you want to start a family. The longer you wait to break up with him the worse it will be."
"So, aside from anything else, all of your comments are showing that you have a REAL problem empathizing with people who aren't you and haven't shared your own personal life experiences.

You seem to have this very vague, abstract idea that yes, bad stuff happens to other people, but it's not REAL to you. It doesn't really matter to you, and you don't really pay much attention to it until it interferes with how you want things to go - at which point, your reaction is to try to force things to go the way you want anyway.

I'm going to want you to recognize this as an understatement: this is a major problem.

It's also a major problem because the only reason you're really examining it now or considering it a problem is because your efforts to circumvent someone else's reality in favor of your own has instead boomeranged to make your own worse than it was before you started meddling. You're still having trouble really recognizing fully that while what you did was fucked up, what you THOUGHT and what you CONTINUE to think is even more fucked up.

You took away your wife's agency because you felt your vision of happy families trumped whatever her reality might be. Even now you're still making excuses for yourself.

I recommend getting some therapy for this, one on one therapy, and also go over to r/justnomil and ask them for help in three things: making this up to your wife (if she will allow you to), educating you on other people's reality, and protecting your wife and child from the unholy shitstorm of abuse which is probably now coming to your doorstep *because you invited it there*.

Seriously. People have DIED because of stuff like this. Estranged parents have stabbed their children, tried setting fire to their homes with the adult children, their spouses and children trapped inside, have tried (and sometimes succeeded in) kidnapping grandchildren even when they've never met them. THIS IS OTHER PEOPLE'S REALITY.

Learn from this."
"Because you are a teenager! You need to understand and maybe you are starting to realize that life isn't easy. If you can't focus on school but only have a low paying job you need to figure out/with your parents help what you are going to do. At 19, you're probably in your first big relationship, you starting having sex quickly with someone after dating a month, and am sure have the notion that you're going to be together forever, which is not likely. Learning to cope with your anxiety is pretty important, ignore your dad's comments and start acting like a grown up (if you're going to have sex you have made the decision to engage in adult behavior), seek out medical treatment. And for gods sake, make sure you don't get pregnant. Seek out support through the college counseling office or your primary care physician/gynecologist (you should have seen a gynecologist if you are sexually active)."
"Yep. Also, you aren't teenagers. The whole ""I don't want my friend's SO there at my *bowling party* cuz I don't really know them"".... I mean it's just *silly*. Why micromanage an effing bowling party guest list?! The event is important, sure. But your friend's general preference is going to cause a bunch of BS. So she needs to drop it lol. "
"&gt; Neither one of us wanted to deal with insurance so we let it go.

Learn to take care of your car.

&gt; She was very flustered and begged me not get insurance involved either and so I agreed. She gave me like $500 and I just considered it even.

This is so dumb. You pay insurance for a reason!! You really don't sound very bright.

Take the Honda, and sell it for a mom car when you actually have kids."
What you just described is American culture in a nutshell.
"You brought it up and put it out there, even though it really has nothing to do with the issue at hand.  There's a big difference between saying you're sex positive and actually behaving in a manner consistent with those views.  Instead of slut-shaming your friend for being honest with you, why don't you figure out why the idea of your friend having sex with a guy you've only been out with twice freaks you out so much.  That's the real issue here.  "
"If your wife feels like she's losing every single night to your hobby, I think it's reasonable to have ""off nights"" where you spend the entire night with her and do not play any video games. Most hobbies aren't 2 hours a day, everyday, so I don't think she's being unreasonable here at all. Playing video games completely makes you unavailable to her, so it's not the same as say...painting where you can take breaks to talk and still engage. Gaming usually shuts you off to the entire world. 

Do you completely ignore her for these hours you are playing? Do you respond to her when she needs something? Do you have days a week where you are spending real, uninterrupted quality time with her?"
"WTH, why? Seriously, this is just a normal part of adulthood. You really think it's okay that your gf asks you to pay for her tuition? She didn't even ask to BORROW the money, no, she asked you to PAY for it. That's a significant difference.

&gt; I offered to pay this 3% in echange that she pays the debt on her student loans 

I understand that you love this girl, but you're extremely naive. Stop spending so much money on this girl. Invest it in yourself and buy some appropriate clothing and put it into savings.

"
"Just be careful you don’t start to take on a parental-type role in all this. You can discuss with her, give your opinion / advice when she asks for it but don’t take on responsibility for her. It’s very hard to get back to being two independent but bonded adults once you’ve instead fallen into a parent/child dynamic. "
"Not to question you here, but are you quite convinced that she was aware of this desire to never birth children the entire time? Perhaps she was trying to convince herself that she wanted to, but when push came to shove the feeling bubbled over?

""Paying your doc under the table"" to not reveal she's on the pill....? I'm sorry but this is lawsuit level accusation, and gross malpractice? Sorry but it doesn't sound believable that she was literally bribing her doctor not to tell you that she's on the pill. Her doctor would have his license suspended for accepting such bribes... you're making this sound like a literal conspiracy... 

Either way divorce her this is clearly a dumpster fire of resentment already "
"Your highly educated, amazing person of a friend is embroiled in an ideology that has historically enacted genocide on marginalized groups of people. I understand that he is your lifelong friend, but he is a literal Nazi.

"
"That doesn't void the neglect, laziness and screaming he ""treats"" your son to the rest of the time.

With how stressed and busy you are, do you take it out on your son? Do you ignore him for hobbies/video games? If not, good, that's the correct way to parent. It's not like your husband misses out on sleep involuntarily or is too busy busting his ass for an income or household/childcare labor. He's not doing schoolwork 12 hours a day. He has absolutely no reason for treating you or your kid the way he does. He's not being an adequate spouse or father."
"This is basically exactly what I think happened. I think she saw me as a kind of nice gentle nerdy guy and this changed her view of me dramatically. 

She also has some really strong views on this stuff in general. I am remembering when we watched Rocky she couldn't stop rolling her eyes at it haha. I think she just kind of thinks this stuff is purely posturing so people think they are tough or some shit. "
"&gt;  he heard this and grabbed his gun and pointed it at me, pulled back the slide, and ranted about having nothing to lose

That."
"Alright, I get where you're coming from. But if it happens again, you definitely need to take more action. Also, your husband is awesome for doing the exact right thing in the situation. :)"
"Um. Let's focus on this douchebag. Having an affair with an employee is already in sexual harassment territory, because you have power over them. Add on having the affair and then contemplating terminating the employee because of it, and you are in huge discrimination territory. He did this to himself and would deserve to have his ass handed to him in court if it came to that."
"Well, if he leaves his wife it’ll be because SHE kicked him out.  Then OP will have to live with a man who 1. Impregnates side pieces while married and 2. Didn’t want her until wifey kicked his cheating and lying self out. Doesn’t sound like the most stable start to a relationship.  

I’m laughing at this dumb bastard though.  Knocking up your affair partner is the ultimate humiliation.  Karma, baby!"
"I saw your edit that he spent christmas with his mom who you don't get along w/ instead of you. That's not ok. When you get married, your spouse becomes your new primary family and you have to have their back. "
"Wow, I hate your husband.

Seriously who is mean to a dog? Who *continues* to be mean to a dog after he bonds with another dog, and ""learns his lesson?"" And then blames you for it? 

Deal breaker for me: anyone who treats animals like shit. I truly hope he's better to your kid than he is to the dog, but I can't say I'm hopeful there. As soon as the kid ""impedes his freedom"" he'll probably be just as much of a dick."
I'm off work today so I'm going to join my boyfriend for lunch. Very simple but I'm really looking forward to it. 😊
Not to mention lawsuit if it bites someone else.
You really need to warn the people in your apartment ASAP if you haven’t already. If someone sees it or their child does and it gets hurt or worse that is 100% on you guys. :( 
Are you a child whisperer? How have you trained your 3 year old so well? Teach us your witchcraft!
"&gt; Lol, counseling. I can imagine 60 whole minutes of silence for free haha.

Counselling is an opportunity for YOU to say YOUR piece about YOUR feelings and not have him dismiss them out of hand.  The counseller is there to affirm your feelings and invite him to respond.

If he doesnt, at least he cant continue to claim your feelings are bullshit.

Don't wave it off, TRY IT."
"A lot of men are pathetically addicted to porn and can't even maintain an erection with a real partner. It is utterly grotesque and a huge problem- the office I worked for was seeing dozens of men in their TWENTIES with erectile dysfunction because of it.

You can't live the rest of your life this way. It's horrible and degrading and painful for you. Walk away. There are men out there who are actually existing on planet frigging Earth and enjoy sex with their partners more than jerking off to videos of people who wouldn't even give them the time of day IRL."
"Aren't you the one who hates people wishing you a happy anniversary? Here you are again, over complicating another simple issue. "
"Lady, you need to quit the pity party. Everyone is coming down hard on you because you’re acting so pitiful and “woe is me.” You made many choices over many years knowing what the risks were. Making this about your pain is still, yet again, not taking responsibility. If you were truly taking responsibility, you would be totally accepting and understanding of these consequences and focusing on your children’s pain rather than your own. You need to back off and give them space to heal and let them rebuild this relationship on your own terms. 

You’ve spent your whole lives, and your children’s whole lives, making your own desires your top priority. It’s time to stop being so selfish and acting so pitiful and grow up.  "
I never thought to actually ask her that. I will do that tonight
"All of my MRS seeking friends also got their degree. Most of them in nursing, teaching, or something artsy. I don’t think I’ve seen someone get an MRS and not finish their degree, but that doesn’t mean it’s not happening or possible. I also notice that the ones pursuing an MRS along with their degree don’t have as much college debt as someone who’s going to college to learn. In my opinion it’s because they’re school is paid for or mostly paid for, giving them more luxury to pursue an MRS. This is just my experience though"
"Yeah.... I've always been one of the crazy animal people. I even talk to spiders when I'm putting them outside. That kind of thing. 
But my dad was a dust bowl baby (literally in depression area OK), raised near farms (they were too poor to HAVE a farm) and the chickens in the yard were dinner. 
When my brother borrowed money for a big vet bill a few years ago, after my dad found out what it was for he said he wouldn't have lent it if he'd known it was to treat a sick cat. 
I really had it out with him (kind but firm). I explained to him that I understood where he came from and how he saw animals... BUT that he needed to take a second and consider it from a different point of view. I told him that my cat LITERALLY saved me from suicide (my brother and I both have mental illness)... that I would go homeless rather than give up a pet... I explained to him about PTSD and animals... etc etc etc. Because I'm ""his little girl"" (even in my 40's) it at least gave him pause to listen.
I told that he needed to open his mind a little and start learning about animals and humans in a different light.  :/ 
"
That's a great response that totally misses the point.  I'm impressed.
"Your wife is a bit fatalistic, huh.

You did fine with your older dog. Why does she think this *completely different* scenario completely negates your dog-caring abilities? A lab puppy is just about the most high-energy creature you can bring into a household, and lab “teenagers” are just puppies who are rapidly becoming stronger than you. That was ALWAYS going to be a struggle. 

Maybe you should get a cat."
"What....

**Theft is not imitation**. 

Especially when she could have had those things for free *before* violating the gf’s trust. And you think the best approach is that the *victim* of the crime provides a gift to the perpetrator?? 

This girl is 17. Not a 4 year old who doesn’t know how to behave (although most kids still know stealing is bad). Drop the kid gloves. If there was ever a way to make that sister an entitled monster, your approach would be perfect. 

The *only* thing you have a point with (in another comment) is the care that should be made in not trying to damage the relationship with the gf/brother too much (which, again, the sister should have thought of *before stealing*). Which is best handled by having the mother intervene, figure out what’s going on, and, oh - you know, making sure the daughter is reminded that stealing is wrong. "
"As someone roughly your age with a best friend around your age doing the same thing, I'm going to be really blunt with you.

I'd really suggest therapy because I guarantee the things you have been feeling about yourself come off to your friends (whether they will ever admit it or not) as super clingy and will end up driving them away.

The nature of many (not all, but many) male friendships change drastically at this age as others settle in careers, families, marriages, kids etc. It sucks but it's something you need to find a way to accept, especially as kids at stuff start popping out.

It doesn't mean you're a bad person or you don't deserve happiness, but as life goes on, your ""importance"" gets knocked down a peg or two to your friends. It's often just how it is.

Seeing your close friends once or twice a week at this age is way more than most. It's honestly way more than I want to see my close friends at this age."
"I did say 'totally' right away and I realize that was my mistake because things are read so differently in text versus in person. For me, 'totally' is a pretty neutral word and can mean 'sure' or 'absolutely' or 'I guess so'. We use it often, so I didn't think about how it'd be read. 

I do get why she's upset, but I think what gets me is she won't see it from me view. I don't ask for anything for my birthday because I hate it. It's stressful time and a reminder of some bad memories.

For me, it seemed the day was about everyone else. My birthday was just being used as a reason for other people. My family insisted on making me a coconut cake even though I hate cake and have an ED history. I pointed this out and I'm ungrateful. They wanted to go to a certain restaurant which I'm known to dislike and I'm shitty for asking to stay. They would say it's all for me, despite knowing I don't want anything, and then everyone is mad at me for not getting excited. I know the intentions are there, but I wish the pressure wouldn't be on me so much.

It makes it seem like I'm the bratty kid saying 'this isn't good enough for me'. That's not it at all. "
"You are so young. Take this as a learning experience, be glad you didn’t have kids, and move on. As someone who has been married for over 20 years, I can tell you that this is not how it is supposed to be."
"You can often see what kind of person a person is by the company they keep - if your girlfriend’s friends don’t mix well with monogamy, it is likely she is used to dynamics where lines of relationships are blurred and that is normal for her... Would really explain why she sees what she does as normal friend activity where you don’t. 

It’s fine to come in and have a discussion of your boundaries, and talk about what monogamy means to you. ‘Basic limits’ of monogamy don’t exist, in my mind, maybe beyond not having full on intercourse with another person. Lots of monogamous couples have different boundaries and still say they are exclusive... eg for me I would be OK with my SO going to a strip club, MAYBE getting a lap dance but no further than that - for some people even going into a strip club breaks their idea of basic monogamy though. This is definitely something to chat about."
"&gt; It's hard to realize people...can be racist as fuck. 

I ended a friendship over similar issues of entitlement due to skin color. The hardest part was the disappointment I felt in myself for trusting that person and caring for them and calling them my friend. "
"Yeah I️ kind of stopped reading after that line, and the bit whew OP capitalized “Hot Girlfriend” and “Desirable Wife” or whatever. Yo OP, you’re not with The Hot Girl. You’re with your wife, who you married, presumably because you love her and like who she is. Don’t project your insecurities onto her. It’s not a crime to be well-liked. She sounds great. Her male coworkers sound immature. You sound like you need to stop making her weight loss all about you."
"&gt;I think I ruined all 3 of our lives

Yup.

&gt;What should I do?

Tell Hoa what happened, apologize, back out of their lives forever."
Male friends she goes on private dinner/movie dates with?  Male friends you have never met?  Male friends she has only known for 3 months?
"When his mom says not Jewish, she mean the race. "
"Physical, emotional, and financial abuse.

OP, this is serious.

For your and your children's sake, get out."
"If it was someone that you had to go track down, I would say definitely don't. But given that you are Facebook friends, I think you should apologize. I'm a woman, and I would want an apology in those circumstances. But what would make it invasive or self-serving is if you started trying to process a bunch of feelings about it. Or even making posts that she can see bemoaning that you feel so terrible about having done stuff like this.

It should be short &amp; to the point, no more than 3 sentences max. Leave everything about your own feelings out. They are not the point &amp; you can work out your feelings on your own. You can leave the door open for her to ask if she wants, but she almost definitely won't. 

Something like, ""I acknowledge that I did wrong by you years ago, and I apologize. I don't need or expect any reply and I won't bring it up again, but if there's anything you need to say to me I will listen.

I think the original commenter was pointing out that you're being really dismissive of your wife's desire to make YouTube makeup tutorials or whatever. 
"There's so many problems with this statement.

First, not being one of someone's closest friends or not part of their intimate moments is not a ""punishment"". Younger sister wants to spend special quality time with the people she is closest too before her wedding after a rough period of her own. This is about who she feels comfortable with, meshes well together as a group, and will give her the sort of intimate bonding time she is hoping for. There are tons of people in the world younger sister doesn't feel this close to and it's not a reproach on them. But fundamentally this is something she wants to do for her own happiness that older sister is making all about her (I can't imagine why you wouldn't want her along). 

You are talking like because older sister had troubles of her own she *couldn't* have made any effort to be close to her sisters. This is condescending and unfair. Trans people are not emotionally handicapped and unable to bond. (I have one trans family member and they are very close to their sibling.) Older sis has several close friends and a partner. Older sister is clearly capable of getting close to others. But she hasn't even tried to make that effort with her younger siblings. I'm not saying that being trans might well be a factor but it's not the same as her legs not working and can't. Likewise, are you implying that anyone who has problems is owed closed friendship and inclusion in all of other people's private moments whether or not they reciprocate friendship? 

Older sis is still not being a good older sister. Younger sister has apparently done a bunch to support her in her transition and gotten nothing back. And older sis is now throwing a fit and getting her parents to gang up on her to ruin her bachlorette party. Some can be trans and selfish, trans people are just people and not all of them are great. A good sibling who cared wouldn't make their pre-wedding sister's camping trip all about them. They wouldn't consider their sister's need for time with friends she can never see who live out of the country to deal with her own issues unimportant since only older sister's problems matter and need taking care of. It sounds like older sis has done nothing to support her back, so it would probably be hard for younger sis to really deal with her stuff with her around. Older sis hasn't even said she wants to come to get closer and bond. Nope, she just cares about appearances. She wants to crash an intimate once in a lifetime trip of her sisters she is going to make awkward (even more so now!) to make herself look good. She apparently can't even understand the point of view of her younger sister in wanting this time with her distant friends after her own struggles - which pretty much shows she shouldn't be there. "
Yeah I was going to say this. My brother had this happen increasingly as he got older and it turned out he had epilepsy and his zone outs were actually seizures!
"And the fact that he wraps it up in 

&gt; **we** wouldn't be as uncomfortable with my lack of experience

like it's partially his girlfriend's fault that he HAD to do it?"
"I understand where you're coming from, but I honestly think you are cutting her husband a friends too much slack.

OPs husband didn't just get manipulated into believing something false but also got manipulated into how reacting to it and to treat OP. Making comments and having an intervention is not the correct way to handle it. If her husband had done some actual researched, gone to a an-na meeting for asvice, or talked to proffessionals that deal with addictions he would have realised that 1) there are no significant signs of addiction, 2) there are more helpful ways to adress addiction, and 3) there is false perseption being spread by a person. At some point before participating in the intervention it was the husbands responsibility to research how to adress the issue he thought existed himself. He had a responsibility to treat OP respectfully enough that he took charge of adressing her suposed addiction and making sure he had enough to be conserned about before making an issue of it. So there's a lot of broken trust, disrespect, and lack of critical thinking in serious situations that needs to be adress regardless of whom you ultimatly blame.

Her husbands and friends also don't get a clean slate because of manipulation. People don't get to hand over responsibility for their action on someone else. The manipulation gives an explanation and empathy for their actions, but doesn't absolve them. Especially as they had fair warning. Especially as they should have been suspicious that the concern for OP came primarly from a person that was angry at OP that had a history of lying about others. Especially as if they had more common sense someone would have noticed the manipulation before they almost ruined several friendships and a marriage.

These people were manipulated, but they still have to take responsibility for their actions. And OP still has the right to be angry at and not forgive their actions. If you treat someone badly because you've been told they are a bad person, if you find out it's not true you apologies to that person and understand if they want nothing to do with you, but you don't go ""I was lied to so therefor it's not my fault"". To truly take responsinsibility for our actions we have to do so even when we ourself have been treated unfairly."
"On this sub? That's life, friend. You think someone just ""deserves""a new car because they want it? You have a lot to learn."
"Get a lawyer, get a divorce. "
"This is a pretty major thing though, and it's one that would end a lot of couples.  Choosing where to live affects every aspect of your life.  Neither of you should be asked to spend your life in a place that you are miserable in.  Counseling can help bring out whether a compromise is even possible.  This is something that you both absolutely need to be on the same page for in order for the marriage to work."
"This, of all the replies my unexpectedly popular comment has received, is the one that made me crack up laughing. 

I guess the world would be a little less interesting if we all only liked cats and dogs and other cute fluffers, though."
"""They are thinking of themselves and how this would play out in their lives.""-This! And I find it strange that they have more empathy for another doctor than for their own child, especially after OP worte they didn´t care that much for his siblings´health.

Another point it is it may mean bankruptcy for the doctor - but OP seems to lose a lot of money due to the misdiagnose, may also lose evrything financially and suffer the physical consequences with a loss of life quality. So it may suck for doc, but it definitely sucks for OP.

I´m sorry for you having no support from your parents in this crisis. There are a lot of parents out there unfortunately that treat their children worse and harsher than any stranger. One has to learn to live with that and find the emotional support elsewhere. 

I wish you the best, OP.

"It’s not a criticism of grandma. 

It’s kid is not allowed near pool except with Mum and dad. Zero exceptions. Even grandma. Because once 1 exception is made then more can be. Then it’s with uncle and aunt. Then it’s Mum and dads friends. Then kid forgets when he needs to avoid and it gets dangerous. "
"I think they're being a bit ridiculous assuming you are actually only holding hands and not making out in front of everyone and holding up the game.  Shit, my fiance and I hold each other's hands all the time and nobody complains.  They sound like they're jealous or have low emotional IQ's or something.  Like maybe they don't know what it's like to have a SO and want to be close to them.  

This thread seems divided, so I might get down votes for saying this, but I sat find better friends who can handle seeing to grown adults hold hands and other touch each other."
I second all of this. Do everything you can to get him to come clean to his wife shy of actually betraying the rules of AA. 
Oh I do think I saw that in the documentary Key and Peele
"She wants you to take her side, rather than your wife’s. You have done nothing wrong. It would be wise to let her sulk in peace and wait for her to get back in touch. "
"Who thinks so little of their GF that they think she'd play a game of ""see how long I can wait in this gross fair bathroom just to keep him waiting?"" That's so self-centered of him! And also, it has to be said, just plain freaking weird. No one spends longer in public bathrooms than they need to."
And what did they have to say to that little revelation? 
"&gt;I've talked to my friends, all of whom never really liked Kyle and to a person they all say that this is typical break up talk and that I'm putting him in a weird spot by calling him so much and he probably still cares and doesn't want to hurt me but he's making it clear he doesn't want to be with me.

Your friends are right. I'm sorry this came as such a shock to you, but you need to stop calling him."
Is Instagram her profession?
"You can argue about semantics, but you made your girlfriend very uncomfortable and rightly so. Dinner and a movie is a weirdly intimate thing to do with a coworker of the opposite sex when you aren’t single. It just is. Either you aren’t being honest with yourself about your feelings for Paige, or you just don’t care how your behavior affects your girlfriend...or both. She allowed to not be ok with what you did. You’re allowed to break up with her, but you’re not allowed to insist she be ok with behavior she’s not ok with."
"Thank you for sharing your story. It’s a very powerful example about the way abusive relationships manifest in real life - it’s almost never like the movies. 

You gave excellent advice as well. I️ just wanted you to know that I️ am inspired by you, and that I’m grateful you have come to terms with your experience and are using it as a way to empower others. "
"And leave my kids without their father? Nope, my parents would be goners. Which is the only way they would have it, by the way. They want what’s best for their grandchildren. Which incidentally is the reason why they’d chew my husband and me put if we tried to give them 2000 every two weeks."
"You need to choose. Either break it off with your girl and continue down the road with this new girl, or instantly break it off with this new girl and continue with your gf."
"&gt; We split it roughly 60-40 between us and the in-laws in terms of down payment, and resulting mortgage has been us alone. 

So your in-laws contributed 40% of the deposit and nothing else? You and your husband paid the other 60% *and* the mortgage payments since? Realistically, how much of a stake does that give your in-laws? 

They are essentially asking you to not only match their intended gift, but beat it by a significant margin. It's like them saying, ""we want to give them our 20% share of the house, you don't mind giving up your 80%, right?""

Personally, I would offer a year's free rent and maybe 5 years discounted rent as a wedding present, and even that is incredibly generous. 

If your in-laws want to give SIL a house, that's their business. But it's not fair they try to oblige you into giving up your investment, especially when their share is far less than half. 

I think you should talk to a financial advisor, just so you can show to your husband in solid numbers how much your in-laws share is worth versus your own share. If he saw that his parents share was (ie) $15k and your share is $85k, and the loss of that money could mean the loss of your family's security or your kids higher education, he might feel differently. 

Giving your SIL a wedding gift shouldn't mean giving up a decades worth of investment. "
"&gt;I have seen some success with the “while we eat, all phones get put away in a pile and you aren’t allowed to touch them” strategy or in a similar vein “phone free family time” hour(s).  Might not work on someone who is battling an addiction, but in that case it might be time to bring in a professional.

Our rule is ""dinner time is for eating and talking to the people you're eating with. Period."""
She is objectively wrong. You can show her study upon study upon study showing that corporal punishment has *no positive effect* on children and is the basis for a lot of behavioral problems rather than corrective action. 
"He is emotionally abusive. If it isn't the gifts, he will try and find something else to hold over your head in order to manipulate you.

When my ex and I broke up, he tried to use our dog as emotional blackmail. After a few months of dealing with his bullshit, I realized that I would never have him out of my life as long as the dog was in my life. So I gave up my claim to her and let him keep her. It was really tough emotionally, I loved that dog. But for my own sake, I just needed him out of my life.

It was satisfying to see how shocked he was when I made that decision. Severing that final tie to him, he wasn't expecting that at all. He hadn't realized how far he had gone in trying to manipulate me, and you could tell he regretted what he had done."
"I looked bald for about the first year of my life, because my hair was so fine and so platinum blond. Now it's thick, medium brown, and grows super fast. I think it's still getting darker, too. "
"So you let him ramble on about how awesome it would be if you cheated on your wife, describe the sex you could have with this co-worker your wife knows you go to drinks with, and you sat there silently? Come on, man. Put yourself in your wife's shoes, would you want one of her family members to tell her to cheat on you with a co-worker she finds attractive? One that she has one on one social interaction with? "
"Vasectomies are cheaper, have less recovery time, and are in most cases reversible, so it is much easier to find a doctor willing to perform them on a 24 year old. My vote is for him. "
"I don't think it's right to say it's either normal or abnormal. As a trans woman, she's finally able to be herself in ways she couldn't before so maybe she feels more free to reveal parts of her personality that she couldn't as a man. "
Kids or no kids is a legitimate deal breaker when talking about marriage. Be happy he changed his mind before the wedding. It sucks because of the time you have invested in this relationship. If you don't want to have kids you should end the engagement and the relationship.
Do you have evidence of your relationship to present to the wife? The fact that her Instagram is suddenly private is interesting.
"It was 4am and your girlfriend was probably just looking for anything to help her sleep. She likely didn't say anything to you because to her, it wasn't a big deal. Everybody masturbates! If it really bothers you that much, talk to her. This is not something to lose sleep over"
You have to tell him. It's the only right thing to do. 
"In addition to what others have said, SIL's bf is in a position where he isn't liable enough to the well-being of your children. He can create a mess and then just walk away if it isn't something he can be prosecuted over.

He's also a stranger who, along with your SIL, conspired to not inform you about his presence around your children and hasn't even met you, their parents.

Maybe he really is a great guy and a good guardian for your children....but you have no way of knowing that, the first impression is already bad, and you have no way of guaranteeing he won't cause problems."
"You guys could consider non-traditional venues. My husband and I booked our venue 8 months out. We got married at an Art Gallery.

However, if you have your heart set on a traditional church wedding followed by a banquet hall reception then yes, it'll be all booked and you'll likely need to push it back to 2019. He's not being realistic about the timeline.

Perhaps you can schedule a consultation with a local wedding planner or do a walk through at an banquet hall to test the waters, and give him a dose of reality about planning a wedding."
"Sorry to hear that. 

It is most definitely rape. Honestly, it doesn't matter what his intentions were at the time, all that matters is how he acted. And look, you're in so much pain because of it. 

I'm surprised that you only resent him. Do you think you would be really angry at him if you spent some time away from him?

Like think about it, why would you describe what the sex was like to a bunch of strangers on the internet? That part doesn't have much relevance to the story about your health issues. 

But you felt the need to say it. Why is that?"
Throwing things during arguments is abusive and so not normal. It scares the shit out of me when a man throws anything around me out of anger 
"Definitely don't take advice from a guy whose site uses terms like ""friendzone"" and ""beta"" and talks about how to try to force people who broke up with you to get back with you. This dude sounds like some serious bad news."
"I don't have anything to worry about as far as the paternity is concerned, I have something to worry about as far as our relationship is concerned. "
"One of the most common fantasies for women is rape.

I don't think it's a male thing."
"&gt;  I honestly am starting to think there is just something wrong with me.

I doubt that, what do your friends and family say about this situation.

Therapy only helps people that want to change, your boyfriend sees nothing wrong with this scenario."
"My ex was very similar in this way, but more with constant touch than constant talking (though that was also an issue) I need quiet time and physical space to recharge, and he needs physical affection and talking to do so. My mom also needs quiet some time to recharge. We took her solution and it actually works really well. 

The solution is this: when she needed quiet and time to herself, she would just tell us that she was going to take a bath. It was understood that bath time = whoever is taking said bath wants to do so uninterrupted. That could last for ten minutes or three hours depending on the day. Mine was “I’m going to read now”. It works. 

The expectation becomes that this chunk of time that you get to claim is your reprieve and safe space from outside stimuli. Find something calm and quiet that you enjoy and which relaxes you. 

Have a clear discussion with him in which you tell him that this is an issue for you, and then him that when you are overwhelmed you are good to say “I’m going to do (insert activity here)”. When you talk to him about it all, explain that it isn’t that you want to get away from him, or you’re mad at him, or that you want a break from him, just that this is time and space you need to take to relax and recharge. He needs to not take it personally and understand that when you are done, you’ll be able to have conversations with him and be a better and more present partner. "
I have a feeling that will also end up being OP's job.
"I have no idea, I think her entire family is planning on being there. At least, that is how she has portrayed it to me. No idea if they are going to actually be in the room with her... it might be a waiting room party."
"It's very important to remember this. Abuse comes in many, many forms...not always physical. This is certainly emotional, because they neglected her."
This. You can never be too safe.
"Wow, THEY want it to be cancelled because THEY have decided it will cause too much drama.. because THEY are going to cause drama about it when it happens? They all need to chill out and grow up.  Please don't cancel this trip. Go and have a great time with your sister and her friends. "
But this could help create a paper trail of his misbehavior if he ever does cross the line with a current student. I think u/throwaway125445 should definitely report it. 
"&gt; And women and the media complain about ""stealthing"".

Yea, how dare women complain about an unpleasant surprise during sex. They should just suck it up because men *obviously* have it worse. /s"
"that seems like an *especially* bad idea, but I've met tons of people with this exact situation."
"PS. Your girlfriend is telling you this is a big deal to her. That it's a boundary you're crossing.

You need to sit down with her and have a discussion about boundaries in your relationship. What feels inappropriate, what constitutes cheating, etc."
"I agree with you 100%, and the line “if you really loved this woman you’d find a way to make it work” is utter crap.

Yes using a surrogate and adoption are options, but she didn’t come to you with those options— instead she lied to you about trying for months, then tried to guilt you into accepting her unilateral decision unquestioningly, then waged an information campaign to get your friends &amp; family on her side. 

After that behavior, I’d caution you against staying with her even if she woke up tomorrow 100% ready for kids. She doesn’t sound like a trustworthy partner. 

Being scared of the consequences of a hard conversation doesn’t give her a pass to lie, and it doesn’t sound like she’s even apologized! 

Your family and friends are either being selfish (they don’t want to things to change) or have been given a totally skewed version of events. Its worth you giving them your side of the story *one time only*, but if they keep pushing or blaming you after that explanation then just refuse to discuss the situation. Say something like “the decision has been made, and your input is not needed or appreciated” then end the conversation by hanging up or leaving if they won’t let it drop. 

I’m really sorry you’re going through this, it’s a nightmare of a situation. 
"
"&gt; Ultimately your sister has made no effort to get to know your wife or even treat her with respect and common decency. 

Because it sounds to me like OP's wife came on to his sister *far* too strongly and got angry when she pretty rightly got creeped out by it and that OP's wife only wanted to do things that were really not his sister's cup of tea. She's also 5 years older, which at ages 18/23 is a big maturity gulf. "
Any SO that is vehemently against you using medication prescribed by a medical professional in your best interests is abusive. 
"&gt; I have a rule that I don't mix financial matters and family

This is the right answer. OP: don't let him try to guilt you into this. A 28-year-old guy with no credit history who spontaneously decides to buy a house by begging for a loan from a family member isn't the kind of guy you want to lend money to.

He'll still be pissed at you but if you're lucky that'll only last as long as his current relationship. "
"OP should totally tell her husband this  "" ""I don't want to watch you slowly kill yourself. This is something I think am willing to divorce you over... you need to decide what's more important, your freedom to sunbathe OR your marriage and our family.""

When my husband was diagnosed at the age of 44 with diabetes he went into denial and depression.  He whined that he wasn't going to be able to eat what he wanted, drink what he wanted, have to take medicine, needed to exercise, lose weight and so on.  All of my efforts to help him change his lifestyle, cook diabetic food, and help him take care of himself were angrily rebuffed.

My statement was: "" Look asshole, I'm not your Mommy and I can't MAKE you take care of yourself, but if you think I'm going to sit by while you pout and whine like a little baby about having to make some minor changes in your life and you end up with your legs amputated or go blind.............don't expect that I'm going to be here to wheel your sorry ass around or take care of you.  If YOU don't care....I don't care either.""

I wasn't going to sit around and watch him kill himself and ruin my life and happiness in the process, no matter HOW much I love that man.

Since then (25 years ago), he has made the minor changes and has improved so much that he doesn't need to take medication any more.  "
"Yeah to second this, any time a guy has told me ""I can make you stop feeling sad"" it has a sexual connotation. I'm almost positive she cheated on you physically, OP. "
"Just wanted to let you know you’re not alone! My husband is Marine Corps and has been in 17 years. On his last (of 10+) deployments he received a TBI and a nasty case of PTSD. He has since received a Purple Heart and was 100% medically retired. I would say on average he has a friend committing suicide every other month. That is not an over dramatization. And I swear every month is some type of “anniversary” and my husband goes thru a rough patch of depression. He’s in the middle of one right now because of an event that happened in October of 2013. I’m open to sharing the story but it’s along one. Anyway, my point being, you’re not alone. We as military spouses may not have gone thru the actual experiences that our spouses have but in a way we still end up going thru them. They end up defining us and affecting us more than civilians know. It’s such a fine line wanting to stand by your husband through these times while also trying to maintain your own mental stability while also working a 40+ hour per week job, managing the household, raising kids and trying to act like everything is okay for the sake of the kids. I’m so sorry that you are going through all of this but you are not alone. If you ever want to PM me to vent or to even cry or for advice (I’m an LCSW in clinical psychology) please feel free to do so. Us military wife bitches have to stick together!  "
"&gt;Am I wrong for assuming that the healthiest marriages are a financial team with no ""mine vs yours""?

You're wrong for oversimplifying things, and for expecting a simple, one-size-fits-all approach to varied and complicated questions. 

I've found the healthiest marriages are those that talk about these things, talk through them, and try to figure out, together, what reasonable expectations look like. 

I don't think you expect him to pay your student loan payments. That would be a little unreasonable. 

I think if your name was on the title to the house and/or the mortgage, that he should expect you to help with the mortgage payment. 

I think your dog is yours, at least for now, and its bills are your bills. But, down the line, he may feel more strongly about the dog than he does now and might want to contribute to its care. 

But mostly, I think those things are true for **my** marriage. In someone else's marriage, maybe every expense is shared. In other marriage, almost no expenses are shared. You get there by *talking* about it. 

There are a lot of different ways to manage money in a marriage, and there's no single ""right"" or ""best"" way. 

And if your partner has worries about being exploited, he can spend a few hundred dollars and meet with a lawyer for a consultation on how marriage, and pre-nuptial agreements, do &amp; don't work. If he has assets he wants to protect and shelter, then he should be willing to pay for a professional opinion on how to do that. That's OK too. If he decides he wants a pre-nuptial agreement, then you should meet with a lawyer as well. Hell, if it's important, he should give you money so you can pick out a lawyer to go over the agreement before you sign. "
I laughed harder than I should have... lmao.
I would recommend the daughter call the doctor's office and explain the change in behaviour. The doctor's office could maybe intervene and ask the mother to come in for a checkup.
So she *still* doesn't have the balls to tell the truth. What a pathetic personality.
Don't bring it up gently. This is a serious conversation that deserves a direct question with the complete mental understanding that this could end in a breakup by your own decision.

"So, you’re okay with a new wife, is what you’re saying? "
"It's been close to 5 months now. It was originally supposed to be one month. He got a new job offer but it didn't start until a couple months after he got it, so he decided to quit his old job a month early and just take some time off.

Then he decided he didn't like working and quit his new job before he even started. He swore he just needed some more time and a while to think about what he really wanted to do. I've seen no moves to start working again."
Depending on the contract it might be illegal. I don't know how it is in your country but in mine (not US) the landlord has to be informed about the situation and can force him to leave.
Right???  Plan B is no picnic!  Is he fucking clueless?
"He didn't randomly show up; he told you beforehand he wanted to join. 

&gt; I'd argue that the whole codependent ""I need my BF to come with us everywhere we go"" mentality is a bit immature. No fully functional adults I know act like that.

You know your friends best, but I see nothing in your post that indicates that's what they are like. I only see a guy who wants to see a concert with his SO *and* his good friend. Doesn't get more normal or reasonable than this.

&gt; I give them the exact same courtesy, unless they are bringing their SOs, mine isn't invited either.

You might want to ease up on that policy a bit, because I can tell you there will be many women who will view this as ""my friends always come first and you are an afterthought""."
"It's unlikely to be deadly to humans, but I wouldn't test it against a baby.  I'd definitely not test it against smaller pets.  This is definitely something OP/her boyfriend need to make the apartment building aware of, they were stupid and brought in a venomous creature to a building of hundreds of people, and they're going to suffer the consequences, especially if someone gets bit."
"That first part is killing me.  I'm reading it and thinking back on my first apartment in the DC area that was well-maintained with surprisingly large rooms, but it was an older building and in a slightly crappy neighborhood.  (As the management company realized because all the doors had huge, updated, metal doors with good deadbolts.)  No pets allowed, one outdoor parking spot (where I got broken into twice), and a 2-mile walk to the closest Metro station.

My colleagues were jealous when they saw my rent and the size of my place that I had all to myself at a pretty affordable rent, because they lived much closer in with roommates and street parking for similar rents.  But we both conceded we had made choices - I lived a little further out so I could have my privacy and not worry about street parking, but they lived closer in where they were much closer to work and a definitively more vibrant social scene.

At that age, you just can't have it all, and you have to pick what's important to you.  They need to suck it up, look for a small house with a yard that allows two big dogs.  OP's wife should not have to worry about her well-maintained house because his family is unrealistic about his sister's ability to rent a place.  (I, too, find it weird other places are not accepting applications without pay-stubs if the parents are willing to fork out.  They must have no, or really crappy, references at all.)"
"&gt; I am going crazy

Yeah, you are.

He sent her a song screenshot. THREE YEARS AGO. You're going batty TODAY, blowing up your relationship over a nothing THREE YEARS AGO! Now you're creeping on his ex who he hasn't seen in ages and creating an issue out of thin air.

Get over it gal or you're gonna lose the relationship you have now over a relationship you imagined up."
Wait I'm confused as to what happened here. Your boyfriend fingered some girl until she came because he felt sorry for her? Can you please explain the context of this??

You did the right thing, OP. It didn't feel right so you stopped it and you left his house immediately. What he did was wrong, to touch you that way was inappropriate. He went into defensive mode when he got angry and said he loves his girlfriend and only sees you as a sister.

"He's not being practical, especially since all of his ""advice"" is wrong. Your bf is full of it."
"So I’m surprised at all the reactions here.

OP, I think there are a few red flags here that are suggesting to me that your perspective might be part of the problem. 

I was raised in a very, very conservative environment. Sex before marriage was basically as appalling as murder. It sounds to me like you have a (obviously much milder) version of that same idea. Which is fine! I actually tend to agree that sex and its implications aren’t respected that much today. However, I think it’s important to remember that *especially among people your/my age* (I’m slightly older - in my 20s - but this is still true) this is not the majority view. You’re college age/in college. People sleep together; people sleep around. A lot of people think that is part of the college experience. I went to a very conservative school and it’s still true that the majority of the people I knew had had multiple sexual encounters with multiple different people, many of them one-nighters, etc. 

The reason I mention this is because you are emphasizing your date’s past as though it is some sort of shame/damaging knowledge, etc. Dude, my husband dates one of my closest friends in college. I know they slept together many times. He’s into me now and that’s what matters. 

Same is true for your dude: being jealous or upset if people’s pasts will help no one, and could really hurt you. I know from personal experience that it’s hard, especially when you have little experience with dating. But chances are high that your new date has slept with more than just that one girl, especially if it was a one time thing at a party (which is what it sounds like). 

The girl you talked to was definitely being awkward. It’s hard to tell if she was really being a b*** or if she just views sex as wayyyyy more casual than you do. I have friends of both sorts. In college, there are plenty of girls *and* guys who literally just see sex as a pleasurable past time. However, I will trust your judgment when you say it came from a place of cruelty, in which case I suggest seeing less of her. 

Regardless of that, however, I suggest looking st yourself and your own feelings really closely to find out why this I upset you so much. Are you jealous? If so, why? It’s not reasonable to be this upset by jealousy in regards to something in the past of a dude you have seen twice. Are you yourself insecure? Then that’s on you to fix. Are you worried that the guy you’re seeing wants to sleep with you? Dude, of course he does! That’s why you guys are dating and not just friends. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t interested in more too, and you need to just wait and see and get to know him better. You have liked him so far so give him the benefit of the doubt. Yes, it is risky - it sucks to find out someone is just using you, etc. But dating is risky, and you can’t cut yourself off from every person with a sexual past. "
I have some bad news... I think your husband is cheating on his mother with you. 
This is not on her **at all**. It's disgusting that you would put even the smallest amount of blame on her. Shame on you
"&gt;I don't feel any special kind of sorry when I hear that a child had died, I mean, I feel the same when a child and an adult die a terrible death - I do feel sorry - but only because they suffered, and not because it is a child.. if you know what I mean? And when someone says something like ""Oh god, there were kids on the plane that crashed, that's terrible!"", well, there were adults too.. I don't get it. 

The younger someone is when they die, it's sadder because of the loss of potential.  Someone 100 years old dies?  Sad, but expected and they had a long time to live their life.  Someone 50 dies?  Sad, but at least they had a chance to do a lot.  Someone 15 dies?  They got to have some experiences, but missed out on lots of potentially cool shit ahead.  The added sadness is because they (dead kid) didn't get a chance to live a full life.

&gt;Of course, I can understand that parents love their children more than anything else in the world,

Honestly?  Not all the time.  Sometimes they can be real little shits and it is soooo tempting to leave them and run away.  And while some parents instantly love their newborns, not everyone does - it's a new little person and it takes time to get to know and love them.  

&gt;I don't understand love for ""all children"" just because they are children

Don't worry about it -most people don't.  There is no way in hell I could ever be a teacher.  Many children annoy me.  "
"This is fake, right? You can't be that obtuse to not know why the mother of your child doesn't like the woman you cheated on her with while pregnant? 

Also, you should be consulting a lawyer to get a custody schedule, child support, etc. all figured out. "

"My husband and I had a similar issue of disproportionate spending.  He made less, so he would use his whole paycheck on himself, and I made more so I would cover all of our expenses and then have very little left over for my own spending.  The inequity made me a little cranky.  

Eventually, I approached him with a very open conversation about financial goals.  (Wouldn't it be nice to travel the world?  When you would like to retire?  I'd like to put this much away for the kids.) We came up with our long term financial goals together. From there I went to where I thought I could save extra money for those goals, and THEN we got to where he could save money.  I took this approach rather than the ""you spend too much"" approach because I wanted us to be a financial team.  

We decided that we would open a joint bank account that covered all of our bills.  And a joint savings account for our dreams.  We both have access to this, but both could veto spending from it.  

We then use our personal accounts for our allowance, which we transfer after it goes into our main account.  We both get $400/month and we can do whatever we want with that money.  

I tied our joint account in with mint.com so we could set better budgets.  

It worked out really well.  It took my husband a few months to get used to having so much less money-- he wasn't super excited about that.  For him to be able to watch the savings grow and have us talk about what we would do with it took the sting out of not having all his extra cash.  

Stay positive.  Stay a team.  &lt;3"
"If you stay with him, you are teaching your daughter what marriage should look like: that it requires staying with a cheating scumbag who you don't even respect.   
You (and especially your daughter) will be better off if you get a divorce and show your daughter that you respect yourself enough to leave a man who cheats on you.   
P.S. -- if he loved you, he would stop cheating and be with you."
"Here's what probably happened: He's already hit up everyone else that he knows that he's closer to, multiple times.  They're sick of it.

So now he's scraping the bottom of the barrel, and hitting people up that he hasn't really talked to in years, like you.

"We can't post links on the sub but there are portable, removable door locks you can get right on Amazon. Just search for ""portable door lock.""

That said, you should address your boss about what she did. Tell her that had you been playing music while you showered, you may not have heard her in the house and could have walked out of the bathroom naked. Just let her know that you felt it was inappropriate for her to invite herself into your living space without any notice, that it makes you uncomfortable and you don't want her to do it again."
End it with your husband. He deserves better than you. 
"&gt; That being said, a lot of science would suggest the corporal punishment might even be the cause of your tantrum tendency, and is not likely to solve it long term.

I can't echo this enough. Often times people who go ""I got spanked and I turned out fine!"" are ignoring all the bits where they didn't turn out fine, and sometimes the spanking caused bad behaviors that resulted in more spanking."
"&gt; We argued for a bit and then he just majorly wore me down. He'd complain EVERY day about not being able to log onto his games, about how he misses his gaming friends, and how he's so bored. So I eventually caved and let him install the game on my computer. Since then, he's essentially taken it over and I have to beg and yell and basically push him off to get to my own computer. It's really annoying because this computer was strictly for my work, which means it has specially installed software to interact with our clients that I need to access every day. It also means I haven't been able to work from home despite work being especially busy. It's been a fight EVERY DAY to kick him off my computer. He'll say 30 more min and then hang onto it for 3 more hours.

His desktop did not randomly die

It was killed by gaming

Completely depends on the laptop and the games he’s using

This is indeed weird. You handled the situation perfectly. Also consider ending the friendship with a 26 year old dude who tries to prey on teens while being in a relationship.
"You're in luck because there is a ridiculously easy solution to this:

**Him:** [Compliments/comments on/gropes/etc your breasts]

**You:** Hey [bf], sometimes I feel like there's a disproportionate amount of attention being paid to my breasts. It makes me feel uncomfortable/objectified/etc, especially when you talk about them with your friends (or some other specific thing that's bothering you).  I know that you like them, but I need you to tone it down.



Set firm and clear boundaries. He can either listen to your wishes and make an honest attempt at following them (he might slip up at times, that's understandable - point it out when it happens), or he can't and you find someone more respectful.

And I agree with everyone else - be up front with your breast reduction plans. *Don't* use them as some sort of test, though, *just fucking talk to him.*"

If he gets offended by your grumpiness, fuck 'im. Let him get down about it. 

Later on when you're more chipper, just engage him like it never even happened. Don't let him fight with you about it later. Bonus points if you walk away and tell him that you'll be willing to talk when his mood is improved (haha)"

"&gt; He tried breaking up with me for 'unrelated reasons' (he says) just the day before he asked me about the flirting stuff. 

Someone who is willing to literally throw away a 9 year relationship over a petty crush on some mildly attractive coworker is not someone I would ever see myself spending my life with. 

You guys got together young at 20 years old. I know things probably feel like you can't imagine your lives without each other. But here's the thing: he is imagining it. He imagined it so hard he even tried to terminate the relationship. He is pushing on boundaries and doing things he knows are inappropriate to do in a relationship using technicalities to his benefit. These aren't things you *do* to people you care about.

I see on here all the time in comments and in other areas people in 10, 15, 20+ year relationships talking about how their SO still means the world to them and how they would shut stuff like this down or never even do things like that. And you know why? Because they love each other, and relationships like that exist. **Your boyfriend didn't just consider dumping you but literally tried to do so in an attempt to get to this girl.** That's not the commitment level one would expect from someone you've been with for 9 years.

And I know you're probably thinking, ""but we've been together so long!"" Think of where you want to be in 9 years, OP. You will be 38. Do you envision yourself as married? With kids? Joint finances with a partner? Living with a partner? Regardless of the answer to those questions, do you really see this relationship moving towards these things? He tried dumping you, he's actively flirting with an attractive coworker who he spends 1-on-1 time with outside of the relationship, he buys her tickets, asks her out, and clearly doesn't give a shit about your feelings since he continues to flirt/engage heavily with her even after all of this. 

They're coworkers, not obligated to be friends. Could you imagine yourself doing the things he did to you to him? It sounds like this might be the beginning of the end, IMO. Marriage and further commitment to people are supposed to be built on strong, unwavering foundations that you guys just belong together and would stay with each other through thick and thin. And married/serious couples do go through issues, but they go through them *together* and generally are issues related to the person themselves like ""I don't want to go to Thanksgiving with in-laws"" or ""Bob has a minor gambling addiction that we are working on"". Regardless of how people choose to react to those issues, the foundation is still strong with their love together. But **trying to leave you for another woman that he barely knows** not only is a massive issue but shatters the foundation and trust on which the relationship was bred.

So I don't know. For me, cheating (which is what he did if he's actively pursuing this woman at least on an emotional level and possibly a physical one due to their excess out-of-work contact) is one of the very few things I think that a relationship really shouldn't try to work through, with very few exceptions. Yours is not one of the exceptions to me. He betrayed you bad. And just think of it, if some perky new 2-month coworker can really cause him to throw away his relationship of 9 years, is the foundation (on his part) really strong enough to be worth it to try to save?

Sorry if some of this hurts but these are just my thoughts. My advice to you would honestly be to start looking on how to separate your lives and start focusing more on yourself. I would have one very honest conversation with him about your feelings about everything, once, and then...just drop it. If he mentions the coworker or wants to see her, fine, he knows your feelings and is just showing that he is putting them aside because he is selfish and actively chasing another woman. Let him chase, but don't allow yourself to be the 'backup.' Because at this point it looks like if she was actively interested and reciprocated, he absolutely would leave you for her. And that's something nobody should just sit around and bare and try to work your way out of. If he can't respect you or this relationship without tears, arguments, unhappiness, and you restricting his behavior (although totally warranted) then he shouldn't be trusted to build a future with. 

Your partner is supposed to have your back and be the one you can rely on WITHOUT having to force them to be there for you. "
"good for you. the key: once you leave, ZERO CONTACT. it's like addiction. cold turkey. complete abstinence."
"If you're about to cheat on her, then you probably *should* end it rather than date other women, though.

It isn't absurd to say that you're not getting your needs met and you're verging on infidelity with increasing temptation and that that is a deal breaker.

Don't minimize it as if it's some kind of shallow issue."
"He took a pay cut and doesn't even to the job?? I'd be furious!

Is he having some sort of mid life crisis? Is his dream job actually just not having to work at all? He has kids to provide for, he can't just be going and pulling shit like this.

Has he had any counselling?"
"There's drugs involved here is my guess. Maya rocked up with her crazy and they went on a bender leaving poor Mitsu in filth and fear. 

Because the only thing worse than treating a poor dog like that is the fact she clearly covered her part in it up. Like she didn't text the OP at all on his trip? And he didn't ask about his beloved dog? The mom didn't suggest popping by to walk Mitsu to help out?

She is staggeringly unempathetic. I really don't particuarly like animals after some crappy childhood experiences and I cannot relate to people who treat them like furbabies. Yet I'm so horrified and upset that someone would treat a dog (they live with no less) like this that I'm almost in tears.

He should not only dump this girl, he should make sure her family know exactly what she did and consider reporting her to the police or ASPCA for animal cruelty. There's not following a checklist as a non dog owner on the fridge thinking Pup here doesn't really need a 5 mile hike and a 3 mile walk will do not realising how crazy spaniels go without exercise and then there's basic human decency that no living creature should be shut in a shed in its own shit for several weeks. 

Like if a 27 year old doesn't know that already she's beyond help. But honestly this sounds like the kind of 'so fucked up my mind is blown' stunt people do on meth to me. Maya's only relevant as the drug buddy me thinks."
"&gt; he looked at her like a sister

so he wants his sister to get cheated on?"
"Be honest with her. My fiancé used to do this when we first got together, but now we talk when we have a moment, then meet up on our days off. It's nice to have some time to yourself. "
"From the wikipedia article on ""Age and female fertility"":


""In humans, a woman's fertility peaks in the early and mid-20s, after which it starts to decline slowly. While many sources suggest a more dramatic drop at around 35,[1] this is unclear since studies are still cited from the nineteenth century and earlier.[2][3] One 2004 study of European women found fertility of the 27-34 and the 35–39 groups had only a four-percent difference.[4] At age 45, a woman starting to try to conceive will have no live birth in 50–80 percent of cases.[5] ""


So ... worst case scenario, you're good until age 35, unless you have specific medical history that means you have fertility issues.


What are his reasons why you can't/shouldn't have kids right now? Have you asked him to translate ""eventually"" into a timeline?"
Not sure how you came up with all of this... I didn't even think of a single one but they are all so plausible. I've called my best friend and shes coming over after work to help me find out who his wife is so we can message her. 
.... Maybe you're stalking some dude and should leave him alone.
"Accept the soft no for what it is. She's not going to forget you asked her out; she knows you're interested! And if at some point she decides she's interested, she'll let you know. But really, come on.

&gt;""Lol are you drunk?""

Does that actually sound like anything besides a no?"
"And even if it weren't for the baby, she's allergic to cats and they have *3* of them. That sounds miserable tbh. "
"Perfect, except I would not actually trust this gran as a parent proxy!"
Why aren't there other routes? There must be streets that lead to where your boyfriend lives. Would they take longer? Be less convenient for you? 
"Good, he deserves it lol. "
"I've been in the same place as you are now, and I let it get way too far. I'd say a good rule of thumb is, if you have to ask if he's abusive, he probably is. Now I'm not just gonna say ""oh yeah dump your boyfriend"" because thats your decision, but I would reevaluate the reasons why you're together. Weigh the pros and cons. Decide if putting up with his temper and weirdly controlling behavior is something you want to do long-term."
"&gt;Can I really be friends with anyone who can't casually get along with the most important person in my life? 

Not easily, not without complex and annoying logistics and compromises. I mean, he's not come to the wedding...

&gt;Doesn't this mean that Doc probably still wants to be with me and actively resents that he isn't?

You are absolutely correct. That is EXACTLY what it means. He'd nail you in a heartbeat and it kills him that he cant and he's probably spent the last 3 years trying to 'nice guy' his way into your pants


&gt;Can any men tell me if Doc is doing this out of insecurity? 

Well, jealousy anyway.

&gt;Essentially...can I reasonably talk to Doc about this? 

Nope. Because he doesnt want to hear or accept what you are telling him. HE WANTS TO BE YOUR LIFE PARTNER and EVERY interaction with you is geared towards this.

I think you need to put him out of his misery once and for all, and tell him that (a) it aint never gonna happen,  (b) that if you wanted to be followed by something so needy you'd buy a puppy, and (c) that this is goodbye. 

Cut him out of your life, totally, then he can get the fuck over you and start to live a normal life, and you can free yourself from his BS "

I went to the doctor with my concerns,  ended up seeing a buttload of specialists,  had brain scans, blood tests, the works.  Nada.

They finally sent me to a psychologist and I went through neuropsychometric testing. My memory and recall actually tested above average - when I was concentrating.  

The thing is,  my thoughts tend to go everywhichway at once,  especially when I'm trying to multi-task. I have some social anxiety so I'll mentally rehearse conversations in my head and end up forgetting to tell someone something because my brain checked off that I'd done it already. 

I'm apparently too old for an ADD diagnosis but I was diagnosed with mild depression and put on a low-dose of antidepressants which helped with my underlying anxiety.  I also took up meditation and mindfulness exercises which improved my concentration a lot.

Point is, I went to the doctor. I wouldn't freak out about brain injury or Alzheimers just yet, but he should get checked out.  It's made a huge difference for me. "

Not once in your fairly long post did you say anything about how you feel about your girlfriend. Do you love her?
Because OP probably was while they were dating. The fact that you're even considering this is crazy. Stop being so agreeable and stop talking to her.

"Have you thought that there's deeper layers there? If you see a couple get into a massive yelling match over a fork left on a counter its pretty safe to say its not about the fork. Arguments don't happen in a vacuum. People carry their baggage into them. 

Yes, I agree he wasn't being sexist in the examples (at least as he told them), but if the person you love most changes quickly and starts hurling accusations at you, your response shouldn't be to fire back with defensive anger, that's only going to escalate things. You talk to her and ask where this is coming from, what's going on in her life that's causing this kind of reaction. You tackle problems together as a couple and not argue about who's right in a situation, because ultimately whether or not he was sexist is a secondary issue here. She felt like he was in that moment so discuss why, go after the root of the issue instead of adding your own emotions to the situation and bickering about a symptom. "
"JUST for trying to turn OP against his wife, he should refuse anything they try to convince him of using that tactic."
"From a post history deep dive, dating her seems to come with a lot of “trivial” strings. And I’m not talking about the polyamory. "

"It seems like you're not getting it. You understand that your wife is upset and you clearly want to avoid a divorce, but you don't seem to understand WHY your wife is upset. 

Signs point to abuse either perpetrated or enabled by her mother. You unilaterally decided that it's more important for you to play out your fantasy of a big happy family than it is for your wife to remain safe. You decided that your wife needs to suck it up and pretend everything is ok and put herself in a situation where she feels terrified just so that you can pretend that the family is normal and happy. You also decided to potentially endanger your own child by putting her in the power of people your wife considers untrustworthy. And you did all that just to play out a naive fantasy of what your wife's family should be like, all while ignoring the reality of what she was actually telling you. You decided that you are more important than she is. 

How would you feel if you had been abused and your wife unilaterally decided that you needed to suck it up and be close with the abuser? Imagine if she went behind your back and set up a meeting with that person, then sprung it on you. "
"So tell them the blunt truth, she made out with a married man, and shown remorse only once confronted. "
"Ugh. 
I know you're mortified, but you dealt with the situation in the best way you could have, especially offering to pay for cleaning. 

It will come out. Especially if it's cleaned professionally. So don't worry about having ruined his seat. You apologized. You offered to remedy the situation. You're obviously embarrassed. He really shouldn't have reacted so strongly. 

Wait a day, text him again apologizing and reiterating that you'd like to pay to have it cleaned. If he's still being rude about it and doesn't apologize for his reaction, he's no good friend of yours. Drop him like a hot potato girl! "
"I'm glad she's getting the medical help she needs now. But you should fully cut ties and move on. Her healing path will be long, rough, and contain set backs. And there's no guarantee she'll ever be fully fixed of these issues. Unless you're willing to endure that over and over, you need to move on and she can sort out her own issues."
All OP needs to do now is wear a fedora when he says it and he'll be set.
"Yeah, no kidding. I'm at the point now where baby fever is seriously kicking in, but my periods are still hardly happening at all since I had my first kid 2.5 years ago (stopped breastfeeding before she turned two). I was sharing my worries with my husband last night, and mentioned that if it comes to it at least there are drugs that can help you ovulate. He made a joke about that leading to twins, and it was like cold water down my spine. I'm VERY much tied up in wanting a baby right now, but I'd still lose my absolute shit if we were having more than one. I think it's a perfectly understandable reaction, especially when you already have one and know how hard that is."
"&gt;unless you think he wants a baby sitter so that you can sit on the couch alone and watch CSI: Miami.

He might actually be happy about that.  Everyone is talking about the husband feeling neglected, but he might also be worried that his wife's entire life is their kid."
"You can’t really dictate how fast people respond.
You try but it’s up to her who she ultimately decides to talk to. Honestly if someone wasn’t so keen on texting me back as I am with them, then I wouldn’t put so much effort into it. 
Maybe it’s just the way she is, and if it’s not effecting things like get togethers, outings, dinner, or whatever then I don’t see much of a problem. The biggest solution would be to stop communicating so much and see what she does in the end."
I would absolutely stop having sex with him until he was tested. I'd also probably dump him because he sounds like an immature jerk. 
"I wonder if he has a coworker that he’s talking to about your relationship problems now? I wonder if he tells her he can’t talk to you, you don’t understand, you only talk about [whatever]...?"

"Yes she was pissing the stairs, but she stopped after the landlord confronted her. The landlord hired professionals to clean the stairs. She also talked about telling the girl to leave, but she first wants to solve the problem and if the problem doesn't solve, she will tell her to leave I think."
"If the girlfriend wants therapy so bad, I really think a joint session just to have this nailed into her head by a professional neutral arbiter might not be the worst idea ever. Going alone would be a waste of OP's time though."

If Sam won't deal you need to leave because no one is worth this shit. No one."
"You missed the part where OP could not find her phone, which is normally her alarm."
"To add to what the commenter said about being naive, she might like the attention even if she isn't into him. I made some very stupid choices as a result of feeding low self esteem / insecurity. 

Your husband has crossed a line like twenty times over... I think you need to stop feeling like you require some sort of ""proof"" and put your foot down that he is very blatantly trying to flirt with this woman and is hiding things from you."
"I think someone being so dead-set on spanking their children is lacking the kind of natural warmth and empathy most of us feel for small, vulnerable people. She's also rigid, set in her ways, and sees things in black and white instead of with nuance. Any of these traits would be a dealbreaker for me, personally."
"Oh, but wife KNOWS he would never cheat! ....I tell ya, whatever I thought I ""knew"" would be out the window after hearing the conversation these two had. She is right to be so upset, because cheating doesn't just happen and here they are laying out the groundwork for it right in front of her, supportive bro and all! Yeesh. "
"I also have a thing for much older men. I'm 22 and Korean too. The difference between you and me is that my dad is the complete opposite of yours. When we lived together, he hugged me everyday and was my biggest supporter. He still is.

"I'm really sorry you are going through all of that! I don't know what it is about Architecture that they seem to want to break you down ... then hopefully (if you survive) build you up again. Nobody has an ego like those professors.


'You don't fail architecture. You de-register.'


We used to call it Architorture. We had a ""crit room"" - someone pinned a sign on the door that said 'entrance to hell'. Also the year above me hung a noose from the rafters in their studio - they had to take it down in case someone used it.


I remember one week in my final year of undergraduate I slept a total of 8hrs in one week. It was absolute hell. The lecturers would write in marker across peoples hand-drawn work that took weeks ""CTRL+Z"". They wold give us literally impossible tasks to do - an entire hotel, with services, no repeating floors, 3d model and renders - in 5 days. I think I saw every person in my year cry at least once. I used to drive home at 5am, shower and come back.

I was top of my honours class (4th year) and the head of my module was talking about how revolutionary my design was - come the exam, my mark went from 96% to 42%, because the head of year didn't understand it. I almost had to repeat the year.


I haven't go real advice for you, but I have been there - and it REALLY sucks. Post grad (ironically) gets a LOT easier. If you are stuck, hire a first year to model make for you.


Take a vitamin B supplement. It does help with energy levels. All you need to do is pass well enough to squeeze into post-grad.


Your work experience is going to help you so much long term, as well as your relationships in the work place.


You aren't alone."
"No, you sound like you're being smart. Emotional exhaustion is just as exhausting (or even more, IMHO) then physical exhaustion. You have a five week old child. You must be so, so drained. 

Stay home and rest, you deserve it. "
"ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MEET THIS MAN.

Don't do it.  

The thing about online dating--and I'm saying this as someone who has met several partners in the last thirteen years or so online, someone who met her current partner and hopefully soon-husband online--is that it's all a story someone is telling you.

Every piece of what you're shown is tuned to arouse interest and promote trust.

No matter how truthful they're *trying* to be, there are going to be things, always, that fall through the cracks.

(My partner? He's the kinda guy who'll unload the dishwasher after I load it, and reload it ""correctly.""  Things like that, small things, can honestly make or break a relationship which started online.)

But this guy? He started with a lie.  And not a little lie, like saying he was 180lbs instead of 175, but a lie like ""Absolutely I've been tested,"" or ""I'm totally single.""  The kind of lie which exists to hide who he is, so that he can get into your pants.

ALL YOU KNOW about him at this point is this: He is most of twice your age, and he hid that from you for _years._

Every other thing you think you know about him, you don't.

_The fact that you have no family or friends is something he used to get you more vulnerable._  There is no one to know if you vanish, OP, which means you're in a really dangerous position right now.

You literally have no idea whether or not this dude is a psycho.  All you do know is that he's a liar who is willing to entirely fuck up your life for his own whim.


You owe him nothing.  And you owe yourself safety.  Don't meet him.  Block him on your phone and online.  And be somewhere else, like a coffeeshop, when he's in town.

Don't give him a chance to apologize or explain.  He's spent the last two years learning what all your buttons are, how to manipulate you, because you've been honest while he told you lies.  He will know how to work you over emotionally, because he's a lot older than you--he has context and experience that you don't, and he will use it against you.

Please, please don't meet him.  Please keep yourself safe."
I'm glad you got out of that situation safely. It's terrifying how many people use this as a manipulation tactic.
"For what it's worth, this is one of the nicest problems I've seen in this forum. What I'm reading is that you and your husband are great parents who teach and enforce smart rules. Your son knows to follow them and it keeps him safe. Bravo! MIL is being immature by sulking, clearly. If I were you, I'd talk about this with your husband while your temper is in check, and ask him to help set her straight. It might have more of an impact coming from him. If it doesn't, pretend she's someone else's child having a tantrum. Smile gently, try to deflect the situation, and if she doesn't cut it out, continue to politely but firmly lay down the law. Eventually she'll get over it. "
"I’m sorry if this is unpopular advice, but I think you need to tell the wife. Confidentiality doesn’t count when a person is a danger to themselves or others. This isn’t about Bill being an alcoholic this is about him using Fentanyl; Bill is most definitely a danger to himself right now. Furthermore, Bill is a danger to the infant. What if his wife trusts him to watch the baby and he uses? What if he ODs? What if the baby is exposed to his stash? I work at a Children’s Hospital in Ohio and I can’t tell you how many babies and children overdose accidentally on their parents’ drugs. I’m sorry but this is no longer about Bill feeling comfortable in an AA meeting; this is about his own life and the life of his newborn. "
"Wait, so you both made the choice early on that you'd only have one kid, and now you're changing your mind?  Am I reading that right?"
With the way she worded the title I thought she was going to say that boyfriend was not the father. That they got together after she was already pregnant. 
"Op I'm sorry you don't have a happy update for us. I work for an animal shelter and I can say bringing the dog back is 100% the right choice. 

I worked heavily with our dog adoption department and unfortunately some behavioral problems just don't show themselves in the shelter. It takes getting the dog home and getting them comfortable where bad behavior starts to show. It's just one of those unknown factors. It's also the reason why I don't think adopting from a shelter is the right choice for everyone. 

Getting a dog from a shelter is a gamble. I have seen dogs that I got along with perfectly, go home to a family and maul another dog or bite the owner severely. They are simply unpredictable. 

The shelter has the resources to evaluate what the right course of action is for the dog. Unfortunately not all behaviors can be trained out but they can determine what's doable and what's not. 

Try not to beat yourself up about this too much. Situations like these are why shelters have return policies. You came there for a family pet, not a project dog, and that a reasonable expectation to have. I work closely with professional trainers and even they often don't want to deal with a project dog, it's asking a lot. 

Take comfort in going on the eighth path and hopefully it will lead you guys to a dog that is a better fit for your household. "
"In your eyes he'll always be a baby. And no, you can't control your instincts but you can control your behavior. You will have to. 

When my cousin was first sleep training her infant she would hear the baby crying and crying in the other room. It was torture for her, she was crying too. But she controlled herself and soon the baby had a regular sleep schedule and proved that going against her instincts was what was best for the baby in the long run. "
"Well, she suffers from crippling depression. They got this dog to replace her old dog that was sort of an emotional support dog for her. I find her blaming herself pretty natural consequence - she wanted a dog and now has to put it back to the shelter. So this is the depression feeding on something she really cared about.

I think they got a young dog because they probably didn't want to have to deal with its death too soon. It definitely backfired on them.

The shelter personnel fucked up big time by telling them the dog was compatible with OP's living situation. OP and wife seem like they're honestly trying - they took the dog to a trainer. They don't seem to be unresponsible pet owners. Their only mistake is trusting what the people at the shelter told them.

Cats can also have behavioral issues (too cool for litterbox, scratching people) and OP's wife has more experience dealing with dogs. I guess they could start by volunteering in a shelter to take dogs for walks, do this for several weeks, and then pick a dog that they're able to work with well."
Why do you want to marry this parasite?
"Eh, when I was 24 I had already graduated undergrad and was finishing my doctorate. We'd totally (jokingly) mock doctoral students dating undergrads, we sure as hell would find it creepy to be dating a sophomore in high school. I'm all fit age differences (my husband was 10 years older than me) but only once everyone is an adult. 16 is still a child-can't vote, restricted driving, can't rent a hotel/car/apartment, can't drink, can't go into many music venues, can't buy cigarettes, has a city curfew (in my state anyway), cant see certain movies in a theatre, etc etc. being attracted to a child living with her parents is creepy to me. "
"I agree in general, but it still strongly looks like she knew she would provoke such a reaction in OP, and intentionally gathered an audience to witness that reaction."
"Yeah, the responsibility of a parent going through marital troubles is to limit the impact those troubles have on the children. (This includes divorcing, I'm not saying to stay together for the kids.) Children should not be put in the position of deciding what to do with information that would make them despise one parent or another.

The father was wrong to allow the children to know about his infidelity. But it's still the mother's responsibility to avoid making it even further their problem."
"Reading all your comments, you're either incredibly naive or you know what you're doing isn't ok and you are just denying it because you want to keep getting to know this girl alone and without interference from your girlfriend.  Which is it?  "
The whole Jim thing was projection.  He cheated/wants to cheat so why wouldn’t you?
Just because he doesn't want to be flashy about his wealth doesn't mean he can't buy some 5 layer burrito Taco Bell heaven for you. I'm so irritated.
"You sound a bit hypocritical. No, you are not wrong for feeling how you feel, but there is nothing you can do about it. And complaining about your brother still living with mom and dad and not having the financial means nor motivation to move out is really not something you can do when you are in the exact same position. 

If you wanted to move out you would be out already, it is just not the convenient answer. Either you deal with your brother and his girlfriend since it is not your house and your parents or pushovers, or you deal with a little financial fallback and perhaps even working at a place you *may not necessarily love* in order to have more independence and control over your home space.

Unfortunately there is no magic answer that will get you anywhere. Try sleeping with earbuds at night and going to a quiet internet cafe during the days to continue the job hunt. Spread the search wider. A lot of people get ""entry-level"" jobs (secretarial, retail, hospitality, etc.) while they're in University and support themselves fine. The FAFSA (if you're American) will help you out with the schooling and be more useful once you're not being claimed as a dependent. Scholarships and loans are better than restless nights and consistent anger."
"I absolutely love killing with kindness at my job. ""You should've done that this way!"" ""Oh thank you SO much for all the help! I REALLY appreciate you taking time out of your work to help me."""

"&gt; I have really screwed up and I know that more than anyone. 

All of this reads like something you are saying but not actually doing. One of those insincere CEO apologies.  

If you actually believed you screwed up, you would be trying to fix the mistake, not trying to get her to stop being mad at you.

Why are you here asking for ways to get your wife to not be mad at you and not on /r/personalfinance asking for ways to fix your finances? Which is what she's actually mad about (in addition to the lying, I'm sure, which means you should also be looking for ways to improve your communication with your wife)."
"I would give it some time to blow over. While it's still ""fresh"" in her mind it may be just super awkward for her. If she's still freezing you out after that, talk to your husband. 

You mention your in-laws are fairly conservative and traditional -- unfortunately sometimes in that mindset, that kind of thing will be blamed on the woman being too ""tempting"" (loose, sexual, whatever). Your MIL may also subconsciously prefer to think of it as your fault than to think her boy has those kinds of thoughts on his own. So *if* it reaches the point where your MIL continues to freeze you out, that's where your husband needs to gently but firmly tell her to knock it off (and, as embarrassing as it may be, own his role in what happened if the incident comes up directly)."
"&gt;Am I a terrible person for having reluctance? 

No. 

&gt;What should I do about her request?

She got herself pregnant, she decided to put herself in a situation where she's stuck with a douchebag's bills, and she's the one that's ultimately responsible for that child. Even asking this of you is selfish of her. She said she can find a way to deal, so trust her and let her deal with the consequences. If you have some spare cash maybe send some her way so she can cut back on the hours, but if you go chances are the few months will be prolonged to a few years, and then you'll have nothing to return to in Europe. "
Stopping sex to go catch a Pokemon is a pretty big sign of disrespect. I don't think it would be unreasonable for you to tell her that there are a few times that stopping to go get Pokemon is a dealbreaker and break up with her if she violates them.
"This stance is pretty one sided. Saying she's not the person he proposed to and mentioning a break up is a pretty nuclear option, IMO for something that on the surface is pretty benign. 

There's a comment below that talks about some of the insecurity that could be driving this on her side. OP likely doesn't know the whole story. Might be worth approaching a conversation to try to understand what's fueling the obsession for her. Just that, just try to get a firm understanding about why she likes Instagram so much, how she feels when she posts, does she think she can do other activities sometimes etc. Once he actually understands, they can then work on real compromises, like don't post while we're actually out on a date. "
"No shit. Dude's bought his mother lingerie, bikini, had a ten time longer honeymoon with his mother(who can't even stand OP enough to come to the wedding) than his own freshly married wife and to top it off he now wants to buy her a new rack. Oh, and he barely has sex with OP anymore. And not to forget, they're talking about each other's masturbation habits.

Like.. how did it take so damn long to come to the realization that *something* might be wrong?"
"Yeah, I think OP bears some responsibility here. I understand that she lives in a small town with nobody but a GP, but if your kid is suffering from something like asthma and their symptoms don't seem to be improving, go find a specialist in the nearest city. If you take your kid to the doc three times and the doc says ""No, this is fine"" and you believe it's not, ask how you can get a second opinion. This is part of the reason most professional organizations discourage doctors from treating family members; a family member may or may not feel comfortable saying ""I think you're wrong, so I'm going elsewhere now."" But it's incumbent upon OP to do that. She's decided her SIL is negligent and a bad doctor. So the question now is: what is she going to do about it? If there's not another doctor close enough to be her family's GP, then she needs to figure out some other kind of game plan."
"Erm, decieving him into doing things so she can stroke her social nedia ego is far from benign."
"You want to know what's going on? Then help out. Look at bank statements, sign into the amazon account, talk to your wife, etc. 

But don't expect her to take time to inform you or give you a dashboard like she's reporting to you and you're her boss. Get involved and actually help out if you want to know. "
"Honestly it's sounds like you have some pretty great parents. I know it's hard for you to hear those things, but they weren't meant for your ears. Jus like they're doing their best to help you in your transition, you need to do your best to be patient with them as they come to acceptance. It's a big change for them too. 

Best of luck to you!"
"First off, you were raped. I read this in horror. Please remove this guy from your life. 

Second, go see a doctor and tell them the entire story. Don’t be polite about it. It could be he tore something during the rape.

"So if the issue *is* Kara, you're basically saying that your family is choosing her over your brother's wife, and by extension him. Which doesn't make you terrible people or it a wrong thing to do, but it's absolutely understandable that if that's the case, that's why your brother and Rachel are distant. It may well be that Rachel's insecure and jealous and doesn't want to be around her, or it could be your family is callous and insensitive and expects Rachel to just suck it up. Either way though, if it's as simple as Kara vs. Rachel, well, you've made your choice, and that comes with consequences. We don't always get to have everything our own way in life. "

"Parenting comes first and you're not the parent here. First your mother needs to talk to your sister and then your sister needs to talk to your girlfriend. You can help make those talks happen, but don't get too involved in the beginning. Too many people needing to talk to her can make her clam up and dig in.

She made a mistake and she needs the space to make it right. She may want to ask you how to make it right with your girlfriend and let her then use you as a sound board to help her figure out a solution. Learning how to fix mistakes is a valuable skill to learn. You don't learn that when other people fix your mistakes or tell you what to do.

You all don't seem too upset, just concerned, so give her the guidance to fix her mistake and the opportunity to learn how."
So disappointed in myself.
"So it's cool to just have zero consideration for your partner because ""that's how we are."" Uh no."
"This is why my first husband and I didn't work out. He married someone more tolerant and basically ruined her life. The lawyers send me their bankruptcy updates. It's bad.

You can't get yourself deeper into this mess."
i really do like this idea. I'm just not sure how easy it would be to get her to come out.
"I honestly don't know of any couple who gets chores and dinner done and washed by 7pm. You'd need to be Swiss (or getting home at 5pm at the latest) to do that.

"If you don't resent it now you will soon. He is treating you like a fuck toy. What is there to your relationship besides sex? His obsession and focus on sex is very unusual and may be his method of coping with stress or some other issue. He needs help before he drives you away. But if he doesn't want help or change, the situation is hopeless because without his consent and cooperation, nothing will change."
"Put all the cum rags on his pillow with a note ""throw this out"". That will serve two ends

1. He knows hiding them doesn't work. You will find them and he will be embarassed about them.

2. He learns how to locate the garbage can. 

Eventually he will put 2 and 2 together and realize that if he just throws them away in the first place, then he won't have to hide them like an idiot because you won't look for them in the garbage. "
"I'm a dude, and sometimes I read shit on here that I can absolutely not even fathom doing. This is one of them. It is so broken and wacky. Dump this clown like yesterday."
"&gt; she has prevented me from going to work and has me locked inside the house with no phone and just my laptop.

This is abuse. So yes, you may end up in shelter. But at least you will be starting to get control of your life.

Sometimes it is ok to put school off until you can actually focus on it. (I used to be a professor, my best students were usually the ones who did take time off first and worked to afford it, because they knew exactly why they were there and what their education was worth to them.)

You need to focus on protecting yourself first.

"Maybe she’s just sick of being part of this dude’s pity party. He fucked up, he fucked his girlfriend over, and now he’s fucked his life up with drugs and alcohol and you and all your friends feel bad for the poor slob. But your girlfriend doesn’t have those warm and friendly feelings towards him, he is your friend more than hers I’m guessing, she sees him as a pathetic mess who can’t deal with the consequences of his actions. You sympathizing with him probably made her blood boil."
"&gt; Abortion is now very scary for her because there's a chance that she won't be able to have kids ever after the procedure

That’s a super rare complication.

HOWEVER. If she really, really wants to be a mother? There’s a good chance she really wants the baby she’s carrying, and at this point, an abortion would break her heart too.

Not a decision anyone can make for the two of you.

Keeping this baby doesn’t sound disasterous - you both seem to have family support and your biggest concerns are weed and video games (not, for example, an upcoming prison sentence or “newly clean from meth”.) You’ll always feel unready for a baby.  Your call."
Maya honestly doesn't play a role in this other than providing an excuse. 
"First, stop enabling her.  She's a grown-up and can find her own rides to where she needs to go.  She'll continue to use you and not get help for her problems or try to drive if she can continue to use you instead.

If she truly has PTSD, she needs counseling to get over it.  She can use her own money to get it if her parent's won't pay for it.  Again, she's an adult and needs to take the reins on this herself."
"Wow, you just dug the heels in a little deeper there. Why not try a little early? You are 30-32, not 50. It will likely be fine.  The above commentor suggested not worrying about a few months and your response is to literally list specific months you want to start trying by. Again, not that big of a deal. 

Think about it this way, would you rather have a kid or have your husband resent you for the entire pregnancy? My sisters are 5 years younger than me. It is the perfect age difference because we are close but we didn't have to directly compete with each other. A few extra months up to a year will likely not make any difference at all."
"Please don't make excuses for his abuse. He clearly doesn't know how to handle frustration and having any kind of pet requires us to handle frustration without using abusive language and physical threats.

"I see your perspective, but it can easily be perceived as, ""I'm not a bad guy, I don't scream, I just raise my voice,"" which seems to be ignoring/excusing the fact that you're upsetting a child.

He might be scared that he has something and had you check to be safe. Him not getting tested could imply he does have it or has a chance of having it. So still fucked up. Maybe sit him down and ask calmly and if he reacts in a weird/angry way then surely somethings up and he might have something. Best of luck.

because it is!"
"Yeah, it's one thing to not like kids or to be good with them. But referring to them as ""little shits"" or ""monsters"" in front of their parents is rude and unacceptable. (And this is clearly not a, ""we're all friends and feel comfortable making harsh-sounding jokes sometimes"" context.)  Likewise interrogating people about their choice to be a SAHP. 

I think OP is going to have to let some of this go, like the stuff about Bro/SIL's nice house or the bragging about their nice vacations. That kind of thing is when you bust out the classic family tradition of smiling at your annoying relative's face, then going home, pouring a glass of wine, and talking shit about them. Kind of seems to me like if SIL was so happy with her life, she wouldn't feel the need to be nasty about yours. Just something to keep in mind.

However, for the situation where SIL is being rude about the children, I think it would be appropriate for OP to calmly, firmly stand up for herself. I think responses like ""I respect your choices, Susan, and I hope you can respect mine in turn"" or ""Susan, I don't appreciate my children being referred to as shits/monsters. You don't have to like them, or children in general, but there's no need to be rude about it"" (however OP wants to phrase it) would be appropriate. 

Also, one last note for OP - unless you are SURE (like, she has said so herself unambiguously) that she is childfree by choice, I would be careful about making that assumption. This is kind of a long shot, but it's possible she/your brother have some fertility issues and some of her nastiness is a form of overcompensation. That would not excuse her behavior at all, but it's a possible land mine to consider."
"I also wonder if they're the child-free types who think that not having kids is the superior choice, etc. Now obviously not all child-free people are like that, but I've met some who really kind of *hate* children and all the attention they get, etc. "
"&gt; ... but I don’t deserve the hatred of my babies.

They're not babies. They are adults that understand the complexity of adult relationships. "
"Could you imagine, ""Hey, I've just had a c-section. I sure would love it if all my relatives and their boyfriends popped 'round for a visit. Preferably after visiting hours so we can just keep on entertaining into the evening."""
"&gt;she was pushed out by other members of our class from doing a video our studio was putting together. 

Wonder why?"
"Yes, she claimed it was only a kiss. In the whole whirlwind of emotions that happened during the confrontation, I don't remember if I clarified that they made out.

We play sports together so we have a lot of the same friends. My hesitation is that she has always been the more social and outgoing one. If what happened comes out, I would probably end up being the one shunned from the group."
"Tell him this. Show him this post.

Take all the photos you want... I think it's absolutely ridiculous that any adult getting married wouldnt include whatever photos they want in their wedding albums because mommy said no. How about uninvite the terrible/judgemental relatives (why are they and their opinions more important than the bride here??) and have a wedding you actually enjoy? 
"Looks like she has three trips to work out, the trip with her husband, the Trip to the parents house for Thanksgiving, and the guilt trip OP’s family takes her on"
Yeah... I think if he actually did send messages I could see why he'd think that he got ghosted and leave. 40 minutes is not nothing... Your advice is helpful. 
"Really good comment. I guess this is all about a mindset change, and realizing that not everyone is going to like me/be cool with my boundaries. And that's fine. The right one will."
"&gt; What I don't understand about her story is how she could have forgotten - after 2 days, you get a period. That's pretty noticeable.

That's not true.  I mean I have friends for whom that is true but it's not universal, it's never happened to me."
"&gt;Conversely you could say the man's purpose, whether the wife respected him or not, was to be a paycheck.

Yup, masculinity can also be toxic! That's why it was a shitty system, and in actuality a very bad gig."
"Want to ask some questions to kind of describe how I feel about this... Did you ask her a specific question about this guy? Or did you just ask if she knows anything about him? Did you say ""I'm really interested in this guy and see a potential relationship with him""?? I understand why you felt embarrassed in front of a room of people hearing this stuff, but I think the rest of them thought of this was no big deal. As someone who has done my fair share of hooking up, I'm pretty casual talking about it amongst those I'd consider friends. 

From the details you provided, it sounds like your friend had zero cues to be sensitive and tread carefully when talking to you about him. If she didn't know you are pursuing a relationship with him she was probably just telling you what she'd tell any of her girlfriends about the encounter. To you it might be oversharing because you have a different take on relationships and sex than she does AND a different view of the guy. And both of you are perfectly okay to view it differently.

I think because of how you felt, you likely felt watched, but I think you are assuming she was bringing you there to humiliate you in front of a room full of people, when for her, she was probably hanging with friends and thought ""hey u/turkishdelight21 is my friend, she can be here with us too and talk about guys and whatever else."" Though you probably heard more than you wanted or needed, how would you have felt if she left out that she'd slept with him and you later found out when in this relationship? 

It sounds like you and your friend have different ideas on what's okay to share. Based only on the info given, I don't think your friend was trying to slight you or upset you, just was giving you info that technically you solicited. You cannot stop people from saying what they'll say and you can't adjust what they're comfortable with. If you don't like that level of sharing, don't share on that level, and in the future, make it known to the friend that you would prefer to not hear such detailed accounts of her sex life. If she can't respect a boundary like that, then maybe reconsider being her friend. At present, she didn't know of this boundary, so if you're upset, talk about it with her one-on-one."
"&gt; told me that I ""should be happy that men think you're beautiful"" when I was catcalled one day

FUCK THAT."
"Yea this guy whipped out his dick and peed in OP parents pool!! Tact is not of concern at this point. This guy needs to understand that OP now sees him as a 3 year old due to his actions. None of what he is doing is normal for a 35 year old, even shit faced drunk 35 year olds know better."
"Lmao I love this one, would pay to see her reaction to this one! "
"Mine apparently accidentally kneed me in the back while we were sleeping together and I muttered ""you jackass"". He felt horrible &amp; bought me chocolates the next day and I had no idea why!

I've also apparently woken up and attempted to explain the Wii controls for Super Mario Galaxy to him before. "
"I think the main answer is in what you think about the ethics of whatever he did compared to your personal moral code.  Do you think what he did was defensible - or is it outright wrong?  

&gt;He’s never been a dishonest person, but being guilty of these things shows that he is at the very least dishonest at work .

Don't kid yourself - if he's truly guilty of dishonest things then he is a dishonest person.  It's not fair to yourself or him to pretend that there are two versions of him.

After you settle on a moral position, there are the practical issues about being with someone with a criminal record like this.  Even if you accept who he is, other people may judge you by his behavior.  He won't be able to work as effectively, so you'll have to carry a bigger load, etc...

If you proceed you should be very confident in your decision."
" You can't reason with an abuser. You can only leave them. 

Whay are you doing? "
"It means he thinks he can get you to bang him again because you took his bait after ""cutting him off."" He told you what he wants, and it's not a relationship. Believe him."
