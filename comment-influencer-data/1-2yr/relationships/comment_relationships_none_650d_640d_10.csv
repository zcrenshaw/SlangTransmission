Tell her as soon as possible and stop wasting her time. 
"That is really a very good idea! I’ve just never had it in me to not do anything for him. I guess I keep hoping that if I make things special for him he’ll return the favor, but you’re right, it’s obviously not working. I may very well do this next time instead."
"The whole “he works a job he can’t have a meal during work hours” doesn’t seem right. Even day laborers are legally afforded lunch breaks. 

Sounds like he has zero motivation to get fit. Talk to him and tell him all the stuff you just said. Be open and honest about your feelings "
"As someone who has never ventured toward this in real life but also thinks its a bit hot to swing  --- I totally do not get these ""no kissing"" type boundaries. You. Are. Fucking. Sex, PIV, genitals, nakedness, orgasms. But no kissing? Is everyone just going to just scissor each other? 

My advice is to find a treasure trove of past Savage Love sex advice columns and see all the 'woe we did a threesome' advice questions. "
"In the comments, the OP said that her husband is basically refusing to leave the house and accused her of using the bank to spy on him when she asked where a charge came from.  

The gaslighting in the original post and part where he went on a rant were also kinda iffy.  "
"Aren't you a long term friend who's been there for him? Oh right, he doesn't need to show appreciation because he ""does small things for you on a regular basis."" Some guys love to keep you feeling small and insignificant.

In general, does he lift you up? Make you feel good? Encourage you toward your goals? How often does he actually do those ""small things"" for you?"
"This exactly, my bf has a lot of sexual energy. Like doing 4-5X a day. Im just not. And unfortunately he, like Op, focuses way to much on the orgasm. It puts me on the spot and it makes the whole thinf unpleasant.

Op, have you tried just making out with her? Dont go for anything, just kiss her. For me, that helps. I dont want to be prodded and poked. I like making out, for me thats better than sex. 

Its sounds like your pushing too hard for the orgasm, and for more exotic sex. For me, when my bf does this its a TOTAL turn off. "
Why should he dump her after his family acted weird for no reason??
She wont have much to see grow at that point.  I would be worried that having her see such a small amount grow would disuade her from saving in the future.
"That is a wonderful summary of how that conversation went. Like, what the hell? What kinda person says that bullshit? Ugh."
"From OP's other post:

&gt; Never paid his share of rent, helped him get 2 cars (first car got totaled), and always stole money from me"
"I had an ex partner who installed keyloggers on my computer and constantly violated my privacy by reading my browser history, email, and any type of messenger service  (chat, texts etc). He logged into my Facebook to delete men he felt threatened by too. He was extremely mentally abusive/moody/controlling outside of this too.

I would never live that way again. People who obssessively violate your privacy are sick and unworthy of partnership. I feel like vomiting when I think about what he used to do to me, and with several years behind me, can truly identify what a pestilence he was in my life.

Think about the true effects of his actions on you. Think about what that says about him."
"Hi! I'm an RA at a University so I hope I can offer some insight. You should absolutely do what everyone is saying and go above your RAs head, schools can and will move you if you are uncomfortable for literally any reason, so you absolutely can and should move out. There should be a community director or someone that has been sending you emails over the semester or a phone number you can get from your RA.

Sorry you have a terrible RA! You  can goto them and tell them you want to move out first and see if they can direct you or if you prefer still go above their heads. Also having YOUR parents raise a stink with the school by calling Residence Life can expedite the process.

Best of luck! Your college experience can and will be so much better!"
"If she can't deal with her depression and anxiety without cheating on you, then she's not ready to be in a relationship in the first place."
Your son sounds like he's going to have an issue with females of he doesn't already. 
How do you explain the trillions of ugly people who are in happy relationships? I can’t even wrap my head around the idea that only attractive people find partners. 
"I didn't really have to do much here.  Your words.

Dude - 4 months?  that's not an investment, that's a cup of coffee and a few condoms."
"Maybe try having empathy for Ed’s girlfriend? As someone who has been in her situation, it would be appreciated. If you like this guy and think he likes you, you need to handle this as the adults you claim to be. You are not helpless in the situation. The next time he flirts with you, before you reciprocate, tell him you are flattered, but can’t escalate things while you he is still in a relationship with his girlfriend.

And if you’re only holding on to your LDR until Ed is ready for you, you’re disrespecting that precious friendship. Either focus on that relationship or let him go to find someone who will treat him appropriately."
"But it’s not anxiety about the condition, is it? OP frames it as such but in truth it isn’t fear or anxiety or any emotion at all; it’s the condition itself. It’s not an emotion that the child has a serious medical condition that might flare up. It’s not an emotion that the condition can be life-threatening.

This is how people with medical conditions and disabilities talk themselves out of protecting themselves; by buying into the bullshit that their reaction is irrational (and therefore stupid) fear and not sensible, fact-based caution."
"I would quit. The extra money is certainly nice, but your relationship and mental health also need dedicated time. In fifty years, you’ll look back on this and value the time you spent enjoying yourself and being with your girlfriend, not that you paid off big debts a few years earlier. I know you would feel bad abandoning your coworkers, but right now, the second job is causing you to basically abandon your girlfriend. Who is more important? "
"Despite what opponents of sex ed will tell you, all the stats show that talking about birth control and in general sex ed, delays kids from having sex. Explaining the risks, giving them language and info to say no, and providing birth control for those that do have sex reduces teen pregnancies, delays age of first sex and reduces STDs.

It's like if you make sex less mysterious and off limits, those pesky teenagers with their poor impulse control, rebellious natures and out if control hormones will make rational decisions about it rather than rush in like crazy people. 

Your husband is being very foolish and if your daughter finds out what his meltdown is about she is never going to forgive him. Once she gets over blaming herself for causing her parents to argue to the point of her dad leaving. "
"The following books were extremely helpful for me in understanding my sister's condition and how best to protect myself from her abuse.

Stop Walking on Eggshells

I Hate You, Don't Leave Me

The Essential Family Guide to Borderline Personality Disorder

Perhaps they will help you as well. Good luck."
"this. everyone is oozing over david in the comments and really vilifying OP, but i think David is overcompensating for his childhood. OP mentioned that he did a similar den mother thing for his younger sisters since their mom worked.

When i was 16, my dad would pound on my door at 6am to wake me up and my mother would hand me a piece of toast as i walked out the door at 6:30am. I wouldn't see them until 7:30pm every night because after school i had sports or was working. They never were involved with my homework except to ask me if it was done or if i asked my dad a history question. I made a lot easier transition to college then my first roommate who's mother i suspect was very much like David."
"&gt;I'm passively trying to teach them critical thinking skills

Speaking as a child from a mixed atheist/Pentecostal marriage, it's worth it, even if you don't live to see the results.

My mom and I went to a Pentecostal church that did the whole shebang, speaking in tongues, etc. My dad was very open with me about not believing in God. It caused me pain as a child, worrying about him not being ""saved."" He died of cancer when I was 14, and it crushed me thinking that I had never been able to convert him.

However, the lessons he taught me about critical thinking, scientific inquiry, etc (for real, he would sit me on his lap as a kid and read Scientific American articles he thought I would like, our weekly daddy-daughter thing was watching Star Trek, whenever I would wonder aloud at why something worked or did what it did, we'd look it up or write down the question in our ""library journal"" to ask a librarian the next time we went to the public library.)

When I would try to convert him, he'd ask me to explain why I thought things, why I interpreted different passages the way I did, or why the church interpreted them that way and why I thought I should trust the church.

Etc, etc, etc.

In my early 20s, I ended up deconverting, and am now an atheist. His lessons in critical thinking and scientific inquiry took root, and while they were dormant for awhile, when they bloomed they were hardy. Of course he would probably be aghast that I'm now a leftist (he worked on Reagan's CA gov campaign) 

You've got to take the long game with your children. Don't push, just plant ideas and help the kids cultivate them."
This seems guilty AF.
"Stay with the aunt and help out with the kids. For a while I had a toddler for 10+ hours a day twice a week and anyone taking over for just 10 minutes would have been nice. Help out and do some dishes or laundry(kids create a shit ton) or even just vacuum. If you pull your weight there will be no problem.

That was just one small kid, three would have been a nightmare. Kids are surprisingly easy to entertain, since everything is new, but at the same time exhausting because you don't really get a break, even to take a dump. I can guarantee that if you follow the rules you talk about with your aunt she wouldn't mind having you there, as I said it's exhausting."
the world where it takes approximately 18 years and 234 women coming forward about sexual harassment by a man for anything to get done (if it ever does?)
Stop it. Stop it stop it stop it.
"I mean, breaking up was definitely the right call, he didn’t love her. But sitting her down for a weird talk where he didn’t come right out and say it, calling her fat and comparing her to his best friends girlfriend then coming here and writing about it as if her reaction was crazy......meh. I just don’t think he’s particularly sympathetic and I think he handled the break up very poorly. "
"I'm a university administrator, my profs just love it when students show up after the final to argue about marks being ""taken off"". 

We have this conversation a lot, that students seem to feel they start with 100% and ""lose"" marks, but we feel they start at 0% and ""earn"" marks. What do you think?"
"&gt;  I hear you on this issue. This is an issue my exes have had. I don't want to talk about it. I won't be fixing it. And if you push it, we will break up, which is what happened in the past.

Amen. Shut down this thread, because that is what OP's boyfriend is saying.

&gt;How should I continue this conversation with him?

OP - You don't. You stop making him dinner and cleaning his stuff, only taking care of your own shit. You get your affairs in order, you start saving your money and looking for roommates and you gtfo."
"Same! I'm prescribed Treximet because mine only occur every once in a while, but it's a searing pain behind my eye that feels like I'm being stabbed from inside my eyeball. Whenever it happens I end up taking the meds, going to my room, covering my head with a pillow to keep all the light/noise away. 

Kids in the room next to me would be an absolute nightmare. "
Follow your older brother's example.  It's none of your responsibility to subsidize or take care of Tom.  He's an adult and needs to deal with that reality.
"&gt;Telling BIL anything is a waste of effort as long as husband is undermining the OP. They need to be a united front (which frankly should be the default in a marriage so this thing is already on the rocks).

Exactly. Throwing BIL out needs to happen as soon as possible if this marriage is to be saved, but it's only the beginning of fixing the problems here."
It's not stupid to be hurt when your friends don't support you.
Don't let her move in with you. She doesn't sound like she's ever been a good mother and you're right she will probably screw you over just like she does everyone else. I can almost guarantee she won't be out in a week. You also risk your own safety if she tells the bf where she is. She's a grown woman and she made her choices. Find some resources for her but do not let her stay with you even for a night. She will take advantage of you.
"How tall are you? 110 is tiny. *Tiny!* While I can appreciate his honesty, fuck this guy. He cares more about having some hot girl on his arm than he does about you. You can find someone who loves you for you. If you do want to change your appearance and work on makeup, etc.- awesome! But don't do it because some tool bag told you too."
"She has made meatloaf before, and I have pretended to like it. haha"
"To all the children/younger boys here: having a yeast infection does not mean one has poor hygeine. It just means one has a yeast infection. (Basing my armchair diagnosis on symptoms reported by OP in comments.)

One treats a yeast infection, which can be recurring for certain individuals due to genetics and vaginal PH imbalance, by purchasing forcibly expensive OTC kits at the drugstore that include suppositories that one must insert in her vagina for one to seven days at a time, depending on how much said woman is willing or unwilling to pay for the kit.

Granted, she probably should have mentioned the fact that she was experiencing one at the time--especially if you attempted to unknowingly go down on her--but she was mostly drunk and embarrassed (possibly she has recurring yeast infections, which are not due to ""poor hygeine' but candida overgrowth and PH imbalance/bad bacteria surplus) and therefore didn't say anything. 

All that said...her behavior following all that is crazy/sad. Do not have sex again; wait a bit to see how things progress? This is a difficult situation due to her seemingly delicate mental state..."
he can pretend this never happened if he never sees the boyfriends face again and that his little girl is still his little girl
Good idea! I already booked a spa day for me and my best friend :)
"Honestly, it sounds like a platonic (or hell, maybe not platonic) version of crush jitters to me. Like how when people are inexperienced they get very socially awkward around crushes. But if it's to this level, that's no good and yeah, he probably does have some therapy he needs to do."
Run away from this mess before you get this girl pregnant 
"Yeah I've lived most of my life in Europe and every one of those meals described sounds like a half assed side dish. I don't know of any country where every meal consists only of a ton of bread and a vegetable side dish with no flavor. Poor OP, this is not normal at all"
"My dad did this to me. That's why I had to point it out. Driving was the worst. He treated me like I was going to be a shitty driver just because I'm a girl. Jokes on him, my brother is the worst driver in our family. 

Also, how is the rest of your relationship. Is he pulling his weight around the house? Does he expect you to do most of the childcare when baby comes? Has he started preparing to be a dad? Has he read any books on how to care for a baby? "
"Oh, and for the love of god, do not EVER have sex with this woman again. If she's faking a pregnancy, she'll try the old ""we don't need protection, you can't knock me up twice"" bullshit, and then actually get pregnant."
"&gt; I don't know what to do right now.

Tell him if he doesn't pay up. you're filing a claim in small claims court."
"
&gt;
&gt;Let me also add, I did cheat on him about a year ago, and we did go to counseling. And there may be distrust there on his part.
&gt;
THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THE MAIN POST. your husband obviously does not trust you. ya'll need to go back to therapy together. 
"
"Yeah, OP, you think about this stuff because your mom poured her bile in your ear when she was at her lowest point, and it's scarred you. So you internalized all that garbage, and think you're only desirable for your youth and looks. But you know those things are temporary, and since you're convinced deep down that that's all your good for, you know it will end and then you'll be undesirable. So it all feeds on itself and ties you in knots. You need to break out of this thought spiral and develop your confidence and self worth, so you'll know you're worthwhile and valuable regardless of your shallow appearance. "
"After 10 years, you just know. Since you do not know, that is your answer. 

Let. Her. Go. 

You are keeping her because you're selfish. You like the relationship, but you clearly know it is not what she wants. And you have no intention of ever giving her what she wants. Let her go. Do the right thing. Let her find someone who will love her and marry her. "
"Plan B is less effective for some women (due to weight, ovulation, etc) so I would highly recommend looking into getting a prescription for Ella. Ella is more effective for a longer period, not affected by ovulation, and covers a high weight range of women. It should be covered thru your insurance as well. "
There is actually no evidence to support this.
Haha what??? After the wedding you add the wedding band and wear them together as a set.
"Roflmao. Dude, you are dating both of these girls. If it isn't obvious to you after this update I just don't know what else to say."
"I am feeling this. I comments earlier on starting a dialogue, but I'm hearing about a relationship full of arguments limited contact and he is often unavailable because of how he chooses to spend his downtime without her. 

OP I have the feeling there is more buried here. Is he willing to listen? It is purely bad communication? Or is it that has doesn't like to listen? "
"&gt; On the note of blood is thicker than water, the whole saying is ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"" or something similar. 

As noted by others ITT that's not the original or whole meaning. The ""blood of the covenant"" line was invented in the 1980's, whereas it's been used in its ""family first"" meaning for over a thousand years."
"I agree! As long as she's respectful, nice and wears appropriate (no cleavage) clothing, I think it'll be fine. "
"Yeah, I suppose I have text conversations and if I delete him as a contact it'll show his phone number so there's no doubt its him "
"Your parents sound like trash people. 
OP, PLEASE keep the kids. Just now there will be two kids instead of three and they're 16 so they don't need as much hands-on parenting from David anymore. Set aside date nights for you and David and marry that wonderful amazing person immediately. "
"Actions speak louder than words. You can say all you want to, but they won't believe it until you step on the gas pedal. Send them an email before your meeting. Read my comment above."
"Oh yes nobody is the boss of my GF!

I'm getting scared that when we travel together, I'll be the one that can't keep up. 

Like we're doing extreme sports but's maybe one thing for the whole day and then chill- my GF is doing extreme tourism lol!"
"Jocasta = Oedipus' mom 
Jacosta = Jim Acosta's gamertag, I assume

Especially since the wedding is inherently about the people getting married... wtf. 
"Is he living with his parents because he chooses to or because he has to? That's the difference.

This might be a can of worms with a guy who can't say no to his parents and relies on them to cook him dinner. Or this might just be a guy who lives with roommates who happen to be his parents."
"Or how about after he's done, he watches the kid so she can exercise too or something?"
Chuck Tingle is a _saint_ and no one can convince me otherwise. :P
"Calm down or you're gonna end up with a miserable wife who resents you. You're not entitled to her body just because you're married, and she's probably nervous or scared. What have you really done to romance or seduce her? To turn her on, make her comfortable? She's not a robot. "
"You need to pretend you're not married. Seriously, go on dates, kiss, cuddle, hold hands, advance in this relationship as though you aren't married and things will progress naturally."
I don’t know I wonder if they lived together or what?  Are they truly broken up?  Does she know about you or has she met you?  It doesn’t seem like you can get a straight answer from him.  Also how did he respond to your messages you sent?  He seems to completely disregard your feelings.  Is this worth it really? 
1 million times this. I wish I could upvote you more for this reply you golden angel.
Sounds like you’ve got a good one OP.
"&gt; acts white

???  I'm betting that he's confusing middle class with white.  I'm white and my family was poor and we lived in communities with black people.  I still have a tendency to say what I think while some managers look at me like I forgot to put my pants and underwear on before coming to work.  I've worked with black upper managers who were raised in educated, middle class families and they have more in common with the white managers than I do.

I've heard this term before ""people of color"".  It's sad that your husband is actually buying into racism (which is meant to keep us all divided, by the way) by not allying himself with other people who aren't white either, while denigrating THEIR culture and history.  Maybe it's time for you to do some teaching and him to do some learning.  Maybe you could get him a copy of some books like ""Las Venas Abiertas de América Latina"".  He sounds ignorant of a lot of history beyond his specialty."
"The tone of the voice reading it listing all the positives as if an after effect. I know because that’s exactly how I would talk describing my ex. But I full on knew he was seeing someone else when I wasn’t conveniently right next to him. It was very obvious to me his “friend” was also infatuated with him. They bonded over knowing he and I were in a rough spot. It is so complicated and sad because he said he loved me and slept with me every day when we were together. I now know how important it is to communicate better with partners. OP, this man does not respect you. Don’t respect this behavior. He is playing you. "
"It's the lack of proof, coupled with the fact that your dad and stepmom never liked your husband, and might have poisoned your step-sister against him. Was she also threatening not to come to the wedding? Do you think she's capable of making this up?"
"This is AWFUL. You are awful. You've been leading this poor woman on for 10 GODDAMN YEARS. You have never wanted to commit to her, and you don't even like her very much, but you've kept stringing her along because it's comfortable? This is abominably selfish. Break up with her and let her find someone who actually wants to be with her. "
"Is your credit union part of a co-op? If so, you can deposit at any affiliated atm."
"Why would a different stone in a ring given to her by the man who loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her be considered ""fake""? The point of an engagement ring is a symbol of the love and commitment between two people. 

Snubbing anything but a 20k diamond ring is ridiculous and incredibly superficial."
"I don’t understand why people are giving you so much shit. I’m 100% in agreement with you. She’s not a tenant, she needs to leave when he leaves. 

If you’ve talked to him and it hasn’t helped, I would approach her directly. “Listen, Name. You cannot be here of Roommate isn’t here. You need to head out.”"
"&gt;He got mad when he finished reading the two links-asked if I was asking to break up, said he's had this issue of not helping and exes feeling underappreciated before.

Translation:  I won't change, you can't make me.  

Your move."
Yeah this is super gross and I would be extremely turned off too. I’d also be annoyed if I did all that for a partner and they didnt thank me. Probably best to just move on from him. 
"Your wife assaulted a child.  She chose to go down to where they were playing, and then responded with violence to a CHILD, and is now lying.  Your wife is disgusting.  I'm sorry, but she this.  This is worse than someone who kicks a puppy out of their way.

You need to take a good, hard look at the vicious, horrible nature of the woman you married.  How she strong-armed you into being child free, how she has isolated you from your family, and how she has turned her personal preference to not have kids into a vendetta against small, innocent little people.  And now, she has violently assaulted one.

I hope to hell we read an update where you have divorced her and reunited with your family, apologizing profusely for not immediately going and telling your sister what your monster wife did."
"&gt;Her flight arrives in the middle of the day, so I already have to plan to leave work, let her in, and then head back. It's a minor inconvenience, but it's still irritating.

Nnnnnno you don't. You stay at work, and she comes to your office to pick keys up, and then stays at your place to let you in at YOUR convenience. Or, she kills time in a coffee shop until you can meet with her to let her in. 

Regarding staying an EXTRA 5 days when you're going to be going away, I definitely find that an unreasonable ask on her part. That is wayy too much time to have a house guest. The fact that she doesn't make as much money as you doesn't entitle her to use your space like it was her own. It's a tough conversation to have, but given that her request was so unreasonable you really shouldn't feel bad about it. 

""Friend, I'm happy to host you at my place between X and X day, but since I'm leaving for my own vacation, you're going to have to find different accommodations for those nights after I'm gone. I personally don't want people staying in my place when I'm not there. See you in December!"""
"""Stop singing or I will go home.""

And then follow through. "
"speaking of cheating if you've had multiple partners before marriage.

I do feel that if someone ever only had one sex partner their whole life, the higher it is for one to have that ""am I missing out?"" question and wanting to have sex with other people just to see how it is, especially when the opportunity arises."
"You're right, it isn't her fault.  But you can't really spend the next 50 years sacrificing your mental health to try to keep her going.  

You need to care enough about yourself to make yourself a priority over your wife.  It's probably time for you to realize that nothing you've done has truly been able to help her.  You can't solve her problems.  Maybe it's time to let her go."
"Ask her what she expects from you. You already said you'd spend Saturday with her, so ask if you expects you to just sit home alone on Friday instead of being with your friends? Maybe mention Friday is a ""guys"" night. There is absolutely nothing wrong from having some time with your friends away from her, it's actually healthy for the relationship.

If she can't understand that, or be reasoned with, you need to have a more serious conversation. "
"&gt; “Yeaaaah, I don’t think I’m ok with that.” His reply was, “Then this is your chance to leave.”

Okay, so he literally is telling you what to do. Leave, because that's what's going to end up happening.


&gt; At the same time, he told me that he doesn’t expect his partner to handle this - his brother, his responsibility so to speak. He also said that wouldn’t be in a relationship if he thought this responsibility would intrude greatly on it.


On the other hand, this is an absolutely moronic thing for him to say. If he thinks he's going to find some magical relationship where he's able to live with his SO and brother and not have his SO involved in care for his brother *at all,* then he's a little crazy. 



I don't think he's quite come to terms with the level of care he's going to need for his brother...... OP, you know you don't want this, so you might as well head out."
"It's different for different families.  This might be a Mexican thing, but in my family we welcome anyone who wants to show up, so long as they bring something to eat or drink.  To use Christmas as an example, at the big Cmas Eve party, it could be our branch of the family (stemming from grandma/grandpa down), plus other branches (our grandparents' brothers/sisters families), plus people from our SO's families, plus assorted friends.  If the kids want to bring their bf/gf, no problem.  My daughter in particular has a good friend from high school whose dad passed away a few years ago, and has no other family in the area.  We don't see a whole lot of her throughout the year, but come Cmas Eve she arrives at our house with her overnight bag and her stocking, goes with us to the party, spends the night and Cmas Day with us.  There could be anywhere from 50-100 people inside and outside the house, which is why everyone has to bring something!  But it's unthinkable for us to allow someone to spend it alone (barring illness or their personal preference).  

In the past I've been with some people where the holidays were literally just the mom and dad, couple of siblings, maybe a couple of kids running around, and that's it.  They just wanted to keep it simple, just with the closest family, Mom cooked all the food herself.  And that's also valid.  It's not for me ;) but I can see the merit in the ""no muss no fuss"" approach as well.  "
You should be able to easily solve this through communication. Why are you so hesitant to bring this up?
"If he respected and loved you he would have tried *anything* rather than one you 20k.  He'd have sold his ass down the docks if necessary, washed windows, mowed lawns, anything. But nope. He is perfectly happy letting you subsidise him. Because he's just not that respectful or loving towards you.


 
So, don't give him an ultimatum, kick him out.

Oh and you are never seeing that 20k again. All you can do is stop it before it is 30k.
"
I kind of agree with whoever said to put “From Santa” on the gifts. Most (if not all) of the kids will know the gifts are actually from you but your ridiculously childish mother will feel included. I grew up with a single mother and had a lot of gifts “From Santa” at various households into adulthood. It alleviates the pressure of sincerely thanking one person for an iPod and another for an Old Navy sweater. You can’t change your mother’s behavior but that shouldn’t mean the kids miss out.
"He says he loses his shit around people he feels to be superior than him. So he’s only nice to lowly humans? I know he says he admires him, but it sounds like some deep seated jealousy issues mixed with resentment. All in all, way more complex than anyone here can unpack"
Any positive relationship is allowed in this thread :)
"The wife going nuts and off the rails is probably exactly why the kids kept it secret, they knew their mother would react this way."
"&gt; Politics really have no place in a relationship

This makes no sense. Politics are an expression of one's values/morals."
That’s the bait. If he were a jerk all the time you’d just leave and he knows it. All the niceness “buys” him the leeway to be a jerk the other times. 
"There is a way more productive way to say that.

""Hey girlfriend, I understand that my roommate allows you to stay here while he's gone. I really am not comfortable with this arrangement. First, he would be in violation of his lease if you were to stay more than 2x/week. Second, I'm in an extremely challenging course right now and I really need my space. Please make other arrangements."""
"Apologize to your sister. Break up with your boyfriend, he’s to old for you. Though if you ever decide to meet up with him in real life do it in a public place, and do not get in a car with him alone. "
Well if you and other family members hate Mary-Kate then maybe you guys could just all have holiday events at yours or your sister's house and not invite Mary-Kate. Your mom would be invited only if she doesn't invite Mary-Kate. 
"The guy said something akin to: OP should be cautious because of the recent 'mass hysteria' regarding rape, she shouldn't believe the conviction."
"&gt; Does she have a business plan?

damn, I just typed a long-ass reply without checking comments first. "
"&gt;every time I forgive her I tell her it's her last warning

yeah, you basically taught her that your ultimatums mean nothing and that she can do this forever without consequences

she loves to be this way. you hate her being this way. your relationship is doomed and is hurting your study

Nothing on earth will make her stop this. All you can do is remove yourself from it but dumping her. Yes, it will suck. But if you stay it will suck worse.  Trust me, 30 year old you is remembering how long you put up with this inappropriate GF and kicking himself in the nuts."
"Or  we can say OP dodged the freight train that would have hit her, dragging her a couple miles, only then to be shot by a passing citizen out of humane intentions. Healthy decision OP!!!"
"Wouldn't the driver be more convenient? S/he sped up and hit him, otherwise they would've been fine. She's blaming her kid for a third party intentionally hitting his brother/her other kid."
"I dont understand why people are crucifying OP for the actions of a child. A child should never be held to the same standards as adults, his actions were abhorrent, BUT kids cant control their emotions or even understand things the way adults do. A 12 year old put in an abusive situation will not have the resources or knowledge to get out of it like an adult. I dont think he did anything wrong, I think his mother and father failed him, I think the adults in his life failed him, I dont think he should have even gone to jail for it. The adult he is now is not the kid he used to be. Theres a reason that crimes committed as a child dont follow you into adulthood. If theres ever a time when a person changes its from when theyre children to adults. "
"I think the professional will end up ""being on your side,"" and he'll stop going. Be prepared for that since he thinks it's ok for your mom to be terrible to you and you should suck it up for him. "

"He had ample opportunities to be honest with OP - why didn't he bring up the pictures and trust fall out from that on their road trip?  He has plenty of time to talk. But it sure seems like he's not talking about the difficulties they need to confront for their relationship to survive. If he fucked up, why is the responsibility on OP to hold his hand into being a faithful partner?

She's not treating him like garbage. She's looking out for herself. You sound like you are performing mental gymnastics to try to make OP the bad guy. "
"I dont wanna rock the boat, but I think i deserve to be with someone who sees me the same way I see them,  like no one can hold a candle to me. I guess when I found out he didn't see me to that magnitude it shattered this image I had of him and our relationship and it all went down the toilet. 

I'm a little ridiculous though, so take what I said with a grain of salt. I hope your SO makes you happy, and i hope he never ever ever does that shitty thing again. "
I’m childfree and I completely agree. Life is too short to waste with crappy people. Your wife is unfortunately a crappy person. 
"I know I'm just a stranger on the internet but I feel weirdly proud of you for recognizing all of this. It is sadly really common for a lot of us to seek out partners whose dysfunctions are familiar because they remind us of patterns from our fucked up childhoods. Your subconscious wants to re-enact all the painful shit from your childhood with the hope of getting a better ending, ie, unconditional love. You need therapy, you need time alone to learn to care for yourself, you need to be cautious in the future when you date again so you don't end up repeating the same patterns.
 
What you don't need is to stay married to a narcissist who is set on burning your life to the ground. A simple ""I am divorcing my wife. What she did and said was completely unhinged, and it was the last straw. I'm so sorry you guys had to be dragged into her craziness"" email will probably start to smooth things over with your friends. Chances are, people have noticed she isn't a nice person and will be supportive if you leave her. Worst case scenario is that you lose your job and have to start over, but it will be much easier to do that when you're not living with this crazy, toxic drama."
"OK, you two have not known each other NEARLY long enough to get married. He's telling you this

&gt;he hadn't really thought about that yet.

because he's not brave enough to tell you that this is about your relationship specifically."
"I think you need an actual plan of action to stop supporting your family. If you are not rich you can't really support other adults.

What social welfare programs and utility discounts does your household qualify for without your income?

As someone who grew up poor: what kind of cable packages or overkill data plans does your household have? (I have and do go without in order to subsist on low income).

Why can't your sister support herself through nursing school? Many people make it work without an older sister to pay rent.


It sounds like your boyfriend isn't a secure breadwinner and he needs to keep a total firewall between himself and your financial situation. I totally support him in that.


If your boyfriend is low income I would advise him only to enter 50/50 living arrangements. And you personally would be put at risk placing all of your eggs into his basket in regards to your living quarters. "
"It's slowly grinding me down honestly, I didn't realize so many people would rather be treated like shit than say no"
"no, now he wants a new 19 year old to entertain him. OP I'm sorry but you were never a partner to him, you were a ***toy***."
"My exact thoughts. 

OP please leave him, grown adults who idolize virginity like the way he does is absolutely vile. "
"First off, you did the right thing getting him to a hospital. You are already helping him more than you may realize, and he's honestly in the best place he can be right now. His situation is really above what any of us can offer advice on, and the best thing to do may be to talk to his doctors for advice and guidance. That said, if this all feels like too much for you, you have no obligation to stay through it. Your own health is important and you need to do what is best for you. There may be guilt if you decide to end things with him, but where he is at now can help deal with it."
"&gt;Can you reduce your work time, so that you work less hours per week?

Be honest: would you ask a man if he could reduce his work hours so he could better take care of cleaning?

"
"Appearances matter. 

This isn't new, and it's not going to change. You've changed your appearance, and are being treated differently because of it. It seems like your upset because you think this is how you should have been treated even while you were obese. A view I'm more sympathetic to when it involves your family, and not random people. 

I think the first thing you should consider is how much of this behavior is being done unconsciously on the part of your family, and friends. I'm not going to say all of it, but is it unreasonable to assume that some of it is? 

Another thing you need to ask yourself is what exactly do you want?

Do you want to go back to how things used to be? Would it make you happier if your family started treating you again like they did before, and your social life was non-existent? 

In an ideal world people wouldn't be judged or treated differently based on appearance. Unfortunately we don't live in a remotely ideal world."
He was but not about the lying. He doesn’t think he lies even though he obviously does. It’s like his lies morph into the truth for him and if he admitted he lied about one thing it would spiral and spiral. He would say he knows he “lied in the past” but he’s not like that anymore. Yes he is. He lies to me constantly still but since we’re not married I just dgaf. 
"Being friendly and helpful to neighbors is great and all, but there's got to be some recognition/thanks. I take care of my neighbor's pets when they're away, and they take care of mine when I'm away -- if it were a situation where I was being effectively told by my neighbor to watch their pets, I'd tell them they're out of line.

Don't get shot, but stand up for yourself."
"STAND, SIT, WHO CARES?????

CLEAN UR PEE"
"Also if the baby is young, hormones are probably all over the place.  

I give a lot of leeway for new parents, the lack of sleep fucks with them seriously badly.  

And if the baby is really young, it's probably not quite able to sleep through noise steadily yet - give it a few months and then go back to normal stuff.  

Though yes, fuck OP's husband for doing this end round around her.  That's just - ugh."
"Or if he doesn’t break up, he’ll continue to cheat, knowing he’ll always have OP at home waiting for him because she didn’t break up when she found out about six women he’s been with. "
She definitely knows how I feel about him. I gave her specific examples of the abuse and she just brushed it under the rug. Im worried if i bring it up again she'll pull even further away from me.
"Honestly this is really fucked up. I’m siding with you’re mother. Break up with him.

He upset you by being racist and anti-Semitic and then didn’t even really apologize. Saying “I’m sorry if I upset you” is not the same as saying “I’m sorry for what I did.” He’s putting the pressure on you to forgive him and framing it as if you are the unreasonable one. 

It’s also really really unlikely that this is the first time he’s made these jokes - he just hasn’t done it in front of you before. "
"I would not underestimate the entitlement some people have regarding other people's decisions. Especially keeping your name or even worse a husband taking a wife's name can get some pretty strong reactions. And it's so easy to say ""I forgot"" or ""that's how I was taught to adress cards"".

I am not saying that people always do that to passive aggressively voice their diasagreement, but I am sure sometimes they do."
"While I think your parents are hypocrites and sexist in their mindset, you did not commit an accident here. And frankly, I hope she does tell them because there is literally no reason why you, a 16 year old minor, should be secretly seen a grown 20 year old and your parents SHOULD interfere.  "
"To answer your second paragraph, honestly I feel like we've tried so much to help him. Out of pocket inpatient treatment at a very exclusive facility killed all of his savings and a significant portion of mine so just from a financial perspective I don't know how much more we can do.  I need him to just help to start, make dinner, put even a marginal amount of effort into fixing up this house and finish a single project, do laundry, go shopping, don't cry at me when uber eats gets his McDonald's order wrong or his therapist gets angry at him because he doesn't do his journaling, anything would be start. "
"Dude, run far far away. This will only get worse if you move in together. What a psycho. No normal girlfriend keeps notebooks of women you mention. No normal girlfriend makes you exhausted of going through the same questions day after day. I'm going through the same thing with my boyfriend (though he doesn't want constant communication), he demands I tell him about my day, which I'm happy to do, and then grills me about every guy I mention. Even if it's names I mentioned before, ""Who is x??? What is his relation to you???"" It's completely exhausting and makes me not want to tell him about my day because I know it will lead to a fight EVERY NIGHT.

I'm working on ending it with him after my finals are over."
"I like written stuff, because then people can be very clear about intent. But ugh, sheldon. do not want. "
"Thank you for being so understanding! She had a perfectly valid reason for not responding, and in this world of constant communication I can understand saying she didn't see the messages. That seems to be the pat response for situations like this because it's easy and people generally don't question it.  

By actually talking to her about it you probably deepened your friendship in the end. Good job communicating!"
"Yeah. It’s really weird for someone who has two children to be “childfree”. Like, if he thinks folks shouldn’t have kids what makes him and his partner so special? "
And I would add I know a lot of Italian-Americans who would be equally horrified.
"She wasn't just a kid. She was an abuse survivor. I don't think that excuses the bullying, but it does make it a bit more understandable."
"Please please please leave. He *chokes* you. 

If you’re in the UK, please look into the Freedom Program. You’re accepting abuse as normal, he’s really done a number on you. "
"Neither parent should be coerced into having a kid unless they are ready and agree to it

Dude sounds like a complete scumbag for doing that. Dump his ass, that is COMPLETELY unacceptable. "
"In many places, that is considered sex without consent...and that's sexual assault or rape.  What he did is SO incredibly wrong and it is most likely criminal where you live.  I'm so sorry OP, you didn't do anything wrong and you are well within your rights to feel so upset.

Please consider leaving him.  He has just shown you that he does not care ONE BIT for your consent, your bodily autonomy, or your health.  He put you at risk of pregnancy, abortion, complications, and all other kinds of things.  This is a horrible horrible man and you need to be away from him as soon as possible."
"&gt; I'll admit I'm spoiled for attention because that's what I've always gotten from him.

The people most at fault here are your parents, for putting in you the spot in the first place - for making you have to choose between fiance and siblings

What IS their excuse for their appalling negligence?"
"You keep repeating that you're not afraid of him and I don't know if you're trying to convince us or yourself. I don't want to scare you but I definitely think that you should be afraid of this man. 

His abusive behavior is only escalating and at this point neither your nor us can know where it'll stop. 

Honestly, I felt knots in my stomach reading your post. He's humiliated you, threatened you, removed your freedom to leave a place and he even seriously could have endangered your physical integrity with his car stunt. I'd be very worried in your place. I urge you to seek help to remove yourself from this situation, from what you've told, it's not going to get better.

Look, even if you still maintain that you're not scarred but just bitter toward him, is it the life you really dreamed about when you married this man? Did you envision yourself a 22 bitter yo in a violent marriage to an unstable man? 

You deserve way better, you don't need him contrarily to what he's certainly told you. 
Just imagine a calm happy life without someone forcing you to do things against your wishes or berating you for something as simple and innocent as falling asleep or for spilling wine in your own freaking home. Doesn't it sound enticing?

You're so young, you should be joyous and carefree, you deserve it and you can have it!

If you decide to leave this monster, please be careful, I'm thinking he won't take too kindly to your desire to remove yourself from this marriage. Protect yourself and be safe."

"Yeah, he really needs *not to have a gun* based on what you've told us, OP. Will it probably be okay, yes. Is that also the basic personality profile of some family annihilators? Also yes. 

It's deeply unsafe to have a gun around (1)  young children and (2) a volatile personality with mental health issues. No stigma implied: I have MH problems myself and don't believe I should ever have access to a gun either."
"I have even told him how he treated her and kept her things was horrible, but it came back around and I should have realized if he did it to her he'd do it to me."

I think I'd stop bending quite so far backwards after this. 
"Yup ""I'm not attracted to X race"" just doesn't pass the *Is It Racist* smell test at all. You don't have to go out of your way to date every race out there, but if all the attraction/compatibility boxes are checked, you're getting close to a person, and when they ask you out, your only basis for denial is their race... you're racist af. Now, you're perfectly entitled to turn them down for whatever reason, but then you need to get real comfortable and honest with your racism, 'cause that's what it was."

"Nah all generations are made up of man babies.  It's just more obvious now.  I think it's a combination of a ubiquitous global network for people to share stories and realise how ridiculous this all is.   That plus women being more in the workforce means they are less likely to take the excuse of ""being tired from work"" as the reason why they have to do all house maintenance and emotional labour. 

All that aside,  the amount of learned helplessness boys and men are taught is horrible.  Like it isn't normal for women to leave their childhood homes not knowing how to do laundry or cook meals or run a household.  But it is for men and the aftermath is things like this where full grown adult men are still unable to even do 50% of the chores. "
"It's not just household and cleaning. Boys are, by their parents, held to a lower standard. Or rather, less is expected of them. I saw this clearly when I taught: statistically, the girls would have done their homework and turned in their assignments more than the boys. Note, this says nothing about the level of the assignment or how smart they are - but just that, doing the work, doing what is expected of 16 year olds in ""high school"", the girls do it. The boys don't. They simply care less, and I can only guess it's due to the parents."

"Morally, you aren’t doing anything wrong, at least not that I can see. You can definitely just use him for sex if that’s working for you. He doesn’t seem to mind.

"Why are you so insistent that unmarried people don't have to deal with legalities? Did you buy a house? Co-own a car? Buy furniture together? Have kids?

"&gt; Some people need to be shamed for them to wake up to their issues

But how is it helpful? So OP says, ""you're right, maybe we shouldn't have had a kid we couldn't afford."" Now what? What can they do with that information? Literally nothing. If you want to give them advice on reworking their budget to make it more affordable, then do that. If you want to tell them they're spending too much on food, then do that. If you want to tell them that her health issues are a problem, then do that. But asking them why they made a decision four years ago that they can't undo is *not helpful.* "

Your friends sound like some awfully close-minded people. They’re acting like you’re having an affair with a married man and trying to convince them you won’t get hurt. 

I’d not only tell them to back off, I’d be reassessing whether these people actually deserve a place in my life - especially after the little “intervention” episode.

"I'm going to say this in a  language I would have listened to when I was your age.

"You describe yourself as a peacemaker, but that's not what you're doing at all. You're passively sitting on the sidelines while your stepmom is shitty to your wife, not having her back, and then expecting your wife's *totally justified* anger toward your stepmother to magically blow over so you don't have to get your hands dirty and everyone is happy.

It's not going to happen, and since the problem is with your family, you're the one who needs to intervene. You can begin by apologizing to your wife for letting your stepmother steamroll all over her in her home, and then disrespect her on social media. Then you can lay down some hard boundaries with your stepmom about what sort of treatment of your wife you will and won't tolerate.

"Here is my perspective:

He isn't including you in a meaningful partnership of any kind. He is sole owner of the house, the mortgage, and both cars. He has determined he is king of the grocery list and the thermostat and any deviation from his decree will have to be paid for by you. He wants you to take out loans to have a legal stake in *the home you two share as a married couple.*

This is about control. I am not a lawyer but my opinion is that giving him further financial control over your marriage will be directly harmful to you. He's trying to make this about assets and money and he's not making it about *marriage.* It sounds like you really love him and you're trying to make your own way here, which is admirable. But a loving partner extends a hand so that their wife will be on equal footing; your husband is coldly looking down on you from on high and monitoring how often you grab his platform to help give yourself a boost. This isn't what I want for your marriage to look like, internet stranger.

"First off, what your wife is doing is rape. Tell her no. Yes you should go to the police about rape. Since you're a guy, I would see if you can somehow gather evidence that she's coercing you into sex (try and record her when she's doing it or something). Make it a plan to go to a divorce lawyer the day you turn 18 if going to the police doesn't help."
"I just want to say your mother is insane.

This is one of the things you just DON'T DO to people - force them to change all their plans, including work and exams (you know, your fucking adult life and future career), for the sake of a holiday!

Holidays, especially big ones like this, have to be planned well in advance and the planning needs to include all the participants.

Obviously, your mother doesn't think you are an adult with a full set of adult responsibilities :/

Time to move out. "
"Pro tip for next time - never ask for a day off to go to an interview. Email the night before to say you got sick/have a personal emergency.

Even though the store is closing, your boss will ALWAYS take it personally if you ask for a day off for an interview. Because they view it as ""this job is less valuable"".

I used to feel guilty about it too. But you have to look out for YOUR best interests first. The fact that she knows youll be out of a job within a month and denied your request is absurd. 

Go to the meet and greet. Good luck! "
"This is a great response and 100% true. As the poster mentioned, how can you consider it anything other than abuse if he literally treats you worse than a dog?? GTFO now!!"
"""it's a sweatshirt, not a rimjob""

Am I doing this right?"
You're a great dog owner! I have a puppy with similar issues (she's lab/aussie/border collie) and I'm nervous bringing her around kids. It sounds like you've created a great dog and your family just doesn't understand the challenges of an energetic dog. I agree with /u/fox-comet about framing it around Bella's needs. 
"Wow, this was a really nice response. I agree with   u/2beagles !"
Why do her actions matter at all? He's acting like he lives in some place where he has no control over the front door. It's very simple to prevent your ex from staying over. You just don't let them in.
And now she's afraid she's going to gain weight if she eats biscuits. This is not a good situation.
"OP, your husband overstepped when he said this to his nephew. It's potentially a very damaging thing to say to a young boy. For the little boy's sake, you need to muster up your courage and talk to his mother. "
"Is this a reference to something? Do I wanna know? (Yes, I do.)"
You sounds like a real catch. 
"One important lesson I learned after a 15 year marriage and subsequent divorce...being right is often not right. In fact it can be downright destructive sometimes. It sucks, yea."
Her *whole life* is dedicated to essentially stalking OP to ensure he's not cheating. 
I'm not sure why other posters are saying $10k isn't a big deal. It is a big deal. And it's the second $10k in 2 years time. That means he's gone $20k beyond your budgeted lifestyle. This is a massive breach of trust in my opinion. I would not be okay with this. 
"Where's your pride, man! Just end that. You put up with that, she'll walk all over you forever."
He actually tagged OP in his 'divorce photo album' though. Her friends were being kind by warning her.
"Right after I left their place I wish I told her to check his phone. I wonder if he put it on his laptop or something is the only thing. He isn't a dumb person, so I really feel like he would hide them somewhere. Thank you so much for your response!"
"You realize he's abusive, right?

There are resources out there for abused women to obtain legal aid for no or low cost. 

And it's not just threatened physical abuse (breaking things, punching things in anger) or emotional abuse, it's economic abuse too:

&gt;Economic abuse in a domestic situation may involve:

* preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, such as restricting their ability to find employment, maintain or advance their careers, and acquire assets
* preventing the victim from obtaining education
* spend victim's money without his or her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim's savings to limit available resources
* exploiting economic resources of the victim"
"This is really amazing advice. You are so much more than just a virgin, you are a human! Sex is a natural, human urge! Also, you'll be married to the person you love and sharing such a special and magical moment!!"
"
I think you have to prepare for the possibility that Erin doesn't immediately side with OP, whether or not Ryan is there. I think OP included all this background about Erin's bad relationship in the past, her intensity in this relationship, because she's worried that Erin won't want to believe this. And I don't think Erin will immediately catch out Ryan's reaction as incriminating when she's shocked herself and Ryan has doubtlessly been rehearsing his denial, this isn't The Mentalist or whatever. 

I wouldn't tell Erin in Ryan's company. I would focus on communicating honestly with my friend, rather than trying to set up a gotcha moment. Because this isn't TV and you probably won't get the satisfying denoument you want, but you can focus your energy on your friend, on your concern for her safety and your own. Focus on the trust between the two of you, and even if she doesn't immediately believe you completely, the chance of planting an important seed of doubt is greater. "
"I wish mine wasn't diamond. What I know now about diamond industry, I would have rather had an amethyst or something similar. Diamonds are not the end all of rings."
"He also says that 15-20k is 25% of his yearly salary, but he makes 6 figures... Not saying he's outright lying or that the price isn't still absurd but his math kinda sucks or something. "
Jesus man. What are you doing?! She’s abusive in all aspects. Get out of there. 
"Being emotionally shut off doesn't mean you know how to cope in healthy way. 

Also since when is sharing your feelings and concerns for your SO considered volatile? Was it the trying to get him to go to therapy part? Because that's out of concern for him and their relationship. If she was FORCING him to go, that would be another thing. We don't get to see the whole picture, we only get his side of the story. Something tells me we may get a different picture if she were the one posting here. "
"That's not the way 'truth' works but it's irrelevant.

If OP (and you) continue to share your personal 'truths' in such an undiplomatic way, unsurprisingly you will end up with few and poor relationships in your life.

Most people over the age of 8 know that you cannot go around calling people and ideas 'stupid' and maintain relationships. I'm sorry this 'truth' was one you never absorbed."
"I think the ""take care"" is just yanking her chain that he might mean ""bye""; it's kind of a threat, an act of coercion, to get her to comply with his wants.  ""You're not doing what I want, so *see ya*...until three days from now when you cave and call me like always and give in to my demands"""
Can confirm. My husband does this and it's great. He's always on point with gifts and surprises me with things I'd mentioned once and forgotten about. It's a great habit he picked up and I'm very appreciative of it.
"Look, unfortunately it happens. He ticked off every box in the 'how to take advantage of someone' list and through a combination of coercion and ambivalence you had a sexual episode you aren't proud of.

You're young, he knew it and played that. He has likely done this a lot of times because the reality is when people are young and idealistic they can be manipulated by nasty and cynical people like him. It can also be shitty bosses at work or friends manipulating us or whatever, though obviously your experience had an additional upsetting dimension to it.

It is what comes next that matters. Too many people would dwell on this and victim blame *themselves*, figure it is an indication of their worth. And it isn't. It was a mistake and that doesn't mean you are less of a person for it. Because if you convince yourself you are less of a person that means if this happens again you'll just believe you deserve it and submit rather than learning from this and next time putting your foot down. 

I know I seem flippant about the severity of this but I am instead trying to get you to focus on what comes next rather than drowning in hindsight. This is an experience that has really shook you to your core, it's taught you the reality of the predators that can be out there and even how your own crushes can compromise your feelings and actions. Life would hit you with that eventually so just run with it and become stronger on the other side. "
"There are a *lot* of steps between having a conversation about your birthday and being naked, and a million times they could have stopped but didn't. 

You need to reevaluate things. If it were me I'd dump the girlfriend and put the friend on ""probation"". She started it and that's really really shitty. 

I'm sorry. This birthday will not be best but I promise you'll have better ones. 
"
"Definitely sounds like ADHD. Reminds me exactly of my experience in school. It sounds like he definitely enjoys the field he's in and I personally think he should give it another try but he would really need to work on his organizational and motivational skills first. Therapy and medication can help tremendously. I don't think he's a lost cause, but it sounds like he definitely needs some kind of 'push' right now."
"Yup, it will never happen if you don't make the plans. 

In all likelihood, she's doing her own thing so she's not in the way of your plans with your buddies.  And you're missing her because she's off on her own adventures.  You need to physically make the time and plan it out."
"What other adults are in the home? Are you living with her? If so, move out asap! Why the hell haven't you gotten out already, when you know that you personally are contributing to her low priority status?

I'm sorry but you are enabling her and risking the kids' well-being by staying."
"&gt;I wonder if Anna is trying to express to Matt that she's not having fun in hopes of spending more time with him.

100%.

Anna wanted to come before ops gf was invited, and was even going to make Matt miss the whole trip if she couldn't come. Of course she wants to spend this once in a lifetime trip with her boyfriend. Who on earth wants to spend two months going shopping with someone they barely know?

Op, this is all your friend's fault. He broke  the original plan, and with more people this whole trip had the makings of a disaster. Let Matt hang out with Anna. "
"Oh man, we use this at work all the time. Granted, I work in an emergency clinic where wait times vary depending on how busy we are. ""Thank you for being patient and understanding"" ...(not that you had a choice) "
"People say this all the time, but I think it's bullshit. You can control what you like and don't like, you just need to put some time and effort into it. 

I think this notion is an outgrowth of the truth that people do not choose to be gay. It's inherent. But that is not the case with fetishes. You are not born with fetishes, they develop over time and they are controllable.

For example, when you find yourself attracted to something that kills people, at the very least, you should not be indulging that desire by seeking out images of that thing. "
"You're an excellent dog owner and as someone who also spends a solid 1.5-2 hours on exercise each day (I've got a husky, whoo) I understand your need for routine very well.

Have you explained Bella's full routine to them before? ""Her average day consists of waking up at x hour for x walk with x equipment, then x walk at x time"" etc. Tell them that unless they're willing to do all of this, you're not willing to sacrifice your vacation time to make sure she gets her exercise and you'd much rather a professional dog sitter do it for you.

I don't think they actually understand the logistics of being a dog owner yet, and vague ""She needs a lot of exercise"" statements don't really hit home for people until you put it into ""I have to wake up at the buttcrack of dawn to make sure my dog doesn't go insane"" terms.

As for the Christmas issue, if she's not fully crate-trained, can you fit an x pen in the guest room? If she's not an escape artist and you get a tall enough pen, she can have more room to roam and people can still pet her without her getting out."
"This weekend we're celebrating our two year anniversary! My boyfriend has also been gone all week on a work trip and I'm so excited to see him tonight and have a wonderful, relaxing weekend together. Every day I'm so thankful to have him in my life, I love him so much!"
"It sounds like you are also comparing yourself to him a lot. 

I don't think you are being overly sensitive. The most likely situation seems to be that he is being an asshole *and* you are feeling raw and depressed as well and are the less equipped to handle it than usual. My partner can be an abrasive ""tell it like it is"" type as well, and sometimes I have to tell him to back the fuck off, because that approach is not helpful or respectful at a given moment.

You need to tell your partner to back the fuck off. 

You may not know exactly what will help you get back on track, but his current comparison bullshit and putdowns certainly isn't helping. The solutions to your struggles might not be the same as the solutions were for his. You also might not experience some of the luck he did either, where his GPA didn't slow him down. If he can't be supportive, he at least needs to back off."
"I would make a police report right now. Do not meet him ever again. I'm sorry but you need to screen all of your calls. Don't pick up till you know who it is. Block him everywhere and on everything and yes tell all your family and friends and even new friends because he's telling them too, this isn't the time to hold back because this guy is hitting all the deadly buttons so you need to pull out all the stops. By the way your friendship became toxic for you not him, he created this, you may have made a mistake in going against your natural feelings of attraction but he's the one who blew this up. This is completely on him. Good luck. "
"PS:  your BF sounds like a gem... he did the right thing, taking your side of things.  And I commend your respect of his mom.  You obviously don't put yourself above them.  However, your humbling comment is probably accurate to some point.  We could ALL use a little humbling. But your respect for his mom shows, because if you really had no respect, you wouldn't consider it.   Good luck.

Would love to hear the update.

"Also, if she does provide say a photo of a positive pregnancy test do a reverse Google image search. So easy to just get one from online and use that"
"I second this. OP, please don't take this as some kind of attack on you, I'm sure your intentions are very honourable and I know lots of people support sick partners.

But my husband got up in front of 150 people and promised to care for me in sickness and in health. Then when I got seriously ill, he punished me because I wasn't going out of my way to make a fuss of him, I wasn't being sexy, I wasn't going out on dates with him. I was boring and ugly. I couldn't even dress myself, or make a meal, or walk upstairs, nevermind about do all the usual wife stuff. I still tried my best to talk to him, ordered gifts online etc. but it wasn't enough and he was angry at me and punished me constantly with the silent treatment, which he openly admitted was because I was ill. I had to go and stay with my parents at one point because he wouldn't buy or prepare me food and I was too weak. This is a very well liked person with good social skills who thinks of himself as a good person (what I'm trying to say is that he's normal and not some weird monster).

I'm NOT saying that you'll do this, I just want you to be prepared. I don't know how her illness will affect her but chances are she won't be conventionally ""pretty"", she'll do unpleasant things like throw up in public. She probably won't have the strength to make you the centre of her life, because trying to get by day to day when you're that unwell is already impossible.

Mentally prepare yourself for this. Then be a good partner and take care of her. I wish you both all the best."
"&gt; It's all really flattering as I like and respect this guy a lot and enjoy working with him.

It should be off-putting and upsetting that he is carrying on flirtation with you behind the back of his girlfriend.  You two are close to an emotional affair with your flirting, touching, and long glances.  How would his girlfriend feel if she saw you two interacting?  How would your boyfriend feel if he saw it?

Don't be flattered by this.  He isn't a good guy if he is flirting with someone else behind his GF's back, and if you date him, he will probably flirt behind YOUR back as well."
"I'd add on that what you describe could be part of his worldview even if he doesn't consciously realize it. We tend to soak up what we're raised with gradually and subtly all our lives.

So I guess what I mean is even if he'd never say something like oh, she's just a dumb woman, it doesn't mean that idea can't come through in his words and actions in a less overt, more natural sounding way."
"By ""literally everything else"" what do you mean? For some people, the previously mentioned chores are all the chores, spare an occasional vacuuming or dusting. Others do those activities more often, compounded with lawn work, making the bed, window cleaning, etc. which is less frequent.

So what exactly do you do besides the things listed? Because I got the sense, by the phrasing you used, you don't really appreciate the things she is already doing. Cleaning the kitchen and bathroom is WAY more work than taking out the trash. I do both, because I handle 95% of the chores in my home. Taking out the trash is a 30 second thing and then you replace a bag. Cleaning a kitchen and a bathroom involves countertops, mirrors, sinks, toilets, tubs, floors, dishes, etc. You also say she does more of the cooking, and handles her own laundry. Again, you mention setting the table, but that's not so bad when there's only two people to set places for. Also, when you cook, are you cooking for just you or also herself? That makes a big difference, in my opinion.

If you're working more, she should be taking on more of the chores than you, and I'm inclined to believe she already does. You just seem to brush off the acts she does for you. Also, I don't think who is earning more is at all relevant to a chore list. I think hours worked does. If you both worked the same hours and she was working hard at her job, I'd advocate a 50/50 split. So I'm confused as to why you'd mention the money."

"Even if he acted like a Boy Scout and did nothing with the girl, he was still in a car with a barely-legal, insecure girl in a parking lot for five hours behind a warehouse in the darkest hours of the night, and then he acted like an asshole when it was addressed as being what it was: sketchy as fuck. He needs to be dumped, bad. OP doesn't deserve this, especially after having had been cheated on."
"Whether or not it's normal isn't really a useful point.

Was it abusive and completely inappropriate? Yes. Does it happen in a lot of families? Yes, and it's really unreasonable but happens when people don't understand how to communicate effectively.

It's a style of conflict resolution that your mother likely learned from her family. "
"I think if you separate your finances, you will be shocked at how much you can afford."
Did a sexual act without her consent.. that is sexual assault
"Okay, this was a ridiculously bad decision from the get go.

Don't live with your ex, if you do, don't have sex with them, if you do *that*, don't move your fucking FWB into the place with you. 

You were naive to think that this wouldn't hurt your ex or your FWB. 

I strongly suggest you wait out your lease and then distance yourself from both of them. "
"&gt; One day he noticed finally that he had no clean jeans and he went off the god damn deep end. I was pretty sure he was going to sucker punch me. 

Honestly I'm so sorry that he got angry (and you felt like you were endangered) but something about this general situation of ""my mommy-role girlfriend stopped washing my clothes and now I'm going to have a tempter tantrum"" makes me laugh. Like wtf dude you're actually going to yell at your girlfriend because YOU have NO CLEAN JEANS? Just think about how pathetic that looks from an outside perspective. 

Happy you got out. "
"Https only willing to have sex when drunk and he doesn't express attraction to women in general? My first thoight? He's gay. Or asexual. 

Either way, his lack of attraction is no fault of yours. You are not in a sexually compatible relationship though."

"Don't ""call her out on it"". It's very clingy and entitled to think she has to respond to you the same way she responds to others. She doesn't owe you anything.

I've had a friend that would complain about me the same way you're complaining about Amanda. The truth is, there was a reason it took me a long time to respond to her. Her texts are emotionally draining and responding to her requires very long sustained concentration, or else she will quadruple text and not be satisfied. It's also a very one-sided conversation without exception: she rants about her problems and doesn't ask me about anything, or if I do come up in conversation (which is rare), she'll start telling me how to live my life.

I value her, but I need to limit her presence in my life. 

Take a long hard look at your own texting habits and see if maybe there's a reason it's taking her so long to text back. The fact that you even care how long it takes her to text back strikes me as a red flag. You seem to be a bit controlling."
"Imo, the ONLY way to salvage your friendships and job is to divorce your wife. If you stay with her people will think you condone her behavior and/or they'll avoid you to avoid her.

"In my 40+ years, when a women shows me her breasts and lets me lay my head on them as pillows, its has has always been a ""sure thing"" that sex was going to happen. Just my thoughts."
Thank you very much for this comment. I struggle with lying too -- I'm not a pathological liar but I grew up in an emotionally abusive environment and have a strong instinct to lie if I feel vulnerable. The techniques you described sound very helpful.
I did this when I became depressed and had massive anxiety. I would do all of these things to my wife because I felt inadequate and felt the need for pity and had a strong desire to feel loved and she is awesome and showed her love but nothing felt like love. I didn’t love myself. So I would want her to love me more while also pushing her away and trying to prop myself up at her expense. I started taking meds and seeing a therapist and I have done a 180. Maybe try breaching the subject with your husband and see if he is having anxiety or depression in anyway. 
You need to put marriage on the back burner. You obviously don't know this guy as well as you should for such a big decision IMO. I would slam on the brakes if I heard my SO saying some whack shit like that. Because seriously. That's some fucky rationale. 
"&gt; I'm with you on this one. He's had plenty enough chances to change.
&gt; The only compromise I can think of is him paying for a maid service out of his fun money for he's that determined to do chores at all.

I agree, I tried to motivate my ex husband to do this part of the chores he never did even when he was unemployed, I took the extra work related to our kids two, complained a lit he never helped even with a maid to help with the big chores.. he just made less and less...

"That analogy was a bit of a stretch - but don’t worry, I won’t call it yoga. "
"&gt; How is that the case here, honest question?

It is up to you to decide if that is the case in your relationship or not. You sound like you are at the end of your rope with her choosing being a great teacher over the happiness in your marriage. Now she may be happy with your marriage, but it doesn't sound like you are and you should ask yourself if you are willing to continue being second in your wife's life after her vision of herself as super teacher.

I would say your wife is a very admirable person, but not someone who I would want to be in a relationship with. My wife is a little like your wife in that she feels like she isn't doing enough, even when she is doing far more than is truly expected. She works in nursing in pediatric hem/onc. She worked through her MSN/E and DNP while we were married and have 2 daughters. When she went into management she virtually disappeared from trying to make everything perfect that she was involved in at the hospital. My daughters and I got through the limited time we got with her when she worked on her advanced degrees, but we let her know that the way she was treating us at the point after starting in management was unacceptable to us and she got the message and adjusted. It sounds like either you aren't making a strong case to your wife or she is just not receptive to it.

If she is not willing to change her behavior, do you want to live your life feeling neglected or if you have kids, do you want to be a virtual single parent?

"Why is your Husband not on your side? There is no way in hell you should have to arrange your schedule around a neighbour's baby.

If you apologise for this you will be setting the precedent that their needs come before yours. It doesn't matter if it's a baby or a dirty carpet, you take care of your own business when you choose.

Sure you can apologise for how it went if you want to be polite, but don't back down on the issue."
"Yeah, I actually agree. I don’t know how much to hold it against him since he changed his behavior, but that memory certainly makes it harder for me to be interested in sex with him."
You’re not in a relationship anymore. Move out and move on with your life.

"It's normal to ""have a crush"" when you're in a relationship, so long as you don't act out on it. 

Rather than calling it a crush, take the romantic/sexual vibes away from it.  Maybe think of it more as you appreciate that person's personality and individuality, while at the same time recognizing that they're an attractive person, treat them as you would a friend."
"Yep, your wife &amp; everyone else nailed it. If your friend didn’t have inappropriate feelings for you, then she could have assured her husband that she’s the one he’s married to, that she has no intention of cheating on him, &amp; that he has nothing to worry about. No need to involve you. So that definitely seems like she wanted to feel out whether her interest was mutual while making it seem like her husband was driving the whole thing. 

If I were you, I would take this as a sign to step way the hell back from this woman. She has already to some extent dragged you into this. If you don’t want to get more involved or accidentally end up in the midst of a marriage breaking up, now would be a good time to take a break from this friendship. Because, while it sounds like you’re doing nothing wrong on your end, you have no idea what she’s doing (spending too much time looking at your social media, talking about you constantly, texting you while she’s supposed to be spending time with her husband) that you could get dragged into. "
I would start distancing yourself from her. She seems shady and like she's trying to drag you into her marriage problems. 
"Seriously, this guy is so unbelievably tedious.  You know how to show appreciation for a kindness someone has done for you like cook dinner for you every night before you go to school?

I mean seriously??? OP's father has passed away, her mother is a widow of a few years and I imagine the holidays must be especially hard for her, anyone with half a heart should easily understand that but apparently not OP's boyfriend nor his family. 

I'm thinking her boyfriend's family certainly know about the fact that she's lost her father a few years ago and yet they can't understand that it's important for OP to spend at least part of the day with her mom during Christmas? I mean, even if her father was still alive, it would be pretty fucking normal for her to want to be with her family, but it's even more understandable given the circumstances.

OP, I'm seriously disgusted by your boyfriend and his family's behaviors. 
It's so selfish, seriously, i can't even process it. If I was in your shoes I would make two or three things clear as soon as possible with your boyfriend's family because if you don't put a stop to their stupid demands it will only escalate as the years pass and one day, without even realizing it, you'll find yourself with no life of your own, at the beck and call of these people without any support from your partner.

I don't want to just say ""break up"" but how do you move past such warped view of reality."
"Let me get this straight you are married and a man texts you sexually and you still think it’s ok to be friends with this man ? And you do it behind your husbands back ? And then he texts you more sexually and you delete all the texts because you don’t want your husband to be upset? And you are wondering why he’s upset. 

Ya, all evidence is pointing toward you are cheating. Feel like there’s a lot more to this story. You put this all on yourself. If I was your husband I’d be rethinking this marriage. "
"I hate to say it, and I am by no means saying that I agree with this mindset, but if you decide to report it later, it's likely to not be taken seriously and possible even come back to bite you because people will question why you didn't report it immediately and speculate that there was a relationship between you and Crotch Pic Dude and whether you are only reporting at this later time as some sort of revenge. 

Tread carefully."
"I'm not agreeing with the sister's reaction here. 

I have kids myself but I can understand how frustrating it might be to always play second fiddle because of ""grandkids"".

There may have been instances in the past where OP has asked to change plans (not malicious) and she's been thrown out by it.

I see it a lot at work where a lot of parents don't want to work on changes or cutover after business hours because of their kids but get a bit miffed when it's suggested that child free people have important things to do too- but they don't see it as important because OMG children. "
I like your thinking but starting a marriage on dishonesty doesn't sound like the best option. 
"Wow, all it took was knowing some obscure band? That's what your marriage vows were broken over? You allowed yourself to get into a position a married woman should never be in, then it got worse from there. You had control of your actions the entire time, so you need to look inside and find out why it was so easy to betray your husband like that.

Look, it can't be easy having a spouse overseas. But you cheated. Take ownership of it. Tell your husband. Then go from there. But if it was that easy, perhaps you weren't as ready for marriage as you thought you were. "
"Yep. That level of premeditation -- ""How can I hurt this child without leaving visible marks? I don't want people to _know_ I deliberately harm preschoolers"" -- speaks volumes about the wife's character.

I hope OP gives himself the gift of separation and therapy for the holiday season."
Especially not combined.
"You clearly are not attracted to her, don't even sound like you're interested in her at all. Do her a favor and leave. She deserves to be with someone who genuinely likes her. "
"OP I just want to say I was following the nasty comments in the last thread and I have to say you are handling this just perfectly. I do want to add however: is your husband really understanding of how much emotional  turmoil he put you through these past 7 months? I feel like you have been sending over backwards to appease his insecurities, but other than coming to a seemingly mutual understanding of he situation, what is he doing to help assure you that he won't act like this again?

7 months is a long time."
"You are being entirely too soft and coddling to your wife. Not only has she moved into physical abuse territory (which could result in loss of custody), she is causing emotional damage as well. You need to stop coddling her and get her to therapy ASAP. "
"Yeah, especially freshmen year college can still be a lot like High School. Jackie is basically doing everything in her power to make her daughter a social pariah. "
"&gt; If she didn't want to marry me why did she say yes

because...

&gt; Got a somewhat arranged marriage

She doesn't know you well enough yet, stop trying to force it."
Well then you can forget about college for the next 10 or so years at least if your family won’t help.
"Then your life is now effectively over. Have fun as a single mother, abandoned by her BF and shunned by her family, living on welfare in a women's shelter. Wake up. You literally cannot *afford* this belief."
"Wtf? I literally had my first boyfriend at 20 years old, and he was literally the first guy I've ever even kissed, let alone held hands with.

I also know people who got their first boyfriends and girlfriends at 23+ and no one bats an eye at that.

I feel sorry for her for not knowing her first relationship experience is with someone who's secretly a judgemental jerk."
"Ah ok, I've read it now.

This guy is even more of a mess than your original post indicates.  You absolutely need to speak to someone about leaving him, whenever and as soon as you can.  His threats to kill himself (even if they've stopped for now) are emotional terrorism and while I realize you feel guilty about the suicide of your ex, it is still NOT YOUR FAULT when anyone does that.  "
"What exactly did she say to you each night? You haven't given any specific examples, just said she has an ""attitude"". "
Jesus. This was the best answer and it didn't even suggest what he should do 😂😂😂
"She feels that I was put into a situation where I felt that trying to kill a man was the only way to protect her.

She blames herself a lot for this still. She was a emotional wreck after it, but she never seemed angry with me, and I am guessing that a part of her is glad that she did not have to deal with her boyfriend ever again. 

I have tried my best to shift the blame from her to myself in her mind, but that has sadly not worked. "
"Honestly? As a chronically ill person all my life, healthy people just don't think of these things. Like they are aware of your illness but not the impact of it until explicitly explained. 

It's basically able bodied privilege and like all privilege it's small examples that show it up because you wouldn't realise otherwise because you have no need to.

Like people say 'it's only a five minute walk' to me and I have to say 'but today my bones are on fire so a five minute walk is as impossible as you suggesting we go up Mount Everest for cocktails.'

Sometimes like the SIL people are deliberately shitty about this stuff. Other times like the PIL, it's a simple lack of getting the true consequences. Good on the OP for spelling it out."
"How much do you want to do? Are you sure she is who she says she is/where she says she is? Have you ever video chatted? Do you know her address/full name/phone number/social media accounts? Can you look her up and make sure she is real? 

Let's say she is legitimate. She is kind of old to be having her first psychotic break. But she could have had others you don't know about. In that case, she probably has some care around her. You say she's in grad school. Then she will probably be noticed and missed as she gets more symptomatic. Her brother is involved in her life? Other family? They are also likely to notice and intervene. 

So, you can: try to reach out to family. Try to contact her university and ask to speak to the health services department (there is likely to be one) and express concern. If she has expressed any violent ideas or self-harm intentions, you can even call her local police department to request a wellness check. You would likely need a full name and address for this. 

or, you can sit tight and see if she gets in touch. "
"It doesn't matter if he understands your needs. It only matters that he follows the rules. You agreed a max of two nights a week and only when he is there. Enforce that.  Let him know if she is there without him, you will ask her to leave. "
"Oh wow, there's nothing those MLM vultures won't get their claws into. "
... is your husband also 15 years old? 
"I guess I was afraid to admit that I nearly killed someone. It changed the way I see myself, and I don't want her seeing me as some violent creature. 

I'll understand if she never wants to see me again. I messed up big time. "
"Tell her.  If he's doing this stuff with you, odds are he's doing it with other women as well.  

&gt; I'm scared of hurting her.

Think of how hurt she'll be if she continues to think he's ""the one"", and they get even more serious, possibly even married, and *then* she finds out that he's a cheater.  And what if she finds out that you knew all along?  

Sit her down, tell her you have something that you need to show her that you know will upset her, but that you care about her and she needs to see it.  Then show her your entire chat history with him since they started dating, so that she knows you weren't trying to start anything with him, and weren't encouraging him.

If she's hurt by it, it's *him* hurting her, not you.  "
"I agree that the problem here is canceling on her. Traveling with friends is definitely a different experience and he shouldn't have to bring her to every trip he goes to. But it seems to me that he knew that he might have a friend trip coming up and he wouldn't be able to go to both trips so he cancelled on her. 

This is a shitty thing to do and a kind of cowardly move...

Either way I don't agree that she should be invited and the fact that he is going with female friends is completely irrelevant."
"OP if you can't acknowledge to the wife that she is #1 priority and reassure her, as outlined above. That is your red flag that the issue is with you and not her. Your post reads like you might not be willing to admit that you're the territorial one. Wife tried to be reasonable and open to making you a friend and you kind of shat on that."
"Yes, she should definitely collect some proof before contacting the wife and attach whatever she has to the email - things like screenshots of his Tinder profile, screenshots of incriminating texts, especially regarding them booking a hotel room, so the wife can check the dates, look back and match them to whatever excuse he gave about not being home that night, texts from him about only wanting to talk to OP through Snapchat, any flirty or suggestive texts or sexts, any lies he told OP about his life, and, of course, any photos of them together (perhaps with OP’s face blurred or covered). 

Also, in posts about these types of situations, a lot of people recommend that “the other woman” create a new, anonymous email address from which to contact the wife and send the evidence, so that OP can’t be readily identified (except by the cheating husband, and is he really going to name the woman he was cheating with?) and doesn’t get drawn into the inevitable shit storm or slandered in some way. "
"And he will. Girl, you know when to do. You know what to expect. Put a condom on your heart and protect yourself. Dump him now before he has to give back the car and phone so he can't use you for those, also. "
I wish I had this book when my sister passed and my Fiancé was accidentally being very insensitive 😐
"Your boyfriend doesn't respect you. He's treating you like a booty call.

He's fine to meet up with you if it's what he wants, but if he has something better to do he'll blow you off. Does that sound accurate?"
"Barring an error in the online system, she likely will follow what her TA told you.

From the style of your posts and their past criticisms, you kind of trail off and don't stick to a clear thesis. You also really think you're a very good writer and that's clouding your perception. 

If you go in there and simply say you think you deserve better you'll be laughed right out. Read and absorb the feedback given to you. "
"So I just asked my girlfriend about this. She's about the same age, 31F. She is one of those hippie granola people, and she says that engagement rings, for a lot of girls, are extremely important, sort of like big weddings. (She also was a little concerned that I was asking about rings...)

If your girlfriend does this with other things (literally demanding expensive things), then she is an entitled brat. Then I would talk to her about priorities. 

However, if it's just the ring, I don't actually think it's that big of a deal. I wouldn't end a relationship with someone you loved over it, especially because you're not even getting married.

Weddings are expensive, and so are rings! A lot of girls don't like fake ones.

Maybe ask her how she would feel about a family ring versus a store-bought one? It might be the quality and sentiment that is important to her, especially if she wants to give her ring to her child (once her child is an adult and can get married.)

I don't think this is a reason to break up with someone, but it is time to talk about your priorities."
"That's probably the most likely, though I wouldn't put it past the roommate to be collecting ""evidence"" of OP cheating to be used against them."
"You preferences for living apart and not getting married are likely also rooted in emotion. 

You’re characterizing her desires as illogical while yours are logical AND dismissing her emotions.

You really could benefit from therapy."
"Your bf needs some serious therapy to deal with his issues about dating someone outside of his race.

Don't stay with someone who's embarrassed at dating you. The blow to your self-esteem isn't worth it. "
"If I found out my partner was doing this we would be done, period. Everyone’s hating on you for reading it, but imagine if you hadn’t and then you married him without ever knowing the truth. "
"&gt;  I have noticed that I don't text her or tell her about an event because I think she knows already. 

She's not psychic, you know.

&gt; What ways can I show my wife I appreciate her?

Have you tried texting when you say you will? Doing what you said you would? It's not rocket science."
"Yeah A+ for snarkiness that dude, I definitely chuckled. Mind your own beeswax, OP. "
"So this begs the question: have you ever, inadvertently talked up how great Hawaiian music is? I'm guessing she thinks you're really into ukelele music and would love to learn to play. It's not really the type of gift you just randomly choose for someone, she likely thinks you'd really love it.

It's actually kind of endearing.

Though now I wanna buy my husband a ukelele just to fuck with him 😂
"
You're not reading *enough* into this. She's horribly irresponsible with money and cheated on you. 
"Yes! OP, my husband was a lot like you, and it has taken years for him to really understand that gifts don't have to be about the money part of it, but are about letting someone know that you think enough of them to acknowledge them. Letting people do that for you is a kindness.

Rather than give them a very narrow, specific list of what to buy you, give some general ideas in a range of prices. ""I've needed a new tie for special occasions -- maybe blue or purple. I have been meaning to read more classic books, like something by Hemingway or Steinbeck. I've never tried a beer-of-the-month club kind of thing, but that might be fun."" 

More importantly, try to acknowledge them as well. Even if you simply buy a box of cards and write a personalized note for each, it will be meaningful to them -- and you will be surprised at how meaningful it is to you as well. ""Dear (GF's father), thank you for really making an effort to welcome me this past year. I really enjoyed going out for drinks with you last month, and I hope we can do more of that in the future. Wishing you the merriest of Christmases and great things in 2018."" "
"My Inlaws are in their late 60s and have almost zero energy to deal with him, I think they have essentially turned a blind eye to him a while ago. They would almost certainly just turn the situation over to the state and probation system. "
"I disagree. I am a hugely sexual person now (I require sex/masturbation at least once a week, but would not mind if I had it 1-2 times/day). But before my first sexual experience with my now ex-BF, I had never masturbated. And actually, I never masturbated until I broke up with said BF. 

I just had never explored my sexuality before. I was much younger than OP's GF. But sexual discovery is very different for men and women. It's not like you just ""get hard"" one day during puberty and start rubbing one out. I literally just had no idea what to do with anything and had never watched porn. But I knew after my first experience that I desired it.

What helped though, was me and my then-bf were both discovering our sexualities together. I never felt pressure to perform or do anything I was uncomfortable with. In fact it was mostly heavy petting until 1 year after, when I finally felt comfortable enough to have sex.

This does not look like the experience of OP's gf at all. He issued an ultimatum instead of letting it be a gradual experience. That would have been enough pressure and anxiety to make me never want to do it too."
"Well sometimes I'm not ""as cool"" as he thought I would grow up to be if I'm not feeling up for it. Or if I suggest it and later something comes up, like once I worked late and had to take someone to the airport at 5am and work all day after so I retracted my offer, he will get upset that I dangle it and berate me for being so careless with his feelings because I know how important going with him is. So yeah, I sometimes really hate going when it's like that. Being told dozens of times how I'm not who he thought he married and I'm not cool, but insecure, I'd a real buzz kill for me and adds this pressure and shit to it and I don't enjoy it. "
He should be checked for B12 deficiency. All of them should. 
"I think that if you want to break up with him because his uncertainty is a disservice *to you*, then perhaps you should go ahead, as it would be a matter of how you feel and what you need (certainty).

If you want to break up to spare him a childless life then absolutely no -the martyr logic where ""I'll be ahead of you and spare you of..."" is really not smart in my opinion. That's a decision he should be making, as long as you're ok with waiting. There's no reason for you to jump in the sword for no reason If he's with you, it's his choice, he's not lacking freedom -is an actual choice. And if so, enjoy your relationship."
"They are amazing people...only to people who look like them and live life like them.  They are racist and close-minded, and their respect for people is only skin-deep.  If they really loved you and wanted you to be happy, they would have said their piece ONCE, and then tried really hard to get to know your boyfriend to see if he was someone who could really make you happy.  But they didn't.  They think they can bully you into making a choice that THEY are more comfortable with.  It's not about you being happy, it's about how it looks, or them not having to face their predjudices and admit that they might be wrong about ""mexicans"".  Your parents, and your sister, are the kind of people that are more concerned about their own comfort than your happiness.  

You think they are amazing people because you've never walked away from the life they consider appropriate for a member of your family.  And you're finding out how they treat people who don't toe the line; with disrespect and frankly disgusting behavior.  

If you would chose your family, then break up with your boyfriend now.  Unless they make a complete 180, this is only going to get worse.  How are they going to treat your boyfriend's family at your wedding?  With the same utter disdain they treat him?  How are they going to treat your ""half-breed"" children?  

You don't have to cut them off yet.  You can give them a chance to get their shit together and be better people.  If you go to Christmas without your boyfriend, the message is that their behavior is fine, that they can just ignore him long enough and he'll go away, like a pesky fly that will buzz away if they can just not acknowledge it.  If you tell them ""I love you, but at this point, boyfriend and I are a package deal.  If you love and respect me, that means you respect my choice of partner and you attempt to get to know him as a person, and not as his race.  If you can't do that, then I won't be attending Christmas this year.  I'm sorry to miss it, but that's my decision.""  

If you don't want to do that, then you need to break up with your boyfriend now.  It means your family's (objectively wrong opinions and behavior) is more important that his feelings and just a basic level of respect, then just end it and find someone else who fits into their idea of who you should be.  "
"Unless coerced, people do exactly what they want to do, every single time.  So either there are literally *no* jobs out there, or he doesn't actually want one all that badly.  

People are motivated by different things; if he hasn't actually been trying to land a job, but has just been paying lip service, then he's not the sort of person who is motivated by self-sufficiency.  So why *would* he try to get a job, when mommy and daddy are paying his bills, and you're paying for everything else?

There's really only one question that you need answered here: are there *really*, legitimately, *no* jobs available (unlikely) or is he just happy coasting along on other people's dime (far more likely).

If the answer is the latter, then 1) he's never going to get a job, *ever*, as long as he can manage to sucker people into supporting him, and 2) you're never *ever* going to see a dime of that $20k.

An ultimatum won't help; if there are no jobs, there are no jobs. If he's a mooch, he'll just find someone else to mooch off of.

"I guess you’re only 17, but you need to work on your empathy skills.  You dont understand the addiction.  It was likely started as a stress reliever and hes trying to quit during what i likely the most stressful time of his life.  And aside from that, it is equally possible that it was your mother who smoked."
Don't say anything. Mind your own business. 
"That's good to hear, OP.  But if you find yourself carrying a debt because you were afraid of being judged, you need to be vocal about that in the safety of couples' counseling.  Don't lose sight of advocating for yourself.  This shouldn't change the relationship, as you haven't lied about who you are.  Stay fair and strong!"
"When people give me ultimatums, I usually pick the thing they didn’t want me to do to spite them. In your case, I’d tell them I broke up with my girlfriend, but that I’m also cutting them off. I’d tell them thy are narcissistic bigots who have no right to influence my life choices. I’d say they are not the same people who raised me; that they’ve become bitter and entitled old fools who were disowned by their son. They will have nothing and no one but each other to be miserable and hateful with. 

I’d be lying about breaking up of course , but I wouldn’t want them to have a lifeline of hate to cling to like I forced their hand in disowning me. I’d want them to know I was the one that cut them out. 

My dad used to say this shit to me as a kid about dating a black girl or if I was gay, and he wasn’t even religious. I remember telling him at 10 yrs old that he’d be welcome to disown me, but that I’d never forgive him for it. I’d never come back and he’d never see any kids I had or my wife. I told him he could die a lonely bitter man without me and I’d be just fine because I’d have my own family to love me. 

Needless to say he changed his tune. Thankfully he’s not at all like that now. "
"She already told you she doesn't like being touched so you should expect nothing less than her reaction when you touched her. If you just let her know, ""hey, i'm sorry about touching your hand the other day, I was just trying to steady your phone so I could read what you were trying to show me, sorry about that"" should clear the air and give you peace of mind. "
"Yeah. I'm sorry for Stacey, but living in buildings- you have to deal with reasonable amounts of noise. I'm on the first floor, and I have to deal with kids running around, crying (one is literally crying right now that I can hear and people are trying to sleep)."
An older dude with money dating a much younger woman expects to be paying for shit. That's part of the deal in his eyes.
"I went through the exact same thing. Was with my bf for 3 years, living together 2.5 years. He got a job offer across the country. Did not discuss it with me at all. Made no mention of me going with him or anything whatsoever. So I told him that if he doesn't care about this at all, and can up and leave with no issues, leave now. I wont be a place holder until you get a better job. I asked him to move out and he did that day.

I refuse to do the long distance thing. It isnt for me. And not communicating about something like this? Something that will make or break the relationship? Screw that."
"Jesus, this isn't in quit Facebook hit the gym territory yet. This can be fixed."
"Yes! Oh, the drama! Don't even bring up the dinner. That is what I would recommend- It seems everyone has formed their own righteous opinions on the matter and if you love this guy make sure he knows that. Next family dinner BRING ""ADAM"" and have him bring to go containers so he can make light of the last dinner and say something cheesy like, ""This time I'll take home what my stomach can't hold! My Brain couldn't stop me from eating all this delicious food last time that my stomach had step- in, or rather step out (ahahahaha *crappy joke) Now my brain is smarter than my stomach!"" LOL, this was a harmless and embarrassing event that got blown way out of proportion for Adam, your family was equally embarrassed, but for all the wrong reasons! Just continue on as if all were normal. What are they going to do make him eat in the bathroom??  If Adam is still around years later your kids will have a very funny story of dad that no one can let go. "
You're naive if you can't see she was fucking him last night 
"&gt; I'm happily married

Is that the only reason you wouldn't do it again?"
"Personally I think you are being over accommodating. More accommodating than he wants you to be by the sound of it.

To me he sounds Bi but I'm no expert. 

He can't really have his cake and eat it though. It doesn't really sound like he want to.

Can't you just be in a normal exclusive relationship relationship and him be bi. Like obviously he will find other men and women attractive as most people find other people attractive in relationships but they don't talk about it constantly as it's not good relationship etiquette."
"Well his life won't be over, but it'll definitely be over as he knows it. He's gonna be a dad. He can still go out and meet people, but it'll NEVER be the same and his very first priority will have to be this new human.

From the little exposure I've had to OP---how he thinks, behaves, etc., I have no fucking clue if he's ready for that."
"Imo the ""romantic"" types are that way because they haven't been required to deal with and plan their own shit. Don't be so down on yourself for being practical, you have 100% reasonable boundaries and you're thinking ahead and handling relationship issues before they even come up. That's smart and will allow you to find the right person who respects you and has a compatible way of thinking. Whether or not your current bf is that person for you, stick to your guns.

He may be feeling hurt that you don't trust him (justifiably or not), so it might benefit the situation to get him to air out his feelings and offer him some reassurance."
"I find it interesting that most the posts here are trying to advise you on how to step into your wife's shoes and give actual consideration to what she's telling you, that this problem is an emotional one, and your response is that it's about cooking.

The problem has nothing to do with cooking.  You should try reading the article called ""She divorced me because I left dishes by the sink.""  It may help you understand your wife's POV.  And until you can understand the concept that your wife could be both supportive and not happy about it, you're not going to get anywhere.  

Also, just a tip: 2 parties on opposite sides of an argument can both be right.  You are right, but so is your wife in this situation.  Until you can understand that your wife is ALSO right, you're going to have a hard time of it."
"Can't argue with the dying thing, but if you're worried about some old dude getting skeezy on her, I assure you that somewhere out there, there is a (ahem) ""confirmed bachelor"" who always wanted a family, but couldn't openly have a partner at the time, never mind kids. There will be at least one gossipy old lady there who can point you directly to him. :)"
"&gt; Then, she will open up her legs and I will literally stick a

Yeah...when I got to this part I was not expecting ""pillow"". I know I've got a dirty mind, but still, this whole routine puts OP in the awkward position of feeling like her parent. That's never a good idea long-term.

If this was like a ""treat"" scenario where she requests it when she's got the flu, I doubt OP would feel like her dad...it would be more in the realm of ""here's this little bit of comfort for the woman I love"". Doing it every single night sets up a situation where the OP feels put-upon and creeped out.

Maybe talk to her and dial it back a bit and save it for special occasions? Or maybe just say ""Sunday nights only"". Basically, you need to treat this like you would if your partner had a sexual kink. Sure, you wouldn't mind indulging her sometimes, but it shouldn't take over your sex life 100% where you're ONLY having kink sex. There are two people involved and your thoughts and feelings on the activity matter just as much as hers because you are a part of this ""kink"" as her partner.

There's no such thing as ""normal"", but you get to say what you are comfortable/uncomfortable with."
"She doesn't need to see every single photo ever taken of the kids, *especially* ones involving her shitty ex who's deliberately trying to hurt her via social media. She already sees her children all the time in real life, I don't see why it would possibly matter if she missed a few random pics of them online. "
Found OP's ex-husband...
She brought drama into the office by physically attacking you. I'd report her to the police and *definitely* tell your boss.
"Leaving someone over infidelity shouldn’t require absolute proof. It’s about the most reasonable explanation from the behavior and the reaction of the cheater that adds up. 

The fact that she’s the daughter of a family friend makes me more inclined, not less, to believe that he slept with her. He could have been grooming her for this for a while. "
I believe it was a manipulation tactic on his part to coerce her into saying yes. I’m sure he knew she would have said no if he proposed in private.
Master's degrees for teachers are the norm these days. You're not overqualified for a teaching position.
He's trying to lock you in because he's almost 40. He doesn't respect you or your plans. 
"There's also the third option where people who have been in the workforce for years know that it's inappropriate and futile to bring this sort of issue to HR. 

You're getting good advice even if it's not what you were hoping to hear. "
People suck sometimes. I only recently learned that some drivers will _go out of their way_ to run over turtles.
"I couldn't justify spending 25% of my salary on a ring, that's way too much. Is this really the expectation?
Why can't people just be happy with what they get and not be greedy?"
"Oh boy.  This is not going to get better.   The beginning of a relationship is the time you have the most contact usually.  Today my husband left or a business trip for 3 days.  I might decide to call him or I might not.  He enjoys his time away without checking in.  (We have kids and we are really busy so I know chilling in a hotel room paying video games or drinking at the bar must be relaxing to him)

This is a relationship you should move on from.  She is way too old to be acting like an insecure schoolgirl.  

Don't you want a moments peace in your whole life?"
"&gt; If you keep up this charade of silent treatment, doubting everything he tells you, and being constantly irritable around him, you won't have a husband soon to discuss your processed emotions with. 

Ok, screw that. 

OP is *upset*. She's struggling with her emotions, she's struggling to figure out how she's feeling, she's angry, she's upset, she's unsure what she wants.

She needs to be allowed to *process* how she is feeling. Her husband fucked up. He didn't, like, *kill* someone, but he still did a bad thing that is negatively affecting her – she is the one who deserves time and space to sort herself out, not him. He has to deal with the fact that him doing *something bad* is going to negatively affect how she interacts with him. He has to accept that there are consequences he won't like for doing bad things.

I don't think OP is doing anything wrong."
"Or she feels like a lot of her ""first times"" for her are always going to be downplayed because ""he's done it before""."
"Please follow this advice. 

I'm half black and dealt with this sort of thing throughout all of middle and high school. I thought I was entirely ugly and undesirable. I moved to a city and suddenly tons of people (of all races) find me attractive. Being surrounded by diversity has done wonders for my self esteem. "
"I don’t think you are looking at it very objectively here. Assuming she doesn’t get out(hopefully she does) are you going to continue supporting here when you get married? She’s going to have an effective negative income. In the off chance she actually manages to make money at this, are you ok morally, knowing that she is scamming other people essentially? I know I wouldn’t be ok with that.

But ultimately this decision is up to you."
he puts you down? Sorry what?
"Until he gets as muscular as you, I'd tell him he has no room to talk. But if you don't want to go scorched earth tell him that he could go work out with you to get all that muscle back and see how fast he shuts that down since he doesn't work out as it is. Hopefully it'll shut him up."
"Oh, fuck this guy. Get a divorce and take him for half of everything. Leave before he makes you pay for flushing the toilet when you have morning sickness. "
He's checking out of your marriage. Don't sign anything. Consult a lawyer.
"You are totally projecting here. You didn't plan a vacation with your girlfriend, you are with your friends. Your girlfriend is a tag-along after Anna joined the group. If you planned a trip with your girlfriend, I bet it would be awesome. "
"Can't you take Anna shopping? Can't you take Anna to get her nails done.

Not just sexist, incredibly selfish and unreasonable."
"She's not working that hard if she's still racing to check his phone when he goes to the bathroom. Honestly, OP, what work is she ACTUALLY putting in? Seems to me that making a commitment to stop invading your privacy would be step number one in trying to get control of her jealousy."
"Absolutely, hit me up in PM anytime. The books have a lot of example scenarios and techniques that you can use too so those will be helpful for you.

The other technique I didn't mention that is helpful is emotional validation. When your sister is expressing disappointment in something, you can validate her emotions without agreeing with them. An example:

&gt;""You went to bed so early during my wedding. I wanted you to come out with us""

""I can tell that really disappointed you. I understand that you wish things could have been different that night.""

Other potential responses for the other items:

&gt;""You never come to the Lakehouse"" / ""When will you come?"" / ""Will you ever come?""

""I have no interest in going to the Lakehouse.""

&gt;""You always go to your partner's brother's house""

""I realize it must feel that way to you."" 

&gt;""You're never around"" / ""my coworkers think I don't even have a sister"" etc

""It's true, I am very busy.""

&gt;""When are you going to invite me over?"" / ""You never invite me over"" / ""you should've invited me over by now""

This one is a little trickier. You can go ""I have no interest in inviting you over,"" if you want to make it clear you don't want a relationship. But if you want to leave it more ambiguous you can just play the busy card.

""Who knows? I am a very busy person!""

Look up grey rock and information diet as well - those would be good things to use with her."
" If he has a brain injury so traumatic that he ""can't remember"" things he's said earlier in the day/week, then he would be given a medical discharge, *not* be deployed overseas. He's using his injury to lie and gaslight you. 

Here's what you do: go over to his place and get anything you've left that you can't live without. If no such thing exists, you don't need to go over there. Then, go back to your house and have your locks re-keyed (if he has a key). 

Then send him a text that says ""I have realized that we are not romantically compatible, and I do not want to continue this relationship. We are broken up. This is not a discussion. If you show up on my property I will call the police. Goodbye.""

Then, block his number so that you can't read his replies or answer his calls. Block his Facebook. Keep your door locked while you're at home. Be prepared to actually call the police if he does come knocking. 

Immediately after you've sent the text and blocked him, call your best friend/ sister/ brother/ mom/ grandma and tell them all about why you broke up with him. Ask them to come over and commiserate with you. It will help you solidify your resolve to *stay* broken up. "
"People like to think if they apply enough love, care and affection that you’ll realize you’re special and wanted and you’ll see that their attempts to celebrate you are totally different from your previous experiences.

Unfortunately, as you know, it doesn’t always work that way.

If it’s possible for you, come up with an alternative for your friends, something that’s comfortable for you and still allows them to feel as if they’ve fussed over you. Is there a charity or something you can suggest they do a mini fundraiser for? An activity you’ve always wanted to do with your friends? Just do it under the guise of your birthday.

If even that makes you uncomfortable, you’re going to have to learn to draw a line and walk out on events you’re not comfortable with. Saying something is nowhere near as effective as acting."
Nice catch. r/quityourbullshit material?
"You’re not selfish, don’t set yourself on fire to keep him warm. Stay strong OP, you’ve got this."
It's different because it's not an older male colleague of hers. Don't try to erase the context and turn it into a different situation entirely. 
"It sounds like she doesn't want to be with you, but calling off an engagement and breaking up are really stressful and difficult so she's just trying to keep you around without committing. Personally, I'd cancel and try to move on. "
"I'm sorry, but as a woman your own age with geeky interests a wardrobe full of LARP and cosplay costumes, I'm gonna be straight with you:

You are too old for this shit.

It's okay to be disappointed, but let go of the anger and self-disgust. You and he weren't on the same page. Sometimes, even when you do everything right, shit doesn't work out. Ce la vie. That's dating.

Text him back a quick, short, blame-free ""I'm not looking for more friends. I'm looking to date. If you're not looking for that too, I'm gonna pass.""

He doesn't owe you a relationship. You don't owe him a friendship. It's okay to be disappointing or annoyed, but don't get worked up into a fit about it and certainly don't get wrapped into some sort of self-shaming ""I can't believe I touched him!"" nonsense. 

Just reject his offer of friendship, and if doesn't take that well, block him like you would any other guy who couldn't handle rejection. "
"At  first I was on her side because although I always try to split things evenly, nobody likes to be nickel and dimed on a date. But the old popcorn and candy is just so over the top strange! How awkward and embarrassing. No, you don't ask her about reimbursing you for dinner. Sometimes you spend money on a date and it doesn't work out. Just chalk it up to a loss and decline any future dates."
"&gt; Why did you have a child when you obviously can't afford it?

How is this helpful? Their kid is 4. Not like they can go back and choose not to have him. Asking this question does nothing but shame OP. "
"Why does he still have these cars if he cannot afford to maintain them &amp; your health is suffering by adding so much to your current workload? 

How long would you be able to return to normal hours if he sold one? What if he sold them all? 

What is his reasoning for not applying for jobs? How long does he see the current situation continuing? 

What does he do to help out while you work? 

How much time/energy would you save if he was cooking you a healthy dinner every night &amp; doing groceries? Would he agree to this &amp; were the chores split fairly before now? 

What would happen if you insisted on advocating for your own needs &amp; told him this situation cannot continue? 

You're running yourself into the ground to make ends meet while he still has FOUR collector cars. Why?

"
"You ratted her out, why exactly shouldn't she do the same to you?  If you don't want that to happen, you are going to need to do a lot more than just say ""I'm sorry"", you betrayed her and broke your promise."
My concern is his lack of boundaries for a lot of areas. The fact that he would be willing to jeopardize the safety of a four year old is...creepy. I have a 3yo and that would just not even be something I would consider asking for or doing when it’s clear she’s gonna come looking for you and then what? It seems clear you’ve established your boundaries and he keeps pushing at them. When you bring up the fact that he isn’t making you feel heard he gaslights you. Not a good sign. 
"Your current boyfriend threatens to harm himself if you leave and is mentally handicapped? Am I reading this right?

And he has more than two children, some of whom are in the care of the state?

And he wants to marry you after four months and get you pregnant?

Please do work on moving out on you own and being single."
"One person on $30/hr is great. Two people on $30/hr is definitely workable. Two people and a baby on $30/hr? Fuhgeddaboudit!

If she was on her own, she would never quit her job without another one lined up. Even if she really really *hated* her job! I can't help but seeing this with the same fears as you do. I'd bet she already sees this new money you're making as her own. I would stand by your feelings here and make it expressly clear to her that you will not be the sole breadwinner in the family. "
"Various things to unpack here. In no particular order:

* Don't write off a lack of support as ""just"" alcoholism.

* Don't date an alcoholic and expect things to be OK.

* Don't assume that the way *you* feel and things you would/wouldn't do automatically apply to other people. Don't try and compare/equate depth of feelings, because everyone feels things differently.

* Just because someone says something, don't assume it's true.

* The problem here is the alcoholism and the infidelity, so work on/through them - don't tie yourself in knots trying to calculate whether he's in love with you or not, and by whose definition."
"&gt;Honestly, I didn't even need support.    

Ouch. This is what marriage IS to many people. If this is coming across in your interactions, she's probably got an ""attitude"" because she feels unnecessary in your marriage. I suspect this is also where her idea of ""more than thanks"" is coming from. Have you ever told her something like ""I couldn't have done this without you. Our marriage and your support mean the world to me"""
"You're underthinking, not overthinking. This is sketchy AF.

I was a pudgy, insecure teen, and plenty of older men (incl very good-looking ones) hit on me. 

I think it's overwhelmingly likely that he fooled around inappropriately with this girl."
"So I don’t know how to start this. I am a Christian too and I am around people who are mostly atheist. Which works fine, we sometimes just agree to disagree. 

But this is a marriage, which is completely different. And you have a huge compatibility problem here. One that neither of you can ignore. Neither of you is going to change their mind about this.  And I fear this will escelate in fights, resentment, anger and loss of respect.

This is sadly not a sustainable marriage, not in the long run.  And since your wife is so religious, she will oppose divorce strongly.  Good luck.  "
That hes upset by it makes it a lot funnier to me.  I dont know what to tell you.
"
&gt;Because I know that he values our friendship. I have been in his life for years, we share a close bond, and we are important to one another. I’m not saying he’d choose me over her, but he wouldn’t cut me out of his life.

If it comes down to a friendship or his marriage, yes he will cut you out. ""Forsaking all others"". You need to appease his wife (rightly or wrongly, who knows) if you want to keep this friendship. "
"While yes, charcoal is also carbon, that doesn't make what you said any less true though. Marketing aside, factually, moissanite and diamond are not the same thing. I'm not saying this because I bought into ""the diamond hype"" or whatever; this is coming from a woman who wants a moissanite engagement ring, not a diamond. But to anyone who actually knows what moissanite is, like OP's GF clearly does, you're just going to be insulting, not persuasive. "
"25% of a yearly salary IS three months of salary, which is, I believe the old rules of what an engagement ring should cost.  OP's gf probably had that in mind."
"&gt;He makes a lot of rude comments to her and intentionally tells her red lights are green, or does other things that freak her out and make her make bad decisions, so he can yell at her for not being ""on her toes."" 
&gt;We're all mixed white (dad's side) and Asian (mom's side), and he's been milking the bad driver jokes. He's getting a two-for-one since she's a girl too, and it's really getting under my sister's skin and actually making her feel kind of bad.

Your dad's a horrible person, what the fuck? Who psyches out their fifteen-year old daughter trying to get her to make driving mistakes, then makes racist and sexist comments directed at her? 

I would make the sacrifice for the poor kid if I could, but unfortunately, it's not possible, and that's just my bleeding heart. Your parents will find out anyway, and it'll be worse for both of you if they catch you in a lie at the same time.

Also, like, no offense, and I know this is jumping the gun and not what you asked for, but your mom should get a divorce. Your dad obviously doesn't respect Asian women like... at all, and verbal abuse is still abuse."
"Yeah, I already text my husband a lot *and* I know sign language. A month with no talking would be cake"
"&gt;since I had gone on trips with my male best friend and was considering moving in with him, it's okay for him to host a friend

Yeah im sorry this is a two way street. You cant go on trips with your male friend but then kick up a fuss when he does something with a female friend, especially if he didn't make a big deal out of you going away with said male friend"
"&gt;  unless your internal alarm system is telling you differently

Did we read the same post, mine went off 10 times.  I'm sorry but I don't see any other way then to view this as an inappropriate relationship and Rick as a predator.  Maybe some 53 yo men take interest in 18 yo girls because they always wanted a daughter, but I'd never be willing to take that chance.  If Rick hadn't totally lost interest with OP as he began spending more time with her daughter, and he was in a solid relationship with OP, I might buy the father stuff, but seeing as he has pulled further away and her daughter has too, he seems like a predator.

"GO TO JAPAN 

This is a much better idea. You can take a cruise and enjoy some nature from far away, or you can go out and enjoy another culture and enjoy nature and life by truly engaging with it. 


Your SIL is being absurd. Legit. The other comments will talk about that, but I'm gonna help you with visiting Japan. 


Get everything your daughter needs translated by a doctor. Meet with a doctor who knows Japanese, and Japanese health care. Ask them questions. Japan doesn't have 24 hours ER the same way the US does, so figure out a plan for night care or weekend care, but their healthcare is great. They may want to have you stay hospitalized longer than you're used to, but nothing is wrong - it's a cultural thing. For medicine, bring a prescription and get it in both your home country language and Japanese. Look deeply into the drug laws since it's very different than your home country most likely. Also, bring extra. A lot of meds in Japan is liquid, so your child may actually want that or prefer the solid pill you take in your home country. 


Practice some Japanese, and body language is included here. It goes a long way. Every train station has a small kiosk. In major cities, at least one of them speaks great English. In smaller cities, or towns really, simply write it down. They may be unable to orally get it, but can via print. Get a mobile stop for your phone since you're going to use Google Maps to get around due to lack of street signs. 


Have a great time~"
"Yeah I don't get it, the whole ""she can't finish me off"" thing seems like he's trying to flop his inability to finish on her side of the table. OP it's your problem that you can't finish not hers."
"Trying to convince me to come back while over drinking. He thought for a time he made a mistake marrying me because I was injured and had to spend a year recovering right after our wedding so we separated and he quickly discovered he didn't actually want to be apart from me, just didn't expect marriage to start with me getting injured. I thought we were over but my dad died very suddenly and my other family starting ripping off the house and threatening to sue when I was named executor and he stepped in and helped me with all of it and we grew close, went to counseling, things improved until recently "
"Seriously. One of the main points to marriage is having someone to lean on, to help you through the tough times. Not someone who will leave you when things aren't fun. Sounds like this guy doesn't want a life partner, he wants a FWB. "
"Well, you and your friend had plans before going on the trip, ones she wasn't interested in so she made her own. Sounds like a really awesome girlfriend to me. THOUGH if it is bothering you that much that you aren't spending time together, maybe talk to her about it and see if you could start the days together (breakfast) or something? It might require you waking up early, but you'd still be able to see her! Or maybe even make one day where you and her do plans together and you don't engage in the plans with the rest of the group/Matt."
"I think we definitely see that Anna is being uncompromising. 

I guess it was easy to ask my GF to step in than give up Matt but I can see now just how unfair that was."
"My SO is divorced and has 2 kids. I don’t mind AT ALL that he talks with the birth mother pretty much daily. Why wouldn’t he be in communication with her regarding the kids? It’s absurd hat your girlfriend can’t understand this. My SO and his ex are great co-parents, and the fact that they are on good terms makes everything easier. Personally, I’m very happy they talk and have the ability to co-parent. If I had to deal with a highly toxic birth mother who fought with my SO and caused drama (or if my SO was the toxic one), I wouldn’t be in this relationship. That sounds like a nightmare. 

Your girlfriend is immature. She should understand that there’s just no way to avoid talking to your kids’ Mom. Things come up all the time that co-parents have to deal with together. It’s just part of the deal. If she can’t accept that, then she shouldn’t date men who have kids from previous relationships. It’s ridiculous that she wants you to tell her every time you talk to the birth mother."
"The fact that they had/have a sexual relationship changes things. If they were just platonic friends, then whatever it's not a big deal. The fact that they are very clearly NOT platonic friends makes this entirely different. There's nothing wrong being uncomfortable with them having contact or hanging out. If he tells you otherwise, it's because he's an asshole who wants to be able to do whatever and whomever he wants. Don't let him walk all over you. Frankly him making that comment to her would be enough for me to end it. He clearly does not respect you, and has given you a thousand reasons not to trust him. Trust and respect are necessary for a healthy relationship. "
"No, she doesn’t have a boyfriend.

You’re right in that she’s not the one who crosses the line, really. She did make a “dedication post” for him on Instagram ~5-6 months ago calling him her “cheat meal ride or die”, her “biggest motivator” and her “bestie”.... but no compliments on his appearance as far as I’m aware."
That was my thought too. 
I actually am one! I appreciate the vote of confidence!

I just...SEVEN MONTHS OF PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE BS OVER SOME DUDE SEXUALLY HARASSING HER?!?!?!!? WTF???? This is emotional abuse in my book tbh, like reading those comments I was like welp time to never date anyone ever because I like to deal with my shit on my own? "
"How serious was he in bodyshaming himself? If he was overly critical of his own body, as opposed to pointing out insecurities he has but that he's working to quell, then I would agree with you that it's upsetting and that he was possibly engaging in shaming of your own body. If instead he was clumsily trying to point out how he has his own hangups sometimes and asking how you feel about your own, he may be clumsy but highly empathetic and trying to suss out your feelings so he can be considerate of them (but obviously has failed at that task due to his inexperience).

If you talk out with him how his statements made him feel, if it's the former he'll go into defensiveness or double down on shaming language and you can start seeing that as a massive red flag. If instead he's immediately appalled on learning that his attempt at establishing some form of trust and understanding of your feelings about your own bodies caused you anguish, I would say he needs time to learn but that it's a very good sign that he's going to be a supportive partner in the future."
"A mouse in the fridge is pretty bad. I’ve never had mice manage to get in there, and my childhood home had so many mice that they crawled on me in my sleep.

"Except that it's impossible to pair 15 people up. You either need one group of three, or someone needs to solo, or someone needs to double up on their amount of work. 

I don't think professors need to hold hands, but in my experience I've been assigned to groups or we did some kind of count off. There's some value in pairing people off with random other people because that's sort of how work works. Letting people pair off with their friends isn't great career training."

"There is actually scientific evidence now that wheat can cause some people health problems, outside of those who have celiac disease. 

Wheat contains fructans, which can cause serious digestive issues in many people including serious pain and bloating and symptoms similar to IBS. People who are affected may need to follow the low FODMAP diet, which requires them to avoid wheat and other foods containing FODMAPs. It's not made up, it's a proper diet established by scientists at two Universities. 

As many as 1 in 8 people suffer from IBS, so that's a lot of people who might genuinely not be able to eat bread because of it's fructans, not because they are fake celiacs. "
"It doesn’t really matter if he husband thinks that way consciously or not. What matters is his actions and words, and they really imply that he does contain these beliefs, even if he can’t express the belief in words. This is the case for a lot of people and it’s why it’s a  hard issue to tackle. 

It’s important to call out instances like this though. Modern forms of sexism are usually subtle and are expressed in the insidious fashion like in OP story. They can be missed, or abstract enough that it’s hard to tackle. And yes, calling someone a sexist is a simplification (no one is wholly one thing), calling out behavior like this is still important. Because how else are people meant to grow and learn? It’s not nice, it’s not pleasant. But the best growth comes from pain. "

You, not the two of you, have decided that you will pursue some dream of yours. Despite this being **your** dream, you require her active participation to do it. You unilaterally decided on this, and then are upset she isn't 100% behind it. 

You then come to an internet forum to ask for advice and won't even tell us what following this dream would entail - for all we know you're asking her to pack up in an RV and travel the country as magicians - which would be a pretty ridiculous thing to ask from your spouse with no prior discussion.

OP if he didn't cheat on you it's because she likes having him dangling about at her beck and call. You've given so many red flags: he pays her more attention when you're together, sleeps over at her house when you've had an argument, and now this final straw of the hugging/kissing and arms around waist. Now is the time for you to end this charade. "
"It is a bit weird, essentially. But like they said, it IS a failsafe. You're not saying they should be having sex, you're saying ""so now you have a boyfriend you're probably gonna start thinking about this, let's take a look at what your options are."" It opens a conversation and, if the daughter wants to - for instance - get an IUD, she'll also be protected against pregnancy if she only starts having sex in, say, two years. By then she'll have some experience with dealing with birth control and talking about this with her parents and partner will be easier because there's a precedent."
"Racial slurs to me I'm mixed, saying I'm ugly on Christmas morning, saying my sister should prostitute herself instead of going to College these are the worst.

"This sounds very strange to me. My gf lost her dad over 10y ago, well before I met her. The circumstances were unlikely to be good, I know she tried to resuscitate him for about 10 minutes before an ambulance arrived. As a doctor, I can't even imagine trying to resuscitate someone I know, let alone one of my parents. 

I surreptitiously put the date on my Google calender so i know when it comes up. 

She doesn't make a big deal out if it, often just a mention on the day or in the week leafing up to it, but her preference is to stay in that night and maybe watch some star trek because that's her happy memory of him.

I have both my parents, but to deny someone the right to remember a parent sounds really, really immature and petty. Not qualities I would be looking for on a long term partner."

Good idea. I worry that when she sees OP, something will happen and things are going to get a bit nuts, which will ruin the wedding :/ I don't want to automatically assume bad intentions, but like you said, alcohol makes people do crazy things (heck, even without alcohol, it can get out of hand)."
"Just wanted to say as a fellow artist that many people are just very judgmental about it. If it was the arrangement between you and your partner and it worked financially, then more power to you. The field you want to go into has commercial applications and there are, like you said, programs you can do so you can get a job more easily. Graphic design is not at all a bad career path too. However from what he said about you not being a good wife, it sounds like he has been building up resentment.

I’m also not sure why he did what he did and then is angry about it - did he just do it for his mother? Why would going part time be more responsible?? He needs to grow a backbone and change the way he makes decisions or agrees to decisions rather than complaining about it afterward. You need to anticipate this, knowing him. 

That said, you’re both unsatisfied with the situation and your communication styles are exacerbating the problem. You can try to get a part time job temporarily but I don’t see how you will be able to stay working late into the pregnancy or directly after so the onus is still on him to find another full time job. It’s unlikely he can get his old job back since they’ve probably hired someone after he left, so he may just have to do a traditional job search. He may want to think about how he’s going to explain why he went part time though.
"
"Everything you just said, those are exactly the doubts that I’ve had and said to myself. Not sure how to buckle down and follow through with cutting ties and of course being afraid of the pain that comes with letting go. It’s just one of those things a person has to learn to do, it’s part of life, but dang I’m terrible at doing it! "
"I think this comment is dead-on and that is OP's problem. He's not attracted to a mature, competent adult. He wants an immature woman who is super young and fresh, like a puppy."
"You know what's intensely narcissistic? Flaunting your marriage in front of 200 people, spending 40k on it, nominating wedding party members to throw you parties, shower you with gifts, and spend hundreds on their dresses and bachelor/bachelorette events.

You know what's not narcissistic? Making your wedding just about the two of you and your relationship together.

&gt;that is not just a major event for you but also for them as your parents who raised you

Seriously, fuck that noise. You must be a narcissistic parent who thinks that their kids marriage is all about them. Weddings are not about the parents. They are about starting a NEW family.

&gt;This conversation starts with an honest apology

HAHAHAHAHA, no."
If I were on the receiving end of that MOH comment that you sent to your friend OP I would find it extremely rude.
"Just to add to this, just because a doctor tells you you are infertile doesn’t mean you are 100% infertile. I had Doctors tell me my whole life i could never have kids due to some very serious internal trauma I experienced when I was younger. I never used the pill with my partners because I thought what’s the point, I’m infertile, we are monogamous, and we’ve been tested. I had sex almost every day in my twenties (when I had a significant other), always unprotected, never once got pregnant. 

Then I met my now husband, and low and behold bam pregnant. Like 1 year into knowing him. And then, 3 more times after that!  How could a person who was deemed infertile have 3 healthy boys (and another on the way?) because doctors aren’t always right. 

So keep faith, and if it doesn’t happen, then absolutely, adopt, get a surrogate, whatever you have to do to have that family you so badly want to have!"
"Maybe he does coke on the bathroom. Maybe he fucks chicks in the bathroom. It's called projecting, and he's putting what he does on you. 

Doesn't matter. 

What matters is...get. the. fuck. away. from him "
This post is ignoring a *looot* of context and catastrophizing a non-catastrophic situation.
"I really hate that women are damned if they do, damned if they don't, when it comes to trusting men. If you don't trust men then you're paranoid and judgmental, and are told ""not all men..."" but if you do trust a man, then you're naive and foolish. 

I mean... fuck it-- make up your mind society! "
"I pee sitting down, it's more comfortable and I'm pretty sure it's proven to be better for your bladder idk?

The toilet seat being cold is BS becuase if you had to poop you wouldn't stand up for that aswell.

It's her apartment her rules, it's not like it's a major thing to sit down"
"I agree with the advice here that you need to have a one-on-one talk with him. But you're asking if you need to ""confront"" him and the answer to that is no. It's not going to convince him that you respect him, if you go into the conversation trying to disprove his belief that you don't like him. That will come across as hostile and make it seem like you're trying to quash the rumor for your own benefit. 

Instead, open up to him. Make yourself a bit vulnerable - explain to him what you typed here, that you feel a bit intimidated by how well he carries himself and that causes you to act in stupid ways. Talk to him about the things you respect about him. You should apologize for how you've acted, because even unintentionally you were rude and disrespectful, but don't apologize with the aim of forcing forgiveness out of him - rather as a way to show him that you truly respect him. 

But you also will need to listen. True understanding is a two-way bridge, and it won't be enough to force your thoughts on him in hopes of forgiveness. You'll also need to give him space to talk to you about how you've acted towards him. Maybe ask what you can do to facilitate better communication between you, or what he needs from you. People of color and other minority groups aren't always given equal room to speak up, even in situations directly involving them and their mistreatment. The best way you can show you truly respect him is by letting him say what he needs to you."
"Weird? Yes. It is outside the norm.

Wrong? No. It is just about the sweetest offer, and it will help your wife feel more connected to the baby the two of you will have.

---

Hopefully I can find the words to say this without being offensive. To society at large, having a baby with a sperm donor is out of the norm. For many, married lesbians is also out of the norm. Finally, having a baby with your wife's brother's sperm is an extremely rare thing in the world.

But none of that matters. No one is normal. Or, IMHO, you are the norm that you measure the rest of the world against. What you need to wondering is ""is it good?""

One of the purest things in the world is a child brought into the world by parents who want to devote themselves to raising that child to the best of their ability. This child will be even more lucky, because s/he will also have an ""uncle"" who will be equally devoted to him/her. Honestly, I hope you guys are up for a second in the future, and that your BIL is will to be a donor then as well.

---

TL;DR; Never worry about weird. Worry about wrong. This is not wrong."
"Sorry if this doesn't fit the thread but it's happy!

* I ended a (couple month) relationship that wasn't working, and she took it well despite being sad. This is a big deal for me because I tend to let myself stay in relationships that aren't working for me just so my partner will be happy.
* I'm relieved to be single, it's what's good for me right now!
* I went on a date Monday and it went well, we got along and he's also not looking for a relationship so I'm going out with him again today

"
"The word you're looking for is ""selfish."" Getting an animal and not taking care of it is not smart."
"Amen I grew up in a similar dynamic. It was a miserable childhood full of anxiety and unhappiness. Your child is a toddler now but what happens when he's a bit older or learns to drive and now it becomes his job to take his mom everywhere? When he has to take her to the post office and grocery store? When he's not allowed a healthy independence of his own bc his mom is dependent on him? I feel for you, but I empathize with your child so much. "
"&gt; we're meeting up later this week to return things.

DO NOT GO ALONE"
Indiana would beg to differ.
"Some things you might have never had a bad reaction to may come up as you hit different milestones. I had a very unhealthy childhood as well and echo the recommendation for therapy. You may come into new situations that affect you in surprising ways, but just don't give up! Continue to seek therapy and work through figuring out what's healthy. "
"You have to stop funding her business at this rate - if it's not self-sustaining, then she needs to get a job and pay for the losses herself. If you want to stay together,  tell her that you think her work is great and that you believe in her, but that you have growing resentment toward her for losing both of your money. Maybe you can tell her what you would like to use that money for (a vacation, a house, kids, etc). 

She's not willing to compromise? She needs to grow up. You're not asking her to give up her dream, you're asking her to pay for it.  Maybe she'll break up with you, but then she'll still need to get a job...  So that's probably not ideal for her.  Plenty of artists work part time or full time to fund their passions. "
"""Aryan beliefs"" just call it racism."
"I know you're probably coming from a good place, and it might be lost in text, but this comes across like you have an incredibly self serving view of relationships.

I really dont see how anyone can justify someone implying they'd rather ditch their partner on an international trip by themselves so they could get hit on by randoms with someone they just met. It just screams self centered/narcissistic behaviour or ""I get mine so who cares about your feelings!!!"".

Also, if they are in a relationship - his feelings are as entitled to her efforts as her freedoms are entitled his respect. Advocating for only one is unfair and unbalanced. If it doesn't work for them then they need communicate more or break up, but not lie about it - thats just manipulative with weak justifications."
"To be fair, we have no idea what OP and her best friend's friendship looks like. Maybe it is inappropriate. Or maybe his fiancee is very jealous. Either way, I'd step away from this drama."
"I'm sorry to say this, but if his life is in jeopardy, there is nothing they can legally do to you worse than not let you see your brother. If he does die, you'll forever regret not doing everything in your power to see him. "
"I also think it's important to note that kids can need different parenting techniques. If you feel this approach wouldn't work on your child, you may very well be right."
Tell your mom to instead drop the asking price on the house until it's a steal. She needs to get rid of it immediately.
"I'm sure you know this already, but opals are extremely fragile and wearing long-term isn't usually realistic. Treat it carefully!"
We past subtle by about 10 miles ago. Holy cow. I couldn't imagine wearing $20k on my finger on a daily basis. I would be a basket case. 
"Get the money upfront plus a little extra for a new deposit when the lease is up. Tell him that's your price for silence(if you don't want to lie then just leave out words like continual or forever silence-he's shit so who cares). He would probably lose a lot more in a divorce. After you're situated tell the wife. There's probably no rush for her to know. You might be able to wait until you're out of that place and living somewhere he has no idea about. Presumably he was able to financially care for both ""families"" and it seems like he prefers the full-on secret affair with decent women so STD risk to her is low (get yourself tested though just in case that's way off)

Making him responsible for his financial obligations isn't contributing to infidelity. He put you in a horrible spot. That's why you need to get the money up front. If she finds out she could cut his financial support off after he spins a different tale to her."
"exactly! If I were to ever give up the bed, someone on their honeymoon would be the BOTTOM of the list..."
"Yep, plus I'm guessing her fiancé didn't have any experience either before the siblings came to live with them, yet he did what had to be done and they're not even his own sisters and brother! So yeah, definitely not an excuse!

Honestly it reads like OP's fiancé had to give attention to four needy people, OP included! If he was the one posting I wonder if people here wouldn't be telling him to run for the hills."
"Just because someone's mad at you doesn't mean you did anything wrong. Is this what you really really want to do? Then do it. They're adults and will get over it. If they don't, they're clearly worried more about *your* wedding being what *they* wanted it to be. Don't get me wrong, I understand wanting to include everyone, and if you're not that bothered and would like family there, go for it. But it sounds like this idea really speaks to you.

Ultimately you have to choose - would you rather be unhappy because you're not having your dream wedding, or unhappy because your family are annoyed? Personally I'd say do the elopement, because if you're going to feel bad either way, better to balance that out with the amazing wedding you actually want? The alternative is being sad and also having a disappointing wedding day, which sounds pretty miserable all round."
"Not only that, but it seems like they chose to tell HIM over their own parents. They love and trust him so much that they would confide in him. This is hearbreaking :("
"It's totally normal to feel this way. You're probably scared because deep down you don't feel like you deserve his kindness. Don't overthink it, enjoy his company, and let yourself be happy."
"Unfortunately, it is not OP and her sibling's job to be that support system. They didn't ask to have this sibling, have made it clear that they won't support it, and they shouldn't have to put their life on hold for them. They might not even want a connection to their mother after this, and interacting with the sibling would force that interaction. So yes, the baby is innocent, but OP and her siblings don't have to consider it their family or offer it any support."
"**STOP**

You all need to stop playing amateur psychiatrists here, because this is not how delusions work or are cured.

Call your family medical doctor. Ask them what to do. He's gonna need involuntary committal, inpatient time, medication, all under professional care.

None of what your family proposes is even *safe*, never mind effective - it may even make him think you are all part of the conspiricy against him, and then  you've lost all chance of influencing him or helping him."
"&gt;Being with him as he is, or being with someone who is the way you want him to be?

She wants to be with the man she dated.  For 4 years, it worked out fine then once they got married he started slacking off. It's not like he acted this way all through dating. She *was* dating someone she wanted to be with so wth happened that now he's acting different? "
"Call campus security whenever she's there and Mary is not, as well as whenever she loses it at you. You can either just move out, or be more stubborn than she is. Or simply go over her head and go to whoever's above the RA and keep going up until something is done. With any hope, they'll ban her from the room/building/campus. "
"I can understand being concerned by your boyfriend's reaction.  I can see someone wondering if it's a red flag and possibly re-evaluating how they feel about being with someone who said those things, in any circumstance.  

But that's not what you're doing.  You're focused on getting an apology, on being in the right.  You do seem rather self-centered.  Why even mention that you couldn't find him for ""a fucking hour,"" as if that's some unspeakable inconvenience?   And you've really glossed over how bad this injury is.  He needed an ambulance, he still had the knife in his foot at the hospital, and he needed to spend the night.  I mean, holy shit lady, couldn't you have given him a day?"
Wow...how does your wife feel about your decision?
"&gt;He did apologize and say he understands that I'm hurt but I don't know how to forgive him. Is this something I should just accept because of him being on the spectrum?  

I don't think this has anything to do with him ""being on the spectrum"" and you yourself admitted that he's barely on there anyway. I think he just goofed up, didn't handle the situation very well and then apologised afterwards.  

So no, you shouldn't forgive him because ""he's on the spectrum"", you should forgive him because it was a pretty minor mistake for which he has apologised. What's the alternative, exactly? Break up with him? Make this a huge argument which drags on for weeks? I understand it was awkward for you, but it sounds a little bit like you're blowing it out of proportion."
"All the reasons you ""like"" her are things she is giving to you: attention, sex, and support. You didn't list a single thing you actually like about *her* so no you shouldn't stay with her. Someone else will be attracted to her and love her for who she is not just what they can get from her. 

Let her go. "
"It's been 5 years since the broken engagement and he is still feeling the effects, letting it happen naturally doesn't seem to be working. This isn't a you problem, and if you try really hard to be the perfect girlfriend to try and make him propose to you and he still doesn't propose, it's going to hurt your self esteem and start making you resentful.  It sounds like he needs to more actively process his feelings. I'd recommend therapy to him at this point."
"I'm curious. Is it a good idea to take the short term job with a prospect of a more permanent job offer afterwards when you don't plan to continue working there? It seems like a bad idea for the company and for her future jobs if they call for a recommendation.

OP, I think there's more to this situation. She specifically didn't move in with you before because of her ""cat"" wouldn't like that yet she has no problem relocating the cat when she has something SHE wants to do? Sounds pretty selfish."
"At 21, she is still establishing who she is, what are the important things to her, and what her life could be. She is still in a season of rapid change and growing up.

At 34, even if you are a ""late bloomer"", your personality, thoughts, things of importance should all be fairly well established.

While maturity and life experience are not mutually inclusive, there is no way for her to have the same maturity level as your average 34 year old. Adding to that is the fact that a very mature 21 year old will only continue to mature with increased life experience. 

The only way for a 34 year old to be on the same level as a 21 year old is if the 34 year old is extremely immature. This is why these large age gap relationships (especially when the younger party is under 25) are such a bad idea; the younger party will continue to mature and either stunt themselves to stay on the level of their immature older partner, or they will outgrow their older partner.

If the girl was here, we would all be warning her that the only 34 year old guys who want to date 21 year olds are predators, or man-children."
"How often do you sleep there?  Does she ever randomly show up when you are there? Probably not, right?  That means it's not random and he is deliberately inviting her over when you are not there.  They are, at very least, still having sex.  My guess is that they are still more involved than that."
"I don't know whats cultural, but the meals sounds so small and low calorie, it really sounds like mom has an eating disorder."
"I agree, OP should have gone after incident one or two, it was a pattern, and he was escalating. I'm more concerned that OP didn't actually leave, he broke up with her because he's ridiculous (he also probably doesn't mean it and will try to get her back)."
"I got married at 22, because I had all my shit together. No debt, both graduated from college, and we bought a house. That does not mean everyone at 22 is ready for marriage. Everyone’s timeline is different. "
"I'm going to talk with her today. I tend to doubt myself a lot, especially if I have a negative feeling about someone else. The comments here have really helped to solidify my gut feeling that this is not okay, so I do not want to continue our relationship anymore."
"Surprisingly enough, none yet. Which is really nice. "
But it's not normal or healthy he isn't allowed to say no.
"Just going to put this out there: it's OK to feel insecure when your life partner masterbates to other women in his life. Like, that's pretty fucked up.


It's great that you want to work on you feeling less secure with your body, but it's a totally natural and understandable reaction. Even if you do feel banging about your bod, would it make what he did (or might do in the future again) ok?


If you honestly feel like no, it wouldn't, I just want you to know, I would feel the same way. Had a partner actually who had a porn addiction and did the exact same thing with his friends. I wasn't OK with it, and fuck damn, I'm happy with my bod. So please don't feel guilty if this  how you end up feeling about the situation.


Besides that, sounds like you have a good grasp of how to process this and move forward. Best of luck."
Some can't be polite enough to break it before cheating occurs. 
"Yeah she seemed to be moving way faster than he was comfortable with, and faster than most people would expect. It's only been 2 months, that's barely any time at all. Everyone moves at different paces, but they should still be in that honeymoon phase, not the ""we really need to work on us"". If a 2 month relationship already had these issues I would call it quits too."
"&gt; why waste your energy on this?

exactly this is so dumb."
"I'm sorry, but tl;Dr should be : got drunk, made the decision to cheat on my boyfriend, then decided I didn't care enough about my relationship to tell him and make things right, then put myself in a risky position with the same guy, then decided to cheat on my boyfriend again, and now I'm trying to say I'm not a cheater and it's just because I'm not happy so it's justified.

Stop justifying yourself. You cheated. Repeatedly. And you don't even feel that guilty about it. You're just trying to make yourself feel better. This is all about how you feel, how you're sad, how you're torn, and how this guy you cheated with is amazing.

At this point, it doesn't even sound like the relationship is worth saving, and it sounds like your boyfriend deserves better. Break up and stop trying to feel good about yourself, you shouldn't."
"You can call people in the ICU, if they can answer the phone."
"Yeah, hurting someone and boiling it down to""legal troubles"" would make me reconsider someone's humanity. "
"That's what stood out to me too. OP seems to buy into the whole superior twin shtick, even if unconsciously. Her sister was emotionally and psychologically destroyed in her formative years; she never stood a chance to get away. The fact that OP is still speaking to her parents and giving them enough info for them to continue with the comparisons shows how she's still playing this game. It's horrifying "
"OP has already messaged her this:

&gt;  ""i don't mean to be rash but i don't think you should be my maid of honor""

... OP if you dont mean to be rash why did you make such a massive decision so impulsively on the back of an entirely imagined slight?"
"oh, it's definitely extra, you're not wrong. I think that's why I love it."
"You're in the algorithm because your friends have all been clicking / interacting with these articles and that's how it gets onto your feed. Facebook does violate your privacy, it tracks everything about you, and everything about everyone connected to you and then it puts 1+1 together and sometimes gets 3 instead of 2. It's not cosmic. Facebook isn't trying to split you up. Facebook is just trying to make money and throw content at you it thinks is relevant because that's how the algorithm works.

Stop letting other people drastically influence your emotional status. If you're happy with him, be happy with him. Don't be unhappy because your friends are unhappy. Yes, a lot of relationships end. There are also a lot of people who have been married and happy families for decades. There are people married for 50+ years. Look at some positive stories if the negative ones are getting you down.

Don't get trapped in an echo chamber that has you just nodding along with everyone else just to fit in with the crowd rather than forging your own opinion."
"&gt; I think how you feel is perfectly understandable.

Yes.

&gt; And of course you don’t want to stay friends with her!

That would be fine, but.

&gt; she can't be with me because she could never see herself having kids with me because of my race.

Total racist bullshit.

&gt; And right now from where I'm sitting on the bathroom floor I'm coming to the conclusion that it's not my face, how much money I make, my stupid dad jokes, my politics, or whatever, it's because I'm asian that almost everyone I've ever liked has rejected me.

 Nope, just racist assholes. Do you really think all other Asians hate you because you are Asian?

Move to a more urban area  and you will enjoy a much more welcoming environment.




"
"I see it as a scapegoat too - I guess I'm more so echoing the kind of excuse I get from him. 

Unfortunately, I make a lot of big batch crock pot meals at home. They're healthy and save us some money as well. Despite me making them and him seeming excited by my doing so, he rarely ends up eating it... 

This is the biggest problem with him. When we've had 'lets do better' conversations in the past without going into mention of his weight. He's always enthusiastic and excited talking about it, but when it comes to action, it just doesn't happen from his side."
"You’re young so let me give you some advice: a man who sees himself as “incredibly rational” is 1) not nearly as rational as he thinks, 2) is a *giant waving red flag*. 

This probably sounds really condescending but, I’ve been there. We’ve all been there. These dudes are terrible. "
"I’m furious the worst is he does not even realise what’s wrong, I feel I’m in the twilight zone!"
"I am definitely jumping on the ""parents need liquid cash/possibly have an addiction issue"" bandwagon. OP sounds pretty responsible and holding down a job and full time school doesnt lead much time for partying. I know it sounds ridiculous to some people for OP to expect that 15k in tuition help but thats actually about what the people at FAFSA would expect as parental contribution at their income level. Its a truly shitty thing to do to your kid to pull the financial rug out like this. OP's parents are either selfish assholes who read the wrong parenting article or they are ass out financially due to some bad personal decisions and they are too chickenshit to admit it to OP. "
"For Facebook, lock it down so that co-worker only sees the public stuff. Can you block him on social media?

Is it possible to only be professional with him? Don't engage in any non work conversation.

He sounds like a ""nice guy"". Keep your distance and be boring around him."
"If your depression is so severe that you are neglecting your health and hygiene, then you need to see a therapist YESTERDAY.

Furthermore, you let things get so bad that it impacted HER ability to live her life. Week old dirty dishes and bedbugs are not a joke, and if someone had done that in MY HOUSE I'd have kicked them out and made them pay pest-control fees.

I understand why your sister's behavior is confusing to you, but she's not exactly wrong in feeling the way she does.

Slamming a fridge door on you, though, that's not okay. 

Still, if I were you I would seek new living arrangements elsewhere and back away from her for a bit: Sounds like you both have some shit to work on about yourselves."
Medical reasons wouldn't really matter because family history would be the same as the wife's. I doubt kids would ask too much.
"I was with you until the feminine bit. I think people don't like OP because OP is rude, sounds like a huge drag and is clearly a misogynist to boot, but I know lots of butch/masc women who are a huge hit with men. "
"Agreed. I don't think this is at all 'explicit'. I understand it's uncomfortable, and I don't think you need to embrace talking about her sex life with gusto nor giving any *actual* explicit advice, but I also think just buying her a book / directing her to somewhere on the internet runs the risk of shutting her down and going back to feeling secretive and shameful about wanting to have a physical relationship with her husband. "
"It says you'll lose points for ""missing class"". It doesn't say ""missing all of a class period"". You were late. You missed part of class. You lost points.

You have nothing to stand on here. You are in the wrong, accept it."
"Yep, that's where you draw a line. ""Keeping the peace"" isn't helping anyone. 

Stand up for the kids. Tell her you will leave too if she doesn't seek counseling for her child abuse. "
"Right here in this question you remain distant, accusatory and condescending towards your wife. 

Her value is a mother and servant to the family, and everything else in her life is written off (her volunteering, and her frustration with you) as if they are *her failure*, rather than her completely valid feelings and beliefs. You bury the lede (you cheated, you remain distant and disengaged from home life despite moving your mother into the home) and excuse your lousy treatment and attitude towards her as ""ingrained"". That's just a way to blame her and excuse yourself for not making the necessary improvements.

I think you should get your own ass into therapy with the goal of *changing your own destructive and unkind behaviours towards your wife and family*. 

You also need to respect her if she says she wishes to leave and recognize she may still be a good mother, maybe even be free to be a *better* mother, if she is not in a marriage where she is miserable and chronically undervalued."
I intend on fully supporting her no matter what happens.
"Nope. I'm a SAHM but I'm not a housewife. It was important to my husband that I contribute to our family in a meaningful way, which meant I either care for our child/ren or I work. He communicated this to me and it wasn't until my daughter was about 1 that I realized how stressful it was for my husband to be the sole provider of the household. It's very intimidating to have your ""safety net"" taken away. I don't think it's unreasonable for you to expect her to work while she gets her GED. It's also extremely unwise to quit a job without another lined up. "
"Are they 'clearly her top 2' because that's what you've observed, or because she's told you? Regardless of how long you've been together, I think it's worth asking, as hearing it from her is better than relying on the assumption that you know her well enough. Plus, it's a nice indicator that you care. Just a thought."
"I don’t get why they feel you’re being used, if you’re both single, consenting adults who cares what label you’re chosen for your own relationship?

I would say maybe they’re worried he doesn’t feel the same way, all the respect and regard in addition the the intimacy, and are concerned you’re going to be hurt, but you said your friends don’t even know him, so how would they know?

Have you asked them to clarify WHY they’re being so insistent on involving themselves?"
"That’s ridiculous; your fiancé is being an ass. He doesn’t get to decide how you grieve or honour your late father. If he can’t respect your wishes or at the very least keep his mouth shut about it, then you might have bigger problems.

I hope you have a meaningful celebration of life with your family and that you’re doing alright! There’s no timeline on how to deal with the death of a loved one."
"That's the book yeah. 

Either OP is trolling, OP's friend is trolling her, OP's friend is having a genuine psychotic break, or their actually is a book called the King in Yellow that drives people who read it crazy.

I have literally never wanted something updated more than this. 
"At the end of the day, only Andrew can decide that."
"Thats a bit of a bygone myth nowadays. The risks are slightly higher, but medicine has advanced that late 30s babies are totally safe. My mom had me when she was in her 40s in the early 90s and I turned out just fine :) 

At your ages you've done a fair a lot of the ""figuring out"", I'd hardly call a 6 year gap drastic. "
"Okay, here goes. I met Beth's father when I was seventeen, and we married after I graduated from college. We were married for 18 years, so he is pretty much all I knew. 

In some ways, I think he never matured, but also his behavior deteriorated over time. By the time we separated, he had essentially checked out of our family functionally and was operating in his own reality. He lies fluidly. He disappears. His behavior tends to be manic. He manipulates. He eventually became erratic with basic adult things -- paying bills, showing up, keeping a job.

Our divorce was horrific. For about two years, our daughters essentially felt that they needed to take care of him. They were just old enough for the court to essentially allow their choice of residence, which enabled a period of severe alienation. I took appropriate legal measures, including mediation, counseling and alienation specialists. Most of all, I held the door open.

My older daughter came back first (she is currently living in NYC), and Beth followed shortly thereafter. My older daughter has rarely interacted with her father for the past 3 or 4 years. Beth's interaction has varied more. 

Beth had been living with me, when her dad and his new girlfriend moved closer to Beth's high school to facilitate her spending more time with them. She split her time between the two households, then gradually spent increasing time at her dad's house for a few months, then shifted back to my place some.

Her father abruptly called me to announce that they were kicking her out, plus cancelling her phone and her plane ticket to the family vacation to Hawaii. She was to turn in her key and phone and pick up her belongings ASAP. 

I asked what the reason was. The only explanations he gave were that she didn't do some chores and they didn't like her going back and forth between the two households. 

He hasn't had much contact with her since and moved to Nevada."
"Why not call the local Landlord and Tenants Board, they can prolly help you evict her. By now, you don't actually need proof that she's stealing, you just need to know your rights as a landlord. If you don't have a lease, in most areas you can give her 30 days notice. She hasn't even paid you rent so far, so it's not like she can make up for something she was behind on. If you share common rooms with her, there might be even better rules to kick her out faster.

For the other stuff, file a police report. Document everything. You're not a cop, go let the actual ones give you suggestions and help you out. 
"
"Maybe your parents expected you to have your own means of transportation at this age.

How many days will you be gone? Could you rent? "
"Hah yes, I love my MIL but she's terrible for saying things like ""But do you think it's worth that?"" or ""Well _I_ wouldn't..."" or ""Oh I never like to do that"" or ""But what about x?"" in a way that she's basically just saying she doesn't understand why anyone would do anything that's not exactly what she would choose."
That is a frankly immature and stupid opinion.  Perhaps she is too young and immature to have a fiance.
"Irrelevant. She is paying for the apartment, the GF is not. If she wants privacy in her own home when her actual paying roommate is not there that is her right. "
"Wtf? You have every right to want to celebrate your special day. The fact that your bf said he now doesn't want a wedding because you won't have anybody there is fucked up. Doesn't he know how sensitive you are when it comes to your lack of family? 

I would communicate with him just how hurt you are by all of this. Do you guys have any sort of premarital counseling planned? If you don't, you should. If you do, this should definitely be brought up."
"Well, as crappy as this is to say -it's a good thing you two haven't been able to have a baby if she's a narcissist. Divorce her, go total no contact with her after the divorce (and only have contact with her through a lawyer during the divorce), and get therapy."
"...and keep in mind that she may bring a kid into the picture as a way of keeping you around.  The easy way to avoid that is to never have sex with this person again.  Personally, I would never spend the night under the same roof as them again."
"It sounds like you were unclear in your communication with him, and both of you were drunk and crossing boundaries. I understand that you're uncomfortable living with him and I think you just stick with that. But you might have to be the one to leave. I don't think he assaulted you, I think you guys got physical and then you decided that you wanted it to stop. And when you got up and said you were done, it stopped. "
Please don't give up everything you have built up to follow him.  You will most likely be unhappy and regret it if you do.  If this is his path then you shouldn't try to stop him.  But I suspect he will get out there and still be unhappy because the issues he has will still be there wherever he goes.  It's not your responsibility to find his happiness for him and you shouldn't have to sacrifice yours for his anyway.  You may just be at a crossroads in your lives that you both need to make your own decisions on. Good luck.
"You are at different stages in life.  Let her go, say your goodbyes, and go your separate ways.  You would be agonizing over her every move while she is gone if you stay together and she may feel like you are holding her back from fully experiencing this adventure too.  She is young and has all of her 20s ahead of her, while you are a working adult who is almost in your 30s.  There is nothing wrong with wanting different things at this part of your lives.  And a year really isn't that long I'm the grand scheme of things."
"Telling me I'm being ""sensitive"" when someone refuses to accept my feelings and boundaries has become a deal breaker for me. It took awhile. I allowed myself to be dismissed and silenced, I grew to question myself in some cases, I pretended to ignore it while feeling resentment and distant. I continued to try to explain myself as if saying ""no"" or ""stop"" wasn't enough. Being dismissed, silenced or manipulated is just no longer acceptable to me. I hope it doesn't take you as long as it did me. "
"&gt;She was heavier than I liked but she was committed and losing weight and I liked her so we went out.

so you only starting dating her to begin with bc she had recently lost 25lbs and was now hot enough for you??

youre bringing up the spending too but tbh i feel like its just a tacked on excuse to try to keep yourself from looking like the shallow, massive douchebag that you are.

&gt;We had a talk last weekend about how I was unhappy with her weight

who fucking cares? she wasn't ""blackmailing"" or ""guilting"" you, she was calling you out on being a shallow asshole. this woman has been with you for four years. she moved with you to a strange country to support you. she obviously loves and cares about you and puts way more into this relationship than you ever did, so i dont blame her for calling you out.

you clearly dont want to be with your gf anymore. dump her and let her find a man who loves her for who she is bc she deserves much better than this."
"If you two break up, you could start dating Sarah. Then Emily would be all jealous and miss you, and that threesome thing could still happen.

"Part of my job involves analyzing outcomes from a program that advocates (often successfully) for lesser/non-incarcerative sentences in favor of mental health treatment for kids involved in the criminal justice system. Stories similar to your friend's are unfortunately common among our participants. 

But it is *somewhat* of a relief (a tiny, tiny one) that courts (in my area, at least) are increasingly recognizing the significance of childhood trauma and taking that into consideration in sentencing. And programs like ours actually seem to be working. We recently helped a traumatized kid initially facing 2 years in prison for a drug charge ultimately end up with probation, substance abuse treatment (including group and individual therapy) and vocational training. I went to a program graduation last week, where most of the graduates came from *very* fucked up backgrounds and just got the shittiest hands in life. This one guy who spoke at the ceremony had been using drugs since childhood and had spent 30+ years of his life incarcerated. And now he has his GED and a $20/hour job, and he's been dealing with his shit soberly and learning how to actually be a father. My childhood was pretty fucked up, too, and whenever I doubt my ability to break the cycle, I think about our participants. We don't have a 100% success rate and people obviously still struggle, but I'm constantly amazed at the obstacles all kinds of people can overcome. 


I really, really hope your friend is doing okay."
"I do use a pen, but everyone already knows it. I also do want this to be part of my larger body of work. It’s good for my career to have this out there...just not something my parents will be too stoked about. I really don’t think other people reading it are going to be like “omg what awful parents.” It’s more just knowing how my parents will perceive it. "
"What you are facing has broken up lots of families. Their obsession is not your fault and doesn't reflect upon you. We choose our friends, our families are forced upon us. 

Tell her everything and let her make the choice. If she decides to come, work out ways to escape when politics comes up. Don't participate in the annual argument this year and always have her back so she doesn't get overwhelmed."
"I know you mean well but, OP, do not go to James (or anyone, except a therapist) and tell him you are intimidated by him. Intimidated, in this context when coming from white people, is heavily coded language that will just add fuel to the fire because James already clearly knows you have a problem with him. 

You can try using different language, but I don’t think this is salvageable. As a black woman, even from the way you describe it, your actions seem rooted in racism. 


"
Friendly and positive and willing to work on yourself sounds like a good place to start.

"Ok, this lady is a grade-a asshole. "
"OP, alternate take: right now it doesn’t really matter if this is genuine mental illness or manipulation or some combination of the two; what matters is that it’s been months (or apparently YEARS, according to his mom) and he hasn’t made any real progress. You’re going to work yourself into the ground (I bet you’ve seen nurses burn out before, right?) and then *your* life will fall apart too, and he will *still not be better* because killing yourself for him *isn’t helping.* There is no amount of love and gentleness and paying his bills and doing his laundry that will fix whatever’s broken in him. Only he can do that. You could spend the rest of your life pouring energy into that black hole and never fill it, and lady, this is the only life you get. 

So here’s a question for you: if you knew it was going to be like this for another year, would you stay? What about another five years? Ten? Because it sure looks like that’s what you’re in for. If you burn yourself out trying to keep him afloat, do you think he’d step up and get a job and take care of you the way you’re taking care of him? Would he do it next year? Five years? How long are you willing to wait for him to be an actual partner to you?"
"That's exactly the reason why you talk about marriage *before* publicly proposing. If you don't know the answer to the question beforehand, either don't propose at all or at least do it privately. "
"half of your post is about him not letting you go out with friends, making snide remarks about staying home, etc. this fact isn't a small thing to people. he doesn't trust you, he might think that if you're always with the kids then you can't be out cheating. "
"Uh just because she proposed doesn't mean she's ""obsessed"" with marriage. You've been dating for 2 years and you're almost 40. I don't think she's being unreasonable. This is not a red flag. A 35 year old man in a 2 year relationship saying he needs a few more years to decide is a flaming red flag."
"I bet it's both. She might be controlling, but then her kids go and do something like run into the street when they can see a car coming. It's like a parents worst nightmare. She's obviously not handling it well, yet I wonder if the doctors have told her to avoid letting the brother visit for now. She may even be dealing with some sort of legal/insurance aspect that the OP isn't aware of. 

And I'm just gonna put this out there at risk of sounding crazy or controlling myself, but if my son ever did something like this there's no way in hell I would let him out on his own already, especially if I had another son that has been hospitalized with serious injuries. 

The only advice I would give OP is to try and call but otherwise ride this out. There will be time hopefully in the future for more calm and reasonable discussions about these circumstances. And maybe OP could just tell him mom that's he's sorry but she is hurting his feelings. Simple and direct statements can go a long way for people who are feeling completely out of control."
"What the fuck?!?!!?

I'm guessing you're also a massive creep."
"Seconding this. My boyfriend has a bunch of women friends that I'm perfectly happy and comfortable with, but your description of that video made me uncomfortable. "
"There’s a lot of ‘I thinks’ in this post and nothing concrete. Chances are Nina and Dan can’t remember they had that conversation (I can’t easily recall previous conversations). And even so, if it was a conversation they had outside it wasn’t something they were keeping secret and it’s not like you were literally bugging their house. If one of my neighbours did the same, I’d be like ‘oh you heard?’ And probably more likely be wondering what stupid things I’d said which they also overheard not that they were creepy (oh crap if they heard me talking can they hear me singing to myself?!!). Not thinking they were weird for hearing it, it’s just what happens when you live so close to people.

I think it’s far more likely your social anxiety is making you think things aren’t there (like Nina’s face and Dan cancelling on you)

Don’t worry about it basically, this is not a big deal, just carry on as you were. "
"Echoing the chorus here:

Don't put your life on hold. If you guys are still going strong in 2020, and end up further apart, you'll figure out how to navigate that then. In the meantime, putting your plans hold for almost three years is absurd. 

Also, doctoral students often run longer than their scheduled graduation date, which means that this could be a total nonissue - either you guys are further separated for a very short period of time, or you're out of law school by the time he's got a job somewhere. 

"
"&gt; Great dads are also great husbands.

Excellent comment. And honestly, I think this is the key for a good marriage. Growing up, I watched my mom do so much. She worked full-time, came home and cooked dinner for everyone (dad was supposed to be served first with the table set up especially for him), is in charge of everyone's emotional needs, has to cater to all and any guests my dad brings home, and manage the day-to-day running of the house (groceries, carpooling, etc). 

I rarely saw my dad cook dinner for us. My dad only goes grocery shopping when *he* wants something. I've seen my dad make my mom cry more times than a child should have to see. 

My dad taught me that I never wanted to marry a man like my father. I don't respect my father. I don't like him. I don't even think I love him. 

Fathers (and mothers) should set an example to their children of what healthy relationships look like."
"Man what shitty timing. My usual response would be tell her immediately. But I've given birth this year. I know what it's like, physically, and mentally, and if I had found out a few days before giving birth that my husband was leading a double life and cheating on me with a long-term affair it would have destroyed me. Absolutely destroyed me. 

At the same time I WOULD want to know. I would leave him and I would be grateful to the person for telling me... but ugh, maybe let her survive the birth and first few weeks first I guess? It's a toughie, especially since you don't know the woman so I doubt you really know what her personality is like and whether she has close friends/family she can rely on over what will undoubtedly be an incredibly tough time of being a new mum and finding out your husband is a lying scumbag.

I'd still want to know though once I was home and had gotten through the first few sleepless weeks, 100%."
"There are so many women that will want you and find you enormously attractive. You need to move, be in a larger centre and maybe make a more diverse group of friends. I grew up in place with a large Asian population and Asian men had plenty of dates, and there were plenty of mixed race families and kids. Try Vancouver, Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, Toronto - as places where your race won't make you stand out."
" If you say so. I can't believe that anyone wouldn't even have a decent pair of flats that are suitable to walk around in a tour in.

"It was Matt's decision to invite his girlfriend along. Your girlfriend is not dating Anna. She's being accommodating, inviting her along, etc. This is her trip too, and she's spending her own money. It's not fair for you all to ask her to change her plans to suit Anna just because she happens to be the other vagina-owner on the trip. Maybe Anna needs to go home early if she's having such an awful time. Like yes it sucks that Matt may not be able to do everything with you guys, but he's the one that pushed to bring a third party on a friend trip. "
"This blows my mind. I've worked for years with victims of DV and the closest thing I've seen to this happening is a victim recanting their story after the initial arrest. IE- cops showed up during/just after the DV, hauled off the abuser, victim then changed their mind and bails out the abuser and pretends all is fine. Abuser still gets charged with assault.

But to charge someone with DV days/weeks/whatever-the-time-frame after the fact, based on 3rd party information?! Baffling.
Jared is absurd. Working with Child Protective Services one of my go-to lines with parents (especially when it's clear to me that the allegations are bogus) is ""wouldn't you rather have someone looking out for your child just in case something *did* happen?"" But in this case, Jared seems to be taking it WAY too far. I really hope he backs off."
"Disappointed? I understand.

Frustrated? I understand. 

Childishly insisting that a person MUST put up with behavior forever that he or she decides isn't working for them because anything else isn't ""fair""?  That I really don't understand. 

"
Even if you asked her out first... she was a 20 year old woman getting hit on by a hormonal 16 year old. The fact that she knew you since you were 14 just makes it worse. 
"What about telling her you're worried about her. That (presumably) you notice her mood swings happening more often, or becoming more severe, or both. Or that they're taking a toll on your relationship. That you're worried about her health, that you're frightened, that you need her to see a professional, that you wouldn't forgive yourself if anything happened to her, that her depression is wearing you down.

Do any of those sound workable?"
Yea so he's not actually getting over it. He's just burying his feelings continuously till they explode. 
"I think this situation is indicative of some far more serious issues with depression that your girlfriend has.  That's a gigantic overreaction to something that's entirely innocuous. So no, I'd say don't just continue to shower with her forever, but maybe attempt to broach the subject of her getting some professional help."
"Well, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's start with:

In this life, not everyone is going to love you.  And that's okay.  You can't *make* people love you if they don't want to in the first place, and if they don't act loving anyway, is it any big loss if they don't?

I think you need to give up on hoping for your boyfriend's mother's love.  The reason why is because her reaction to you leaving was NOT a normal, healthy reaction.  Name-calling (her calling you spoiled and high maintenance) is not a healthy way to argue.  I think most people would be embarrassed to have rodents and bugs in their house.   A normal reaction to embarrassment is to apologize, not to attack.  That's a sign of a toxic person.

I think it's very telling that your boyfriend is willing to go no contact with his mother over this, and I think you should sincerely consider following his lead on that.  It's likely that there have been a lot of other instances of her doing shit like this, probably all throughout his childhood, and he seems sick of her shit.  He's the one that knows her best and has had to put up with her his whole life.  It's his family, let him handle how much you guys see them.  

Don't push for a reconciliation that he doesn't want, because it will most likely just end in you getting treated badly again.  No offense, but you say you've already been in one abusive relationship; it's possible you just aren't great at recognizing toxic people and those who want to take advantage of you.  His mom certainly seems to be one of those people. "
"Has she given the money back? Because that's theft?

Does she realise that if she slapped an adult it would be assault and battery?

Those kids need help and support, not physical, emotional and mental abuse.

Shame on your wife.

And a side eye to you.  You do need to advocate more for them and stand up for them.  Insist on this family counselling plus anger management."
"*What's stopping her from just stabbing you next time?*

This is a very reductive and harmful view of someone who is suffering with mental illness and has never displayed aggression to someone else. This is not helping OP."
Let this guy go he deserves better.
Can you ask someone to come with you.  What effort is your boyfriend making to see that you're generally comfortable?  The way your family treated him is the norm but your boyfriend as his family seem like very unwelcoming people to impose all these rules on you and not think about your needs.
"He's probably also ""shoulder surfing"" via the hidden cameras so he will know any new password she would put in.  She needs to password protect the phone in a location far away from home, like a business's rest room."
"Totally correct if I'm reading this wrong, but the way you've worded the outcome to the meeting is more along the combative line, like you're annoyed that Dad took her side and annoyed that her apology was poor - whereas I felt in your post you were conflicted over your relationship with GF not just hanging out to prove them wrong.

I guess what I'm trying to say is maybe you need to work out where to from here, are you wanting to reconcile the relationship or are you thinking that maybe you aren't as close to GF as you thought. If you are trying to work it out, you might have to accept their point of view is at *least* their point of view     "
"If they ignored an urgent question that needs to be answered, it's probably rude. If it's just aimless banter, like I miss you, how is your day going, work sucks, what's your favourite Pokemon -- then it's no big deal."
"But.... 8 incidents in 3 months and you're in here surprised? He was manipulating you. Even that fake break up where he was upset because you were willing to let him walk away was very telling.

Girl. You should have run. I'd be examining why you didn't!"
"I was going to say this.  Because what if bf's response is ""LOL that's cool hun.""  Wouldn't want to stay in that relationship.  "
"I'm not trying to be an asshole here but if this guy is an abuser, he is a master of manipulation and control. It's not a reach to think that he's charmed your counselor into thinking he's a decent guy too (why are you in counseling together anyway?) Is this the first time she's met with you alone? Does she think his financial control of you is okay?

Finally, you have a son. Would you advise him to treat his future wife the way you are being treated? Because he will."
"I agree with asking /r/legaladvice 

Ignore her, do not reply. Keep all messages she sends you."
This entire relationship is a trainwreck.
Tbh he's got no right to complain and be pissed because you asked him his opinion and informed him of the size and placement changes. And he said go for it. So he needs to suck it up.
"I was bullied pretty horrifically as a child. The worst of my bullies never apologised and, when I see them in my old hometown whilst visiting family, they ignore me, but a couple I have made friendly acquaintance with because people do change.

Personally, I’ll never totally forgive my bullies, so I wouldn’t even have the close relationship OP has with Andrew. However I’d still argue that it’s andrews decision to make - he had enough choices taken away as a kid, this one should be his.

I couldn’t do it myself, but then none of my bullies ever explicitly apologised or made any sincere reparation for what they did - although some of them have turned out to be nice people whom I am aware have changed significantly. In Andrews case... if I could be big enough to really forgive a sincere apology, then maybe. But he should get to decide."
"For real, if this isn't just a fake account. Everything she says sounds like a stereotype of what some right wing nut would say to impersonate a socialist."
"Did you at least give her the context that the person you hurt was an abusive, terrible person? 

In another comment, you call him ""mean"" and say you ""didn't like him."" 

I'm gleaning from the general story that he was an abusive and awful person, but if you didn't tell her that and downplayed it by calling him ""mean"" or ""undeserving of my mom,"" your girlfriend could be wrongly misinterpreting this as you were a teenager who didn't like that your mom was dating, or he had some strict rules that you didn't like and you lashed out.

Obviously that doesn't sound like the case here. But if you danced around the facts a little, as you did in the comments here, it could be she's misunderstanding.

I can't imagine reacting the way she did if she really understands it was a self-defense/defending your mom/pushed to the edge kind of thing.

Also, as others have said, it is really important to tell her how this changed your views and your view of yourself especially."
"I think it's more along the lines of ""sexual assault"" but yes. This was definitely a non-consent type situation and he should have consequences."
"""But they have terrrrrrrorists there"" 
""Call me twice a day on fb so i know you are alive""
""Why cant you go to somewhere safer like Chicago or Las Vegas? "" 

Haha, we went to Japan which is one of the safest countries, currently. Blew their mind for months before the trip.  "
Have you tried not posting this every week and getting some therapy like we've told you many times over?
Maybe she doesnt give a shit about penis size hence her bored response. What was she supposed to say? 
You'll get over that and find someone else to like/love.
"Pssht, that would be ridiculous. It was clearly meant to be a bag of decks, which is perfectly feasible if your bag is big enough."
"I was going to add the exact same thing. If it was a vacation that was supposed to be an adults thing/for SIL in some way, I would understand her reaction. But this is a family trip, one where the entertainment of the adults is being JUST as considered as the entertainment of the children.
She is making it about her when it is about family.

My SO and I are childfree and both agree that this was an overreaction. Also, JAPAN IS AWESOME! We want to honeymoon there"
"So what you're saying is there are tons of bad things your husband does and you're checking with us if one of them is enough to leave? 

Any of them is enough to leave him. Please. Leave him. "
"&gt; She said she doesn't know what's wrong, and that I haven't done anything wrong, but why would she cheat on me?

Relationships that start when you're very young are at a lot of disadvantages for lasting throughout your young adulthood. You both are changing a ton and will continue until you're in your mid 20's, you don't know if a partner who is compatible with you in your teens will still be compatible in your 20's, your lives are changing frequently with school and getting settled into your career, there's often a bit of moving around involved, you don't have the relationship experience to know what to do when things are getting tough, one or both of you may feel restless and wonder what else is out there, etc. It sounds like she's somewhat checked out of the relationship and didn't know how to communicate that to you, so she went on a date with someone else.

I don't think this relationship is salvageable. I think you should try and learn from what happened and do your best to move on. It's going to be hard, losing your first serious relationship is hard, but it can be a tremendous learning and growing experience to help you eventually end up in a happy long-term adult relationship."
reading this thread has made me so uncomfortable. If i'm seriously honest with myself this is the top reason i will never have a kid. 
"As someone that has depression and struggles with cleaning, especially with a husband that doesn't really help much with housework, this sounds a lot like a depression/mental health issue."
"From OP’s responses consistently protecting and putting Nicole first, I really wonder if more hasn’t gone on than we are being told."

""Private wedding"" seems to cover it.

"Ding Ding Ding! As long as his sleep and sex life isn't taking a huge hit, this is definitely mom's decision. She is the one still dealing with night time nursing. Having your baby right next to you to nurse is SO much easier. I did it with 3 babies! 

OP, your kid will NOT be 18 years old and still sleeping with you, I promise. And your wife obviously loves having her baby in bed with her, so I don't see the problem. "
"OP, do not get her 50 shades of grey, it is not a healthy dom/sub relationship and she should not base her sexual knowledge on such crap."
"I think it’s kind of a silly thing to fixate on. Did you tell him *beforehand* that you wanted him to do the traditional on-one-knee thing? Because it would be unfair of you to get mad about an expectation that you didn’t communicate with him.

But on the other hand, *he* kind of acted like a defensive brat when you asked him about it! Is he frequently like that? "
"Well,  4 months is still at the getting to know you stage.

However delaying full disclosure ""till you start having kids"" is the other extreme."
You did something to someone that they'll never forget and that will haunt them and affect how they perceive relationships. So...
"You made the right choice. They're called dealbreakers for a reason. Yes, it's one thing, but some things are still very important."

Honestly... why did you post? You don’t seem to want to hear anything people have to say. At this point I’d venture to say it’s your attitude that’s holding you back. 
"&gt;I was raised that a man is the head of his house. Archaic and paternalistic I know but deeply ingrained nonetheless. I have cheated which I confessed without being caught.

i think you should only ask yourself why she didnt leave earlier man...."
"I came to say the same thing. Talk to your grandma and maybe even bring Adam along and have him explain to her that everything was so good, he couldn't refuse. Tell grandma you're not sure why your mom is blowing this out of proportion and that everyone else had a great time until she started this."
Omg. Omg. I am so sorry you had to go through with that. I want my daughter to be proud of me. It's time to stand up. 
"&gt;The bigger problem is that you and your husband can't even manage to have that argument and reach any kind of resolution to it. The time to figure this stuff out about your partner and to develop the communication skills to deal with these disagreements is BEFORE you get married and pregnant.

I tried talking to him and he got offended, refused to explain or talk to me, he called me annoying and implied I was stupid. I don't know what else to do. He storms off and it can't be resolved. We've talked about it before and he'll be more respectful for awhile but eventually something will piss him off enough to revert back to this disrespectful behavior. "
"I hear that, but the wedding was important too. Not for the color schemes and what not, but the symbolism and meaning was very powerful for me. It was an incredible kickstart to our marriage. It was a small, humble little wedding but even my normally stoic and stern husband shed some tears. It was beautiful and powerful. I know reddit tends to dislike weddings but it definitely made a big difference to my husband and me :)"
"I feel like, no matter who is right or wrong here, you shouldn't accept presents from someone you didn't get anything for...no matter what you do about your son. And no matter how you want to describe your 'selfish' girlfriend in your comments, it sound like she spends a lot more on you than vice versa, and she doesn't seem to like that. You are pretending you and your son are the victims here. But what, like, you stop vaping for a month and use that money for a gift? "
I stopped too. This is on you OP. 
"You are painting yourself in that light. Even more so with your additional comments. 

I don't have to try to understand it from anyone's perspective. You're the one who is having trouble seeing your wife's perspective. You came here specifically to ask for how to understand your wife. If you're mad at a stranger on reddit for attempting to show you ""only hers"" then maybe you have deeper issues that could be resolved with individual therapy. 

I'm not holding you or her to any standards. You are holding your wife to a standard, however, and it seems like she is failing to meet it. So, either 1. you introspect and adjust your standard and work on your relationship with her, as most people on this thread are trying to help you do, 2. you keep your standard and divorce your wife because she can't instantly articulate every feeling she has, or 3. you keep your standard but stay with your wife in this toxic environment and resent her for decades. 

I'm not the one in this relationship, dude. You gotta figure it out for yourself.
"
Thank fuck RomanPolanskisSon is here to keep this conversation on topic 🙄
"Agreed. I wonder if anyone here encouraging OP has actually been bullied as a child, because top comments seem to have no idea just how badly it messes you up. Some of us coped by trying to befriend our bullies at any price - I put myself close to my bullies too, and would have been horrified if any of them had expressed romantic interest on top of everything else. Like, do I have to do this for them as well to keep the peace?

Don't risk it, OP. Sometimes ""they were just kids"" doesn't excuse what you did. You can certainly move on, but don't ask for too much."
"what in the hell.....

1. he isn't really a good friend if he is fucking your wife
2. they are literally doing this in your home while you're there...the level of disrespect is crazy. Also, they have most likely been doing this for a long time, they are way to cocky if it just started. Maybe it been years.
3. you been married for 25 years, if you're not living in an ""at fault"" state you will get fucked. what if she wants out before ur kids go to college? then u will be fucked also
4. your ""friend"" wife most likely doesn't know, she is being cheated on for god knows how long.....that is fucked up

I don't know what you should do, because i would have lost my mind. in my own home while I am there? oh fuck no."
"I am listening to you. I very much hope that you are not correct, but obviously I have major concerns. 

I have never seen any inappropriate physical interaction at all. Rick is someone whom I and my entire family have trusted for decades.

That said, I am not sure what I can legitimately DO here. As far as I know, I don't have anything legally actionable here. Talking with Beth and Rick hasn't done anything constructive so far. "
"It's unfair towards her if you continue dismissing marriage like that, especially if you really think you owe her (like you described).

Either break up or commit. There is nothing worse that a guy who doesn't know what he wants. This is part of growing up. No one likes an adult baby. 

If you are too immature for marriage, grow up. Make decisions and stand behind them, without being a sissy. 10  years is frigging long, man. "
"What's the crime? Maybe it's unethical in the part where she's conning your dad about her sexuality. But who says you need to have sex to have a happy marriage or be in love with the partner? That marriage doesn't stop existing once your sister meets her dreamgirl, for now, this bearding relationship is bringing her a lot of benefits and she's investing in her best friend.

If your parents cannot afford to give away their fortune, they should prepare for that. Your sister isn't stealing from anyone, your parents are passing it to her as an inheritance. It's unfair to portray her as some thief, taking from her mom. This is what your parents have decided on. 

You could've tried the same con. You didn't. Now it's kind of weird to try to get your sister sued for finding a way to outsmart dad. You could try hooking up with some Republican and poop out some babies, but the other things might be harder to manage before your dad passes."
"After reading the post again I've realised OP just wanted to be told she was right and her friends wife is jealous of how amazing and YOONIQ her friendship with her bestie is. She calls her crazy multiple times and makes no attempt to understand how or why her behaviour sounds inappropriate. I think she's probably harbouring some feelings and is leaning on someone else's husband more than she should. 

I've met and love all of my husbands female friends, they are supportive and kind and would be horrified if I felt like they were disrespecting our relationship. "
"&gt; The whole industry is a ~~bit of a~~ sham

Fixed that for you.

"Ah. That’s the problem. There is a precise way to write for a lab report, research paper, or grant that isn’t the same as how you’d write for a literature class. You just need to forget your 5s in AP lit. You are working in technical English now with its own jargon and rules. Your TA’s objections are likely valid and you may want to seek assistance from the department or the school writing center to become better at technical writing. 

I had to train myself to write in technical English as expected in grants, research papers, and reports through college and getting a biomedical research PhD. Now I write short fiction and I have to train myself out of all my old science writing habits. It is doable but step one is to acknowledge that this is not literature, this is science writing. "
"Don't worry, it's not worth 20k once it walks out the door!"
You need to stop referring to your female acquaintances as friends. To you they’re only potential sex partners with the added benefit of giving you no-strings attached emotional support. 
"I was going to say YOU have the combination to the gun safe, but the two safes is a better idea (and in fact, is legally required where I live). 

If he doesn't agree to these (very reasonable provisions, given that you have young kids in the house and he has mental history), you get out and take the kids. "
"How was what she was doing ""leading on"" the coworker?  She said she wanted to be friends with the coworker, she told the coworker to cut it out when he passed into inappropriate territory, and she blocked him after the second occasion a week later.

It's clear *in retrospect* what he was doing by trying to be friendly, but we can't judge people's past actions based on events that happened later."
"You both have a point. Your past &amp; her expectations are not unreasonable. 

If you cannot come to a compromise here, then you probably aren't meant to be married.

One suggestion, Destination wedding. She can plan the hell out of it, but it would by necessity be small. "
"""I also find these nerdy white girls really attractive, and their personalities lovely.""

Tip: when you find a nerdy white girl, don't treat her as a fetish.  ""Nerdy"" is not a whole personality.  She will pick up on it if you're looking at her as a white nerd girl to pop into a trophy case."
"Strongly seconding this – it sounds from OP's comments as if getting him to a neuro won't be easy, but I think it's absolutely worth checking. "
Are we talking GoT Momoa or Justice League Momoa?
"Listen.  

You are not being professional, nor are you being a loving husband.

Get over Nicole.  Ask if there's anyway to not be around her so much.

Clearly you cannot handle being work friends.

Don't be surprised when gossip goes around that you fucked her."
I think her decency was seriously called into question when she used the loan to finance the lifestyle they couldn't afford.
"Everybody has unpleasant or embarrassing life experiences that can make them cringe, even years later.  I think that's normal.

But you are describing something more serious.  It is affecting your happiness.  You are avoiding social interaction because of this.

You need to make an appointment with a qualified therapist who can help you work through this.  Do some research and try to find someone with excellent recommendations.  Make sure the person is trained and experienced.

I'm cautioning you about this because in some states, anybody can call themselves a ""counselor"" and advertise for clients.

What you are experiencing isn't uncommon and I believe a good doctor or therapist can be of immense help to you."
"Even if they don't end up together long-term, he should still ""threaten"" to stay with her this Christmas, so his family learns that they can't treat his girlfriends like this without consequence."
"&gt; The secretive texting is what sets this off, she's (in my opinion) trying to ""set you two up"", while she's the only one wanting it to happen.

God, I hope she’s not trying that..."
"Let her buy the phone, but offer to help her set up a retirement account with the remainder. E.g. a Roth where she can't take the money back out, but can see it grow."
I think you misread- they were saying they plan to settle down and have kids 10-15 years AFTER their late twenties.
"Before it gets to the ‘there’s nothing left, I’ll do it’ point, it sounds like it’s pretty likely your gf has already done it.

If you know your gf has a stressful full time job, why wouldn’t you want to do more than your share during this time off to make her life better? This isn’t just a roommate, supposedly this is someone you love or at least like."
"You’ll accept any poor treatment as long as it’s not cheating or physical abuse? 

That’s a really, really low bar to set for a marriage. A relationship without trust or security is a bad relationship, no matter what caused it. Lying and spinelessness in the face of family conflict can do plenty of damage on their own. 

I don’t doubt that he *can* change, but he has to want to. With the picture you’ve painted, he doesn’t want to, and won’t until their treatment of him (not you, just him) goes from 80-90% poor to 100% poor. And if you’re waiting for the day that they forget how to reel him back in after an episode, you’ll be waiting a very long time. "
"It's a good point. He is normally a very healthy guy, so I think this is very unlikely. but I will reach out to his mother now. I know that he wants to visit her today, so she could know if everything is alright with him."
Thank you for this comment! As a sufferer of IBS I found that avoiding certain wheat products/switching to gluten free made my symptoms less severe overall even though I tested negative for celiac.  Not everyone can eat the same foods as others.
"And carbs, lol. If she's missing anything it's fats."
Please please dont leave her when things turn south due to her health issues
"Definitely a creep and no, he does not mean well. Don't feel bad for cutting him off. He probably only sees you as a potential girlfriend and not as a friend. "
"&gt; He likes bigger girls more than thin girls, that's the fact. It doesn't make him a bad person, it doesn't say he likes unhealthy girl.

I understand the point that the boyfriend should not be vilified for a subconscious preference, but you cannot divorce this from health. Ultimately, you don't get to be a size 18 withour being significantly overweight, if not obese, and you don't get to be significantly overweight without being unhealthy. They're part and parcel of the same issue."
"He was cheating on you. You did not make a mistake in getting a divorce. 

Agree with other redditor...block on Facebook and all other social media. Tell your friends you have done this and ask them to respect your need to not hear about his bullshit.

Take the high road. It doesn't change much but the view is awfully nice. You will be able to look your kids in the eye and know you did the right thing. This will be HUGE to them in future years. I know this through experience as a single dad.

As for how to deal with all the mental and emotional issues this brings up; therapy. No, I'm not kidding."
"You seem a bit self centered. A few things:

1) Some people get angry when they get hurt, its fight or flight response. Whenever I randomly hurt my blood tends to boil

2) He should not have cursed you out

3) You should be way more understanding, the guy got fucking stabbed like seriously anything he was saying was in the heat of the moment

4) You ask for an apology first thing in the morning. If it were me I guarantee I would instantly be in a bad mood if the person who dropped the knife into my foot asked me for an apology, as I was laying in a hospital bed. Like look at the god damned situation and maybe bring it up way after the pain has subsided.

"
"""I can screw my friends"", too. "
"My hs bf and I did it *everywhere*. On campus. In movie theaters. In the changing room at Macy's. We couldn't do it at our houses but just *not* doing it did not compute with us.

"You don't deserve to be treated like this. 
You deserve to be respected and loved by a man who won't throw you out of your own home because you asked him a perfectly reasonable question. 
Please don't regret anything, don't tell yourself that you shouldn't have asked questions and that he might be innocent and so offended that he's lashing out. In my opinion an innocent man doesn't react this way and a good man certainly doesn't treat his loved one like he did to you! 
You've got every confirmation needed that's he's not a good partner and not a good human being. You can do way better! This thing with the 18 yo proved to be a chance for you to see his true colors and not waste anymore of your time on this jerk.

Reach out to your friends or family if you can. You shouldn't be alone right now with your pain. Anyway, I wish you nothing but the best for the future."
"Lord help you. You are in for a world of hurt if you continue this relationship. If all the advice we give you argue with, why even ask if you already have an answer picked out."
"He's not even stingy in my opinion, considering he's happy to spend HER money insisting that they go out to expensive restaurants against her wishes and that she drive him places rather than biking. Claiming he's stingy is just an excuse to weasel out of paying for things."
Stop telling those stories. They're probably not as interesting as you think they are and they come off as territorial. 
"My thought exactly, the way she reminisces you'd think they were friends since kindergarten, but no ,she only knew him for 2 years before he met his wife. Which makes her behaviour weirder. "
"So it sounds like your ""best friend"" totally threw his fiancée under the bus. Blaming her for not being able to hang out with you? He can do what he wants and he chose not to stand up for himself and instead call her names. And you joined in. It sure sounds like it's a you and him vs her deal going on. Whether she's a good person or not doesn't matter. I wouldn't want someone my fiancé enjoyed badmouthing me with to be best man/woman. 


She's his fiancée - if he doesn't side with her he shouldn't be marrying her. She didn't even cut you out of the wedding and seems open enough to work on your relationship. If you care about friendship you should be happy to accommodate and realize the terms have changed. If you're only willing to be on his life holding the title best friend, then yeah no point going to the wedding. If you concede to being a good friend and can come to terms with his wife taking precedence (as she should for the most part), then attend the wedding as a guest and be happy for him. "
"Ugh, I rolled my eyes so hard at this they almost disappeared into my skull"
"&gt; Someone should probably educate him on them, maybe that would help?

This sounds like such an irrational phobia that that probably won't help - hell, he's admitted he's *never seen opossums around* and is still paranoid about them finding their way into the house. 

The real way to fix this(therapy) is also the least likely thing OP could get him to do, so I'd go with the ""point out that your house being full of garbage is going to attract the mythical doom opossums(by his logic)"" strategy, with ""get the landlord involved"" as a last resort."
"I just googled ""opossum repellent"" and there's tons of results for it. Find something non-toxic and safe to have around, and spray around the garbage cans and maybe by the doors to the house. That might help alleviate your roommate's fear and let you take the garbage out without a huge argument. Since the fear is irrational, when you find a repellent, I'd talk a big game about how awesome it is, and how excited you are about how your roommate will never have to worry about possums again, ever, with this repellent, and how you can now do things like take the garbage out without fear, etc. Treat the fear like it's serious and offer a serious solution even though the problem is BS (since 1. possums are cool and 2. you don't have any)"
Is there more than one option here besides breaking up?
"I mean, it might not be the first time as they have a sick child -but they handled this really well. They didn’t ask or expect anyone to change their plan. They simple made an adjustment to what their nuclear family could handle. And it’s pretty normal for a lot of parents to make changes to their lifestyle and routine when grandkids, sick or not, come along. It might not feel totally fair because SIL doesn’t have kids yet, but I have a suspicion that if she were the one with kids, she would be the one demanding accommodation for the sake of, “Faaaamily”."
"So he lies a lot to manage other people's reactions.

He lies to impress, to avoid admitting errors, or it seems to just nervously fill time with the sound of his voice. 

There are a lot of people do *some degree of this*. You can decide it's mostly harmless. You can decide it's a totally unacceptable dealbreaker. Both are valid.

You can try talking to him, but since this seems to be an anxiety or fear-based behaviour, it's unlikely a frank conversation will achieve much besides excuses and stonewalling. Anxiety = Avoidance. It sounds like that is the fundamental motivation for a lot of this."
Stand up to pee at his house to until he sees the problem.  
"Yeah, I think and this is probably sexist of me, I was expecting her to encroach a little but I should have realized she'd be fine. She's traveled alone and with friends."
"No, I doubt this. People say things in grieving that aren't logical or things they actually believe. The death of ones child is completely shattering, life changing, and something that can never truly be emotionally repaired. It's not that far of a stretch to say OPs friend was lashing out at her over her pain, and not necessarily because of the action itself.

OP I am willing to bet your friend wants to talk and I don't think it will be a conversation that either of you will leave feeling bad about."
"Stopmtrying to figure out what he's thinking. You are trying to interpret it in your own empathic ways.  

He isn't empathic. He gets off on controlling you in one of the most base way he can. 

You should be running, screaming,  getting a goddamn restraining order on this psychopath. Wake up. "
"You tell him exactly what you put here.  That you love him, but you can't tolerate his ""friends"" any more.  While you appreciate him standing up for you, he still has these horrible people as his friends and so long as he does, you can't be his girlfriend.  Don't stay with someone who disrespects you (keeping them as friends is disrespecting you) just because you don't want to be lonely.  It is better to be alone at a holiday than be with him and his friends belittling you."
Which is exactly what a friend can do for you. This is not enough of a reason to be in a romantic relationship with someone 
"She's raising your kid. Do you expect her to be superwoman with a kickass career too? Maybe start talking to your wife about what your **family** should work towards as goals, together."
"She doesn't sound like ""the salt of the earth"" to me. She sounds bitter an envious. If my mom ever spoke to my wife like that, even once, I don't know if our relationship would ever recover. 

She is only going to get more jealous when OP and her son (who are both college educated) live in better houses, drive better cars, and raise their kids with higher standards of living than she could. "
My mom used to put me in my carrier on top of the dryer while it was going lmao. Apparently it was one of the few things that put me to sleep. 
"I gave a child up for adoption 11 years ago, and it is something that is incredibly difficult to talk about. It is emotionally traumatic. It carries stigma and judgment. And frankly, it is a really heavy thing to spring on someone. 

That said, I told my current partner after we had been together a few months. I don’t have visitation or anything like your SO, and I probably could have kept it a secret for the rest of our lives, but I didn’t because it was an important thing that left a big mark on me. And so, I felt it was necessary to share that information. 

When I first read the title to this post, I was completely prepared to side with your SO. But after reading the full story... yeah... this kind of lying is pretty messed up. She didn’t just have a child and sign some papers and move on with her life; her son is an active, consistent presence. That is a huge omission and it really changes the future of your relationship."
"Also want to add a 4.5: /u/thoreauaway15234 get yourself to a therapist as soon as you can after you break up. Given that this was your first/only relationship, the level to which she has controlled/been abusive to you will affect you in future relationships (not just romantic ones) until you resolve it. 

Your university should have free options for students, and since I'm betting you're still on your parents insurance, you can also find one in-network so the cost is low&amp;mdash;typically only the amount of your standard copay.

Good luck to you. I feel so terrible that she treated you this way for so long. You're better than this, and you will soon see how great life can/will be once you get rid of her! Go enjoy college. This should be one of the happiest times in your life."
"We've had disagreements and talked them out, but we've never had a fight or an argument. Just crossed the 8-years-married mark."
Agree with this. This is control and abuse. Relationships are supposed to be equal and nothing about this is equal. Leave. You deserve better. Abuse is gradual and it will only get worse. You are isolated and alone with no money or even access to any money. Do you want your child to grow up and think this is how relationships are meant to be?
You have my sword. How household labor is shared (or not) speaks to the fundamental relationship dynamic of partner vs. care taker. 
"&gt; ""I need to assure my husband I won't cheat on *him*...right?

"
Um what? You must have a warped view of divorce if you think an ex-wife can just magically demand more money if her ex-husband pisses her off. It sounds like you're one of those guys who think marriage is bad because women are all money-hungry leeches.
I don’t see an issue with the gown. You do you girl 
OMG you have only stayed with her out of continence. Let her go find someone who will love her and fulfill her needs. Don't date someone unless you both don't want to get married. Otherwise you are just wasting your girl's time. 
"&gt; I agree that that moment in the café was the time to say something, but again, I was pretty shocked and obviously hadn't had time to properly process.

It's been more than a month since you agreed...  That is way too much ""processing time"" to go back on your word.  "
"Yup. Which brings me right back to my first words: *""Let David decide.""* "
"&gt;How can I convince her that I only want her and that there's nothing going on without outing Julie?

You can't. You can't just tell someone you'll never have feelings for another person and get rid of all insecurity. She can work on it herself with therapy, but honestly your actions are making things worse. You are hiding the nature of your relationship with Julie from her and you are closer to her than you would be a straight friend you had feelings for. 

&gt; Can I help her get over what her ex did?

She needs to do that herself. But on your end, the problem is with your actions, not her insecurity. 

If Julie isn't comfortable coming out to your partner, then you have to own that you are hurting your girlfriend with your actions and lying to her. 

Yeah, don't out Julie. But let Julie know the fact that being this close to a straight female friend wouldn't be okay with your partner, so you can't spend the same time together you did before. Also while I respect Julie's right to only tell people she trusts, it is normal when getting serious to say me and my partner are a team and I'm not comfortable keeping secrets from her.

Talk to Sarah about what she's going to be comfortable with. You don't have to give up your friend, but keep in mind you have to treat Julie like you would a straight female friend for as long as your girlfriend doesn't know. And remind Julie that you can't keep this secret forever. At some point you and Sarah are a package deal.

Hi everyone! I’ve been at work and just read all of your comments. Seeing so many responses has literally brought me to tears. I definitely have some things to sort out before leaving. I’m scared to leave but you guys have definitely helped me feel more confident and sure of my decision. I know that I’ll be coming back to this post in the near future to give me comfort after I’ve left. 
"Try therapy first. If he doesn’t change, move on. Set an example for your kids that each person deserves respect in their relationship. "
"&gt; I took the reference to my name as an attempt at a veiled threat, and to a therapist as an insult.

You tracked someone down on app and you find *their* reply threatening?

Honey, he was being sarcastic and it flew right over your head."
"If you're not willing to have major shakeups in your relationship, maybe take the day for yourself.  Treat yourself on thaws days.  Go to the park and read that book you've been trying to read.  Take yourself to lunch.  Buy yourself some extra cozy socks.  Take a bubble bath.  Do something special for you."
"Hoo, boy, I take back what I said about ""meaning this kindly"" and ""unintentionally."" You have got a lot of sexism and entitlement to unlearn. 

&gt;How about the woman who gave me her number then never responded when I texted her?

You're not entitled to her texting you back!

&gt;How about the female acquaintance who I caught staring at me followed by a smile, and nervous laugh; who mentioned that she'd recently broken up with her boyfriend (if that's not a hint I don't know what is); but upon meeting her shortly afterwards in a social context pretty much ignored me when I said hi?

Wow. A stare, a smile, and a nervous laugh are not signs that someone necessarily wants to have sex with you. Neither is mentioning a recent breakup. They could be, and you're not in the wrong for being

&gt;How about the woman who flirted with me endlessly over Facebook but as soon as I asked her on a date her responses took four times as long and she never followed up?

Again: you're not entitled to a date, or a quick follow up. 

Also, none of this behavior is what I was talking about. I was talking about behavior ON A DATE. All of these could be signs that a woman wants to date and have sex with you. But they also could not. You find out by asking them on a date. Since they said no, they don't want to date you, and they weren't tricking you by sending you signals because you're not entitled to their time and attention.

&gt;Are these people all unambiguously telling me they want to have sex with me?

No one is unambiguously telling you that they want to have sex with you unless you ask them if they want to have sex and they say ""yes"". "
"Presents are absolutely the end all be all of Christmas. What, do you think I'm celebrating Christ's summer birthday in December for the Michael Buble Christmas album? Maybe a little, but moreso, I want fucking stuff dude... Gimme"
You need to get a job.
"That would depend on the art she does, though. But, you are right in that it's hard and a long ass journey. I worked with my art AND had jobs on the side for like 7 years before I could survive off my art alone - and my first year of really making a go of living off my art wouldn't have been possible if my SO hadn't had a well-paying job in tech.

She needs a job. She can still do art on the side and build up a client-base/sale platform on her free time.(maybe she could sell her art on POD-sites? It's a nice, side income that you really don't have to think about)"
"I will get downvoted for this, but have you discussed abortion.

"&gt;  he told me that he doesn’t expect his partner to handle this - his brother, his responsibility so to speak. 

What happens if your boyfriend is sick, out at the store while you're home alone with the brother, or your boyfriend dies unexpectedly in a car accident and his brother becomes your responsibility? 

If you are this against having any involvement in the care of his brother, then you should end this relationship."
"Look up the gray rock method. It's for dealing with psychopaths and narcissists, but the advice works for anyone you are trying to get to leave you alone. Basically, be as polite as you need to be socially but also be SOO BORING. I don't think antagonizing this guy will help you, seeing as the coaches have a little community, unfortunately. "
Could very well be. Shes upfront which is why I like her. 
"This is my mindset. There is a difference between having somebody living at home, not working or studying. And being over it. But this is just being cruel. "
Your happy ending is going to be very different from your husband's. You have fallen into the trap that all partners of abusive people do - you want things to work because they don't. But they will never work. There will never be a happy ending for you with this man.
"Did he ask you in this date? If yes, then he should pay. Then you ask him on the fourth date, pick somewhere appropriate for your income and pay. 

I personally find dutch awkward, so I would rather plan and pay for a date that is appropriate for my income, and have another date where the person I am dating plans and pays.

The last woman I dated actually planned some absolutely free dates that were incredibly fun and I definitely left feeling valued as a romantic partner despite that the outing was free.

You were invited because you were wanted. Bring a card and have fun! 
I'm fascinated by how eager OP is to pin all of this on her. She's probably genuinely suffering because of his need to be in charge.
"Alternate explanation: Growing up, he didn't learn how to cope with difficult times and now gets thrown into depression because he doesn't know how to handle life's ups and downs. He's aware of his mom's feelings, he feels like an outsider in his family, and it makes him anxious to spend time with them. When his fiancee comes to him with the possibility that his depression is his fault, he panics and goes into angry mode. Same outcome, without the cold, calculated bit.

I think overall we tend to assume that manipulation comes from this very deliberate place, which tends to further isolate the manipulative person and reinforce their behaviour (which we can see from how he reacts to the mother's perspective.) If we approach the situation with compassion (yes, losing a job is very stressful, yes, being unemployed can make you feel worthless, but it's time to learn the tools to handle those situations,) the person can usually start to see how their actions are hurting the people they care about and hopefully start to adopt healthier behaviours.

Either way, OP, it comes down to this - is this the way you are willing to live indefinitely until he is willing to seek help? Regardless of how he ended up this way, this is the way he is. How long could you continue in this situation if he didn't change? What changes would you need to see from him to be able to stay (e.g. him in therapy, him looking for jobs, couples counselling)? Would those changes be enough if the personality changes took longer to happen? This is a situation where you need to make sure your own needs are being met and evaluate whether this relationship is still overall meeting your needs."
"This is like the inverse of the ""I'm suuuuch a good guy why don't women like me maybe I should be an asshole to get women instead"". Hint: that's not why people don't like ""nice guys"".

Becoming this (misogynistic) cliche won't help you. Work on your self esteem (re: your comment calling yourself ""crazy ugly""). Figure out what you want from a relationship, rather than deciding what to change to fit what you claim other people must want. Basically, stop feeling sorry for yourself, start loving yourself and your life on your own, and maybe you'll meet someone who likes you for you.

PS. You're 23, which means you've only been an adult for 5 years, which means you haven't been single *that* long. You're fine."
"You're not obligated to be ""fun"" for an abuser, and that's the dynamic he's setting up every time he won't listen to ""stop it"". I realize this sub is quick to say this all the time, but it's time to Get Rid of that boundary-stomping asshole. What you say is *law* when it comes to **your body**. If you wouldn't accept it from a coworker or boss, you don't need to accept it from a ""partner"". 

Or maybe next time just ball-check him to remind him that pain hurts and you don't deserve it, then dump his ass?"
"Is the cave attached ch to your house, or is it an entirely separate building? I've seen different types"
100% this. People are hating on the boyfriend but I think he's coming up with these reasons and excuses to soften the blow. 
"My response is coming from a legal perspective and a personal perspective.  I'm in court all the time seeing these kinds of cases.  I have also had to cut several family members off, who have tried many times to worm back in.  

She wants a reaction and you dragging her into court would be exactly that.  Some people like the drama in their lives, for whatever reason.  If you go down that road, be prepared to spend many, many hours in court.  She will find ways to retaliate (trying to get a no-contact against you or some other BS).  She will make your life a living hell.  Right now in my office we have a situation where the crazy person is using the legal system to harass the non-crazy person.  There are four cases pending, all of which will end in our client's favor.  But the goal of the crazy-person is not to win but to harass.  If you can avoid putting the idea in her head, I would.  Not to mention that the restraining orders only tend to restrain folks who are reasonably sane and she doesn't sound sane. 

The strategy should be 100% radio silence.  NO ONE communicates with her.  No one responds.  She will get bored and move on.  She may circle back around but just continue to ignore her.  This is the only effective strategy, in my opinion.  

The shock you are feeling will wear off.  It used to be like an electric bolt when my bully of an older sister would contact me.  Over time, as I've ignored her and not responded, her power over me lessens.  The same will happen to you.  This storm will pass and as best as you can, you need to try to focus on other things.  You are allowing her to take up a huge amount of real estate in your mind.

You should, however, keep the evidence of her contacting you, in case she doesn't give up.  You may, at some point, need to go to court for a restraining order.  But I strongly recommend ghosting her first."
Deflection is a good method for dealing with people like her dad. It will drive him crazy though and he may ramp it up since it will make him feel out of control.
"If someone else moves in, are they going to have issues with your boyfriend too, because it seems like the problem lies there."
"That's fucking insane, it never even occurred to me that anyone would do that. I'm so sorry that that happened to you, it must have been horrifying."
"I know the age at which he did it... She only has as much information as he told her, the same information which he told us, that he grew up in an abusive household and beat up the man who was abusive to his mom. The girlfriend's not the one I'm giving advice to here, so I'm not sure why it's relevant. 

"
"I have read your post and all your comments.  You say that you ""are not very forgiving in your views"".  Your boyfriend is finding success, and I believe you feel inferior because of this.  You come off as very entitled, opinionated and judgmental. You brag about harassing a republican congressperson. Sounds like you ARE on a soapbox rant with your whole post and comments. 


Also, you should do some research before looking down upon your boyfriend for getting his finances in order.  You are delusional if you think there will be a revolution and everyone's retirement funds will disappear.  You need to be educated on some things before you have an opinion on them.  

"
"It’ll escalate. I promise. Your life, your call. 

If you stay, make sure you double up on the birth control. Innocent kids don’t have a choice and don’t deserve to be exposed to this."
"Yeah I guess so. I am always asking him permission to do things but only because this started off as a joke (because in the beginning he almost always said yes, of course) but now he says no more and more.

Man I don't know. I can't see him actually hitting me but this was still so violent? I don't know if that's the right word. It just felt wrong."
"&gt; justified

and there wa have it. They believe they know best for you, better than you do. And are trying to destroy your marriage. Incompetently

Seriously, this was probably the PURPOSE of her visit."
"Consult an accountant or a tax attorney specializing in your situation. If your boyfriend has an issue with that, tell him your level,of knowledge isn’t where you’re comfortable going alone and ask why he’s against you feeling comfortable and informed. If he insists on going this solo, politely decline to be named as his dependent."
Can you get a ride home right now?
You sound really socially inept. How did you think he would respond to being called a narcissist? 
"This is one where i agree with you, but i feel like you should’ve just kept your opinion to yourself or vented about it to a friend. I mean, I️ agree and think it’s kind of corny, but it’s harmless and it’s what she wants, so there was really  no point in making it known that you think it’s dumb."
"&gt; He said he was using them in the bathroom and got sloppy about throwing the wrappers away.

And then one tunneled into his car?"
"It sounds like he expects his partner to be always available and only interested in him and his activities. If he's not ok with you getting injured, what are you going to do if you get a serious illness? He sounds really selfish, and I don't think that's going to change. I don't think you can say or do anything to fix it, because he's not interested in being there for you. "
"Be prepared for her to needle and whine. But he'll be fine. If anything happened I know it would be an accident, blah blah blah blah blah. Just look her dead in the eyes and say, ""I told you I'm not comfortable with it."" Period.

GOD she's awful. "
"While people might say this is a stretch based on what few details are provided, this is *exactly* what I was expecting when I read the title, and as I started reading the post. And given there seems no reasonable explanation for his behavior, I fully assume he had something planned and she fucked it up (might not  necessarily be an affair, could be drugs). 



"
Also? OP was not promiscuous. She had sex with her partners within a relationship.
"Ah, yes. The price charming who had been told to back the hell off by instead came to legaladvice to ask if he could file a restraining order against the girl's boyfriend on her behalf. That guy was scary. "
"Police and parents.  Your brother-in-law is not, in fact, getting his act together.  What he is doing is the opposite of getting his act together.  Your wife is being an enabler for his criminality."
"Yeah, no, he didn't think you were being playful. He's just trying to get you back.

OP, this guy has already shown he disrespects your boundaries and is willing to use physical force against you. I don't want to alarm you, but please *be careful* for a while! I do not want to think he will do anything illegal, but I'd much rather warn you and be wrong than say nothing and see a bad update later."
"Sorry to latch onto a small part of your comment, but PSA: trans or gynecomastia or any other purposes, *please* no bandages. Especially ace bandages. I bound my chest for five minutes with them just to see how it feels. You absolutely can't breathe in them."
Why do you think 13 is a lot?
"OK, so his weight is a secondary issue and you need to address his alcohol dependency first."
I don't see the big deal about the free tickets. She got you guys into the movie so what does it matter if she paid with cash or a coupon? If you are so uptight about paying for dates and everything being 50/50 you're going to have a bad time.
"In this particular case the mice seem to be because of the dirty home.

But you're right, any home can get mice. We hire an exterminator who comes out four times a year and I still see mouse droppings once in a while (and find the occasional dead mouse). We aren't the best about keeping the floors free of crumbs but we're not complete slobs either. "
"&gt;Do you think I need to leave it alone

Fucking duh"
"At the time you chose to betray your relationship and your partner's trust by fucking someone else? Yes, you were a bad person.

That said, I do think people grow and change, so I can't speak to how you are now."
"She's actually muzzle trained, but I've never shared that with my parents for fear of them losing it. They're good people, but they tend to personify animals. When I told them I was crate training Bels they almost broke down in tears, lol.

I think I'll bring along her muzzle as a last-ditch effort, and tell everyone if they let her out, I'll have to muzzle her. Thanks!"
"Next time you talk with her, as her to tell her family or give you the right to alert them if necessary.

Does she have a girlfriend she could stay with. She does not need a knight in shining armour, but friends to support and console her.

You are starting to have feelings for her and you motives may be called into question, and that is the last thing she needs."
Yeah it sounds like in this relationship it would be a terrible idea.
"You call animal services to the point of harassment; there is a dog being abused right in front of you. Call multiple times a day. No response? Non-emerg police line. Fight for this poor animal because it's the right thing to do. Don't accept ""no"". Get him help OP. "
"IMO it's not the size of the gap that is the problem, it's the ages involved. At 34 you have finished maturing, you are pretty much who you are going to be for the rest of your life. At 21 she has not finished maturing, she is going to grow significantly over the next 5 years. Now whether she will grow into you, or simply outgrow you remains to be seen, but be aware that she might wake up in 5 years and realize that she is now in a completely different place to you. "
"Just be straight with him.

Say, ""Hey Ted, you realize you're $90 short in total for rent over the past few months?""

And look at it this way, your problem right now is because you know this guy. If you didn't have as much of a connection to this guy, it would be easier for you to ask him to pay in full and harder for him to slide."
"How afe we meant to know? You knkw him better than we do, you're going to have to soeak to him about it.

If you aren't willing to actually take a stand of any sort, then that's about your only optipn."
You two are super lucky to have each other. Make those last moments with her count!
"If you get rejected it's not a big deal and nothing to worry about, you're going to have to get used to rejection in life so take this as your first practice!

Ask her if she wants to get a coffee, dinner or a movie as you prefer. Coffee is the easiest and most casual. Pick a nice, quiet coffee shop you can walk to from campus. Ask her questions about herself whilst there, answer hers and see if a connection forms.

If she says no thank you, no big deal, at least you know and can put your energy into something else."
"Some people never change regardless of how many consequences you throw their way - don't look at it as punishing someone else, but instead look at it as helping yourself."
"&gt; How did she treat you?!! We keep asking and you don't answer.

Right?! Come on, either she did something terrible or she didn't! Why is this so hard!  Either 1) she didn't really do anything that bad, *or* 2) he is a terrible communicator who isn't able to tell us his side of the story correctly, which is probably not helping his marital problems. "
"She just moved into a brand new place, so the bathroom is really nice, thankfully. I'm going to be there the whole time to help her with some other things, but yeah I'm following her lead with all this. Neither of us are too worried about the emotions. She's a mom already, and I've never wanted one of my own. Thanks for the advice:) "
I think he wants a pretty kewpie doll without an opinion that might jack his preferences on everything.
"Even outside of the church, it's harmful.

As an adult dude, I had to almost totally re-learn how to set limits and communicate well, because all my teens taught me is ""guys are always asking for sex, and women are always saying no"".  Left me totally unprepared to deal with times when I didn't actually want sex, and times when the *other* person was being pushy/coercive about sex.

And I didn't go to church and grew up in a pretty liberal family, too :/"
"She's not selfish. These aren't her children, they're her siblings who have two parents there. She's allowed to put herself first. "
I will mind the age difference because it’s absolutely part of the issue at hand. He’s a child who is behaving like it. Why are you dating a child? Have some self respect and date someone who isn’t prone to dictate your seriousness and keep hurt scoreboards. 
"She works in the medical field. The best she's probably going to find is another job with the same hours but maybe during the day. And a lot of new hires don't get an ""ideal"" shift because of course they're going to to to the people with seniority. "
"Wow, this sound bad. Unfortunately it sounds like Rick is a creep and Beth has been sucked in.

I would suggest cross-posting to legal advice to see what your options are for trying to get Rick arrested, or at least set up some sort of restraining order. Beth would very much hate you for this and it could potentially backfire when she turns 18, but if you want to stop things, I think that's your only shot.

The other thing you should think about is how Beth feels about all this. If she has had a rough time living with her father, you pushing back on this relationship (even though you absolutely should be pushing back here) may come off as controlling to her. She probably feels like you are trying to fight her own independence as an adult. When you try talking to her about this, frame it around acknowledging her independence as an adult. That might help. At the very least, it might let her open up enough that you can have a discussion on healthy vs unhealthy relationship dynamics so at some point she can identify on her own why this is a bad thing. But remember, the instant you appear against this relationship, you push her away."
"I had but before this they seemed like despite their shitty mentalities they weren't vindictive... just overly opinionated or ""justified"". This, if my sister is lying, would be an immediate shut the lid cook em for dinner with butter and that be that situation. Lying about stuff like this isn't cool, and lying about my husband is a hell no."
"There may be a bigger reason than presents. Perhaps they are trying to cut the cord of sorts. Do you always depend on them for rides, etc? Maybe it's time you two figure your own way out.

"Bringing a gun into a household where your partner has explicitly said s/he did not want guns is not ""acting in a responsible manner"".  It's disrespectful at best and deceitful at worse.  "
Lots of love from reddit &lt;3 I hope you and your family feel better.
"Sorry one more comment - assuming that she needs you to fix her problems is insulting to her intelligence. She is telling you because she wants sympathy because whatever happened upset her. Unless she is asking for your advice, she doesn't want you to solve her problems because she is an adult and she knows damn well how. "
Right? I'd choose the room furthest away...
My psychology professor years ago said that divorce is not as damaging as growong up watching your parents in a damaged relationship. What will be worse than divorcing and throwing your life in upheaval is your kids learning to treat you as your husband does. Do not sink your energy into a man who doesn't care about you because you think your kids might need therapy one day to get over mommy and daddy getting a divorce.
"&gt; That went on for two months, and then she said she wanted to start talking again.

Must you comply to all her wants and wishes?"
"You would be surprised how many people have problems like or similar to this. Or even worse issues. And it's these times when you realize why Pride is one of the seven deadly sins.

Your sisters problem is only a problem because for some reason she can't address it. This is like an addict that refuses to get high or a guy who realizes he's wrong in an argument but refuses to agree to it. 

And I hate to say this, because you seriously care, but deep cleaning every month is a huge drain on you and won't ever cover the real problem. And it may be a problem that can be addressed and fixed.

What's more, please know your family may not be a mess. They have a messy PROBLEM. People are allowed to have problems and flaws, provided they acknowledge and work on them. Think of this as a scrape. You put neosporin or another medicine on it to keep it clean, right? This situation is your sister ignoring a scrape that became a pusy wound and you planning to drain it before the baby. The idea should be to stop the wound.

Again, you don't sound like a mess. You sound like your family is in a messy situation, and that's okay. Just please acknowledge the situation for what it is and solve it. Because I know you all can."
"It hurts him that she doesnt meet some false narrative, when he is sleeping with her?  ok, nah.

The only thing the least bit edgy is the septum piercing. Everything else is stuff you would see in any suburb in America.
Why are some men/people like this? They see value in virginity!?!? (really was he supposed to find a virgin at 37????) and its baffling that these revelations come out about the people who you're the closest too! I mean what a bomb dropped.... and now what is she supposed to do w this information.... this changes everything. Truly so disgusting and disappointing. How do you go so long without knowing the true kind of person your SO is??? That's the scariest part... But I suppose it was more than okay that he wasn't a virgin and/or has had sex with more than 2 people.
The partner's gender wasn't specified. ;)
"Could you and your dad research some nursing homes in the area and perhaps ask you mum to go around and see a couple - absolutely no obligations. If you talk to the nursing home co-ordinator before you visit and tell them about the situation and your mums fears, they can have a proper chat to her about them. It could be that she is thinking the worst about these places but if she actually went to visit one she might be more open minded?

Can you also try to find ones within easy visitation and stress a schedule to visit every day? If your mother doesn't drive you could talk about the public transport or make sure it is accessible so she doesn't feel like she is abandoning your grandma but will still be spending lots of time with her, whilst also reclaiming her own home and life."
"You know when the worst time to take a nude selfie to “check yourself” is? Probably when you are sick.

"YMMV

Personally, I want to be dating for at least a year and have set plans for the future of our relationship before I bring an SO around for any major holidays, but that's just me. I understand why her BF might not yet feel comfortable including her with his family like that. "
"&gt;her sending him pics in her underwear is crossing a huge line

Its called a progress pic and its EXTREMELY common for people to send them to their PT's. When I had an online trainer I would send them an underwear pic (I'm a guy) every weekend. Nothing sexual about it. t's how they know what to tweak in your diet and workouts. "
"Honestly, I can't help but wonder if ops daughter isn't hoping for a divorce so she can live with mum"
"Yeah, he was violent **as an abused 12 year old.** A situation in which most people would be violent."
"I think it would be much easier to just find someone who fits what you want rather than trying to change her. You can still break up with her even though you ""live together in a strange country""."
Then you’re not ready for an adult relationship. Part of growing up is realizing that your parents are as human as anyone else-sometimes awful people have kids. 
OP I understand why you don't want her to be your MOH anymore but I think perhaps you need to be a bit more forgiving of people. Weddings are very stressful and the next person you decide to be your MOH might fuck up somehow as well because humans are humans. If you're not willing to forgive people it's going to be a very difficult period of time for you.
"For real, there were several times we used a vacuum cleaner as white noise before we got a proper white noise machine."
I would highly recommend family counseling for your family right now.

She started being like this when they were in 8th grade.
Many authorities would laugh about this complaint. Check your jurisdiction before calling the cops.
Yes she can. You don't need to cut out alcohol completely while breastfeeding.
"Has it happened already? Serious question. If it has, its probably time to have a conversation about it. I personally highly doubt that your dad has actually considered what it’d be like if you two hooked up. Most likely he offered what she said as a compliment to you, rather than an invitation for sex. "
"Hate to break it to you, but your family of origin plays a HUGE role in the success of your future relationships, and if you have issues with moving forward in this relationship it makes perfect sense that your girlfriend is drawing connections between your present circumstances and the way you grew up.

And speaking as a fellow survivor of childhood abuse, you may think it's water under the bridge but I promise you it isn't. Experiences like those shape your attachment style and influence your behavior in ways you cannot comprehend on a conscious level. Therapy is essential for processing those experiences so they can't control you. 

Tl;dr: Go to therapy, or be prepared to lose the relationship. Your girlfriend is seeing problems in your blind spot. "
"What can she expect when it seems that she's created an environment where being truthful with her is met with chaos and violence. I wouldn't consider what the kids (let's remember, especially at the time they were pretty much little kids) did as ""betrayal"" but rather self preservation in the face of two completely fucked up parents and an unstable situation.

"And furthermore, she wouldn’t be back if her new partner was still alive. "
I would switch one and two. Tell him it's over before he has a chance to argue or manipulate
"Yeah, blaming you isn’t fair but also not necessarily irrational imo in the context of an emotional reaction. I would just stop trying to frame this as an irrational vs. logical thing as your post is tying to do. In your girlfriend’s position I don’t think it’s illogical to lash out if you are trying to tell her that her reaction is irrational when it’s really not. And give her a few days to calm down before hashing this out, I think. By the way, how were you feeling after the attack? "
"As the saying goes, ""do as I say not as I do"". It can be easy to see the problems in peers relationships and tell them to get out both without own, emotions warp things it make it much harder.

"Your boyfriend is not in charge of what you do. The tattoo you just got--which presumably you are happy with, independent of your issues with your partner--is a part of YOU, not a part of the relationship. I'm guessing it's not his choice what length your hair is or whether you wear mascara, so why is this any different? It's part of who you are now and how you choose to look.

Even if the tattoo isn't his cup of tea, a reasonable person would not be angry with you about it, or even make you feel like you need to text him pictures during the process to make sure it's okay.

This is a red flag. He is being controlling."

You are young. You dont have children. It doesnt sound like your husband is trust worthy. Is this relationship worth all of this? Counseling would be required for all of this, the journal entries are fucked up, saying he sees your mother as a better version of you is not going to end in your favor.

I think they are going to sleep together whether you are together with your husband or not. Youve got to choose what your relationship with your husband will be when they do. "

"Honestly, it's fine to have preferences and the likes but that does not excuse him for treating his wife poorly. You can not like the way someone looks and still be civil about it, especially if said someone is your partner. For me personally, the problem is not the preferences in and of themselves but the way he frames it as if OP must feel ashamed of not catering to them in a very ""how dare you!"" sort of way, which is not fitting for a respectful partner. He really seems like he can use a bit of a talk on how to express his preferences in a non-passive aggressive and/or hurtful way."

Hon, he **doesn't want to**. There is no communication out there that will suddenly make him want to be a good partner. There is nothing you can do here because you're not the one who needs to change - he is, and he knows that, and he already has made it pretty clear he won't. "

“Hey hun,

7 months ago you broke my heart by - what I now realize was - emotionally cheating on me. You may have apologized but you also make excuses for yourself. And those excuses and your choice to cozy up with her again while insisting on making her a part of my life - thus even more embedded in our relationship - has shaken my trust in you once more. I’m not second place. I deserve to be the only one adored by my boyfriend. You’re going to need to make a decision. Either cut her out or I will be moving on.”"
Your writing style is very intense. Is that how you talk as well? It's almost childish. I am not mocking you. Just something to look into.
"I get that you are young, but you absolutely need to go to HR immediately and give them any info you have and document any further actions on his part.  You seem like you hate confrontation, but you HAVE to handle this.  He's behaving terribly and knows you won't take any action.  I would be furious.  you should be furious.  Do it today."
"I was in a similar situation but the aggressor was my sisters fiancé. He never got her a ring or anything. She was 20 he was 28. I came by their apartment one day and there was like stacks of cash on the kitchen coffee table, she was counting it and I was helping her. He came in the room started flipping out. I was 13 at the time. He kept saying how I should never touch another mans money, and that my sister was a stupid b**** for trusting me. I had no intention of taking any. So he takes her in the other room, the yelling starts, then I hear loud thumping, crying, she's saying ""stop my brothers here"". The door was locked but some how I broke in and she was on the floor covering her face crying. I lost it, I grabbed a hockey stick and started hitting him. I attacked him from the back when he wasn't looking. I messed him up pretty bad. The landlord called the cops on me and I was sent to an audy home, then boot camp. I told my now wife, about it like 6 months into our relationship. She was upset for maybe a day, but we didn't really have trust issues or anything because of it. Shit happens, we grow older, we're obviously not the same people who we were as kids. Everything will work out bro. This'll blow over like nothing. Your gf already took a stance on it in the beginning, and that is the only reason she is being the way she is now. Btw my sister left that douche bag right after that incident. So he tried his best to ruin my life because to him, I broke them up. "
Not my relationship but my sister is getting married in the summer and I'm just so excited for her. We got her dress last weekend and she is just adorable!!
"It's not that they don't understand, it's that they are the lowest pieces of shit on the planet and should be put down themselves. Call the police. If worst comes to worst and you get no other help, catch the dog and take it to a shelter. "
This is a very good point! That's about as mainstream as tv gets and clearly nobody thought that was weird and it was like twenty years ago (? might have over stretched that but I wrote fifteen first and that didn't seem long enough!)
"In the US slapping *your own minor child* in the face with an open hand has been held to be legal corporal punishment so long as there is no injury or lasting mark.  That is fact, it isn't an ""argument""."
"&gt; I’m not mean or rude to people. I include people and am tolerant and sensitive to different types of people  

&gt;I still see women who mostly get by on their looks, or obnoxious confidence but who are actually losers in terms of ambition, character, substance  
  
Does that second quote seem like someone who is not rude and tolerate and sensitive to others? Time for a wake up call, honey."
"&gt; The thing is, reddit, I do want to date other guys right now too. Just to be sure that there aren't better guys out there. 

Then be prepared to lose Nick. You can't have your cake and eat it to. Nick told you he wants to be exclusive and see what potential you two have. Either you go along with that or you don't and accept that he'll move on."
"The life you describe wouldn't be the one I'd choose for myself... but I'm not you. If that *is* the life you'd want, then there are no direct problems with having a houseful of kids that you can afford. From a pragmatic standpoint though, a few potential hurdles I spotted are:

&gt;she has told me that she absolutely can't use birth control. She wants to, as she says, ""have as many kids as we're given""

What if you have a baby with birth defects? She's obviously not likely to be down with abortion. But what if your first child comes out with Down's Syndome? Severely Autistic? What if they have the kind of birth defects that mean that they'll only live a short life of pain before dying? What if baby number two or three or four does as well? Is this the household that you're picturing coming home to each day? These aren't pleasant things to think about, but you *should* think them through and talk with her about them given her refusal to allow for birth control, which I assume includes you ever getting a vasectomy.

&gt;she wants to be a stay at home mother, which is what is expected of her by her parents/culture

Being realistic, not all relationships work out forever. In fact most relationships don't. We all hope that our relationships will be the ones that see us into retirement... but people change. Hell, just getting pregnant can change her hormones to the point where she's not acting like the person that you fell in love with anymore. Not to mention dealing with a house full of rugrats every day. That can wear anyone down. So from this one:

* Make sure that your relationship as a couple remains the priority. Happy husband and wife first, happy mother and father second. If your relationship fails then no one is happy. Get on the same page about this. Make sure she wants you first and foremost rather than just wanting kids and a family which you happen to be a part of. Be each others first priorities.

* Be cognizant that if things do go badly and you end up divorcing, with her not working and a bundle of kids running around you will be completely financially fucked. Alimony and child support will rape you. I know it's not pleasant to think about, but maybe see about a quiet consultation with a lawyer prior to marrying to see if there is anything you can do to protect yourself.

&gt;She is a virgin, unsurprising considering she's a devout Christian with parents from the mid-east, while I've had sex with only 1 girl (who was my serious girlfriend in college).

So when you say virgin... do you just mean hymen in tact but you're still otherwise sexually engaged? Or do you mean you've never been naked together? There's a concern here about sexual compatibility. What if she ends up not liking sex whereas you do? What if she only wants to have sex for procreation. You good with brief bursts of sex ever 10-11 months or so? What about other fun bedroom stuff? Have any kinks you'd like to explore? How about just sex other than PIV? For most people these questions answer themselves way prior to marriage. You get to know what's on the table and what's not before committing. No sex before marriage though means that you need to talk this stuff out. It may not be fun, but you're hopefully committing for life here. Eat the awkwardness and have this discussion. 

Finally... don't compromise on what you'll *need* in order to be fulfilled in a relationship. As you said... you're in a profession where you make decent money. You want a family and plan to be a good father. You're 30 which is a great age for men to date, especially when it comes to finding women who want kids. She's a 29 year old virgin who doesn't want to have sex before marriage, doesn't want to work anymore, but wants lots of kids and will refuse to stop. You are in a really good position to find what you need and want in a partner, whereas she kind of hit the jackpot in you. If she's all that you want, that's fantastic and I'm happy for you. If she's not though... don't settle just because she's interested in you. Once you marry and start having kids, the obligations won't fall off of your shoulders for a long time. Make sure you'll be comfortable and happy wearing them."
"Your wife is probably right. Sounds like your friend was probably nursing a crush on you and acting inappropriate/suspicious, and her husband is insisting she put appropriate boundaries in place, and this conversation was a shady attempt to do that, but also feel out whether you might have similar feelings for her. I would try to stay out of this situation as much as possible  if I were you and tell your wife immediately if anything weird happens with your friend. "
Don't be so butt hurt and stop looking for drama. Your friend correctly assumed that you wouldn't be able to go.  Yes you are wrong. 
It sounds like this was a complete setup from the beginning to try and force OP's hand. 
"It's an appropriate end to things, really. Some things can't be undone, and this is a natural consequence for what went down. If it's taken longer to come to this, well, clinging to something desperately doesn't mean you can hold it. Let it go. Start fresh and take it as a valuable lesson for the future."
"No! Wtf, you're going to wait two months to bring it up? Bring it up TODAY.

""Hey, now that we're planning on getting married, I just really want to make sure that we are on the same page about kids.""

This is a man you're planning on tying yourself to forever. If you feel the need to tiptoe around difficult conversations then you probably shouldn't be getting married to him."
"I feel really sad for you OP. It’s like you’re giving without even putting in any effort. Sex is like driving a car. The first time you drive a car would you just hop on the highway and drive 70mph? No right? You start slow in parking slots and alleys and neighborhood streets. You work your way up to the highway. It’s the same with sex. Start by kissing, touching , exploring. Work your way up to the sex and who knows maybe you’ll really enjoy it. First and foremost though talk to him. Tell him about your fears and work through this with him. You chose him for a reason. Let him decide if he wants to work through this with you. Good luck!"
"I feel so sorry for you OP. I hope she realizes there's more to life than church otherwise at one point she might have a very rude awakening. Since the kids are back in school maybe it's time for less bible study and more look for a job. The questions is, can you take 20 or 30 years more of not doing anything with your life? What happens when the children grow and go to college and they stop believing in this nonsense?"
You are truly clueless.
"&gt;Silent treatment for over a week because of some saved pictures that he probably jerks off to of a girl he knows. 

Silent treatment is a deliberate and manipulative tactic used to punish people; being so angry, upset, and confused that you struggle to hold a normal conversation with someone who has betrayed your trust is an understandable way of processing a bad event.

&gt;You're right, he didn't kill someone, he didn't even cheat or blow through their entire savings, he saved some pictures. Can you imagine if he actually did something that would justify this response? This is absolutely wrong.

The bar shouldn't be 'Well, he didn't totally destroy her life by blowing through all her money or unambiguously decimate their relationship by cheating, so she doesn't deserve to feel *that* bad'. That's ridiculous. Acting like the only time being upset and struggling to control your reaction to events so that it doesn't negatively impact your partner is justified is when *your life has been ruined* is totally ludicrous. There are shades between 'not a big deal' and 'total life ruined', and you are allowed to be upset about things that haven't totally destroyed your life.

What you're saying is that even as OP is struggling with sadness, anger, shame, embarrassment, and low self-esteem due to her husband acting like a total creep (because there is *no* non-creepy reason to have saved a tonne of her friend's Instagram photos, don't even try), she should be making sure that her *husband* isn't made to feel bad. Her husband, who has betrayed her trust and thrown her into turmoil, should be her priority.

Again, screw that. "
"Because he was already failing to pay his share. And Op practically allowed him back in, except now he wasn't just struggling to pay. He was outright not going to pay anything. That was the agreement. If he didn't pay he was out. OP failed to meet her own agreement and is now wondering why sister left? It seemed sister was fine with covering for his part as long as he was out of the house. Instead they both did whatever they wanted without taking her into consideration. They all screwed up. Next time she makes an agreement with a roommate, she needs to learn to uphold it herself first."
"Exactly.  That's what I meant by ""OPs girlfriend has clearly bought into the marketing"""
"You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about. He shouldn’t have flirted with you, he shouldn’t have said “probably,” and he shouldn’t have asked for your number. Just treat him normally."
"&gt;""everything I've been saying to you this evening is irrelevant, because i'm only bothering talking to you because you're hot and I want to fuck you""

even with casual sex, you still have to *like* the person - or at least I do. It's not just about looks. It's not even *primarily* about looks, really.

&gt;When I meet women I have always wanted to get to know them as people and develop a natural rapport. I always thought I would meet someone at university and lose my virginity in a loving relationship. 

You can still have that, if that's what you prefer. But you need to start meeting people, if you want a relationship."
TALK TO YOUR BROTHER!!!  As a mom....sometimes we are a little behind on the current obsessions.  Maybe he would prefer a deadpool themed affordable present or maybe he reallu wants a Minecraft giftcard.
"Female Black Belt in Karate and Brown in Brazilian Jui Jitsu here ...my martial arts have been a huge benefit in my life. My posture and bearing make people take me seriously. The black belt rank is a very positive talking point for job interviews. 

DO NOT sacrifice that for some selfish dime a dozen frat boy! 3 months from now when he’s thinking about hooking up with the sorority girls at a party because you aren’t available 24/7 you’ll kick yourself for not at least getting your black belt! 

I know martial arts can seem silly to some people, but I assure you if you ‘own’ your belt, and are realistically proud of the effort and the work, people they are not assholes will be interested and respectful of the effort. 

I suspect your parents see this guy is actually kind of an ass, and are trying to do damage control without telling you to break-up. But It sounds to me like a break-up is in your best interest. "
"That's true, she's been very considerate of us and our schedule."
"So, let me see if I understand you.

When OP will settle for, but can't even expect, a romantic card for Christmas from her bf = bad materialism

OP's boyfriend buying a female stranger a $65 sweater for Christmas = good materialism

How am I doing?"
"Such an important point. He figures he's got her ""trapped"" now so he doesn't have to try anymore. Him caring was just a front. He literally doesn't give a shit."
"Ugh.
I hate this kind of ****.

I'd break up with her. She and all the friends sound extremely immature and annoying. They don't respect peoples' boundaries or feelings, apparently at all.
It's also weird that they are fixated on this? Who the **** cares about this crap.

Break up with her OP. You can do better.

If you are completely opposed to that, have a serious sit down and lay it all out for her. Tell her you're seriously irritated and this is almost becoming a dealbreaker for you in your relationship with her, and then maybe ask her WHY she is doing it wtf. Get some communication going, otherwise this relationship is toast."
"Right, you are trying your best, and he is messaging another girl about her blow jobs.

I'm sorry, there was no better way to word that. My favorite phrase is don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. Why are you the one putting all the time and effort into this relationship?"
Especially if they bought high before the crash can be very hard leans to maintain
"Well I think that was a bit rash, you should have just asked what the comment was about instead of going full nuclear. :s"
"How do you know she was referring to the gift OP? All you heard was her saying it was so intense, but she could have been having a background conversation with someone about anything... you're making assumptions here."
"This. My husband *thought* he had accidentally burned me once (He hadn't at all) and spent the rest of the night apologising and trying to make up for nothing. He was completely horrified and was convinced he had hurt me. 

Trying to blame you for being in the way when it doesn't sound like you were is awful. "
You don't reward tantrums.
"Nope, they get the sofa bed! It's your house, you can do as you please.

We only ever gave our bed up for my parents when they got older and found the sofa bed more difficult to get in and out of as it was a bit low.

Like everyone else, I want to know why your cousins are honeymooning in your house! "
Then it’s probably not a good idea to play into their conservatism if that’s not how you want to live your life.  Why live as a hypocrite when you can just not pretend to be perfect?
"Totally. Huge violation. 

It's been about a year but that's a massive red flag. You need to get her apologize and promise to not do that again and ask her why she interrogated you about things that happened before you knew eachother. "
"&gt; OPs wife just sounds like shes completely unglued all because the kids want to associate with the ex. 

I'm halfway with you. The wife sounds unglued, but not because the kids want to associate with the ex, but because her kids betrayed her by keeping it secret. There's no way it can be anything other than an utter betrayal to keep this secret from her, and while she's absolutely collapsing because of it, let's not pretend we don't know why.

This woman found out literally every man in her life was lying to her. Two of her sons, three of her stepsons, and her husband were all in on the secret that the husband was cheating and all of them kept that secret among themselves.

So yeah, I can see never speaking to those step-kids again, given that they clearly don't care about you, and yeah, I can see not wanting your own kids to see them because both sets of kids were culpable and the best thing you can do in those situations is remove the people you care about from bad influences.

She's acting like a lunatic, but there's some real work to be done between this woman and her sons, and the sons are going to have to realize eventually how much they've hurt their mother. I don't know if they'll care at all by the time they realize, but the mom's hurt and the kids' obliviousness are the root of this."
"I'd add something like, ""I can tell you worked so hard on this. That's amazing! Not everyone can say they have written and published a book. I am super proud of you!"" If she's thinking of writing another, encourage her to find an editor to help her work get ""even better"". "
"I don't think they consider this as a serious issue and that there is just some weirdo who talks too much. Until it becomes something where he has said something sexual or god forbid, done something sexual."
"&gt; urine is sterile 

No, it isn't. It might be while it's in your bladder, but then it passes through the tip of your penis, which is not sterile."
"&gt; As for taking care of the baby, I don't know. I can't go home since my family would hate me for getting pregnant, and I have no network of support here.


then keeping this baby is insane. Literally insane. Like, there should be a law to stop you. Do the math. realise the squalour you would be living in. realise college  - and thus a career - is OVER for you if you keep this baby. The whole of the last 18 years of working for college  - thrown away.  The whole next 18 years, thrown away. And then you'll be 36, no degree, no work experience, no future. Oh and nobody will date you with a kid, so yeah, single too.

Hope you like raman and dont like central heating.

&gt; I am still against abortion though, so i don't know what to do

You have an abortion and hate yourself for a little while, until you grow up and realise it was the right thing to do."
"Sounds like she's been attempting to gain some distance and some independence for a while now. If all she's ever done is be Mom and Wife she might feel like she needs it, especially if the kids are older and able to take care of themselves more.

Here's the thing though: If you want your children to be truly happy, then you have to accept that it might be better for them to live in two homes with one happy parent in each rather than in one home with one parent who probably feels like she's not being allowed to have a life and one parent who takes it personally when she does."
"One thing to keep in mind is that y’all have so much joy and love as partners and that sometimes gets muddied as you start to take on a more caretaking role. You might want to think about how you can continue to bring her support as her boyfriend by setting good boundaries about how you will both ask for help caring for her physical needs. Sometimes when we take on caretaking roles, we can lose some of the romance that draws us to each other. Not because it’s not coming from a place of love, but because the role of a caretaker can be difficult to balance with being a partner. I’m so happy you find love in each other! Building up a support system for both of you will really help keep you both able to focus on LIFE together instead of pouring your energy into her illness. Best of luck! "
"Ask your parents to install locks on your room and perhaps some simple home cams. She's still going to break in and destroy shit, but then you're making it a little bit harder and you have evidence of what she's exactly doing. 

Perhaps your parents should also call Adult Protective Services for some advice and help. Maybe your sister needs to be on disability or in a program where she has a guidance counselor while she lives alone. Katie needs independence, she definitely needs to live on her own. But that doesn't mean she will be alone. With APS advice, maybe your parents can navigate that. "
"You're still with your sisters ex? That's the husband you're referring to? Yes, the saying us time heals all wounds, but 4 years might not be enough time for this one. "
Marriage is not for the faint-hearted. 
Absolutely. I've had first-hand experience with this and a former partner of mine. I was convinced they would never help me after the way I pushed them away and I couldn't have been more wrong. 
"..... Why would you return the ring? That makes no sense.
"
"&gt; I thought maybe he should be the one to reach out to her and tell her to GFY but he thinks even that is letting her win.

If you respond to someone after they send you 50 messages, even to tell them to stop sending messages, what you are telling them is that if they want you to respond, they need to send 50 messages.
"
"She's actually not super old to be having her first psychotic break. Schizophrenia is traditionally thought of as appearing first in the 18-22 age group, but with women, the first episode can be in their late 20s. "
"Lmao that line infuriated me. If it weren't for OP subsidizing her life and business, she couldnt even pursue this ""dream"" - so I hope OP dumps her ungrateful, misguided ass."
"Most Christians I can get along with just fine.  It's the ""everyone except my group is going to hell"" kind that I can't get along with; it's such a poisonous attitude to have.  

&gt;And I fear this will escelate in fights, resentment, anger and loss of respect.

We're basically there.  Most conflicts are ignored until they go away, but if one of them sticks, it's her yelling, tears, and passive-aggressively ignoring me until we swallow our dissension and pretend like everything is ok again.

She will not agree to a divorce, I know because I've brought it up in the past.  I'm terrified of how things will play out if we eventually go that route...she hasn't worked in over 10 years, since our first child was born.  I have been the sole bread winner for the family.  I am scared of the unknowns on her end should we go the divorce route.  I make enough, but not a whole lot, and we both will be struggling financially if we get divorced.  "
"You can cheat with your heart as well as your body. In your shoes, I honestly wouldn't even care whether or not sex had been involved. He was romantically courting another woman. That would be it for me."
"&gt; He did say though, if we do that, he's going to be sending someone to check on us every 30 minutes or so.

Maybe just keep your bedroom door open if he is talking about you two retreating to your room while the dinner/evening continues?

Perhaps I'm being hopeful here, but it sounds like your dad just wants you to feel comfortable being able to bring around a girlfriend or a good friend. As long as you two dress suitably for the event (ask your dad and mom about dress code or expectations, then relay those promptly to your SO so she can prepare as best as possible), and you behave nicely, it should go quite well. People can get passed oddly dyed hair, but being rude is a no-go. I would say jeans with holes in them get viewed with greater hostility than freaky hair colors (at least by older folks), but it all can vary.

At least you dad and mom will see that you are seeking to be respectful with all of that. They might even have etiquette tips or things not to do that could help your girlfriend and you! I'm not saying pretend to be another person; just be the best you in that right context."
"What kind of psycho fucking school is that? You want to exchange your ""psycho roommate spying on me having sex for blackmail material"" situation for a ""psycho school that will expel me and ruin my professional success if i have sex"" situation?

Like, seriously rethink this. You're 35. Not 15. Are you actually willing to indulge that kind of insane restriction on adult freedom for this career? You say it's political, not religious, so why is the best program for it at a religious school? (if you're not in the US then ignore that question, but if you are... umm separation of church and state??)"
"+1 to this. I'm actually a little confused as to why everyone's jumping on the OP and being like ""well OF COURSE your gf is going to be scared and confused!"" he was 12. If my SO told me he beat the shit out of someone as a kid and there's been no serious red flags beforehand in the relationship, y reaction would probably be something along the lines of 'oh okay, that sucks I guess why do I care??""

I guess I just don't really care about the acts of a literal child when we're both adults. Everyone's also real quick to judge the OP for trying to explain himself. ""YOU'RE JUST MAKING EXCUSES"" it reminds me of every time I tried to explain *why* XYZ happened to teachers or smth and got screamed at for making ""excuses."" No you fuckers I'm providing the *reason*. there's a difference!

Everything about the comments section here is making me frustrated and baffled. but different people with different cares ig"
"Welp, incoming downvotes. 


A TA in a science related field is only a few years ahead of you. I’m going to go on the example you pointed out in a comment where she told you “if you incubate anything long enough it’ll be positive”

I’m going to go on a limb to say your TA is working in a lab and overlapping her practical experience to your references (which are usually very black and white)

As opposed to everyone else, I think it’s fine to talk to your professor if you can’t understand the TAs criticism (please note that, excepting some awful professors, most give their TAs guidelines for grading).  Please don’t approach the professor saying your TA hates you or you deserve a higher grade. The question you want to ask is “I am having trouble understanding this concept. How should I have presented it? At first I thought (what you wrote), am I wrong I’m thinking this?”

If your thinking is “right” go on to ask how to best explain it next time. If your thinking is wrong, listen to the right answer and then ask how to best explain it. 

TAs have too much on their plates to hate you. "

"Rent a storage space unit as a safe spot and slowly empty your things into it.  Rent a PO box and redirect your mail over there, see if they have a forwarding service so you can get mail sent to you in Europe.  If these things are too expensive, store items/redirect mail to a trusted friend or stack them in your office.

On another note, your GF is really troubled and you are totally justified in vanishing.  I'm guessing your movements are tracked because she is at home all day.  Not letting you leave for 5(!) hours is abusive (abusive is a term that gets thrown around a lot here, but she doesn't have to physically hit you in order to be abusive.)  The UK recently passed laws against coercive and controlling behaviors and she fits into that.

Next time she doesn't let you leave the apartment, call the non-emergency police phone number.  After you get away, if she won't leave you alone then you may need to get a restraining order with the regular police as well as campus police.  And as terrible as this is, if you can give a list/pack up and label items so a friend can empty your items from the apartment when you two are away for that weekend away, it might be the easiest way."

I remember being a young kid, elementary school, and I asked my mom why she didn't pack me a lunch like the other kids. She told me to pack it myself if I wanted one - a first grader! This extened into basically everything else, it was up to me to feed myself. And the choices I made were bad. 

When you're 9 and all you know how to use is the microwave, you eat a lot of shitty food. But I wasn't the one buying it. In fact my mom was very proud of the fact that she wouldn't allow me to have sugary cereals or soda. I guess boxes and boxes of chicken nuggets are okay though.

I was never taught anything about calories. Candy and ice cream were bad, yeah, but 3 bowls of cornflakes? That's pretty normal, right? If you eat 3000 calories in sandwiches to try to fill the emptiness and boredom you feel while being neglected by your parents, is it really your choice? 

Once I started to get noticeably fat, my parents both seemed to feel upset about it. Their response was to tell me I'm fat and I need to eat less, that I don't exercise enough. Just telling me though - no other support, like offering to go on bike rides or hikes, trying to teach me how to make a healthy dinner, or any of that. 

So it's not always a story of just eating too much candy. "
"I just want to say that you sound like an amazing person. Protecting your mom when you were so young, and continuing to provide for her now. You deserve your empathetic girlfriend a million percent.

I really hope that you also dedicate time to caring for yourself. Being a nurturer often means that part gets neglected."
Right? Dog behavior is completely foreign to him in assessing whether or not a dog is in full attack mode but knows the exact behavior that triggers them to attack. Ok. 
"I agree with everyone saying to cut contact and threaten a restraining order, but I also want to say: this person is not your close friend. This person has been using your friendship this whole time to try to date you. This is not a ""toxic relationship,"" this is someone trying to push you into being their girlfriend when you never wanted to. A respectful person, an *actual friend*, never would treat you like this."
"&gt; For your in-laws staying at your place while you're not there, eh. Let them stay in your room. It's one night and I doubt they'll raid your closet.

Not the point.  To some, the bedroom and bed are very personal.  OP is justified in wanting personal space to remain that way.  

&gt; Regardless, you should have talked this over together and reached a consensus before any sleeping arrangements were made.

Did you read the OP? He tried talking it over regarding the parents, and she steamrolled him.  With brother and SO, she made a decision without consulting OP, so he did't have a chance to try to reach a consensus.  "
"This is what I'm worried about. That I might not be able to ever get over it, even if he does have a good explanation. Pre-marital counselling might be a good idea, but I'm scared I won't ever be able to unring this bell. I will bring myself to talk to him though. Thanks for the advice so far."
I had a buddy who was tripping but trying to hide it from his gf at the time because she  wasn't  down.  She wants sex so he goes for it.  5 minutes in he was crying and scared shitless Because he thought their bodies were melding together...  least sexy times drug I've ever tried
"For real!

This:
&gt;**and intentionally tells her red lights are green**, or does other things that freak her out and make her make bad decisions, so he can yell at her for not being ""on her toes.""

And this:
&gt; Then, she was driving behind a car, and they slowed down abruptly. My sister panicked, and **hit the accelerator instead of the brake**, ramming into the back of their car. 

Gives hints about why that was her reaction. Accidents definitely do happen, but considering he's yelling at her about Opposite Day in the car..."
"Just be honest, don't pussyfoot around the truth in a relationship. That way leads to madness, always trying to avoid upsetting the other person.

My husband loves long hair. I recently got a haircut that was way shorter than I expected. As soon as he saw it his face fell &amp; he said ""I hate it.""

I couldn't help but laugh. I adore him for his honesty! He reiterated that he loves me &amp; always finds me attractive &amp; it's my hair but that he hates the haircut. Fine. No problem, it'll grow out.

She's an adult. Just be honest with her."
"I had a similar thing with my mum...

I went through a phase of working from home, while my SO worked in an office - bought in same income, did the same level of chores in the evenings/weekend etc 

Anyway, I was chatting to my mum one day, saying that looking at the messy house was distracting me from working, and making me feel like i should just tidy up, to which she said ""you should, you're the one enjoying your day at home, poor SO is out working"".... as if somehow, the business I had built from scratch should take second place to doing the dishes!! The same woman who told me i could be anything.... "
"&gt; Mother asked for significant amount of money from my student loan,

WTF?

&gt; I was hesitant

Thank God!

&gt; offered alternatives

Very nice of you.

&gt; she got mad at me

Let her be mad. Ain't no cure for stupid.

&gt; she said they don't want to get involved in the legal hassle.

Sounds like she doesn't think they would win... probably some terms and conditions you don't know about... probably the firm wasn't really responsible for this and she lies to you about it to try and get you to help.

&gt; Her savings are her retirement plan and she doesn't want to use them at the moment.

You said 60K in savings.... not much of a retirement plan. Good thing you are moving out of the country to get away from this toxic person.
"
"Yeah, as soon she told me I let her know that I wasn't going anywhere and would be there. We both know it's legitimately the best call right now, which makes it easier on both of us. "
"When you're a counselor in a situation like this, you don't really have a choice other than to very sneakily lead someone up to the door, crack it open, and suggest they peek through to the other side.

First, the counselor has a relationship with both the husband and wife, and there are certain ethics against just blatantly picking sides, obvious as it may be. Unless there is physical violence, sexual violence or threats happening, you have to tread very lightly.

Second, you can't hammer in perspective changes into people. They have to be able to logically step from one stone to the next themselves. If you just lay it hard on someone: ""Your husband is an abuser!"" then you're likely to get the client to either go into complete denial because they cannot see how you've arrived there given what you've told them, and therefore not trust your opinion, or just shut you out entirely out of fear, and stop coming.

Counselor got them this far, so they sound quite capable."
"&gt;Any advice?

Yeah, skip your job and go to the nearest police station to report that you were sexually assaulted. Keeping this job isn't worth it - not even close. AND if you get fired for reporting this, that's a crime. Firing someone in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment or assault is illegal at a federal level; the EEOC investigates that. "

"Well, there's your mistake right there.  You married someone while thinking they would change.  That never works.  And it sounds like it was a mistake anyway, as you didn't really want to, rather that you just had bad relationships before and this one didn't suck."
"Well she sounds just delightful :-(

Your whole family needs to stop 'appeasing' her. That's why she IS this way.


You send a message saying ""No, I am not going to do that.""

Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) because she'll fight each point. Don't say ""Sorry"", dont say ""I hope it goes well"".
Don't answer the ensuing shitstorm.  Just..... block her. She is toxic in every way. Seriously, cut her the fuck out of your life. Or this will never end. She'll get the message eventually, after a lot of drama. 
"
You're being purposely daft aren't you? It's a snapstreak. With your ex. She's allowed to be uncomfortable with it. How long is it anyway?? Unless its thousands of days long I don't see why you care about it.
"If he still has that level of doubts about you.  Then you need to take a look at this relationship.  You have to trust each other 100%, and it sounds like he isn't there.  You both need to sit down and have a long conversation about this.  

Both your friends are idiots.  I don't know what field he is going into.  But I know lots of people who went into fields with great ""earning potential"" and still haven't made near that much.  You two are fighting over money you don't even have yet.  You both need to stand up to your friends and shut down that nonsense now, or get better friends."
This post should be available for everyone who doesn’t understand how abusive relationships “work.”
"Considering OP says that she does stuff like this often, I think it's probably a good suggestion. "
Oh honey.... Do you really think he values your friendship over his relationship with HIS WIFE?! Get over yourself. Grow up. You are not that important. I hope he does drop you. You are toxic to his relationship. 
Don't forget your dog! He may do something to it if you leave it alone with him after you leave
Maybe stop calling her irrational? you must have said she was irrational like 30 times in this post. Shes your fucking girlfriend and it seems like you only have bad things to say about her. Why do you even like her in the first place? 
"You need to do whatever you can to leave before it gets to that point. Can you move in with a friend or find a roommate so you can still split the cost of living without having to deal with this creep? I don't normally advocate sending pets away, but you need to put your well being before your dogs if placing them elsewhere (ideally temporariliy) will make that possible. "
"Seriously, unless you’ve thought of doing it before or have done it before who decides to pinch in the armpits? It’s also an oddly specific area for kids to make up.

Personally, this would be divorce-worthy. "
"&gt;Wouldn't it be easier for him to just end things with me than to try to keep things going?

What part about cheaters do you not get? He wants to have sex with you *and* with her. Who cares if he wants you or her in the end (it's her otherwise he'd have ended things). He's a liar and a cheater."
"Two possible reasons could be: 

1) possibly she was humiliated at having to delete all the photos of her ex-boyfriend when they broke up so she wants to wait a little longer before she's comfortable posting a relationship publicly again

2) if she's attractive and trying to cultivate a large social media presence, it's common for women to avoid putting their boyfriends on their social media because other men are less likely to follow women if they know she has a boyfriend. i remember reading about a female live streamer who mentioned that she would literally get half as many likes on pictures of her with her boyfriend as opposed to pictures of her alone.

I'm not saying either of these are necessarily a good thing but they're better options than her cheating. I would say this is a yellow flag: not a complete red flag but take it in conjunction with her other behaviors. Does she introduce you to her friends and family? Does she look proud to be with you whenever you're out in public?"
"&gt; (I don’t think “I’m not attracted to Asian men” is necessarily racist.)

Ehh maybe you wouldn't call it racist but deciding such a large group of people is simply unattractive to you is still ridiculous, especially because attraction is just a very subjective thing. You may have an 'ideal look' in mind as what you would find most attractive in a person but surely everyone can grow to love another person and start to like things they didn't know they would before?

To me it's just like saying you're not attracted to brunettes at all - a ridiculous generalization. What she said may be a preference / not racist but I think she holds that preference because she is racist.

"yes, people have opinions. some people think the earth is flat. I don't understand how that statement assists OP."
"This isn't really any advice, but I'm really shocked she was invited to the wedding at all, what is wrong with your son and husband? Bet they wouldn't be so nonchalant if it was their ex best friend. It's even weirder that she RSVP'd.

I wouldn't reach out before the wedding, that's kind of on her.

I think the best thing to do is honestly just ignore it, there's a chance she may want to make amends by coming."
"Yes, yes, yes! It would be a different situation if you had been the one to change the guys-only dynamic. But Matt wanted Anna there. If he wants her mall excursions to be accommodated, HE should be the one to accommodate them.

Your gf sounds like she is doing everything right -- genuinely trying to include Anna in activities, but not resentfully abandoning her own vacation in order to be a babysitter, and not trying to keep you from enjoying yourself with the guys. 

I know you don't want to make waves with Matt, but you have to be honest with him. To not do so will be much more damaging to your relationship with him in the long run."
"I get that you don't wanna be controlling, but if this were my relationship I would tell him that he cannot be friends with her.  Full stop.  And if he doesn't think that is something he can do, I'd walk. "
"Right? ""I'm going to buy this house you can come or not"" - totally a welcoming and happy thing!

Also, this lights thing is just weird. Like, if you're home when the sun is up, you don't have all the lights on, and then the sun sets, so you don't turn all the lights on in every room, just the room you're in? Thats just such a weird thing to complain about! Also, conservation much? LOL"
"Send them a copy of the book “Vegan for Life” which has nutritional guidelines for kids and adults. Bookmark the kid section.

Send them a link to the YouTube channel of “The Unnatural Vegan” she has videos of why raw is bad, and she is pro-science.

"In no way at all am I condoning how she’s treating you, but depression and grief can make people do crazy things. When you feel so low or numb, you start doing things to feel again. It’s not something I could ever forgive, but I’m giving you some food for thought. "
"After reading the OP's original post and his responses, OP is a total doormat. If his post and responses are truthful, he has let his wife leave her mom and grandfather in his primary care and spent most of their disposable income on her interests all while giving OP a minimum of attention. This has also led to OP spending less time on his job than he should have given that he is the leading earner in the household.

"If you're intimidated because he's awesome, then find a therapist who can teach you how to better channel your emotions.  Probably should talk to HR and explain what's going on as well.  Hopefully you aren't a racist."
"You have been given an opportunity to make your life significantly better. Use it. Giving your mom the money wont change the abuse your grandma laid at her doorstep. Nor will it change the abuse you suffered at your moms hands. Your mom isnt broke or destitute. She will be getting a share which from what you said is larger than yours. 

You have been conditioned to excuse your moms abuse. Hell half your post excuses away her behavior. What will your mom say if you say no? Im sure you’re afraid of what her response will be. Your mom chooses to act abusive to you instead of seeking help. 

You’re letting a gift that can do so much good in your life start to turn and become something you dread. Giving your mom the money wont stop the type of person she is. At this point probably nothing can. Now is the time to be strong and do what is best for you. 
"
"Yea, I completely agree with this. The vague promises of ""we'll revisit the issue once her term is up"" sound either like (a) she'll decide what she wants to do and tell him after the fact, like this time, or (b) (more likely IMO) she's planning on breaking up with him, and wants distance between them first to make it easier for her."
"i'm of the opinion that they're arn't many people who couldn't benefit from a mental-wellness checkup from time to time. i wish people would treat it like getting their blood pressure done.

Which goes back to my original comment. They clearly need to take a harassment seminar then because they don't understand what harassment is. 
"I was going to say the same thing! Wait two years. If it's meant to be, they can come back in a few years and be fine. I guarantee she does A LOT of growing up in those two years though.

"&gt;He’s so controlling. I’m basically strangled. I have no car (not enough money, supposedly), no job (I’m a stay at home mom), no friends anymore (he didn’t like them, so slowly they got cut out), no access to money (he’s the only one with our only card. I get a cash “allowance” sometimes, but not often).

This IS abuse. You're a prisoner."
If you can afford it I would get a pair of lined (waterproof) sheets for her bed that you can toss if need be. My cousin took the pill and bled through all her pads and it ruined her mattress. 20$ sheets would be much cheaper than a replacement! 
"I think given she follows it with  ""I dont want to lead anyone on"" she suspects OP is the one who has feelings  for her. Either her husband suggested this or her but they suspected  this and her question was looking for assurance that he doesn't  have any feelings  for her  and thus  her husband  doesn't  have  anything  worry about.

"I'm sorry but I think you behaved really unproductively here, even if it was out of love and support. The reality is that Lucas is dependent on your mother, financially and emotionally. Rather than helping your mother become more sympathetic, or helping Lucas take steps to become more independent from her, you've undermined any chance for progress in the short term (at the very least). 

If I were you (and I have a more similar situation than you might realise in my own conservative parents with vulnerable, non conforming siblings in their care), I would give your mum some space. Message her apologising for going behind her back, and say you respect and understand her desire to raise her child in the way she deems healthiest. Then draw on the fact that you, as an older sister, also want the best for your sibling and love them. Ask if you can talk privately with her about what that looks like, and go from there.

There is very little you are going to get out of being ideological about this. I know our generation more easily accepts issues like transgender and identity questions, but they can be genuinely  confronting for still-loving parents. Take a step back and approach this with a little more care- Lucas deserves it. "

"I hear what your saying. If that is the case, however, I can't imagine that he would admit it though? How would asking (to which, I think we can safely assume he will say no) help her?"
Your best friend ended your friendship with this move. He's sending you a clear message that it's over. I wouldn't attend the wedding if I were you - you will probably never see him again after it even if you go.

"This, I'm a prof and the attitude that comes through in this post is really off-putting. Each class has different expectations, and saying the point of taking these classes is to get an A is the sort of comment that would be irksome to most profs and TAs. The attitude you want to come across is that you're here to learn. Cliche, I know, but true.

You need to: take time to read the comments (ie don't make appointments before you've even read them), address any interactions as ' I'd like to learn more about where I went wrong and how to improve in the future.' Profs will generally back up the TAs, and will want to know that you addressed any concerns with the TA first. A remark can mean your mark stays the same, goes up or goes down."
You sound lazy. Get your ass up and clean the right way. No one likes to pick up after grown adults specially men. Get it together!
"Hi OP. I am so sorry to hear about this tragedy. This was not your fault. This is one of those absolutely terrible events for which nobody can really tell you how to feel or what to do. Everyone has their own path to deal with grief.

I would, however, recommend seeking a professional therapist. This is way about reddit's paygrade. Having a specialist who is able to be a sounding board for you and help you understand your thoughts and emotions will be invaluable as you pick up the pieces from here.

I am so, so sorry. **This was not your fault.** I wish you well."
"I would add that if you do end up needing to say something I would personally say something along the lines of ""She came and apologized to me immediately and has been extremely remorseful"" and that you just want to move past it and hope they can too.

Also while its not necessarily any of their business, do they have the full context? Because if not they might think that you caught her and that she's just a dirty cheater / manipulator.

I would share with them how she came to you after a drunken one night stand bawling her eyes out, if it comes from her they may just see it as an excuse (the line between giving context and making excuses for oneself is extremely blurry) whereas if it comes from you it might help them to move past it.

"Hi OP, situations like this generally fall under what I call the 'emotional labour' problem.  That is, women tend to get stuck with doing all the emotional labour - from taking care of the children to managing and running the household.

If you're new parents, and your fiance can still spend his time playing games all day then something is definitely wrong.  Ignore your mother - the older generation let this thing slide because they didn't know better and those that got stuck with crappy partners might have genuinely thought that men were physically and intellectually incapable of taking care of children (that is the only reason I can think for why entire generations of women let this pass).

It sounds like your fiance does want to help - he just has no knowledge, experience or ability.  Can I suggest you give a call back to the hospital (did you have a nurse who was supposed to come around to help you figure out how to breast feed, change diapers etc) and ask if there's any classes for new parents.

That is - classes on how to hold the baby, on feeding, diaper changing, on what is normal crying versus not normal crying?

If they don't know, try the local community center.  If they don't know, try the local library.  Somewhere in the community somebody will know of a place your fiance can get educated.

And while he's in classes, OP, I strongly recommend two things:

(1) Call your mother, ask her to please take care of your baby while you catch up on sleep.

(2) Call your university and ask if you can get leniency on your exams/assignments as you are a new parent and struggling with lack of sleep.

Also do these things:

- tell your fiance that he'll never get better at dealing with the baby (crying or otherwise) unless he practises.  He needs to manage without you supervising or he's not a true parent.  If he doesn't step up there's a problem.

- never feel guilty for wanting to rely on somebody who doesn't need you to constantly supervise them.  If your fiance isn't up to the task, go to your mother instead.  And if your fiance whinges about it tell him to shape up or shut up, your sleep is important.

- tell your fiance that if he plays games all day then he better as hell be managing all diaper changes and night feedings and all the cleaning up in your home.  WTF."
"Come over, we'll take you out for dinner and buy you a birthday gift. Seriously. 

Also, your husband sucks. If he thinks you're materialistic, he can give you gifts that don't cost anything - a flower from the side of the road, a printed poem, etc. Money is secondary in gift-giving, it's the thought that counts first."
"&gt; I can't keep cutting ties with everyone I feel this way for right?

Sure you can. For most people, crushes don't happen all the time. I mean meeting someone hot is one thing, actually engaging with them etc. which can lead to emotional cheating and worse is another. In cases like the one you've described, cutting this friend out is the only way to go. Everything else is simply disrespectful towards your gf. 

I mean have you told her about your friend? Could you imagine how she'd react?"
"She sounds ungrateful, unrealistic and a little controlling. There’s nothing wrong with anything you’ve mentioned doing, and lots of people would be incredibly happy to have a partner who cares enough to keep a list and reminders like that. "
"&gt;I then told her that a married woman should not be shy with her husband and be comfortable enough to sleep naked with me as we are married

You took it from a general ""A wife should be comfortable with her husband"" to ""my wife shouldn't be shy and should sleep naked with me.""

But seriously? This was just poor communication, and her reaction is quite extreme. I hope you two aren't getting married any time soon, because with this kind of argument, you're in for one heck of a rough marriage. "

I think Anna is a ""missing stair"" that the whole group is trying to work around, rather than calling her on her uncompromising behavior (won't buy sneakers, won't be ready to do things in a timely fashion). This dynamic is common in social scenarios, but her behavior is not yours, or your girlfriend's, to fix."
"I think you need to tell him that you will 100% never be okay with nonmonogamy. If he still wants to get married knowing that, it's a good sign.

I just had this exchange (when I walked into the door after my full time job)

Me: can you please put those drink glasses on the coffee table in the dishwasher so I can run it?
Him: they aren't my glasses
Me: THEY AREN'T MINE EITHER! Why should I have to do it?! Just do it! You've been home all day!

Of course I will run and unload the dishwasher because if I don't then the dirty dishes will pile up in the sink forever

It's not sophisticated to be a snob.
Maybe you come across as a bit intense on the first date? Like maybe focusing too hard on it going well and saying the exact right things that you're not really connecting with them? Are you a bit of a Type A or perfectionist? I really have no clue without knowing you personally but it's just a guess. Also a hike as a first date could be intimidating since you are obviously very fit and into that sort of thing. So unless you know that's totally her thing as well it's kind of a risky first date.
