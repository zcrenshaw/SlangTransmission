"Got this line when i asked a girl to pay for the pizza i just delivered. 

She took the pizza and was closing the door, i said ""wait you gotta pay"" she just said ""i have a boyfriend so sowwy!"" Yes she said ""sowwy"" in the snarkiest way possible. 

I kept knocking, she called me a creep and told me to leave. Her boyfriend came around and she said he'll beat me up. Nope, he paid for her pizza and gave me a $10 tip for having to deal with her shit. It was VERY clear he was 110% DONE with her bullshit. "
"I just finished shopping and was in the parking lot putting my stuff in my car. This girl was putting her cart in the corral the same time I was and I notice she'd forgotten a case of soda and chicken strips at the bottom of her cart.

Me: ""Excuse me Miss.""

Her: ""Um dude, I have a boyfriend."" And then she immediately got into her car. I waited for her to drive away, took her shit, and left. I had a nice lunch that day, thanks to her being a bitch."

"Bonus points for this happening less than 2 hours ago? 

I'm on shift as an EMT when we get a call for a confirmed cardiac arrest in the mall. Usually on these calls it's all hands on deck until we arrive so occasionally no one is there to guide us to the patient. My partner and I arrive on scene in a rush and a little lost as per where to go so I approach the first person in front of me who happened to be this dumb bitch who immediately turned to me and gave me the line. Granted I'm in full uniform with a defib in one hand and a crash bag in the other with my partner &amp; stretcher 5 feet behind me. The male whom she was with, presumably the bf, called her an idiot and directed us. As we were running off he yelled an apology and started yelling at her - didn't really hear what was going on but I hope it was him breaking up with her bc come on now bitch. Fucking annoying af. 


Make matters worse, we lost the patient. All around bad turn of events for the day and I still have 5 hours left."

"At a bar, had a booth where my girlfriend and a few other friends were hanging out. They were absolutely slammed, so I told the waitress (who was also a classmate) not to worry about our table, I'd get the drinks from the bar. Knew the bartender, so I told him the order and told him to yell my name when the order was up and I'll come around to pick them up. 

He does, so go I go to the counter to see this woman with zero spatial awareness, sit at the counter talking to her friend while also directly near the trays where our order was. I patiently wait for her to stop talking (she doesn't). I clear my throat, the following ensues:

""Excuse me, could I-""

*looks at me the way you'd look at a bag of poo*

""I have a boyfriend""

Me, visibly annoyed: ""Good for you! Now, could you please let me pass, I need to grab my drinks.""

She begrudgingly moves, I take the tray and head back to my table, feeling her eyes bore a hole in the back of my skull the entire time. I was seated facing her on the other side of the room; couldn't help her shooting dirty looks at us every time we were laughing, presumably because she thought we were having a laugh about her. "

"Was behind a young lady in the supermarket lineup for a self checkout till. She was next up for the newly opened spot but was on her phone. It tapped her on the shoulder, started to tell her, 'Pardon me, you're spot is...' 

#I have a boyfriend

I assume she said it so loudly because she had her headphones on. It stopped me mid sentence with my mouth open. After a moment's pause I closed my mouth and just walked past her to checkout my items.

It sucked the air out of the area. The usual din of conversations and casual chitchat from the cashiers was gone.

It's the only time I have ever had it said to me and this was around 4 years ago.

"I used to work security for a university student union/ bar while I was in uni myself. 

It was a slowish night, and I was sitting at the receptions desk with one of my co-workers, when someone approaches the desk and hands over a purse they found. 

Looked inside and sure enough there is a student ID with the girls photo. Cool. There was pretty much nothing to do at the desk, and the paper work for finding the lost bank cards that were in the purse would have been a pain, so I thought I would look around for her. 

Sure enough, she’s standing with 2 of her friends in the corner of one of the rooms. 

I approach her and say something to the effect of “Hey, are you [First Name]?”

I get a sidelong look and, while maintaining most of her back to me, she just sort of shouts at me, way way louder than the noise level of the area really needed, “I HAVE A BOYFRIEND” 

“Okay, but are you [First Name - Second Name]?” 

“I HAVE A BOYFRIEND! FUCK OFF” 

“Okay, but I have the purse of [First Name - Second Name] and she looks like you. Is that you?” 

Apparently she didn’t hear me and her friends seemed not to twig that I’m in the security uniform, but instead of a reply, I got the finger. 

Cool. 

I removed her student card from the purse and gave it to one of our bartenders for the wall. If your student card is on the wall, you’re cut off and you have to answer to the unions academic conduct board to get it back. This process is meant to be for those we kick out for being drunk and disorderly, but, you know, fuck her. 

Went upstairs, filed the paper work for (Lost - Possible fraud), which means she needed to go the police to get her bank cards back. 

Cause, you know, fuck her.

It was so damn pointless and presumptive on her end."
"She didn’t literally say “I have a boyfriend” but here’s my story. 

I was at a busy bar and I was trying to get a drink. However the bar was so packed that I couldn’t even get up to it to order. These two girls were standing by the bar just hanging out so I tapped one on the shoulder, I said “excuse me” as in, please move out of the way so the rest of us can order. And she turns, looks at me, and says “no thanks” And turns back around. I decided to roast her so was pretty mean. I tapped her shoulder again and said “I wasn’t trying to hit on you, you’re in the fucking way! Move!” Kind of a dick head way to act on my part but I can’t stand arrogance in people and that really ticked me off. "

"Both men and women can get the fuck over the notion that a romantic partner is a prize to be won or a potential partner being an adversary to ""win over"" or ""wear down"". 

Additionally, stop focusing on the grand gesture. The occasional grand gesture can be romantic and endearing in real life, but it should be reinforcing an existing strong bond. It isn't actually a good way to solve a major issue in the relationship or to ""win over"" a previously uninterested partner. That's just begging for trouble once the endorphins run down. "

"The only time this happened to me, it went very poorly.

I was in college, and I was working full time and in school full time. I had little time to party and my love life was not going so well. Plus I lived in a shithole city where I recently was almost carjacked, twice. 

So there I am. I’m stressed, tired, overworked, underpaid, sleep and sex deprived and just generally irritable and in no mood to suffer anyone’s bullshit. 

I’m sat in class one day, early as usual because of work, and I’m watching the other students fill up the seats. In walks this smokin hot basic blonde replete with to-go coffee, leggings, ugg boots, the whole starter kit. She takes one of the few seats left which happens to be right next to me. 

Now, at the time I was frazzled for sure, but I still showered every day, wore clean clothes, and had a trimmed beard and very short, combed hair. The point is, I wasn’t some neckbeard nor was I the smelly greasy guy in class. I was just a guy. 

So like I say, I’ve been there for a minute and was working on our take-home quiz. I had missed a day earlier in the week and I couldn’t find one of the answers so I figure it must have been from lecture, yeah? ‘Course. 

I leaned over toward basic bitch *very* slightly so I can quietly ask, “Hey, were you here on Tuesday?”  
She recoiled as though I had whispered in her goddamn ear, gave me this super bitchy annoyed look, and said, “Yes.”  

“Cool, look,” I said. “I can’t find anything on number 8, was it covered in lecture?”  

She looked at me dumbly for a sec. I was holding my quiz and pointing to number 8.  

“I have a boyfriend!” she said. Just like, blurt! out of fuckin nowhere. 

I blinked at her a couple times, totally nonplussed. 

“What the fuck does that have to do with anything?” I said, in the same conspiring hush I had used a moment before. 

She pulls the blankest expression I’ve ever seen. Seriously it was like looking at a potato. 

Stupidly, she just said, “No.” 

WTF. That’s when I decided this chick might literally be retarded. I’m sure I was looking at her like she’s the dumbest fucking person *on Earth.*

I turned to the person on my other side, some Hispanic ratchet chick in scrubs, probably in my same overworked with too much school situation, and she filled me in about number 8 from her notes, and cribbed some answers from my quiz.

Me and Emily or Ashland or whatever the fuck her name *of course* was spent the rest of the class thornily ignoring each other. 

Seriously, “I have a boyfriend!” like I give a fuck. She could’ve had AIDS for all I care; I just wanted the info about the quiz. "
"That I want him to lose weight and go back to how he looked last year. I still love him abd I still find him sexy and attractive but sometimes his weight can just be a real turn off. He also has a chronic case of plumbers crack and won't wear his boxers higher to prevent it. He has a hairy bum too. I wish he'd make an effort to look more put together. 

Edit: I didn't expect this to blow up. To clarify, we're engaged and his weight and buttcrack aren't really a problem. His weight will fluctuate all our lives, I just like when he's a bit smaller than he is now. His plumbers crack is mostly just a running joke because of how bad it is but its still kinda gross and I wish it wasn't a thing. Its just something that's there.

Sometimes she'll come snuggle with me to try and deal with it in comfort in which case I just tell a random short story about my life or about something completely made up which seems to help and she likes it.

No one person is the same so you'll have to see what helps in your case or not. Although I would think one of the keys is that when they are feeling anxious, don't go to them, let them come to you.

He treated both of his kids equally with love, intelligence and respect, no matter their sex. He taught them morals and how to treat other people, even if they're different or an outcast. He treated the help with the same respect he treated the powerful people in town and expected his kids to do the same.

"Maybe I can offer some insight, because half of the replies in this thread are similar to this one.

I think there's two main reasons women appear to be disinterested in sex (either by playing dead starfish or by not communicating what they want). One is lack of interest/arousal and the other is fear of overt sexuality. The remedy for lack of interest is generally more foreplay. The remedy for the other is more complex, but usually involves encouragement of some sort.

Maybe you're wondering why are so many women afraid of overt sexuality? It's because society has taught young women that being an openly sexual being is something to be ashamed of - it makes them a slut/whore/etc. Women are also taught that men don't want to be with a slut. Thus leading to a huge conundrum, as women become sexual beings who don't want to be too ""open"" sexually because it will make them undesirable/bad/dirty/etc.

So women then become confused how to merge the two parts of themselves - the one part who wants sex and the one part who doesn't want to be a slut.

One solution is to sleep with many partners, but play dead starfish. This allows a woman to ""save"" a part of their sexuality. By being passive partners in sex, women feel less slutty. This behavior allows them to still feel desirable and wanted. A bit twisted, I know, but that's how psychological coping is many times.

Another solution is to have one partner with which they have monogamous sex, but they still don't communicate what they want. Although they aren't being ""a slut"" in the general sense, they also don't want to be ""slutty"" by asking for what they want.

There are many strange combinations women make in order to be sexual beings but also not too sexual as to compromise their self-identity and self-worth.

My advice to men who think you have a sexually suppressed partner.

* During foreplay/sex ask her if she likes what you're doing. If she's too shy to say it, ask her to nod or shake her head, or give some other type of feedback.
* Give her some feedback, either before or after sex. Something like ""you're such a sexy woman when you do ______ "" or ""I love how you're vocal when _______ , I wish you would bring that to the bedroom"".
* Tell her exactly what you want her to do to you. (No need to be pushy, just say what you want. If she isn't comfortable doing it one day she might change her mind later). If she is suppressing her sexuality to be more desirable to you as a partner, it's your job to tell her what to do instead to be more desirable to you.
* Compliment her and make her feel desirable after you have sex. This creates a positive association between having sex and desirability. Women already feel desirable when men initiate sex, but sometimes the act of having sex makes them feel less desirable afterwards.
* Be understanding. Women peak much later than men. It often takes them years to figure out what they like in bed. You can really change a woman's quality of life by becoming the man who wakes her up sexually. But in order to do this you need to have patience and understanding. You need to make her feel comfortable with you by allowing her to express herself (or often times encouraging her because she is too shy)."

"I was playing pool in a crowded bar and needed a girl to move in order for me take a shot. She was leaning up against the table talking to a group of guys so I walked over and gently nudged her

Me: ""excuse me...""

Her: ""Don't touch me! I have a BOYFRIEND!""

Me: ""1. I fucking doubt it and 2. Get off the damn pool table so I can take my shot!""

Now normally I'm a pretty easy going guy, but there  something about the way she responded that really pissed me off. And it's not that I thought she was ugly or anything, I just wanted to say something mean. Anyways, the guys started cracking up and she got even more pissed and left, which lead me to believe that I was right about her being single...

"Yeah. Sometimes.

I remember my ex fiance ordered something, when the bill came she said ""oh my fiancee has it."" And began munching down.

Now she'd invited me and it was her turn to pay, I had forgotten my wallet in the car, not intentionally.

So I left her there. We never made it to marriage. Fuck that.

The major thing here is, there's a certain type of woman out there, and it's not a small percentage, that sees their boyfriend as an extension of support, monetary, social, physical, and not as an actual person. Avoid them at all costs. The first sign this could happen means ditch, get the fuck out. 

Take it from me, change your vetting and you'll be so much better off."
"I met an old friend of mine that I hadn’t seen for awhile at a party and she posted a picture of us on her Facebook and tagged me in it. All I commented was “it was nice seeing you again.” Next morning I wake up to about 10 instant messages from some guy saying something along the lines of “I’m going to make you regret your life decisions”  he called me a home wrecker (they aren’t married and they had no children) so I don’t know what home I was wrecking. He said if I ever see him out in public I better run. He asked for my address. He also said if I go near his girlfriend again he would fuck my mom. I ignore it and go on about my day.

Few hours later another barrage of messages saying the same thing in different words. The only difference was this time he asked if I had a sister and if I did where does she live so he can go fuck her right now. She was 15 at the time and that was the final straw for me. I found out where he works from his girlfriend and went there and as soon as I walked in he ran to the back and locked himself in their little office. Such a pussy in real life. A week later he sent me a message saying “sorry bro” and then blocked me on facebook. "

"I had something similar happen several years ago at a coffeeshop/diner. I was getting lunch and had just received my order but there was no ketchup at my table and the waitress hadn't brought any. I was going to try to get the waitress's attention when I saw that a couple of girls sitting at the table next to me had a bottle. I lean over and say something like ""Excuse me/pardon me."" 

One of them immediately responds ""I have a boyfriend.""  

It took me a moment to understand why she said that, and when it hit me I think my jaw hung open for a bit. I managed to say ""How wonderful for him, but can I borrow your ketchup?"" 

I think she was at least somewhat self-aware because I think she flushed a bit in embarrassment, but her friend handed me the bottle and they left soon after. "
"Most likely they have zero self-esteem is because of their past experiences that reinforce the idea that they're ugly. The best way to counter this is to create new experiences with them that reinforce the idea that they're attractive. The more powerful the experience, the better. That's why actions are generally more powerful than words.

"Busy college bar, loud, press of people...  I've experienced that same situation word for word a dozen times.  The best is when you know people around the girl who know that you're just trying to get a drink (bartender, barback, regulars, etc) and they all start laughing loudly.  

I am a polite person.  I'll wait my turn and I'll rarely make a fuss, I don't care if someone cuts in line most times, but if you want to be a shitcunting bloodfart, then fine, I'll break my own back to stoop to your level.  Let's fuckin *RAGE*. 

Another great ""I have a boyfriend"" moment was when I was working at a gas station and a girl was on the phone in line.  She just stood there, people behind her, oblivious, until I finally learned forward and said ""excuse me miss"".  Except she cut me off; apparently the lean forward creeped her out and she says, loudly, ""**Ew you fucking creep I have a boyfriend!!**"" 

I was actually stunned, I didn't know what to say, but my coworker happens to be walking by and says something to the effect of ""Sheeeit, if you have a boyfriend there's hope for us all!"" In his mocking, not-at-all-condescending-but-SUPER-condescending southern drawl.  I motioned for her to step up and said ""would you like to complete your transaction now?""  

And she did and she left.  And she kinda tried to slam the door on the way out but it was one of those doors with the close-assist that really is designed so it *won't* slam so she was pulling it hard behind her and it threw her off balance.  She dumped her drink and purse into the parking lot, and the customer who stepped up to my counter shouts, ""HEY!  MAYBE YOUR BOYFRIEND CAN HELP CLEAN THAT UP!"""
"Besides the assssination of president Kennedy being far more than just one lone wolf, which has already been mentioned, I also believe his brother, Robert Kennedy, was the victim of a conspiracy against him.

"Worked at a coffee shop and took a quick break on the patio for a smoke. Only myself and this girl who is kind of a regular we’re out there. As soon as I walk out she puts her phone to her ear. I’d been there for hours and was tired. Asked to borrow her lighter as mine had disappeared. She sighs and says to the phone hold on babe. This guy won’t stop bothering me. She hands me the lighter. I use it, motion an apology and pull out my phone to read something. She says what were you saying honey and before she could finish the sentence, her phone starts ringing very loudly. I look at her, she turns red and starts staring at her phone until I finish my smoke and go back in. I never saw her again. Was even funnier because the staff saw it and the girl I was dating was working there too. "

**I'm actually shocked at the number of commenters here who've breezed past this, uh, rather important point.** OP probably doesn't realize it, but there's are now four women out there who've become convinced that their mothers/aunts/grandmothers/jaded girlfriends were maybe right all along, that men are only interested in sex, and will dispose of them once they've gotten it. (Because that's pretty much exactly what OP did, if Woman #4's experience is representative.) Do you want a dating pool full of bitter women who think men only want them for sex? Because that's how you get a dating pool full of bitter women who think men only want them for sex. 

When you aren't upfront and honest with people about what you're looking for (e.g., FWB, something serious, something casual), most people -- whether male or female -- are going to assume that sex implies at least some degree of seriousness in a relationship. Even if that isn't the case, they have a reasonable expectation that you're not going to ... you know ... treat them like shit. This woman came over for movie night, which is a common *date*, but was basically ejected from OP's apartment once they'd finished having sex. 

&gt;I guess she got the message, and started getting dressed. I was going to walk her back to her apartment, but she simply said, ""I can walk myself back"" and stormed out. 

Christ. OP, can you see how, from her perspective, she comes over to your apartment for what is essentially date night, and once you got your rocks off, it was ""Bye-bye, and don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out?"" 

And that you basically waited to stage what she might reasonably see as a break-up until *after* you'd slept together?

&gt;I can't lie and say I wasn't relieved that she left, and I'm pretty sure she won't want anything more to do with me, which I'm not upset about. 

**OP, you probably should be upset about it, *because it kind of makes you an asshole*.** Your first concern here should not be the possibility of feeling hurt that someone you've treated like crap might not want anything to do with you afterwards. Let's dump the male/female angle for a moment, and the gender-neutral assessment of what you're doing is this: You are temporarily assigning value to another human being on the basis of that person's meeting one of your desires. Once that desire is met, the person has no more value to you. And because this point apparently needs to be made, you would probably be upset if someone else did something similar and you were the victim!

**The issue isn't the sex.** The issue is that you aren't being honest with other people about what you want and you've shrugged off the moral implications of treating them as if they're disposable.

The advice given above is sound. Delay sex until after you've gotten to know someone, and let it develop from a relationship rather than being the only reason for that relationship. Or, if the only thing you're looking for is NSA sex, be honest about that at the very beginning.

"She koalas onto me at night and talks about me in her sleep.  She talks about me to other people like im a super hero or something.  I feel like a super hero with her.  One of the first dates we went on she had a guy she went to high school with sit down next to her and tell her how hot he thought she was and how he was too nervous to talk to her back then and blah blah blah.  She turned over to me and introduced me as her boyfriend and then proceeded to brag about me to this guy for like 20 minutes.

"Dating is very very American. Although it's starting to be a thing here in France because of Tinder. Because you know that you want something romantic/sexually with the person you're meeting with. But it's still very rare. 
Before that, you just meet people, you click become friends, get some drinks together with a bunch of other friends. Lots of gossip happens here when you go out with friends because most of the time everybody knows who's into who. And then getting some drinks becomes going to parties (not American movies' parties just bunch of friends in an apartment drinking and talking about whatever comes up). Usually, the group gets divided during the night, some people will stay in the living room, we have what we call here the ""counter-party"" that happens in the kitchen, then hallways, bedrooms... and you get to be close to whoever you're into and kisses happens (or more). And then everybody talks about it the day after, and you tell those who were in the living room what happened in the kitchen bla-bla-bla. And then, you talk about ""what happened last night"" with the other person and if you kiss again during day time tadaaa you're in a relationship! "

Naturally, he stopped, and reached under the mower to clear the grass, without cutting the zip tie. The cleared the mower of the grass and the tips of his fingers.

"I went back to full time study at 50. I had dropped out of college when I was 21 because I was a terrible student. Everything was done the night before it was due because I was so distracted with more interesting things.

When I went back to school, all nighters were not an option, in fact, more than two or three hours was not only more than my brain could handle without the words swimming on the pages, I rarely had a lump of time to work that big.

So I had to learn this thing called time management. Some of you may have heard of it.

I hadn't.

When we had a break between classes, instead of heading to the pub or the Cafe, I went to the library. I soon discovered that the library was more like a 3d dating app than a place where I could get work done. So I found an empty conference room on the top floor which became my ""office""

As soon as we were given an assignment I started on it, working a little bit every day. This meant that I was able to email my tutor a rough draft a week before the assignment was due for guidance on how make it better. Which meant I actually did several drafts of the essay and learned how to make it better. I realized that what I had been turning in my previous time as a student was a ""first draft"" except I never got past the first draft stage and my writing never improved.

I wouldn't have had the maturity to follow this advice the first time I was a student, that took another 30 years to trickle down, but hopefully you will. "

"Broke up with her a while ago, but saw her for several years.

I'd do a lot of the little housekeeping stuff because I would not think twice about spending the 10-15 minutes to collect the dishes from around the house, wash them, and put them away... while in her case each step might consume an entire day's worth of motivation and staring at chores accumulating would become gradually more and more overwhelming until she'd just hide in bed to not have to deal with it.

I'd caution about whether this is actually helpful, though. It became apparent that she'd rapidly develop a dependency on having me/someone facilitate her life by just kind of taking care of stuff without her having to think about it... led to a weird power dynamic that I wasn't interested in developing outside of a more stable relationship than the one we had."

At 9am she writes ""thanks, lol"" and I'm just about ready to bury myself, and spend the day attempting to do so with junk food and shame.

You don't pump a lactating cow udder, You squeeze in a downwards motion. 

But your metaphore still stands because that's also not how you handle a penis. I'd been sexually active for SEVEN YEARS when my current partner , on our 5th date took my hand gently and moved it away from his penis and said softly ""are you milking my penis like an udder? That's not how a penis works""

In an attempt to understand where I went wrong and how to fix it, I sourced my mistake on 4 past experiences:

1) When I was learning to milk our pet sheep as a child my gramdmother and mum joked that I would make a man happy one day because I had good milking hands.  
2) I understood the penis to basically be a giant clitoris, and to treat them the same, I'm a fucking weirdo who likes a ""milking"" pressure and motion on my own genitals. Weirdly though, My ex-girlfriends had no complaints that they voiced.  
3) The phrase ""Milking his prostate"" still confuses me  
4) I'm so goddam uncoordinated, My patient partner has been trying to teach me how to jack him off for 2 years, I still can't get it right, I'm either squeezing too hard, jacking too fast, applying pressure in the wrong spot....thank fuck i'm good at sucking dick. apparently I do the right thing with my hand when i'm using it in combination with my mouth, I just suck at handjobs...

Me: ""Lucky dude. Anyway, nice chatting with you, have a good night.""

In everyday conversation if I'm being generally friendly and chatty, they're usually quick with an anecdote where they did something with their boyfriend, even if it isn't remotely what we're talking about. I suppose it's their ""preemptive defense through offense"" strategy. It's usually like:

Anyone man can be a powerful role model for boys and young men to look up to an emulate, you just have to give enough of a damn to live your life that way. 

Philosophical, maybe. But I had a childhood where I saw clear as day the difference between the kind man I want to be (my dad/grandfather) and the kind of man I don't want to deal with anymore (my stepfather.) Lots of kids only see the bad side of that coin and don't have any other example to build  an idea of what it means to be a man around."
"From my dad who was married 5 times:

She uses complete words and punctuation when texting.
Exactly.  The man was a paragon of professional and personal integrity even while living his life under the most exacting microscope in the world.  He was a loving husband and a devoted father even while holding the most demanding job in the world.  He was the ideal of everything that a modern man should be.
"I knew at the time, but I had a whole bunch of issues that she couldn't help me with, especially not long distance. Breaking up was the right decision at the time, I just wish I'd met her in a few years time once I've actually got my shit a bit more together."
"Girl... as a fat fucking sack of ass myself, good on you for losing the weight. Don't let the loose skin bother you too much, it's way more important in your head than it is to most people. Of course there *will* be people out there turned off by it, the same way that there are people out there turned off by imperfect teeth or a second toe that's longer than the big toe.

But for most guys, it probably falls under ""neutral""/""Don't care""."
"Yes, I have. Let me try to put it this way: her whole family is kinda cold. (German) and because her dads profession they had to move a looot from one city to another so they dont show much affection towards anyone, they ALL have few friends. And because of that, shes kinda cold too, she doesnt show much affection, we are dating for almost 3 years now and not once she asked for a hug, said she missed me or asked for a kiss. Don't get me wrong, she does love me a lot, she say that she loves me frequenty but you know when you just laid down with someone, you both look into each other's eye and you feel home, you feel safe? That just aint there. When those moments happen I feel anxious. 

And theres the sex problem. Because she was my first, in the beginning i felt horrible, i came too fast and was anxious about it all the time. And she was too! We talked about it a lot, we tried to drink jist a little before sex, so we could be less shy, we try to do sex more often and thar all helped... me. Only me. Ive seen such an improvement from me, I no longer feel anxious, i no longer last for only 2 minutes. But shes just not there yet, shes still the same. She doesnt want to improve, she doesnt ""feel like"" having oral sex or trying new positions, shes happy with our average sex but Im not."
I am currently with her and this thread made realize I should never take that for granted.

"I genuinely wonder how many romcoms are written by women, as this is a pretty glaring trope in just about all of them and in real life this would just make women uncomfortable. 

Movie: Girl says no? Better follow her and do romantic things for her until she decides that, yes, she actually wanted me the whole time. 

IRL: Girl says no? Better follow her around and... well now I’m a creepy weirdo who can’t take a hint and has a restraining order against him.

"Back when we got started my GF couldn’t get me to finish thru oral, but she became determined so she tried different techniques until she got the results she wanted haha.

"I will share my sports conspiracies...

* the NBA ""forced"" Jordan to retire because his gambling debts got his father killed and they couldn't bear the risk of their star playing being complicit in that. 

* every MLB player since the late 80s has more or less been on steroids at some point. The MLB allowed it to happen to boost the popularity of the game again after the strike. They've then selectively decided who would get ""caught"" testing positive for anything. 

* applies for all sports but I believe gambling and betting by referees to fix the outcome of games is more common and easy to get away with than we realize.

"I had zero idea, so I googled the words ""Italy Korea game.""  In 2002 the World Cup was held in S. Korea and Japan (shared).  Italy was playing S. Korea in one game; the game was in S. Korea.  This ref, Byron Moreno, called offside on a goal by Italy, negating the goal (but there was no offside, apparently).  Then later he called a second yellow-card on an Italian player and the player was ejected from the game (the player did not dive but was pushed, apparently).  S. Korea eventually won, and many people claimed it was because they were hosts of the World Cup.

Unrelated:  this same ref was arrested 8 years later at JFK airport in New York for trying to smuggle 13 lbs of heroin, hidden in his underwear."

What is your wife saying/doing about this?
"I have dated in England, America and in India. To put it in simple words, In America, it’s like “she’s my friend. I can’t date her and ruin the friendship”. In India, it’s like “we’re not even friends, how can we just date?”"
"That's it for me. If a girl has a sense of humour and enjoy being goofy without judging others for being a bit immature or awkward sometimes, then it's great for me already. "

"I didn’t exactly “let her go” but I was an idiot and ruined my chance to have her. I met a girl while volunteering in NYC. She was from Jersey and I was from upstate ny. Not sure why but we clicked instantly and the two days we were there we were with eachother the whole time. We got to know eachother we were laughing with eachother it was amazing. 

Just before I had to leave I told her I liked her and it was pretty clear she felt the same way. At that time I was nervous as hell because I’d never had something like that happen before so after I said that I left and I never got her number or any contact info. I couldn’t find her on social media either. 

A year later she popped into my head and I thought fuck it let’s see if I can find her. Sure enough I did. We’ve been great friends ever since but she isn’t attracted to me anymore and I now live 1000 miles away from her in Texas. I appreciate the friendship we have but I never can stop thinking about what could have been had I not been so scared and nervous that day. "

"I kind of did. I was at a business networking event at a conference and spotted a friend of mine while she was talking to a girl I didn't know. When I walked up, the girl my friend was talking to saw me, rolled her eyes and in a somewhat exasperated tone said, ""Listen, I have a boyfriend, alright.""

My friend saw the confusion on my face, looked at her and said, ""That's not one of those guys."" Turns out the girl had been hassled several times at the conference, including earlier at the networking event by a group of three guys, one of whom, if you squint, looked a little like me. She apologized profusely and was clearly embarrassed. Sometimes it's tough being a woman in a male dominated industry I guess.

Bonus points, I pulled the opposite line on a girl once. This girl was totally going out of her way to talk to me at a party, kept seeking me out and tried to corner me a few times to make small talk. Finally, I told her I had a girlfriend (which was true), and it turns out she wasn't hitting on me, she wanted me to come to her stupid MLM meeting."

"President Kennedy was constantly rebuffing his own military staff, which viewed him as ""soft on communism"". He wasn't, though. He was a staunch anti-communist, but he wasn't in favor of risking World War III, like some of his generals would have him do. If he had listened to his military staff, he would have send in American troops to Cuba after a CIA plot to thwart Castro with an invasion in the Bay of Pigs went wrong. He would have confronted Soviet Russia over the Cuban missile crisis, risking nuclear war, instead of resolving it through diplomatic means with Soviet leader Kruchev. He would have expanded the war in Vietnam and send tens of thousands more soldiers in there.   

The fact that he didn't and that he rebuffed his hawkish military staff at all turns made him a hated figure within the Pentagon and within the 'deep state'. President Kennedy's last internal White House memo was about starting to *withdraw* American troops from Vietnam. He wanted to have all troops out by the end of 1965. He was talking about ending the Cold War altogether; he wanted to negotiate directly with Kruchev to bring an end to hostilities, having seen with the Cuban missile crisis how close the world had come to the brink of nuclear war.    

His decisions would have costed the military-industrial complex (against which outgoing president Eisenhower, a general in WWII, had warned the country in his farewell speech) tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars. Immediately after president Kennedy's assassination, his successor Johnson wrote an internal memo regarding Vietnam that contradicted everything that president Kennedy had written. And it was Johnson who escalated the war in Vietnam by lying to Congress about the so-called 'Gulf of Tonkin' incident, alledging that North-Vietnamese ships had attacked the US navy, which was completely untrue. Tens of thousands of extra troops were send to Vietnam and it turned into a debacle.   

I have always thought it wasn't a coincidence that mere months after president Kennedy's assassination, Soviet leader Kruchev was deposed of as well. He was the only leader who didn't rule until his death during the existence of the Soviet Union. Kruchev was a reformer as well, exposing the crimes of his predecessor Stalin, which shocked the Soviet establishment. Those two leaders had to go because they were standing in the way of keeping the war machine going."

"Another thing that I feel should be implicit, but I’d rather someone just say it is to be willing and able to back off.

I was the first guy my last girlfriend had dated since she left her abusive boyfriend. She was a very sexually open person, but struggled to committing to having sex in general because the flashbacks were too much for her. She was caught in a weird place where she wanted to participate, but couldn’t get past the psychology. It took a lot of patience, but we finally got to a place where we could be intimate with the use of safe words. She only had to use it once, and I stopped immediately, and I think that gave her loads of confidence that she could actually enjoy herself. 

I won’t say it was always perfect, or that I helped fix her, or anything like that, but being a guy who’s always had more female friends, I know there are tons of girls in her same situation that would have been called teases, bitches, prudes, etc, because she does *want* sex but has so much built up baggage to work through. 

Hopefully now, she’s continuing her journey in a healthy way with a good person or people that will treat her well. but without someone she could trust and just being willing to empathize a bit, she may be still right where she was when she left that previous asshole. As in all things, you can be the person to change someone’s life for the better, or at least help put them on that path. Sex is no different. Be excellent to each other."
"It's kind of a nebulous answer so I'll do the best I can.

You should feel safe and secure.  You should feel like you can tell your partner anything and vice versa.  You shouldn't be afraid of talking or communication.  You should feel comforted, like he or she has accepted you for who you are and is perfectly OK with that.  

I once told my wife (then girlfriend) that she was like sitting in front of the fireplace under a big warm blanket with a hot cup of cocoa while it's snowing and cold outside.  So I guess that's what it's like."

"Not just ""I have a boyfriend"", she full-on lost her shit, but it worked out for me in the end:

I was at a bar with a group of Marines from my unit. The area around the bar was packed, but most of the tables were empty so we pushed a couple of tables together. When I finished my beer I went up to the bar to get another, but I couldn't get through the crowd and couldn't get the bartender's attention over the throng. So I walk up and tap the closest person on the shoulder...

Be:me

Don't be PC(psycho chick)

Me: ""Excuse me...""

PC: ""WHAT THE *FUCK*! I'M *SO* TIRED OF THIS SHIT! I CAN'T EVER JUST HAVE A DRINK WITHOUT GETTING HIT ON BY SOME CREEP! LEAVE ME ALONE!!""

Me: ""ummmm...ok?""

Everyone at the bar fell silent and just stared. I raised my hands, took an exaggerated step backwards, and gestured with my empty bottle at the bartender. (Who was also staring)

 (to bartender) Me: ""Could I have another Yuengling?""

(to PC's friend) Me: ""If I ask you to let me in, are you gonna yell at me too?""

PC realized what had just happened after everyone at the bar cracked up. She turned bright red and looked like she wanted to crawl into a crack in the floor. After the bartender brought me my beer, I backed away slowly like I was afraid she might attack. She quietly finished her drink and left the bar without looking at me. On her way out, the friend came over and apologized

In the end though, she helped me get the bartender's attention, so it worked out well for me"
"Buddy I’m gonna tell you like I told one of my best friends who had the same issue. Stand up for yourself or walk out. The issue isn’t that she just won’t give good head. Its that she won’t make the effort. That’s crippling, and as big of flaw in a relationship as if she just refused to talk to you. “Suffering” isn’t something you deserve, no matter what you tell yourself how you feel about her. If I stopped making an effort I’d expect my GF to voice her concern, and then to do what she needed to do if I didn’t make any changes. Life is short, and it can be great. You owe yourself more than what you seem to be settling for. If she isn’t doing it because of lack of sexual compatibility, you both deserve more. If it’s that she just doesn’t seem to care, you certainly do."

I like a person, I confess. If they agree, then from day 1 we are in a relationship. That's it. All done.

I agree in some relationships, both parties may know each other, but I wouldn't say they fall in love gradually. In most cases here, people befriend each other *because* they are attracted. "

"Once, I was at a club, I was approaching a woman. Another woman who was along the way that I had blurred out in my mind because she was a ""hell naw"" looked up and said ""NOT INTERESTED!"" so I stopped, looked at her and said ""Damn right I am not, you couldn't pay me enough!!"" then kept walking."
"Ok first of all she's 25 and I'm 30 years old now, but kudos to the guy who correctly guessed that our 3 year anniversary wasn't too long ago.

So wifey and I grew up on the same street along with our siblings and group of other kids. Whenever the parents of the neighborhood had things planned, instead of hiring a professional sitter, we kids would just   go stay at one of the other family houses. That was how my wife and I knew each other growing up. Sometimes she'd be at my house, I'd be at hers when I was younger, or on not too rare occasions we'd be at another kid's house at the same time.

So I grew up a kinda awkward kid, I had friends but I wasn't attracting any sort of attention from girls, so I went through 3 years of HS with no experience with women whatsoever. 

So according to my wife, she was always crushing on to me when I shooed a dog away that was scaring her when she was 9ish or 10(?). Also I kinda looked like a character named Gordo from that Lizzie show.

So late Spring of '04 right before Summer break, I get a note from a girl sitting behind me on the bus folded in a neat triangle. My soon-to-be-wife, in her infinite wisdom decided that a 6th grader giving an 11th grader a love note would *totally* work in her favor. I turn to give her the stink eye, and she does that thing where a girl blinks repeatedly and it should look stupid but it looks cute?, yeah I blushed and she knew she had me.

She sealed the deal when her parents had her and her siblings stay at my family's house . She comes up to my room and *demands* a date. I scoff but she doesn't relent and promises I could a kiss afterwards. Well I had never been kissed by a girl before and I acted like I didn't care (I did).

Over the summer our meetings kept going, and I fell for her hard. I was awkward with showing my feelings but she didn't mind, she cared for me all the same. We obviously started dating in absolute secrecy, although in the beginning it was more because I didn't want to be made fun of in school for dating a middle schooler. It wasn't until senior year did I realize the more serious reasoning why guys like me didn't date middle schoolers especially with my 18th coming up. But to this day my wife and I are pretty proud for keeping our relationship so secret, although being 2004/2005 certainly helped, cellphones were rare so we mostly communicated by notes that we burned either at school or before we got home, no social media where we both could post about how madly in love we were with each other, our dates were movie nights at the next county so people didn't recognize us (in hindsight this was the riskiest move we ever pulled). 

I started college close to home so we could still be close with each other. Once she got a car, I got myself a dorm room so we could get more ""privacy"".  I took a gap year after junior year and worked for my dad (unrelated to my relationship with her)  I started grad school immediately after graduation in the same university just so I could be around when she started school there. We finally started dating openly some months after she became a freshman at the university. 

So our combined social circles believe we didn't start dating until we were both in the same university. The funny thing is that during our whole secret relationship, my parents though I was dating guys in college and her parents though she was prioritizing school over boys (she was quite the accomplished high school student). Her mother also voiced concern that we were moving too fast"" when I asked her to marry me after only a couple years of relationship in her eyes. Although now she's happy since there's a baby on the way now."

"It’s a delicate balance for women. Most of the stories here are times when the woman definitely jumped the gun, but if you let a conversation go on for too long and it turns out he *is* interested, you might be called a bitch. So your second example is a non sequitur but usually finding a way to subtly mention the boyfriend is the best strategy. 

Maybe people here will disagree with me but in your first example I can see how it could have come across as you hitting on her and I don’t think it’s weird that she said she had a boyfriend when turning down your invitation. "
"Bake 'em away, toys."
"That I think she has narcissistic personality disorder.

She changed so dramatically after we signed a lease and she says everything is fine.  She told me I'm imagining how affectionate she used to be and how much more romantic she once was.  I miss having sex the way we used to.  She changed so abruptly and it breaks my heart.  She blames me when I give her feedback.  She often tells me I am doing the thing I am giving her feedback about; or changes the subject to me.  She often will shut down in conflict.

She goes really hot and cold and sometimes withdraws for no apparent reason.  On the hot days she is so loving, we have sex, kiss, etc.  On the cold days I feel like I do not exist.  I may be in an abusive relationship.  I doubt my sanity a lot.  Is she doing this on purpose to control me?

It is a major mindfuck because maybe she just needs some space?  Maybe I am doing something wrong?  Maybe the honeymoon phase just ended?  She meets almost all the DSM criteria and I'm disturbed.

It's either that or this is just how she shows love.  She tells me she loves me and I believe her.  It's just the unpredictable behavior is hard to be unaffected by.   If she would communicate with me how she feels or what she is trying to do, that would help so much.  She convinced me to drop a lot of my friends.

I really love her and man she is so fun when she is.  She's the most creative and socially smart person I've ever met.  She is incredibly charismatic and popular.  I know the implications if she does have this disorder.  I didn't use to be this anxiety ridden person.  I don't think she's cheating on me.

"Research says there are three key factors in forming friendships. 

1. Proximity. You have to be close enough to the people to do stuff together.  

2. Spontaneous events. You have to be able to participate in repeated, and un-planned, events together.  

3. Settings that foster unguarded sharing between you. 

These factors are all met in settings where people commonly make their strongest friendships; school, college, or childhood neighborhoods. 

But, as you get older, these opportunities change. Singles become couples, colleagues become co-workers, and work replaces school. You don't have time for unplanned events, compete against each other or aren't equals in salary, and you're only regularly around either your coworkers or your partner. 

So, it's not easy. "

its more complex then that but it would take way to much typing to explain it with any justice.

Pretty much caveman instincts x the way you spend your time with the women x your feelings for your ex girlfriend."
"As soon as I make enough money to make you go away and so my child can still have a good life with both of us you are gone. 

You are a horrible black hole of a person and knowing you had made me worse of a person. "
That's..... That's.... I need a story *right now*
"Cooking - it doesn't take much to look like a master chef in the kitchen  

A clean car. Women don't give a shit about what you drive, but if you keep it clean, they will notice. This goes for anything really; bathrooms, bedrooms, your place in general.  

Pets, and your unfettered affection for those pets. 

A smart pair of shoes. "
"The most expensive teleport I've ever teleported was 0.8 miles.

Put a fence post through my leg. Remember bits and pieces. Ambulance coming. Woke up in the hospital. Couple months later get an itemized bill. $500 for ambulance _gas_. 0.8 miles.

Can't complain, though. Saved my life."
He's got a certain warm stoicness about him
"A guy taking Spanish tried to correct me on how to traditionally say my last name and the part that gets me was that his friends sided with him. HELLO, I THINK I KNOW HOW TO SAY MY OWN NAME! An example would be: ""no, no, it's goon-zal-uss, not gun-zal-ez"". Then his friend went, ""yeah, are you even Hispanic?"""

I don’t like when women have [these piercings](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/7d/2f/8b/7d2f8b98c11111c50e200ab1c1ea52b1.png)
Ugh this. Dated a woman for 3 years who was amazing in almost every facet of the term for my liking and every time I asked her what she was into she’d just say “I’m into you” or “I enjoy you” and I’m there struggling to understand what the fuck that means. 
If I could go back in time 3 years ago and swiped left on tinder I fucking would. I wish I never met you.  Don’t even want to be friends with you. 
Facebook is already coming under fire for providing directed ads based on audio cues heard from your phone.... so yeah.... fucked up.
How do you do the thing with the letters and the guy shrugging?
Bro you gotta up that self esteem. You’re fuckin worth more than that.
"Off topic but ... [nine times out of ten, when a sportscaster talks about a black athlete, they refer to him as ""a class act""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M78_HqBMZ4U)"
"...how the hell does that sound juvenile?  That's ""meet someone, realise you're interested in them, and over time manouevre so you get to be alone with them"".  How is that any more juvenile than seeing someone and asking them on a date because you think they're hot?  Frankly, I feel basing interest *purely* on physical attraction is far more childish."
Vast majority of athletes in various sports are all on PEDs.
"IIRC Pepsi wins in blind taste tests, but is far behind in sales.  Taste tests have flaws and don't always represent what drink/product a consumer actually prefers."
"He actually didn't take a pay cut, he declined a gross percentage of profits to make sure the effects department could do their work well. That's unarguably way more than just a pay cut because that means that he's continually not making money off of those movies."
"&gt; I don't have the time or the crayons to explain this to you

Just kidding. That's a shitty reddit insult that awkward teens think would make them look cool in real life but would just get them laughed at."
That must have been one hell of a journey! 
The movies aren't wrong though - these women want *the right guy* chasing them. Not your average Joe on the street. 
"my wife and I like to go camping.
