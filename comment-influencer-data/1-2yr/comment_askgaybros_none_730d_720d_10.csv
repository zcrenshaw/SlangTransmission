"Before I kissed another person, the idea of kissing was gross. Why do you want to mix saliva? What if they're sick? Have food particles in their mouth? What do you do with the spit? Swallow? Gross!!!

Then I did it. It felt good. Mixing spit happens, but you cease to care. It's intimate and sexy. It feels good. 

Before I sucked a cock, it seemed gross. What would it taste like? Precum seems gross. Do I have to swallow it or his cum? I'll just spit it out. That is where you pee. Should I make sure he washes off after peeing?

Then I did it. And it felt good to make him feel good. And it felt good to explore his shape and feel his fullness. And his precum became sexy and it didn't taste good but it tasted right and turned me on. And I felt good and satisfied when he moaned and bucked his hips. And feeling his warm cum and swallowing it knowing I did that and seeing his puppy dog thankful smile when he knows his man did that. 

Before I gave my bottom a rim job, it seemed gross. That is where you shit! It would smell. Gross!

Then I did it. And I heard him moan. And I saw it turn him into a horny man begging for me to fuck him. And I realized I associated it with anticipation of fucking and I'm at my hardest and most horny while rimming. And he goes nuts. And he cleans for me so it tastes like nothing. And now I see his sexy ass and crave it. And I know a few minutes of my tongue back there is rewarded often with my cock cumming deep in him.

The answer to why is because it's sexy. For you, for him. Just like kissing and blow jobs it's intimate and it's sexy. If you're going all the way, it is an incredible foreplay step to get everyone in the mood.  

Even if you're a top, let a man rim you once. It feels so good. A few minutes in, you might change your mind and ask for him to top you. It makes you want to bottom. 

If you're the top, it gets him so relaxed and ready for you. It makes getting you deep in him so much easier. It makes him want you in him more. 

If you're worried about taste, don't. Either it is clean or even soapy, or it's slightly musky and sweaty--both can be hot. Bottoms don't let their ass get licked if it isn't ready and clean. You're going to taste nothing or just some sweat. 

Sure, graduating from kissing to dick to ass takes a mental leap, but if you think it's gross now, know it's no more or less gross than sucking a dirty dick. If the ass is clean, it's a perfectly fine place to put a tongue. And you'll get hooked. 

Edit: fixed some words. "

"&gt; He’s asserted that I need to back off, and to recognize the role I’ve played in where he’s at. He’s outlined all the work he’s doing to get back to work while keeping a clear head and positive attitude through a discouraging several weeks of just a few responses and bad interviews.

Listen to your boyfriend.

Fuckin' hell, you're one controlling asshole of a boyfriend.  Stop pushing goals on him.  Stop trying to find him jobs.  Stop pressuring him.  Just stop.

Instead, support him.  Listen to him.  He really doesn't need your advice, but I bet he needs to unload some frustration and it'd be great if you could just be there for him and listen.  Tell him he's doing well and that you're proud of him.

And FFS, he gave up his job and was ready to move to a different country for you.  And you went and fucked it up (yes, I know its far more complicated than that).  Apologize.  Seriously, apologize for it.  I'm sure you can explain it away as not-really-your-fault, but just suck it up and apologize.

Take your type-A and shove it up yer ass; way up there.  Get out of this assuming-leadership role at home and make it a true partnership.

Maybe somewhere down deep inside he wants to get out of town and start fresh - seriously think about it.  And think about maybe letting him take the lead and moving and following him and his career.

Finally: much love from another type-A bastard who's fucked up relationships over stupid shit.

"Okay, I’m confused by one thing - Not sure if it’s a culture difference or not but in the UK, boys have sleep overs with other boys all the time and it’s not gay :/ 

Also, is cuddling really gay? I mean yeah, it’s pretty odd to sleep on another guys chest but it’s so completely innocent. "

"When he comes to grab your phone, hold your hand out in front of him and yell ""SWIPER NO SWIPING!"" That will stop him for sure."
"Totally fine. HOWEVER, beware that you don't fall into this pattern: I've noticed that a lot of older (30+) gay guys who exclusively date 18-21ish guys, mentally retain an 18-21 maturity level themselves. They date and hang with young guys not just because they're attracted to them, but because they keep themselves on the same level mentally...the types of jobs they have, drama they participate in, partying all the time, living at home or in shitty college style apartments, etc. In the long run it bites them in the ass because young guys into older guys aren't looking for an older version of themselves...they're attracted to maturity and stability. "
"You have a couple options here:

1.  Talk to your friend about your concerns while remaining polite about the girl you haven't met yet.

2.  Say nothing, see how it goes, and only deal with her views if she starts spouting those rubbish opinions. 

How she feels (however uniformed and ass-backwards) is her business. If you go in swinging before she talks about it, she'll feel validated and just in her misguided views on ""the gays.""

Be polite. Be civil. And be prepared to calmly shoot down anything negative she has to say. If you're the calm friend and she becomes the raging bitch, all the better for you."

"I would be mortified and extremely angry if I found out my parents had secret access to my private conversations at 13. It's normal for people that age to date but not have sex, I wouldn't worry too much about it if the guy he is seeing is the same age. But still every parent should be able to have the frank conversation about sex when they start puberty "

"You're 15. While this is obviously a breach of trust on his behalf, you're 15.

Outside of locking your phone and apps, which he'll obviously have a problem with since you're 15, talk to him about how his lack of trust in you will only cause you to resent him and damage your relationship. That if he believes he raised you right, he'll respect some bit of your autonomy and personal space."

"I personally hate fingers past the first knuckle. I find them to be uncomfortable to painful. Using fingers on the outside and just opening my hole with the tip of a finger is fine, but too many guys like to shove their fingers all the way in, which is worse for me than no preparation. "
"Maybe it is a cultural difference then. Where I live, by the time a boy is 15, it would be considered very weird if his parents were looking through his phone (it would be a little weird to have done it at any age). Especially if it is openly, you are destroying his sense of privacy, and what you risk doing is making him respond by becoming secretive. That destroys your trust, and when parents and kids don't have trust, well, that is the worst possibility..."

"A lot would depend on your respective ages.  He could be gay and in denial, not having sorted it out yet.  He could be bi, and wanting to explore.  Or he could just be straight and drunk.  

When I was a youngster in the military I saw a lot of completely straight men hit on the gay guys.  When your young and your hormones are hopping, and you are intoxicated--- pretty is pretty, what ever the gender.  It doesn't make him gay.  It just means he want to crack a nut."

normal. average. often repeated.
A lot of gay men haven't gotten to start dating or being sexually active until their early 20's. They aren't ready to settle down yet. Also maybe they just don't want kids ever. 
"I travel quite a bit (Asia in January, Paris in July, DC in October) but I save a lot of money and usually stay in hostels.

The answer is, a lot of these guys usually A.) Are wealthy B.) Have a sugar daddy C.) Are escorts/models who get paid for having sex or being pretty D.) Are up to their eyeballs in debt

We also have to remember that these people probably represent maybe 5% of the overall LGBT population. Go on Grindr and see how many average guys there are. The super hot/ripped/globetrotter gay is not common. Most gays are pudgy, average, middle class people with boring lives."

"Well, it began when I decided to come out to my friends. They are a bunch of anime nerds, gamers and no-lifes, so they were naturally tolerant to different sexual orientations. Hiding the truth from them would be a strictly paranoid move.

It's not like I wanted to start dating or God knows what, I just wanted them to stop, for example, sending me posts from 9gag filled with woman asses, so ""I can enjoy like every other men""...

They all reacted well (some even **too** well, ehh) and it boosted my confidence so much that I decided to come out to the person I did not intend to before. It wasn't a friend from my ""pack"", he wasn't a tolerant, yaoi obsessed nerd. He was a highly unpredictable guy for me, and a very dangerous one, I would say. He used to be my bully when we were kids and I used to be scared of him shitless. He was a jock, older than me, very masculine, ""straight acting"", with car, real job and army of acquaintances... well, just overwhelming to me in general.

Well, I told him, and I could already tell that his reaction couldn't be considered as ""good"". We were supposed to watch a movie, and I was supposed to tell him that AFTER the movie, but I was so pumped and nervous that I did it before it... Instant regret. He was a shadow of himself. It felt so horrible to sit next to him and think of how much he has to hate me right know... After that day, I was 100% sure we're not friends anymore, lol.

Week later my girl-friend (don't confuse with girlfriend) forced me to go to a party, because I promised. She's just as socially awkward as I am, but she keeps trying to not be. We went there, she quickly abandoned me for her girlies and I was standing there alone, between all those strangers like ""oh my god, act naturally"". I was standing next to a wall and doing nothing, really, for longest ten minutes of my life. Then ""the horror"" started. I've noticed my friend there. THE friend. He was sitting on the couch, looking very grim and drunk. I felt like I can't approach him anymore... but then he noticed me too and waved on me to join him.

He was himself again, but very grim one, because he didn't get the promotion in his job (which he got year later). When people at party went from drinking to sleeping or having sex on the next floor, we began watching movie. Then he made a very surprising move on me... and it all started. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Years later he explained that this night when I came out to him, he was already making plans if and how to get to my pants. Looks like I misunderstood his pondering with hostile quietness...

&gt;how old were you when you met them!

Something aroud 6 or 8 years old, but I really don't remember.

I was 18 the year I came out to him. (He was 24 at the moment.)"

"*This story has a funny little twist at the end...I'd say my bf and I have a pretty unique first date story*

I'm 23 and I met my bf six months ago. A friend of a friend said she worked with a really cute guy and wanted to set us up, but I repeatedly brushed her off. In the past, whenever a girl said she wanted to set me up with her gay friend, it was with some random guy I wasn't attracted to at all. Girls always think that the two gay people they happen to know will be sexually, physically and emotionally compatible just because they're both men.

Anyway, one time I was with the friend-of-a-friend, and she showed me his picture again. I realized that I had already matched with him on Tinder AND Bumble, and we had talked a bit. I got really excited because he was super cute, so I messaged him and asked him on a date.

He said he would get out of work around eight, and I get out at six, so I offered to meet him in the park across from his office. I planned our entire first date around his work so it would be convenient for him. We went to a rooftop bar and had a few drinks, and then we had a nice dinner at a romantic Italian place. A straight middle-aged couple at a nearby table even sent us shots of Limoncello because they thought we looked cute! How amazing is that? It definitely felt like a good sign.

I walked him to the subway (he lives in Brooklyn) and I thought we were going to kiss, but we didn't. I think we were both scared. But on the second date we went to an underground champagne bar and I walked him to his friend's birthday dinner and he kissed me right before he went inside. I walked all the way home grinning like a little boy. And after that, the rest is history.

But the only 'off' thing during our first date was that he barely ate any of his food. I assumed that he didn't like it or something. The next day, I followed up and said that I had a great time, and I asked how work was that day. He asked how it was for me, and I went on and on about random irrelevant work shit, and then he said, ""Oh nice. Well, I actually didn't go to work today"" and he sent me a picture of him on a stretcher. He eventually told me that he had a seizure a few hours after our date! (Don't worry, he's totally fine now).

Four months later he admitted that he had been feeling sick that entire day. So sick, in fact, that he had actually skipped work and had been debating skipping our date. He ended up going on our date because he was scared that if he cancelled the day-of, he'd piss me off and lose his chance to meet me (how FREAKING sweet is that?!). 

The best part of this revelation was that he had skipped work that day. Think about it: he had been home in Brooklyn all day, and then put on work clothes, come to Manhattan, and pretended to walk out of his office building at eight o'clock, all because I thought I was being romantic by trying to make the date convenient for him. Hah!"

"If there is any sexual tension, it's from your perspective. Straight guys **really** like to tease and flirt just for attention. They can't do that with girls because they either flip out or treat it too seriously. They see gay guys as non-threat in that matter so they play and seduce us, just for fun. I assure you they would went crazy if you would cross the line and try to touch them too low. Well, unless they are actually bisexual/gay.

Use it for your advantage, just like they do. It's always fun to rub oil in sexy jock's shoulders. (-◞◦)"

"It's almost never the people you want flirting with you. 

 I once had a probably 65 year old man (I was 23 at the time) with a cane who would meet me at the front door when I went in to open my store. He would pick up the newspapers and we would chat. He would buy a pack of cigarettes and that was about it.  After awhile coworkers told me someone had been calling looking for me and I started to get several phone calls a shift at work and the other end would be silent.  Eventually I got a call and the caller said you're cute and asked if I liked boys. I was caught off guard and was just like excuse me and hung up thinking it was a crank call.  

He came into the store that afternoon and gave me a piece of paper with his number and apologized for calling. I was freaked out but just said thanks but I'm seeing someone. He insisted I should call him and left. Fortunately I ended up getting a promotion and getting moved to a different location like literally the next week. 

The worst part was he lived in low income housing across the street from the store. I'm not sure why he thought I was looking for a disabled 65 year old boyfriend at 23, but man was it awkward.

"When everyone else likes tits and vag except you, it can make you a deep thinker on how and why things are the way they are. "
"My favorite ones are ""FRIENDS ONLY"" but the only thing they have on their profile is a shirtless pic and their preferred position. "
"Women don't care as much, and men like lesbian scenes because they get hot action without anyone perceived as competition getting in the way."
Ummm Grindr is the wrong place for you. 
"&gt;I should've figured something was up when a heterosexual teenaged boy wanted to have a sleepover with another male, which never happens from my experience

Guys have sleepovers until their mid-20s or until they get married/move in with their girlfriend, whichever comes first."
"Well, if that helps, I gave my straight friend a full shirtless backrub and there was nothing more to it."
not literally though.. I hope
"I do

"I know plenty of gay men, who in a drunken moment went with a woman.  That didn't make them the least bit straight.  The opposite is also true."
"Comfortable with him hiding it? Hell no. Not mentioning it because it's not important? Sure.

But if he's hiding hot guys making advances, then he's choosing to hide one of the things I enjoy, and he knows I enjoy it. That's like finding a funny video and intentionally choosing not to tell me. Like... I like pictures of cats. Seems like an obvious way to make us both feel good."
"&gt; Just being gay too is not a free pass into anyone else's life.


SUPER THIS!"
Depends how different they look
Never even crossed my mind escorting could be part of how they're pulling it off. Just spent 10 mins searching rentboy for a famous IGer in NYC and lo and behold... lol
10. I pound ass like I'm drilling for oil in Texas.
"I'll make sure to do that, because if they're going to screw each other, as mad as I will be, it's going to happen. My husband and I found every loophole there was by junior year."
This actually happened to a friend at work he is really fast on the register (we are cashiers) and he swiftly told the customer the total and the customer who was this old guy straight up asked why he sounded so gay. My friend was like shocked and the manager just told the customer to have a good day. Like wtf talking fast doesn't mean a person is gay but we all laughed about it.
"I saw ""puts a pillow over my face"" and thought this was going in a very different direction."
"Fuck them. Who cares?! You be you, bro!"
"I don't really care what other people think. But idk, it would have to be a really attractive guy for me to venture into the world of gay sex. No homo until then. Just appreciating male booty from a distance."
"I got news for you, bud. They weren't completely straight. :)"
"I told a guy I thought he was a 7 out of 10 and meant it, thinking it was a nice thing to say. He took it very badly.

We are still together I now think he's a 10."
"I understand your perspective but I kinda feel sorry for him because he’s probably gone through the majority of his life alone. Loneliness makes you do weird things. Still, he should be hitting on someone his own age. "
"Worked at a grocery store and I have a couple stories:

Some guy bought roses and then asked me out to prom (I was 19 at the time but I had already graduated, so I found this a little strange) even though I never met him and said ""I'm sorry, no"" and he looked kinda hurt. He had a birthmark on the side of his face, and I thought it made him rather cute. I actually kind of wish I said yes or gave him my number.

Another one (also 19) was when I was blocking (moving things forward, making it all look pretty) and some guy asked me for help and I followed him to the next aisle and he asked me which condoms are the best. I was a virgin, so I said ""I don't know"" he then asked if he could open them and try it and I said no, then he said if he bought it could he try them with me and I just walked away.

I don't know if that even works, but I don't think I want to be friends with you anymore, especially if you're going to continually post anti-gay stuff on Facebook."

"They don't turn me on, but hey, some ladies smell nice.

You should hang out at a trailer park and you'll find all the trash bussy you want. 
I gave up on bottoming like five times. (Tight hole) Eventually I realized I wanted sex and there weren't too many 'sides' so I sucked it up and became a full time bottom.
What he did is actually mature and respectful. Its unfortunate that it didn't go the way you wanted it to but you should appreciate the straightforward way he handled it and understand that it means that he cares about you enough to recognize and handle the situation maturely. I've had to do something similar once or twice in the past and it's always with guys who I genuinely liked as a person but just didn't click with romantically for one reason or another.

"Yeah, a lot of those ""fitness model"" types are for hire. "
"- On his phone a lot a lot during the date. 
- Doesn't really participate in the conversation (doesn't ask questions, gives very short answers, etc). 
- If they can't talk about what they love doing for more than 1 sentence. 
- Asks for your astrological sign (might sound stupid, but for me it has turned into a red flag) 
- Doesn't offer to pay for his share (unless it was implied that all expenses were paid by the person, it's just good manner to offer to pay for yourself). 

There's probably a bunch more, but I'll leave it at that for now."
"Because it feels right, surprisingly it doesn't taste like shit, it feels like the inside of a mouth tbh. "
But how do you KNOW? 😉
Dislocate your jaw.
"Compliment him before he's crying, just at random. If that doesn't help some, the cynic in me wonders if it's for attention. At the end of the day it's either that or body dysmorphia, which can require serious therapy to get over."
When he puts a pillow over my face in the morning before he turns on the light (he wakes up and hour before me) and then lifts it after he shuts the light off and kisses me and says he loves me then goes off to work.. so many others but this one is a favorite.

"You could invite him over as a ""friend"", and when your parents leave you alone just lock the door and do your thing."
"Kinda disappointing for your boy, but I bet he knew this before entering in a relationship with you so... he has to deal with it.

Anyways, I'd advice to try at least once for him. Take it like its a gift for him. He will appreciate it.

I'd rather hypothesize that's what the older partner accepts in exchange of the other one's youth. Something along the line of a trade off. ??

"- It is 2017.  24 is young for even straight people to be marrying, unless they are Mormons or something.
- Gay men couldn't marry in most places in the US 5 years ago, don't have any kind of biological clock or social pressure, and have access to way better casual sex than 90% of straight folks."
That was all typed really oddly specific
"I am mildly curious now, but I feel like it's one of those things that's better to be fantasized about and never actually indulged in."
"Sure. Not particularly amazing, he evidently finds me attractive enough to have sex with, but it would be a little bit of an ego boost..."
"Yeah I'd prefer an equal type of relationship, things only change during sex though. Can be as rough as they like haha. "
"They exist, but for clear reasons it's the obvious gay guys in the short shorts that draw my attention."
"Sounds like a textbook case of a [false memory syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory_syndrome). I'm not sure I can offer solid advice on what you should do about it. You know your friend better than we do. If you told him you suspected FMS and linked to the Wikipedia article or a case example, would he at least consider the possibility? If you feel confronting him directly is a bad idea, how about using her gf as an intermediary?

Legally he has no case without any corroborating evidence in any sane jurisdiction (though IANAL). Other than losing him as a friend, the main worry is that if he goes very public with the accusations, others in your social circle may side with him. Hence I'd look at any ways to defuse the situation before he does."

You think having a sleepover or being physically affectionate with another man is gay?
I never said this was an exciting story 
"Suffer, bitch."
"Very well written. I feel like you've sort of answered your own question already, all these pros you've outlined and the only con is the age difference? And only 15 years at that, i don't think its that much of a big deal. I think your bf has decided he wants to be with you regardless of the age difference as its probably not a big deal to him. When your 45 and he's 30 i think it would mean exactly the same thing it does to him now, also he's old enough to know what he's getting in to. When tastes change in the relationship you adapt and work together. Don't worry about the age difference too much or let it bother you it sounds like you've got a really good thing going, that most of us hope we can find at some point."

Ya I don't get the sleepover thing either. All my friends in high school had sleepovers like every weekend. 
"He approached me and wondered if I were wearing eyeliner ( I never do but people often think I do ) he might have thought I was gay if I were indeed wearing it...then he casually asked me about the dating scene around here since he was from another state, he asked about the girls I said ""I don't know"" and he asked if I weren't into girls I said ""yes"", he then asked if we could take a walk, we did and he said he was horny and would have loved if I could hook him up with a ""fagot"" or a girl. I said ""I know no body who can help you with that but I'd like to have your phone number"" he wondered why would I have liked to have his number , he said ""you would do things with me"" and the thirsty whore in me said yes...we were walking in public when I would casually grab his dick and he my ass until we stood by a police station ( risky, huh? ) he then said he only does this for money and any more would cost me money but for me sex should between two consensual adults and exchange for nothing so knowing that he liked me I said I wouldn't pay him a single cent so he laughed and said "" you expect me to cool off your engines for free?"" I quickly replied ""you expect me to pay you to cool off yours?"" He then smiled and we headed to a bush not very far from the police station and there the glory happens, it was great and for the rest of the day I would be maybe eating or doing something else  and then remember and say to myself ""today I sucked a dick!""
Edit: As for the guy, he was about 5'10"" , he said he was 26, he was my type jock kind of guy and best of all he was in the military!...that if he wasn't lying of course."
"Fuck him, you must not."
Some guys that have gay/masculinity issues really get sensitive when theyre called cute

"You're not overreacting. The problem is that we're used to expecting these types of christians to be super shitty so when people meet a christian is not as super shitty they think its something impressive/worthy of admiring, worthy of letting slide. No. That doesn't take away from the fact that she has ignorant views and puts an imaginary friend before her sense of humanity. I would feel the same (probably even worse) about her. "
"Why can't guys who want sexual freedom date other guys who want the same and just have open relationships, and the guys who want monogamy stick to other guys who want monogamy? 

Sleeping around isn't ""cheating"" if you and your partner have discussed and mutually agreed to allow yourselves to sleep around, and there's nothing morally wrong in two adults mutually agreeing to be open in their relationship. The problem only arises when the partners disagree about what they expect out of the relationship. If one you wants to open and the other wants to be closed you simply have mismatched relationship goals. "
I never let people completely in.  Part of it is self preservation the other is that I like the control of being able to tell someone else you really don't know me .  
yassssss
"Sloppy and tiring.

I was extremly worried about hurting it with my teeth. I was focusing on hiding them behind my lips, breathing, sucking, moving my tongue, playing with his balls and not chocking at the same time. Kinda overwhelming. My jaws started to hurt and I was just hoping he would finally cum, but it was taking forever...

When he came, I thought I will throw up. It was *disgusting* and it felt like there was 3 times more of semen than there actually was. When it was finally over, I had tears in my eyes and I was like ""yeah, never again""... but next time it wasn't that bad anymore and now I love it!"

"Ask them why their previous relationships ended. My first ever boyfriend simply said, ""They were all liars and cheats,"" which little ol' Never Been Kissed Before Me didn't really think about at the time. But now I realize it was a sign of his complete inability to take responsibility, and the fact that he was a melodramatic little bitch, just like his mother. Someone who refuses to ever admit fault in their previous relationships is clearly too immature to be dating. "
"My boyfriend and I are complete and total opposites. Exact opposites. But it totally works. I'm more wild child, very relaxed. Hes so tame and vanilla, and super high stress. I keep him on his toes constantly and pull him WAY out of his comfort zone. I keep him calm. He keeps me grounded and focused. He will never truly know what he has done for me emotionally. Ive never been so in love. The best part is, I honestly know its 100% mutual. He likes to make sure I know that. I feel like the ""luckiest"" guy in the world everytime I look at him... plus he has a GREAT ass. So that makes me very lucky hahaha"
Not really. It seems like there are more straight guys curious about dicks than gay guys about pussies tbh.
aw this is cute
"Twink+

Small, athletic bodies, boyish looking, with a little bit of hair. Something that gives the vibe ""I am a real man!"" but in reality you're still just a cute boy who's only trying to be a man."
You are not his boyfriend.  Stop acting like you are.
"It's rare that anyone is completely straight or completely gay, that's my point."
"His girlfriend dumped him for his drug abuse. You should too. He isn't looking for an explanation on your part. He's fishing for blackmail material you fear (whether real or false) to get something (probably money) out of you, and his mind is also probably rationalizing to him that his suspicions are right, just so he can find a way to blame/accuse you of all his problems and get you to ""fix"" it for him, probably with money, which he will use on drugs. If he can get you to admit rape, then he can rationalize that his life went South after you ""raped"" him, and he can blame you for his shitty life choices instead of himself. 

Stay away from this dude. He isn't your friend anymore."
"Doesn't mean this is a great way to approach people though.  You didn't say, this is how I met my two best friends"
"Keep in mind that there's a difference between ""bottoming does nothing for me"" and ""I find bottoming physically painful and/or emotionally traumatizing.""  

I don't think you should ever do anything that fits into the latter category, but doing the former seems like just the sort of compromise that makes relationships work.  "
No they don't know each other.

"Oh yeah, they're trash people, but they wanted head and I wanted to give head so it worked out okay that 1 time. Every other time went less optimally. "
"In our case, we have a two bedroom apt and both the rooms are both medium in size. We both have our own beds and furniture so it just makes practical sense. 

It's nice because I have mine setup the way I like, and vice versa. We wind up in each others beds quite alot, but we both enjoy having a space all to our own if needed. "
That's a protest I can get behind!
"I was your age even before the 80s.  I went off to university and they were still taking us gays off to jail for simply talking with each other over a beer in a gay pub.  They would kick you out of university for suspicion of being gay, and not give you your transcripts.  Family could have doctors give you lobotomies, or electro shock, or simply lock you away.

By the 80s, the police were not arresting us so much, although it still happened, especially on trumped up charges.  They would also stand by and watch a gang of bashers attack a lone gay man outside a club, and just laugh.  

The AIDs crisis came on like gang busters, and we didn't even have a name for it.  The country looked on with cold eyes, and just didn't give a fig.  The senior senator from South Carolina had a standard form letter that he sent out to every parent of a person who died of AIDS in his state, telling them that their child was an abomination who got what he deserved, and was burning in hell now.

Ambulances and hospitals and emergency rooms regularly refused services to people if they thought they were gay, fearing AIDS.  If you got your friend into a hospital, you had to go multiple times a day to make sure they had been taken water, and that the food was taken into their rooms, because the attendants would just let them starve, or lay in their own soiled sheets.

I'm one of the lucky ones.  I got very monogamously in love right before the plague swept through our circles.  By our late 30s my partner and I were the only one of our friends still alive.  There were no gays from ten years older than us to ten years younger than us.  They had all died of the plague.  We were going through the emotions of people who are in their 70s, who have lost all their friends, and we also had acute survivors guilt.

The 80s were a very rough time."
"Losing your virginity under the wrong circumstances (like drunk or unprepared) is worse than any shame that you may feel about your virginity. Also gays have stunt development due to our need for hiding in the closet during the teenage years, so it is not uncommon for 20 something virgins to occur. "
"&gt;I’m more frustrated with him home all the time, which I’ve interpreted as him not looking any longer. 

If you acknowledge that you played a role in his situation, you don't have any right to feel like this."
"It's ok.   You're slowly deprogramming.  You were taught for so long by society that doing that is ""not quite right"".   Takes some people longer to deprogram than others.
I almost pushed a guy down some stairs when he tried to hug me.

Different things cause different reactions.  
I was ok with giving/getting blowjobs, but couldn't deal with simple hugging or affection.
You're the opposite.

This will go away as you become more comfortable with yourself."

"Um, maybe you just weren't invited to the sleepovers because the straight boys were ignorant and thought ""the gay guy will suck our dicks while we're sleeping""."
