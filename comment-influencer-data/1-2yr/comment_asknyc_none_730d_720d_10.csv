"This question is actually great.

The first thing you gotta know is: every bodega's process is a little different, like how every snowflake is different, in that I don't believe that every snowflake is actually different; they're just mostly different. I mean, how the fuck do they know EVERY snowflake is different?? Do you realize how many snowflakes fall on your block in a single hour of a single snowfall? Like, millions! And they're ALL different? Unh-unh. I don't think so.

Anyway, go in with the assumption that the person you're ordering from already hates you. Because many already do. You'll say, ""Can I get a roast beef on a roll?"" And he'll go, ""...You wanches?"" And you'll be like, ""Uh, what was that?"" And he'll sigh and go, ""You. WANCHES??""

And you'll be like, ""Uh, I'm sorry??""

And he'll make a big deal like you're a complete moron and he's doing you this big favor and spell out for you: ""Do. You. Wan. Chizzz?""

""Oh! Cheese! I'm sorry! Yes, please.""

""Watkin chiz?""

""Uh, I don't unde-... Oh! Muenster??""

And then he'll silently make your sandwich and thrust it at you.

And after two or three of these interactions it won't be stressful anymore. Like you're playing a game of Risk, you've worn down this deli and made it your own due largely to attrition and a complete disregard for strategy. Go to another deli and the process will have its own unique intricacies that you'll have to learn.

There are a few shortcuts, though. Know the lingo: if people say ""kaiser rolls"" where you come from, tell that phrase ""auf wiedersehen"" because I've never heard anyone say it here. It's a hard roll, maybe ""with the poppyseeds"" specified. Like your sandwich on a ""torpedo roll""? Well, run silent, admiral, because you'll get a ""hero"" or maybe a ""sub"". Sometimes it'll be the smaller size of the torpedo you're used to, if you're some sort of fancy pants who expects differently sized torpedoes and heroes, but mostly they're all the large size. And anyway, if it's small, then you're probably at some fancy pants deli that's not even a bodega anyway. (The best delis, in my mind, actually seem to have these even bigger, harder, like semolina style breads for their heroes, which is the most legit. In full disclosure, though: I'm not sure I really even know what semolina means.)

Otherwise, you should try to plan out your sandwich before you arrive. Or at least order. But you never know who is going to be standing in front of you but too chickenshit to catch the deli guy's eye first, even though it's his turn, so just be ready or be flexible. 

Your sandwich needs: a bread, a filling (that is, a meat that Boar's Head makes), an optional cheese, a dressing (mayo and/or salt &amp; pepper and/or oil &amp; vinegar if you're Italian... And if you're lucky, horseradish sauce), plus toppings. For the toppings, you'll probably get lettuce and tomato free of charge. Same for onions, maybe green peppers, but at this point you might be stealing from the salad guy. You can PROBABLY pull roasted red peppers in many places, but it might be an additional charge, and they're going to massively change the texture of your sandwich, so be prepared.

You may be asked if you want it toasted. Some rare places may even ask if you want the whole thing toasted or just the bread. Have an idea of what you want.

Don't be tempted by paninis, which is a pluralization of an already pluralized word, but fuck if I'm going to order a ""panino"". Anyway, they're always a little expensive for what you're getting; I feel like they sit around for a long time; and the vast majority of places hardly warms it at all before you get it, or they heat it fully and it takes forever and maybe got too crispy.

You should order your tomato-y subs (chicken parm, meatball parm, etc) at a pizza place, not at a bodega.

When you order, say it loud and clear. Almost like you're yelling at the guy. Command him to let you ""get"" something. Include the full order upfront, with a noted pause after the transition to dressings and toppings. You can be more trepidatious with the verb you use to request toppings. If you're requesting it hot, just yell the word ""TOASTED"" at the end or before the transition. Also, once a sandwich is under production it becomes socially acceptable for a straight man to ask a dude with a mustache about his pickle.

For example:

You: ""Heyyyyyyy... Lemme get a HONEY HAM .. on A HERO .. with SWISS... ...!TOASTED!... ...And can I get it with lettuce-and-tomato, and green peppers?""

Guy silently starts making it.

You: ""...You got pickles?""

Him: ""You want pickle on top?""

You: ""Yeah.""

Special note: if you get into a situation where you just can't understand the guy, you can just say ""...Yes"" like the out-of-towner that you are. But I recommend just saying ""I'msorrybut.. I don't even KNOW what yer SAYIN'."" Like... He's the one talking a mile a minute with marbles in his mouth. You don't gotta feel like the weirdo here.

Anyway, at this point you gotta look around and determine if the guy is going to aggressively slide your sandwich to you across the counter and then you go to the cashier to pay, or whether he's going to bring it himself. If you can't tell, just keep an eye on where your sandwich goes. Don't plan on paying with card unless you know they'll take it or your order is at least around $8.

You'll get your sandwich in a bag with probably like 2-4 of the world's shittiest napkins. Depending on what you got, this will either be about right or far, far too few.

Now you take it home or back to work and eat it. If you know of a way to eat it comfortable without a table, like, on the street somewhere, I'd be interested to hear it, because I feel like this is a recurring solvable problem that I have.

EDIT: A bunch of people have been writing very nice things to me based on this post, so first, thank you, and second, I can't post any links here but if people like this, I'd love to get a DM and share a project I've been working on with you guys."
I've lived here my whole life and this is a perfect summation of the bodega sandwich experience. Bravo.
"Super shy and introverted, been living here my whole life, and never had this experience. 

It's probably one of the easiest exchanges I do.

Closest I had to this was a deli man saying I'm putting to much meat on the sandwich but that he'll try to make it work. I was drunk and just wanted to eat whatever monstrosity I came up with at the time He did and he not charged me for two meats instead of three. "
"This is a mirror of my bodega experiences. But yeah, your anecdotal evidence is different so fuck this guy. "
That's still exactly what an anecdote is. 
Brav-fucking-o. I don't think I can ask for much more than this. You're a Bodega specialist lmao.
This deserves a home in the sidebar
Yeah wtf is this shit this is catering to people's misconceptions about NY. It writes like someones idea of what NY is like or some stupid tourist who is offended by the deli dude that probably speaks two languages and doesn't give 2 shits about some jack off taking his sweet ass time. Oh and the napkins are almost always fantastic house level napkins.
do you know what the word anecdotal means
"&gt; If you know of a way to eat it comfortable without a table, like, on the street somewhere, I'd be interested to hear it

If the sandwich is[ wrapped in paper](https://margesnextmeal.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/photo-3.jpg), it's easy. 

Only unwrap your next 2-3 bites at a time, and when you start getting close to paper, unwrap some more. 

I can eat a bodega steak sandwich walking down the street and barely slow my pace. It gets more complicated if you have a drink in your other hand. "
The wrong fucking way to eat a burrito that's what.

For real, this is *the most* NYC thing I've read in my life.

You know the definition of anecdotal right...?
It's weird to think that you belong anywhere more than someone else. 
You must be really fun at bodegas.  
Fyres will see your anecdotal evidence and raise you the anecdotal evidence of him and his entire family. 
"West Coaster here,

""I want a black coffee.""

""Sure, Would you like sugar with the coffee?""

""I SAID. I WANT. A **BLACK** COFFEE.""

""I HEARD YOU JUST FINE. SUGAR DOESN'T CHANGE THE COLOR ASSHOLE, SO DO YOU FUCKING WANT SUGAR OR NOT?"""
That's more of a general cat thing.
"Very soup nazi - and very accurate.

I would add - much depends on how busy the place is. And time of day. If you're in there for breakfast, all you gotta do is yell ""Bacon, egg, and cheese on a roll!"" and you're set. Ask for ketchup if you're feeling bold. And of course a bodega coffee - black - no sugar. Breakfast of champions. By which I mean the severely hungover."
This is the same way proper Californians eat a burrito. 
Don't forget to pet the bodega cat.
"Wait, you guys do this to coffee by default and then serve plain fucking iced tea?"
"One of my favorite experiences at a NY deli was watching a guy order a Turkey, Bacon, and Cheese who instead got a sandwich with cheese and turkey bacon, and watching both argue over who was in the wrong"
"And we have an early favorite for September, ""how do I order a sandwich"" is gonna be tough to beat."
"In case you're not just trolling:

When you go into the bodega you'll see two counters, one with cigarettes and lotto, the other with deli meat. Order at the deli counter. If there isn't someone at the counter, ask the cashier or bodega cat and someone will appear and take your order.

There are normally only three types of bread offered: roll, hero (like a foot long sub) or toast.  Specialty sandwiches may be advertised on hand written signs posted on the counter.

Cheesesteak with green peppers and onion is my litmus test for bodega sandwiches. If they can do that well, then they can do anything.

After you order you can walk around the store and admire how a tiny corner store can carry everything you may ever need.

Once finished, the guy making your sandwich will hand it over to you, or will give it directly to the cashier. You can then pay and go.
If you really like the sandwich, put a dollar in the deli tip jar next time you go in. "
"As someone who has moved from the east to the west coast, there is a missing instruction - if you are from California, the important part is the part where you plan your order before it is your turn. There is no tolerance for not knowing what you want when it gets to your turn. If you don't know, the correct move is to step aside, let the adults order their food, and wait until you are emotionally ready to actually list all of the ingredients of your sandwich in order. Need to ask a question of your sandwich maker? Cool. That is an indication that you are in the wrong place, not that you should ask the question. If you need to know what kind of mayo they are going to use - this is not where you should be.

I see a lot of misunderstandings in this area so I felt it needed to be added as a kind of appendix for those with WCDMD (West Coast Decision Making Disorder)."
"Also, please for the love of god, if you're in a busy deli/bodega situation in the morning and getting something relatively simple, e.g. BEC + coffee, go to the register while they're making your sandwich and pay. It saves a ton of time for you and other people. Not all bodegas will allow you to do that more often than not they will. "
eat at the olive garden in times square
Guy got what he ordered. What he wanted to ask for was a turkey and cheese with bacon. 
"To translate for those outside of NYC, coffee comes with milk and an assload of sugar by default. Black countermands the milk, no sugar countermands the sugar. If you order a black coffee in NYC, unlike anywhere else in the world, you get a minimum of a tablespoon of sugar in it."
"Probably some sophomore undergrad who was given one of those writing assignments where you get extra credit for it making the front page of Reddit.

I wish I was joking."
You need slab bacon from Peter Luger's. 
Wth is that? 
You don't work it into cool tea. You pour the sugar into the hot tea and then work it in before you ice it.
Lol ask the bodega cat. Priceless. 
I just say what I want and it's made...really don't understand you guys
Finish packing.
"It's a corner store. They have some or all of smokes, beer, basic home needs, soda, and a deli. A one stop shop. "
"11 rules to bodega like a New Yorker:

1. respect the cat
2. loosies are 25 cents if you're cool, 50 cents if you're uncool. for god's sake don't ask for one if there's a cop in the shop.
3. if you're uptown get a chopped cheese sandwich if the shop has a grill man
4. don't order bacon at a halal shop, they'll give you turkey bacon instead and it sucks
5. you want a roll or a hero. if they even offer it to you on sliced bread it's a shit bodega. wraps are for yuppie scum only. 
6. mix and match six packs are a privilege, not a right. 
7. tip your grill man for fuck's sake
8. if there's a bullet proof plexiglass screen, you might not want to come around after midnight, ya dig?
9. the upside to a shop playing really bad latin music (the kind with that shitty plucked guitar) is that everything in the shop will cost like 20% less
10. if they got curly fries, you want them curly fries
11. respect the cat"
"Top of the WTC and the WTC Memorial, and then the top of the Empire State. One last look at the Chrysler Building, Grand Central. Walk a nice tour of Midtown. Maybe a quick hop into Central Park, or the East Village. Or take a boat tour which will circle Manhattan. Rent a car, drive around to experience NYC traffic one more time. Take the subway and wait in sweltering heat for a train that will seem to take forever to come. Enjoy being on a train that's packed with sweaty, drunk, loud strangers on a train at 1AM. 

Visit all the awesome NYC museums that you've always wanted to visit but never had the time for. Don't forget to visit Times Square as a New Yorker; next time it'll be as a tourist and people will hate you. 

Or, you can stay home and cook for the first time in like forever, since you probably haven't after you moved to NYC. It will be good practice for after the move. 


But me, I would rent a room/penthouse on the 80th floor of a high-rise in Manhattan with a nice view, I would sit there (preferably outside on a balcony) all night watching the city lights, and I would be reflecting on all the dreams and hopes I had when I first came to the city, and who I've become and where I am and where I'm going to go next. And I would promise myself that I would come back, maybe, one day, when I'm younger. "
"Exactly that. Thank you. I really don't understand being so shitty to people about sandwiches. Or about not being native to a given place. Are sandwiches serious business now? Is moving suddenly unacceptable? If so, please find a hobby. Knitting is fun *and* useful! You can spend forty bucks, two weeks, and infinite curse words making a lovely throw blanket you could have bought for $20, but it's made with *love*, man. "
I like Bodega cats but I would never touch one. That's just asking for something bad to happen
Only two? You must live in a fancy apartment. 
"They sure got you fired up. Anecdotally speaking, of course. "
You forgot the cat. 
In the office yes but not when going to a friends apt.  If it's super crappy out and I'm worried about messing up their apartment I'll just take off my boots and be that guy in socks (wear cool socks and you can pull this off easier).
If that's the weirdest interaction you've had in NYC you should consider yourself blessed
Triggered by the word anecdotal while demonstrating you have no idea what it means?  New Yorker confirmed.

"Wowowow! You sure are passionate about protecting bodega's reputation. You're like a...bodegard.

"There is a difference between salvaging a broken burrito with a fork, and going in *planning* on eating it with a fork."
