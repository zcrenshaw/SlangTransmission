" Run, brother, run. Run as far away as you can. Run as fast as you can."
T is an asshole. T is not indicative of straight people as a whole.
He is clearly depressed. 
"What the hell. RUN, and don't look back.

Btw, do you wanna hear about their first night, their marital problems or how they organise childcare? IMO, he wants to keep you in his back pocket in case he needs some man meat, knowing that you'd be committed to him.

RUN."
Tell them their straight crush came out as a bottom.
lick their bodies when they sleep.

Usually it's the masc obsessed gay guys that have the problem with them though 
Hey dude protect your friend/teammate just knowing people have his back make a world of difference...trust me I was outed by people in hs but I had friends who had my back and stopped been from dong something stupid and seeing that things would get better. PM me is you need any further advice or help with this 
"most dudes will just spam right swipes without even looking at the profile and leave the females to be the discerners.

If there's multiple matches, then the dude will sort through them and message the ones he's going for.  

The difference between gay dudes and straight dudes is the willingness of our partners.  It's hard to be a whore as a straight man if you're gated by a female phalanx."
Dirty talk is actually one of my biggest turn ons and I hate when a guy is too silent during sex...
Now what was that wink though üòÇ
I think you answered your own question lol
"I mean I‚Äôm not out to them no, but I think they‚Äôve definitely caught me staring lol"

"Congratulations on both victories (accepting family and doctorate degree)!!! 

That is so incredible, and I‚Äôm so happy that you can now be your authentic self!"
this sounds like a good start to a porno! lol.  did you check craigslist missed connections?
Oh my god yes when the Gay Straight Alliance kids would come in and talk to the class I would get so awkward and almost have tears in my eyes. Then theyd leave and a bunch of people would start laughing and making fun of them and Id just sit there in silence :( It was rough.

"There‚Äôs a difference between stocky and overweight. Stocky is usually a skeletal frame a bit wider than expected for the height with a bit of muscle, developed or not. When the belly extends over the belt, stocky is no longer the correct word. "

"It can really take me out of the moment if I'm not fully into it.

No. You're the only person on the planet to sleep naked.
"""You have no ass."""
"Always. And I'm definitely not bi.  

The guys in straight porn don't fit into cookie cutter molds like too many of the guys in gay porn do. Also, they aren't ""straight for pay,"" so it isn't obvious that they are not really into what they're doing like the guys in gay porn.  

If the chick is making too much noise like a squalking balloon with the air slowly being let out, it's really annoying.

You could say it was a *hard* experience 
"I wish I had a father like you. 

You should look up your local PFLAG group! Odds are you‚Äôll find some other family members of LGBT people who may have shared experiences with you and your wife. They have resources for you, and you can start to create a more accepting social circle! They may also be able to help you start conversations with your other family members and/or friends. 

Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. Maybe you could consider attending a group therapy or support group with your wife? 

You sound like a pretty badass dad. I‚Äôm so glad parents like you exist. "
"""you like that, you fucking retard?"" just really hits my spot."
"So I‚Äôm Latino and my bf is  white. (lord bless him, he‚Äôs so pale, I keep him inside) He gets stupid horny when I start talking to him in Spanish and given that his favorite position is the lotus flower (because he‚Äôs so limber and I can support him with my arms), when he‚Äôs near climax I start talking to him in Spanish and he goes absolutely ape shit. It is...the best thing ever. We always laugh afterwards cause it takes us like 5-10 minutes to start back up again."

"He's clearly VERY depressed.  Are you sure he is taking his medication? How often does he see the psychiatrist? Maybe his medication needs to be changed or enhanced?   Currently, he needs to see someone (maybe a psychotherapist- MSW- or a psychologist for talk therapy) on a WEEKLY basis to help get better.

That's a lot of change to experience. Pet deaths are real  milestones in one's life ( it's like losing a child).  You really ought to think about getting a puppy.  My hubby and I have had to say goodbye to multiple dogs in our 31 years together. Each time is wretching. But we have found that we have to have canine companions in our life and the joy of a new ""life energy"" in our lives is contagious!  Good Luck!"
"Where do you live, Hell? 
It might be time to consider moving far away from all those people so that you and your family can start to be happy."

They like the attention.
"&gt; I might be full of crap and this might not be helpful.

Oh no you have hit the nail on the bloody head mate.

The first  gay dude you will ever need to impress and love is always yourself. It sounds so wanky to say it but self love so important.

Honestly the second I just let myself say ""you are who you are buddy and that is okay"" everything changed since I ""love"" myself I am more willing and motivated to care for myself. 

I now make sure I eat more healthy, I make sure that I am more responsible and I have basically become my own fussy mother type always making sure that I am okay and happy.

Yes I am not perfect, there is issues  I need to work on but I am trying and I will keep moving forward. People come and go. But you will always have to live with yourself.

It honestly breaks my heart seeing so many people here feeling so bummed out about themselves cause the feel they don't look like a Greek statue or have amazing lifestyles."
Comparison is the thief of joy.  
Hello you are bi. 
Where do you want to go for dinner.
"Message him on Grindr something like ""I see you bro lol"" lmao"

You can‚Äôt suck dick as well as you think.
I hooked up with my ex boyfriends much hotter brother. He was better in bed too. 
Wow that is gonna raise sooo many issues if/when he does dome out. Wtf will you do if he dies or falls ill suddenly and his family doesn't even know you exist?!
My friend needs to see this. Girls shoot him down because he‚Äôs short but he‚Äôs more fit than most guys. I‚Äôll let him know the gays appreciate him haha.

1. I was at a guy's place and while we were getting down and dirty, his girlfriend called. She was sick and in another country. I kept on going. 

2. I was on a four-hour train ride. The guy next to me started fondling me, and I let him, and in less than twenty minutes we were full-blown feeling each other up for the rest of the ride, and I almost came in my pants many times. I never knew his name, because as soon as we reached our destination, I got up and left.

 Doing it in public -- with people everywhere less than 5 feet from us, with the possibility of being caught by the officers or being seen through the CCTV -- was hot as fuck.  "
One time we had a drunk argument on how the American electoral college worked at 3 am. Crazy part is we‚Äôre both Canadian.
Yes I watch straight porn if the guy is hot. I really like it when they are having sex in missionary position so I can see the guys ass. And there‚Äôs this site called hotguysfucked where the guys are really hot and the camera focuses a lot on the guy.
"T is a POS and quite frankly your other friends are pretty shitty for not sticking up for you. Were I to witness that, I'd have told T to go fuck off and that I would not be going with him either. 

Were I you, I think it would have been appropriate to put a little pressure on W to see how he reacted when he had to make a choice on the issue - if only so you'd know where he really stands on the issue. By walking off you gave him an easy out.  "

"I was gonna say yes, but then I thought about why that is. It isn't necessarily the gay voice that is a turn off. It's the stereotypical sentences being spoken in that voice. The voice itself doesn't matter, but if the language being used is annoying and feminine, my boner is killed."

" I've had 3 different doc's over the past 7 years and one of them was a muuuuuuch older man who only chuckled quietly when he saw my hole (very worn looking, check out my posted pics) the other two were guys in their late thirties. One didn't react at all. One spent A LOT more time ""checking"" my prostate. Started with one finger and then went to two. Asked if I was feeling any discomfort. I said no and he legit leveled up to 4 fingers to the hilt. I spotted a grin for a fleeting moment. Thankfully he was cute. He really dug around in there. Lots of twisting and curling his fingers. "

Am I a bad person for admitting that I laughed when I read this? I'm not laughing at the OP, but at the situation. 

For the OP, your brother is probably thinking about your friend in the same way your friend is thinking about your brother. We're all guys, gay or straight. That's just how it works. The only problem for you is if things don't go well and you end up stuck in the middle, figuratively speaking. "
I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and let‚Äôs be honest about the real struggle here: pants. 
"In your case I would wait till you go to college and join the LGBT society. Meet gays outside of a sexual context and become comfortable with your sexuality. 

If you do meet up with a guy for sex only.  Always, *always* meet up somewhere first. It can even be Starbucks. Talk a and get to know them.

It might make you more comfortable to get to know a guy first, 1 to two weeks. Text, meet up and take it slowly. 

Be firm with what you want to do. Whether that's just a handjob or a blowjob. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for having your limits and don't be afraid to leave if a guy is pressuring you into doing more or is giving you shit for not being good at something. Sex should be fun.

Lastly even if you are experienced, there are always jerks who will try to take advantage of you. Sex is a vulnerable act. I had guys mid sex trying to do something that I didn't agree to, whether that is to take the condom of or something else.

Be firm with them, don't take their shit and leave. 

Also *always* tell a friend where you are going. Use a condom, always. Get tested every 3 months or so.

Also what people forget is, wear comfortable clothing when you go out for a hook up. A sweater and some trousers (not jeans). In a scenario where you would have to leave quickly it can be life saving.

Good luck and have fun!!

"Eh, I think scandalous is a bit subjective. I've hooked up with plenty of guys who are married, in relationships, been snuck into houses for threesomes while they were visiting family, and so on.

I guess the one that feels dirtiest/most scandalous, simply because I had to sneak around a truck stop and the whole affair reeked of sleazy behavior, was when some dude hit me up on Grindr probably four years ago. Said he was a trucker, asked if I'd come get him and bring him back to my place. Said I couldn't (really I just don't like having people in my personal space), he asked if I'd at least trade blowjobs in his cab.

Sure, good looking enough. Tall, tan, redneckish, early 30s but between the sun and whatever else he looked a bit older, leathery. Went, he said we had to be careful because he didn't want anyone to see me. Sure, fine; we sneak between trucks, go the long way around, had to stop and wait a few times until someone moved. I was getting annoyed, if I really wanted to play Metal Gear Solid I'd have stayed home.

Anyways, we finally get to the cab and I climb up, get in the back. What was supposed to be swapping head turned into him jerking me off while he rimmed me, turned into him asking me to turn over and get on my knees so he could rim better turned into a several hours of aggressive, dominant buttfuckery. Not to encourage unsafe sex, but Lawd he came at least three times, and spent a good bit enjoying pushing and fucking his load into me.

After he came the second time I got off and was more or less done, and kind of figured he was too. He leaned out from the back of the cab, looked around, said there were too many people milling about still and asked if I would mind waiting for a bit. I was fine, I was a bit sore and didn't really want to bother with putting clothes on and just wanted to lay there and enjoy the ambiance/feeling/etc.

He wanted to cuddle a little, which really just turned into stroking, me getting hard again, and him going back to giving me head. Everything more or less played out as it did before with less rimming, more (and more aggressive) fingering, and in fifteen minutes or so he took me from ""No, I'm really sore and tight, I don't want to get fucked again"" to getting used and abused until he came a third time a while after that.

He wouldn't let me go until I came again, which took quite a while but you wouldn't have heard me complaining (only partly because he was choking me with his arm from behind while he as fucking my face into the corner of some musty old padding).

Good times.

"I hooked up with a professor at my school. Not mine though. 

We went to his classroom and fucked on one of those cold black science class tables. My ass made a condensation print on it. "
Have you met every straight person? Or even any in this guy's town? Are you a straight guy? Where is your evidence for dismissing this guy's concerns?
Most straight boys are like that here

That's what happens when a penis' most sensitive parts are left alone instead of being cut (aka mutilated).
"The first time anything went in my ass and I immediately thought ""nope"""
I am so sorry you are going through this.  He is probably taking it even harder because he knows it‚Äôs all is because of him.  Make sure he gets support he needs so he doesn‚Äôt do anything stupid.  
Some people would think you‚Äôre the idiot. Different strokes.
"I was walking down the stairs from the queen featuring Adam Lambert concert chatting this guy up (given the concert, odds are he‚Äôs gay). He was super cute and let me have some of his popcorn on the way down the stairs. 

At the bottom we went over to look at the merch table - my friends and ride were leaving and so I asked for his number. His response?  ‚ÄúOhh mate, you‚Äôre barking up the wrong tree...‚Äù

Hahaha. Facepalm. "
"Yup, welcome to being a gay young person. We miss out on a lot, not everyone gets a boyfriend after a magical coming out story."
"This is honestly why I get annoyed with some gay movies. Like, the characters just fall into each other's laps, happen to be gay, happen to be attracted to one another, and happen to be compatible sexually. Like that is a lot of stacked coincidence that isn't reflective of reality at all.  "

In his former posts he's mentioned they live in Serbia and the son wants to stay there. Something tells me they're probably not going to find a PFLAG group or a friendly therapist there.

"Is this what they call ""stuck between a cock and a hard place""?"
"You have been married for two years.....he's gotta come out. In my opinion, he's being selfish. Now you can't force him out...but you should at least ask him why you can't meet with his parents. Or even better (maybe for him) tell him next time he sees his parents you both go together and instead of coming out....you silently act like a couple. like hold hands at times."

"wtf, people just reach over and start fondling the person sitting next to them??? glad it worked out for you, but that is NOT an okay behavior."
I think he‚Äôs getting at the fact that some gay guys push the fact that the reason straight people won‚Äôt accept us is because of fem gays

You deserve better. Hell the one that will be miserable at the end. You'll find your peace.

2). Yeah shame is toxic. Gotta let that shit go..practice makes perfect! 


3).  Well....you already know......you dick is telling ya..........once you give that guy your phone number, this will all be so much conjecture.   Cuz if you think your Dick is cray cray for him now, wait till you cum down his throat, you will be so turned on you will think you didn‚Äôt know how sex felt. You‚Äôll see. "
"If I‚Äôm topping: if it‚Äôs a first time hookup, I‚Äôll often bring up how they‚Äôre a total slut for inviting me (a stranger) over/or coming to my place for me to fuck them. I‚Äôll also bring up how tight they are or how good it feels to fuck them/get sucked by them etc. 

Words like slut, bitch, whore, and even the f word (not fuck lol) work fantastically if the other guy is okay with them. Though I‚Äôm also the kind of person who constantly asks how it feels for them (to make sure he‚Äôs actually enjoying the sex.) I find this sexy in its own way, since knowing that the other guy is loving it is a huge turn on for me. 

If I‚Äôm bottoming: I like the other guy to do all of the above. 

I also will tell him how good his dick feels or to go harder/softer, deeper etc. depending on how it feels and maybe even refer to myself as a slut etc haha. Also if i moan it‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúout of breath because your dick is exhausting me deep voice moan‚Äù instead of a high pitched loud one. I find it more realistic and sexier haha. 

I know that half of it isn‚Äôt sincere, but it REALLY enhances sex for me, so I love vocal guys and being vocal. "

"Ugh gays for Trump are a fucking cancer.

Every now and then I come across one, and they're like, ""Wow you're really cute and I'm really sweet and have really nice arms/shoulders but two weeks in I'm gonna make some shitty comment about how Black Lives Matter is a racist, anti-police terrorist organization, and start on about how President Trump should just get rid of all of them"" and I have to give them the bye Felicia.

And then awkwardly ignore them when we run into each other out because I can't talk to them with a straight face, and whenever they bring it up I'm just like, ""You're pretty but you can't fix stupid"" and then they get angry and I'm spared them trying to talk to me for a couple months."

"When I wanna enlisted in the army, I had as a wallpaper in my phone my girl best friend and I told everyone she was my girlfriend. "
I‚Äôd say when my husband recorded us having sex (I knew about it) and then a few months later I was using his phone while he was in the pool because id left mine at home and I went to go to gmail in the browser and when I did there was an account logged in that I didn‚Äôt recognize and he sent a friend the videos of us having sex a day after it happened (I remember because it was his birthday). So I went home until our friends left and we had a three day fight (not physical just a lot of yelling on my part.) 
"Drop social media, that's your first step.

"I was driving back to university from home and stopped at a rest area to go to the bathroom. Stupid and risky thing to do since it was the middle of the night and I was alone. Then some older trucker guy comes in and stands at the urinal right next to me and starts jerking off. My horny ass got a boner and he saw it. He got down on his knees and I let him suck my dick right there out in the open when anyone could've come by (worst case a random cop). The guy was hot though and the whole public thing is a turn on so I wasn't thinking clearly. It's a hot memory but looking back, so many things could've gone wrong. The guy could've been crazy or tried to hurt me or something. "
"i dont, I just like people asking this question a billion times a week here"
Very much so. When I was younger I used to have a bunch of stuffed animals and I used to sleep with them. My father wanted me to stop acting like a bitch. Nice words for an 8 year old.

Also what is with the line of comparing us to ""lumbering abusive oafs""? And if twinks are becoming extremely popular I have yet to see that, most people still seem to like the big strong gym man and ""masc4masc"" is a common thing to see. I think this article is full of shit"

Leave him and work on getting over it. 
"Early on in my coming out period in college I attended a gay house party. I was shit faced when I got there and started talking to this guy in a bathroom line. It was a long line so we were both complaining about holding our dicks. After the bathroom we met up and started dancing. Pretty heavy stuff, at some point I def grabbed his ass. To which he says, ‚Äúoh man, I wish I were into guys, I‚Äôd take you home.‚Äù He was very chill about it all, tho looking back I think I was his #MeeToo moment. 

At my second and last gay college house party I was chatting it up with this hottie who was a friend of a friend, tho I‚Äôd never met him. Again, I assumed he was gay, and funny enough he assumed I was straight. So he was surprised when I asked him to if he wanted to go back to my place. I thought him lightly punching my chest at a gay party was a clearenough indicator. Incorrect. "

Edit: but also all the secrecy and sneaking around made shit super fucking hot. Fucking while skydiving kind of adrenaline"

"Get fit, dress well, and find your confidence. If your attitude is ‚Äúpoor me, I‚Äôm ugly‚Äù, everyone will pick up on it. If your attitude is ‚ÄúI look hot today‚Äù people will pick up on it.
