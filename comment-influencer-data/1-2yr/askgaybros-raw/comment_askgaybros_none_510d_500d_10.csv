"First, the fact that you've made the hard decision of removing yourself from a relationship with his mother is already testament to your being a good father and trying to be there for him. 

I get that you may not like that your son is gay. I imagine that your dreams of seeing your son marry a beautiful woman one day and being there for him when his wife gives birth, etc have now been dashed. It's new territory. But I promise you that the more you are there to listen to your son and learn more about him, the more you'll start to love him for who he truly is and you'll again, find your excitement in being a father in law one day to...wait for it...an incredible and beautiful man. 

Take your time. You're growing as well. I would say try to continue being as open and welcoming to your son as possible. The fact that you posted in this group is admirable "
üòÇ this is just too cute. Something about being a dumb teenager in love makes this kinda heartwarming.

Isn't it a bit ridiculous that using lotion is even considered feminine? What kind of bridge dwelling trolls are men supposed to be?

"Have a big brother to little brother talk. 5 minutes after he arrives next time from *Matt's* place: 

- You: how's Matt? 
- Him: fine
- You: what did you do last night/yesterday etc.? 
- Him: we went to X and did Y
- You: that's nice. Did you have fun
- Him: his response
- You: Are you two a couple these days? 

Remain silent, retain eye contact and let him speak. If not then, later.  

You can tell him that your parents are fine with it **but** it is his choice to tell them. Advise him that it will be better for him because all the sneaking around will end. 

I told my younger brother directly and he replied: ""and...What do you want a medal?"" üòÉ He is a right cunt.

"One of my biggest fears about coming out was the ‚Äúoh I knew anyway‚Äù or ‚Äúwe all worked that one out‚Äù kinda comments because for me it was a struggle to work it out myself.

I think showing your open mindedness, little comments of LGBT support here and there will be extremely comforting and perhaps give him the confidence to open up. 

Ask if he‚Äôs seeing anyone. Ask if his friend is seeing anyone ‚Äòa girlfriend?‚Äô ‚Äòor boyfriend?‚Äô In a very casual, matter of fact kind of way, this will reinforce to him that he doesn‚Äôt need to hide this."
I had sex with a man (?)
"On one of the apps my profile picture is me sitting with my roommates' dog. The first thing this guy sends me is a paragraphs long message detailing his fantasy of watching the dog fuck me.

I was honestly weirdly impressed at the fucking nerve this guy had to send something like that. I'm sort of curious if there's like a beastiality hanky code thing I accidentally set off with that picture."
"No tall gays? :(

"Way back in my misty youth, before the great flood, while I lived with my first lover, I really pressured him to ""butch up his poodle"".  Now, looking back over the long years that is one of the few regrets I have in my life.  For a period, before I got over my cheap self, I made him very unhappy with those pressures.

He wasn't transexual or anything.  We met in the military in our teens, and he was a martial artist of the first rank, etc.  Yet when he got around me, and felt his feelings for me, a really feminine streak shown through.  An overt effeminacy would come forward in the screwing.

After a couple of years together I grew up enough to admit that his feminine nature was one of the traits that made him so beautiful.  It was the butch cowboy in me that had the problem.  If you love someone you encourage them to be themselves."
"Sounds like she has her own demons to worry about.

"When people come out, they bring everyone out with them. It's weird to think about, because it's his life, sexuality, interests... But him coming out doesn't just change him, it changes you too. You're now the father of a gay teen.

Something I've seen a lot of, which may be what you're struggling with, is the ""he's still my son, but..."" idea. He is still your son, but a lot of the life you may have imagined for him is gone. My dad imagined me bringing home hot girls and getting married to a beautiful, smart woman and having a billion babies. That's what he thought about for my future, from the time I was born. He can't do that any more. I took that ideal future son away from him, and he had a hard time dealing with it.

(Dad's also a hardcore military republican who was raised by a racist, but he's come a long way and I'm proud of him).

The best advice I could give you is to treat your son like a normal kid. Whatever you were doing before--about school, sports, computer activities, dating--keep doing those things. Show him that he's still who he has always been, and you're still his dad. Give him the talk, explain porn, and make him keep the door open when his boyfriends are over. Do all the same stuff, just with boy-boy instead of boy-girl. You'll both be fine."
Maybe smile?
"Had sex, got drunk and texted one of my friends about how I felt like a pretty flower.

I believe he called it feminine for its fragrance; not the fact that I was using lotion.

"We're not just *gay*, we're *gay* as well!"
"I live in a small village and one of the only other gay lads here is a fucking prick. Just a rude, arrogant arsehole who used to kind of bully me when we were in primary school. Couple of years ago I called him a bellend in the pub and his friend replied that there was no need to be homophobic. I just laughed and said that I wasn't homophobic at all, and he'd be just as much of a prick if he was straight.

Finally someone asks the important questions
"You can be gay and enforce homophobia. For example, there's a famous gay Latino pageant guru that doesn't believe gay men should have the right to adopt children. Sure, that's extreme...but in a society that is founded on homophobia, it is not uncommon for us to unknowingly also push homophobia. "

"Well handled, probs to you for seeing the signs and not clinging on to something that wouldnt work and props to him for being honest and chill when u confronted him."
we just got to be grateful for these random matchups that come through our lives and accept that they can just as quickly pass by whilst another is on its way.  Don't despair over the loss. it's healthier to just fondly remember that moment and probably spend a few nights jacking off to its memory.
Sex (anal sex for gay dudes) is pretty normal at 16 tbh.  Nothing offputting about it.

Fucked a guy while music playlist was on random. Suddenly some queen comes on and for some ungodly reason I decide to start singing along with it.

It could be worse. It could of caused you to only be able to get off with shit being involved. 
Coming Out on Top is hands down the best when it comes to the sex scenes.
"First things first. Thank you so much for removing him away from a toxic mother and taking the step to move out when it couldn't have been the easiest decision. I feel like usually it's the father that takes it the worse.

You really just need to be there for him. I'm still young (20) and have never had a great relationship with my dad. He's always been quite homophobic and my mother as well, so I know I can never really come out until I'm financially stable or I'm just waiting till they die. 

I know it can be a bit weird that your son likes guys but why is it you think you feel this way? He really is no different than anyone else, he just likes guys instead of girls, which logically isn't really a big problem at all.

I wish my parents would be more understanding of gays but they're over 50 and 60 years old plus of a different culture. So there's that and the generational difference. Tbh I would just want my dad to be there for me and show he cares. Like what you're doing. You're doing great. And it's still early. If he only came out about 6 months ago then I'm sure over a bit more time you'll be completely fine.

Treat the boyfriend as any other friend. If your son wants privacy and close the door then let him do so."

"Progress is progress. He's also got a point. You can't expect him to completely change himself, especially when you knew about it going in. 

The fact he's making an effort shows how much he cares for you. "
Being hot
"Not sure if I agree with the keeping the door open thing. If the kid was younger, sure, but he's 16. It's a normal time to discover your sexuality, and privacy should be a right unless he has proven that he can't handle it.

I think it's better to have a talk with your kid about sex and being safe than him having to be sneaking around to get his privacy (as literally any 16 y.o would do). Be open with him and you'll have a great relationship with him for the rest of your life."
"The judge/jury went bananas.

Good."
"Idk, what you guys are expecting interacting the gay community the reality is, as is with any minority, there's a lot of trauma in our community. 


A lot of damaged guys damaging other guys, even when gay men don't have traumatic coming out experiences they're emotionally stunted from spending years unable to express themselves and taking on a lot of derogatory narratives that they've never explored. 


Many of us despite our trauma don't seek professional help or explore our emotional triggers and just inflict our pain, trauma, and emotional labor on other people while descending in and out of depressive spirals. We communicate through brash comments and malice (see: ""Shade."") Because we didn't have the opportunity to explore healthy romantic relationships under the watchful eye of a parent or mentor, we don't know how to support them and end up believing the whole community is incapable of love and just fuck instead.  

Then grindr just facilitates more of this undoing, many of us use quick and easy hook-ups as a drug to fill voids in our lives that ultimately stem from the trauma or loneliness of being gay, the app's format provides us the comfort and space to throw stones at others because we feel our own glass house is broken. 

You should come to the app with that perspective, that you're going to meet a lot of vulnerable, hurt, insecure people, a lot of un-declared addicts, a lot of people distant from their internal selves. Their bullshit and inconsistencies stem from a larger systemic issue of what it means to grow up and define oneself in a homophobic society. What it means to love and understand yourself in this community is to be able to navigate that with grace and also, simultaneously, be evaluate if your own desire to hook-up through grindr is steming from a pure sense of horniess or something much larger and previously unevaluated?"

Simply responding to him and giving him the chance to talk doesn‚Äôt automatically mean you have forgiven him and everything is ok. But you can give him a chance and see how it goes. Potentially having a strong relationship with your father is a pretty valuable thing. I would give him a second chance.

"I vote for letting him tell you in his own time. He'll bring it up when he's ready. He's got his own processing to do. Dropping subtle hints was my family's approach, and I found it irritating and humiliating. No one likes feeling like they're being caught out... particularly not a teenager. They're trying to form their own space, anyway. Just give him space to be a teenager in love, and leave them alone. When he's ready, he'll say something. When he does, accept him. Avoid: ""I've known all along,"" or ""duh,"" or ""finally!"" or ""Oh, man! That's so cool! Yay!"" or even ""You do you, bro... we just want you to be happy."" All of that rings hollow. You can have the ""we knew for years"" conversation in a couple of years when he's got his own foundations built.

Just: ""Okay, cool. Thanks for telling me."" and give him a hug, and then let him steer the conversation. If he's got more to say, let him say it, and just listen and be receptive ‚Äî work hard to keep him in the driver's seat of the conversation. It's his story, he gets to tell it. Not you. You can smile, and nod, and use short sentences to encourage him and make it safe for him, but don't take over with your own opinions. It's not about you.

If that's all he needs to say, then let that be for now ‚Äî the rest of the conversation will happen later. You're doing him a solid by not forcing him to make a big production out of it. Trust me."

"Hi, Gay Dad to Straight Son here.

&gt;What I struggle with is the fact that I don't like that he's gay. 

I need to level with you for a minute. ""I don't feel disgusted"", ""I feel embarrassed"" ""Yet I get it's not a choice though.""  All of these statements point to a level of shame. In some circles people might use the term ""homophobia"" to describe it, but in general, you are not able to accept his orientation or be proud of him because of your values or feelings. You need to get into a safe environment with a counselor who can help you accept the reality and fact of your Son's orientation and reconcile it with your emotional value system that is causing you shame, embarrassment and to hide how you feel from your Son. 

You see, until you work on you, you will continue to feel the way you do. You realize how conflicted you are, and attempt to insulate him from your value judgments by withholding information. You will know you are good when you feel pride that he is a good valuable human and it doesn't matter how he identifies his sexuality. 

On being a good Father. 

You are ***HIS FATHER*** no one else can do that job. No one else can take your place, For you to have done the things you have done to keep him mom from being allowed to hurt him is HUGE. No one else can do all of that for him. 

Boyfriends crashing....a teen boy may get frisky from time to time and that isn't really a hard stop, but the home isn't a flop house for him to bring home his live in boyfriend either. You exercise the same rules for straights and gays under the roof. If it's an open door, fine. go with that, and if they get frisky under a blanket maybe they will keep it quiet and not let you find out about it. 

I would allow his boyfriends to crash from time to time, but not live there. 

You loving him is all you really have to get right. FOOD, CLOTHING, A PARENT WHO LOVES HIM, SHELTER, there really isn't anything else kids need. 

If he questions you about your feelings about him being gay, just tell him, ""I am glad you are happy with who you are, I am happy with who I am"".  If he presses the issue you can always say this, ""Hey, Dad's still working some of that out, but I can tell you bub, I love you and that don't change"". 

Also I will tell you this. You may need some time to figure all this out, take what time you need, go to counseling, get it right. Think about this....He had the same value system. He had to make the decision to try to accept this as well and also try to turn shame and embarrassment into respect and self identity. 

Keep advocating for him, the two of you can win over her trying to force him into being someone else. I also have to tell you, my mother took it very hard, and my dad stood mute. They sent me to ex gay therapy, where I learned to hate myself for being me. By the time I was 23, I was married and having a son!!! By the time I was 26 I was getting divorced and had attempted suicide twice over not being able to be straight. 

You have made the right moves. Keep your focus on the basics, Err on the side of caution, treat the boyfriends the same way you treat girlfriends, and let him try to fill in the blanks. Good Luck DAD, thanks for doing your best...I PROMISE YOU, none of us are perfect, YOU ARE DOING FINE.

"Not my story, but the ex boyfriend of a friend. We all went to a gay bar together because my friend and his ex are still on really good terms. All of us are from ages 21-23. Some older gentleman (I use the term loosely) offers to buy my friends ex a drink. He politely declines. The man instructs the bartender to send the drink over anyways (sidenote: did not know people actually did that), and my friends ex again says no. 20~ mins later, we step out for a cigarette. The man shortly follows, and confronts my friends ex, talking about how he saw him on Grindr, started talking about the things he wanted to do with him, etc. A drag queen eventually chased the man away, but it was a full 10/10 on the cringe scale.

In retrospect, I'm sooooooooooooooo sorry this happen to you.

Don't be passive about this. Get bar video, blast his fucking face. If you let this go, it will be a  continually cycle of him continually doing it to the next victim. If there is no video, then blast the bar, an establishment is not allowed federally to allow this behavior. They can get fines and potentially shut down for turning away people in need, allowing bar fights, allowing patrons of this kind, etc.

"It's a very old porn thing : the cum shot is the ""moneyshot"", the proof, what in the 70' maked the difference between an erotic movie (where you don't see genitals) and a porn one. It stayed, and the cumshot itself is still something exciting for a lot of people. That said, i doubt that ""cum on face"" was a thing in bed before an all generation saw it in porn videos...

And yes, i prefer see guys cum inside (mouth or ass, doesn't matter), and see sex ending in a deep embrace. You can have that in ""creampie"" video (where people cum inside, althought you will often have a big closup on the asshole leaking after, which is kind of yucky). Also in some ""breeding / breeder"" categories, I suppose."

"I was the gay guy that married a woman because I wasn‚Äôt ready to come out. She and I are friends now and I got a son out of it, so I don‚Äôt necessarily regret it, but I would never want someone else to experience the pain I put my ex wife through. Really, at the end of the day, whether he is gay or not is irrelevant. You shouldn‚Äôt marry him or stay with him if you don‚Äôt feel satisfied or completely trust his intentions. You deserve to feel completely committed to and cherished, and so does he. Don‚Äôt end things because he might be gay, end things because you aren‚Äôt getting what you need. Let him sort out any feelings he has on his own terms. "
"You gotta read the room. Some guys want to be used as a cumdump and then tossed aside.  Others want to get their rocks off too.  If you mix them up, you're going to have a pissed off bottom on your hands (or at least a very dissappointed one).

"I had a friend who was young and attractive in an Aryan way.  He was sitting in a bar one afternoon after a hard day and this gross old Greek guy say next to him and struck up conversation.  My friend grunted out a few answers over about 15 minutes or so before the guy makes his move, asking my friend to go home with him.  For a laugh my friend decided to shut this guy down and get rid of him, so without even making eye contact he says ""It'll be $200.""

Instead of slinking away, the guy shouts (in a very quiet bar)
#YOU ARE WHORE?! I WOULD NOT GIVE YOU 2 CENTS YOU DIRTY WHORE!!

"Completely anecdotal, just personal experience: straight men are uncomfortable with *anything* that might make them rethink their idea of masculinity. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why that is, but my guess is that they have an idea of what being a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù entails and fucking women plays a huge part in that. You can see it clearly with straight guys who have trouble getting laid. Many feel emasculated, like they‚Äôre not ‚Äúman enough‚Äù because they‚Äôre not fucking women.

Likewise, I think they have a lot of issues with regards to handling feelings, their own emotions and the emotions of others, because they (and we, I‚Äôm guessing most of us!) grew up with the whole ‚Äúboys don‚Äôt cry‚Äù nonsense, and with the idea that being sensitive or kind or sweet is ‚Äúgirly‚Äù and therefore bad. 

That‚Äôs probably the reason why so many men, both gay and straight, are uncomfortable with feminine guys. It fucks with their idea of what it is to be a man. That‚Äôs probably the root cause of transphobia too, for cis men and women alike. How do I know that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù if a person who isn‚Äôt biologically male is also a man? How do I know that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúreal man‚Äù if that girly guy is also a man?

Last but not least: at least some of them are probably bisexual or curious and terrified/grossed out, and our existence as out gay men makes them wonder ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù, which they *really* don‚Äôt want to do.

Edit: this is probably why ‚Äúman products‚Äù exist. Like soap FOR MEN!!! BIG MANLY SOAP!! and other stuff like that. I saw a sponge or a loofah thing or something the other day that was ‚Äúfor men‚Äù and it was literally labeled ‚Äúshower tool‚Äù. SHOWER TOOL. Come the fuck *on* it‚Äôs a SPONGE lol"
"The worst news any parent can hear is that their child committed suicide, due to not being able to be himself.  I'm glad you came out, how they handle the issue is there problem, not yours. I'm glad your brother was there for you."

"First off, great on you for getting your son out of that situation. To address some points: 

&gt;He certainly doesn't have any stereotypical gay qualities.

Most gay guys don't, people just notice the few that do. Everyone knows far more gay people than they realize. 

&gt;His mother took it extremely hard. She didn't and still doesn't have anything positive to say about it.

She's going to have to get over it. Her anger is the exact equivalent of hating her sons eye color, hair color, height, etc. He didn't choose to be gay, that was determined by hormone levels in the womb before he was born. Just like she didn't choose to be straight, he didn't choose to be gay. If she values a relationship with her son she will need to learn to put aside her anger. 

&gt;Didn't want him on the wrestling team anymore or playing rugby. His two favourite things which he is extremely talented at.

Thats just awful. I hope you're still letting him play. Sports doesn't make someone gay/straight. 

&gt;What I struggle with is the fact that I don't like that he's gay. It's a feeling I don't really know how to describe. I guess in a way I feel embarrassed? I don't feel disgusted by the idea of it. Maybe I just find it a bit weird. It's something I don't understand. I get that it's not a choice though, which is why I would never verbalize any of these feelings to my son. I love him more than anything. I want him to love himself too.

Honestly your discomfort could stem from the fact you're just not used to being around it. Many gay people (myself included) were weirded out the first time we saw two guys kiss. Its just startling if you're not used to seeing it. 

&gt;Do I just treat the guy like he was any other friend my son brings over?

Personally I would. Your son is being open and honest with you by the sounds of it which is really good. Banning him will just cause him to be sneaky or go else where.  I would also make sure there is always condoms available. I know parents don't like to think about their kids having sex but everyones kids are having sex and having access to protection is important as STDs are higher in the gay community.

The fact that he trusts you enough to bring his boyfriend around is a huge deal. I know married guys that still haven't told their parents they're gay (and married to a dude). 

&gt;What are things your parents did to help you? What are things you wished they'd done?

Time for a long one: 

I grew up in an ultra conservative area. I was taught constantly that being gay was a choice, and that gays would all die of AIDS and burn in hell for eternity because ""Jesus loves them."" This had deep effects on me when I hit puberty. Other guys around me were noticing girls and going absolutely insane over them. I didn't get what the fuss was about and figured I was just a late bloomer. At the same time I found myself extremely attracted to certain guys and I couldn't figure out why. I rationalized in my head that I just wanted to be like them, I didn't realize I was having crushes. 

Fast forward a few years and the realization I was gay hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt sick to my stomach and contemplated suicide since I was brainwashed all my life to believe I was going to hell anyway for it. I hate goodbye notes written and everything. Then by a stroke of luck I moved out of my horrible hometown and somewhere completely different. Suddenly being gay didn't matter to anyone. I met openly gay people who were open about it in public for the first time. I suddenly felt way better about myself, my horrible depression over being gay was for the most part, gone. I built up an entire life surrounded by straight and gay friends, and my family is no part of it. 

For you see, they're still VERY anti-gay, so they know nothing about me. They've never met any of the guys I've dated, they know nothing of any of the ski trips I take, the beach vacations I go on, or my trips to the south pacific. They know none of my friends, have seen none of my pictures for the past 14 years, and literally don't even know me as a person. They know my ""straight"" persona I front to them. They think I work all day and come home and play video games and that's my life. They know nothing of the rich social life I've built up for myself and probably won't ever and it's all because I know they'll never change their ways. 

Had they had been more supportive of gay people while I was growing up (or now), I wouldn't feel the need to hide my entire life from them, and although I don't value their opinion on the subject I don't feel like dealing with the nonsense that will come with them finding out so I keep it secret. They're getting older now and are just simply not a major part of my life because long ago I learned to live for me. We all have one life and I'm not about to hate myself any longer because of someones nonsensical religious beliefs. 

I'm not even remotely the only one like this. I know many guys who do the exact same thing. Your wife is going to likely find this out the hard way if she doesn't change her tune. You'll be the only proxy by which she learns about her sons life. 

Gay people are just people. They're just attracted to the same sex vs the opposite sex. It's no more extraordinary than someone being left handed, religious types just make it out to be.

"Grindr is a hookup app. Nobody gives a shit about personality on there because they‚Äôre all just looking for cock or ass, not a relationship.

"Yes and no. The hole stretching is a physical sensation you can pinpoint. The insides feel a bite more like your being like *filled up*. It‚Äôs harder to describe but it has like maybe a dull but warm feeling throughout your torso. When they get really deep it becomes less dull.

"My boyfriend and I had been together for nine years, and had talked about marriage on and off for a while. There was no big romantic proposal (not our style!) and we just decided now or never.

We had a tiny ceremony with only four guests (my mother, her husband, boyfriends mother and his sister). This was mainly due to family politics and bullshit we wanted to avoid. And we‚Äôre both pretty low key, so big wedding was never going to suit us. We wore suits - not matching - and no tie. Very casual. Had a few of our favourite songs played at the end of the ceremony whilst our family took photos.

We went for a meal afterwards at a lovely French restaurant we know, then went to a few bars and got steadily drunk. We ended the night in a dive gay bar we know with his sister. And the day was just perfect üòÄ"
"&gt; We are together for almost a half of a year, now we are living together for 3 weeks

So what we are really talking about is that you have been seeing each other for about 5 months, and you moved in at around the 5 month mark.

"Male sex with other males is a TABOO in our society. 

You may not realize that because being a gay person it just seems so very natural. 

Our society and culture (USA) gives us messages about the worth of males who have sex with other males. It is taught by example that it is ""wrong"" and that it is ""nasty"" and that it is ""shameful"" and that it is ""against nature"". 

They never challenge that teaching or belief. Every gay man does, and usually very early as they seek to stimulate their bodies and minds. "
"I offered one room in my apartment in one of those roommate websites and I got a message from a guy that was interested.

"When I was in college I used to take the subway to and from class most days. I was followed, at night, twice by two creeps. One of which actually followed me to my car, reached inside and grabbed my inner thigh and one of my balls. He straight up asked ‚Äúdo you want to fuck? I think we should fuck, you have such a nice body and you are such a cute boy.‚Äù (He was like 200+ lbs muscle bear beefy dude) It all happened so fast in like 2 seconds. I didn‚Äôt even know what to think or say..I just said no and got the fuck out of there. 

After that, sitting in LA traffic for 3 hours and paying $20 a day to park seemed fucking perfect in comparison. Even though I was always broke. 

I remember that same year some dude that was either on meth or crack would come into the store I worked at and just stare at me for like 1-2 hours every few days. After doing that for a few weeks he came in spun out one time and was demanding to know what my price was and all this humiliating sexual shit in front of a lot of customers and employees. My boss told him I wasn‚Äôt for sale and to gtfo üòÇ‚úäüèº she‚Äôs the real mvp. "

He and I don't ever talk about being gay or gay subjects, but he's fairing well.

So, after a party, someone wouldn't ask me ""Who was that feminine guy at you New Year's Party?""  It would be ""Who was that cute guy in the rabbit fur coat?"" Or ""Who was the guy that sat on the couch all night telling jokes?"" The ""feminine"" descriptor would never have come up.

The gay community isn't a hivemind, thank god. We do all have our own interests, and pursue them often by ourselves. When we want to be together it's expressed in clubs and bars often. We're typical men, really, in that regard. A ""night out"" when with others, the Mancave for when by ourselves.

We wouldn't be in bars and clubs every day. I know a group of bears who go to a movie together once in a while. Superheroes. Comedies. They're guys. 

In my experience, friends with benefits &amp; open relationships are very common. I don't really like it. There are many monogamous gay men though. Again, we're like all other men in that regard.

"I'm vers and I personally think that people who pure top, while of course a valid preference, are missing out on an opportunity to understand exactly what's going on on the other end when they're smashing me bloody and thinking they're doing a great job. The first time you have that happen to you is a real eyeopener...

To start with: no ramming it straight in and smashing away at the speed of a jackhammer. Give me time to open up a bit, finger me a bit first even better. I'm not that into the fingering but I appreciate that it opens me up before the main event.

Put your dick in slowly for goodness sake, do a bit, wait for me to say to continue. If I know I can take it then I'll grab your legs and pull you into me, so don't worry about going too slow because I know how to move things along.

Once you're in, don't then go from gear 1 to gear 5 in three seconds flat. Build up. If you go straight to 100mph then my arse is gonna protest and then I'm not having any fun and you'll be seeing the end of your fun pretty soon. Literally go through all the gears of speed. Start with shallow thrusts, get deeper as we move up the gears. You don't have to spend five minutes at each speed, just don't skip 'em.

Listen to me. I know it can feel good for a top regardless of whatever's going on for the bottom, so what I'm telling you is to make my experience better. You can listen to it or we can stop having sex, you choose. It's still gonna feel good for you either way.

There're other things, but these are the basics in my opinion."

"The car accident when I was 17, which left me permanently injured, was less of an accident and something closer to a suicide attempt."

Well that‚Äôs just sad "
You were just gay sweetie. 
Screen shots and go to the police now
"I went on vacation to Miami last year. I was with my much more attractive friend who constantly gets hit on. I was in the process of losing weight and a little overweight at the time; something I was extremely self-conscious about it. With that in mind, we decide to check out Haulover Beach. It‚Äôs a nude beach open to everyone but had a gay section. 

Neither my friend nor I got nude but we did go shirtless. As usual, my friend was getting approached by dudes checking him out and flirting while I sat in the sun. 

Eventually, this attractive, athletic guy comes up to where we‚Äôre sitting and eye-fucks the shit out of me. I was a little weirded out because I‚Äôm definitely not used to that type of attention. 

He asks me if he could sit next to me, introduces himself and asks me for a hug. Whatever. I‚Äôm on vacation. I give him a bro hug and it wasn‚Äôt good enough for him. He proceeded to tell me that‚Äôs not how you hug and then pulls me into him and literally squeezes my love handles with both hands and holds on like he‚Äôs been missing them for awhile. It was fucking awkward. 

I think he could tell I was uncomfortable. So he sits down and pulls a full size key lime pie out of his beach bag and offers me the whole thing. He doesn‚Äôt want any of it. I decline and he asks why. He asks if I‚Äôm trying to lose weight (which I legitimately was and have done since then). He tells me how foolish it would be because he loves chubby guys. Not only was his entire approach an instant turn off, it was like a kick to the ego because I had actually lost a decent amount of weight prior to that point as well. 

He sat directly next to me for about a half hour relentlessly offering me pie and asking for hugs. Eventually, he went into the water and I told my friend it was time to go. 

It was simultaneously the first and oddest time I‚Äôve been hit on. "
The psychological definition is ‚Äúthirsty.‚Äù
I stole +$20 worth in YuGiOh cards from a friend when I was like 9 and it still haunts me
"For me, it's a numbers game. Generously, 1/10 guys are gay, which means for every gay guy I like, I like 9 straight guys."
"&gt; hoping that its like this every time

If by ""like this"" you mean the emotional rush of your first sexual encounter, then no, it's not going to be like that every time; and that's a good thing, b/c you'd probably explode. :)  

&gt; I would hate to have it become ""normal""

What will probably become normal is being confident and comfortable about being with a man. And that's a good thing, any way you slice it.

You were lucky enough to have your first time be a cathartic, comforting, guilt-free, *affirming* experience. For now, just revel in that. And resolve, sometime in the future, to pay it forward."
they're awesome and i'm jealous.
I had a homebuilding program when I was 14. What a weird kid I was. 
"Yeah I did, he ended up saying on the date that at 88Kg, I was fatass.

On a brigther note since that I've dropped to 64Kg, so fuck him."
"lol thanks for this. I get ""untrained"" bottoms coming to me because I'm hung but when it comes to it they cant take me and they should have swum with smaller fish first. I hate all this ""size matters"" crap. I like getting fucked by smaller guys because it hits my gspot better. "
"I would also include talking about your roommate excessively. I went on a date last week and he talked more about his roommate than himself. I understand people have roommates, but it can come across as a relationship regardless if the roommate is a girl or boy. "
"If he's turned off by you because of your mom, he's not the one."

"I‚Äôm sure various types are available, but I I‚Äôm in the UK and I use Holland &amp; Barrett Fibre Formula and am equally pleased with the results. It‚Äôs konjac fibres rather than psyllium, but it does the same thing. 

It‚Äôs in a red container in the digestive health section and it‚Äôs got pictures of raspberries on it because apparently it also contains ‚Äúraspberry ketones‚Äù whatever they are.
The biggest issue I have is that H&amp;B always stock it right next to two or three other products in identical bottles so you have to read the label carefully!"
"You're talking to both but haven't gone on a date with either yet? In that case, I think you should've gone on the date with both of them. You're not in a relationship with either of them, more getting to know each other. At the very least I think you should've gone on a first date with both of them and see who you connected with more. "
I‚Äôd vote for subtle hints or showing that you‚Äôre cool with other gay people. Instill a feeling that he‚Äôs accepted and when he‚Äôs ready you will be there for him.
"Yes. Two chicks that I didn‚Äôt know were gay. They thought I was hitting on them (I wasn‚Äôt). I was surprised to learn they werr a course le. Then they said I was another dumb straight guy who couldn‚Äôt tell they were together and ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok puppy, you go sniff around somewhere else‚Äù. "
"What generation are you from? In the past people used words like ""butch"" and ""nelly"", or ""macho"" and ""sissy"", or ""trade"" and ""camp"", but they meant the same things. "

"I‚Äôve previously dated girls and I think that dating a guy is so much more relaxed. Might just be the girls I‚Äôve been with but everything has to be organised, when we‚Äôre meeting, what we‚Äôre doing, but with a guy you just go with the flow. It‚Äôs like having a mate you fuck basically"
"On the subway, well, I wouldn't call it flirting so much as sexually harassing me? So I'm sitting near the back of the car, when dude comes up and sits across from me. There're maybe 4 other people in the same car, further away. He gives me the usual dude nod, I reciprocate. I'm looking away, but I can tell he's grabbing his junk. When I get up to exit the car, I can see that his dick is hard, and the head is sticking out from his waistband. I'm staring off into the distance, and all of a sudden I felt his hard dick against my ass. At the exact moment the doors opened up and I bolted out the door. The dude was PLASTERED and smelled of puke. This is the shit that happens when you ride the subway thru West Village at 4am.  "
I'm bi in the sense that I find both genders attractive but I usually just call myself gay because I like guys slightly more and you also don't get questioned or judged as much. Many bi people I know simply call themselves gay to save the time.
Wait...wait...whoa...back up there sport.  You got fucked 3 different times over 5 hours??  You nasty ass ho!!!   Umm...can I get your number?  :-) 
"I have a non-contageous skin condition that makes patches of my skin fade to the most un-tan white you can imagine. Unfortunately it's only on my dick. It's actually kinda cool but I just assume most people will think it's an STD. Imagine a cheetah's spots but white. That's my dick.

If people don't like it, whatever. If people like it though, haaaay."
"I get the fantasy, but the thought of having sex with my brother literally makes me want to puke.

the guy proposing a 3-way would have to be Chris Pratt irl for me to not instantly block him."
"I could say having a dick up my ass is pretty much as gay as you can get, but it lacks a certain poetry. I'll go with being at the New York Pride parade, taking pictures with a gay Stormtrooper with my boyfriend, wielding a tiny rainbow flag in one hand. Pretty gay!"
I would feel nothing. I'm in the same boat.
I want to do the same &gt;&lt; soon I will have lived 21 years without touching any other man's butt or dick T-T
"These are some few things remaining uncrossed on my list:

* blow a celebrity

* have sex on the rooftop of a skyscraper

* fuck on a plane (only hj and bj so far)

And here are some that I've already crossed out of my list: 

* being bottom in a DP

* getting fucked in front of strangers

* gym sex

* watch SO getting banged"
Have your face in your main picture. Problem solved. 
"Um, why are you still dating this person?  I don't care how much money someone makes, you still contribute to the damn household at the end of the day.

Break up with his ass."
You'll have to get past it.  Sadly it's just a risk you take in doing anal.  This is what condoms are for.  
It‚Äôs just shit. Like take a shower. You‚Äôll live. 
"&gt; but in a society that is founded on homophobia, it is not uncommon for us to unknowingly also push homophobia.

Or knowingly, whether closeted or not.

I usually don't volunteer my sexual orientation to most people from break, but I would be quick to if a gay guy accused me of homophobia. 

""I don't hate you because you're gay. I'm gay. I hate you because you're an obnoxious fucking creep!"""
"Love him in silence. Love him fully. What else is your duty? Love him and laugh at him. He has the whole world to come out to, not just you. Just be his island. Tell him to bring him. To dinner to the movies, to ANYTHING! Bring him. Love his love. "
Real men do what makes them happy
A mess. 
Ew gross. No homo.
"&gt; feeling dick whipped by a nice slab of meat is one of the joys of being gay.

damn that's a hot phrase. and completely true"
"I once heard this one but won't be able to credit the author:

*People think bottoming is gayer than topping but it's the contrary. In order to top you need to feel horny about what you're about to do. You need to get hard so that it'll work out. Bottoming, on the other hand, doesn't require being aroused (read: hard), nor does sucking a dick.*

Super creepy and rapey if you ask me but not entirely wrong."
This reminds of a time when my boyfriend and I were out holding hands and we did a double take when we realized we'd passed another gay couple holding hands. They did the same thing at about the same time which lead to a semi awkward moment of both couples staring at each other as we headed our own ways.
This is so fucking cute I‚Äôm gonna die of jealousy.
"Yikes. I‚Äôm really, really sorry to hear that it all went down like this. In this world, as queer people, privacy is all we‚Äôve really got. That safety blanket, is so important to us because we sometimes don‚Äôt really know how the world is going to react to us. Invasions of privacy are never okay and when you couple that with having written down your deepest, most sincere feelings, it can be even more devastating. It‚Äôs 100% okay to feel what you‚Äôre feeling in this moment. How you deal with what you‚Äôre feeling is going to be the real test.

I spent the majority of my college life as a leader in the queer community, coming across literally thousands of queer students with different backgrounds and stories.  Throughout my time, I met so many people who believed ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù to be unfair, rightly so. The coming out process is something that is uniquely ours and no one should be able to take that away from us. Sometimes, though, things don‚Äôt go as planned. 

I think it‚Äôs very important to start the process of transitioning from feeling hurt and betrayed to finding your stride again. You didn‚Äôt get to come out the way you wanted to, but you get to love your life the way you want to."

Yeah nothing is a bigger turn off than watching a guy who doesn‚Äôt seem like he‚Äôs enjoying himself at all. 
"I.... I don't even know where to begin...


First, use even more lube than you were using.

Second, ease it in! "
"Like, everything. 

I just wanna get fucked in a stairwell somewhere."
Pretty often. Drunk me has no shame.
The romances are also really sweet. I need an Ian or Brad in my life.
"I was at a bar with some friends and an older guy came up and started flirting with me. I think he could tell I wasn't really interested and then in what I assume was a last ditch effort, he ended up showing me a picture of his very newborn baby. I was speechless."
Being hypnotized into a dudes sex slave. I don't consider hypnosis to be real and it's definitely kinda icky ethically.
