"Just remember this, they have failed you. Not the other way round. Parents are supposed to love their kids unconditionally. Your parents would rather stick to their prejudices than love their son, so what does that say about them as people.

A rough time for sure, but remember you boyfriend loves you. All the best man"
It’s YOUR car! You don’t have to to let anyone borrow it.
I feel like it’s one of those things where it’s only hot during sexy-times
I want an update on this tomorrow -_-
“Peacefully jerking off”
"Also:

"Whatever you do, don’t sneak a fuck at the BBQ!"
"I hope you accepted his offer to get a lock ;-)

And good luck with telling the rest of your family. "
It disables the security features.
"Sorry I'm bad at advice, but I would watch this movie ;)"
"As others have said, depends on the circumstances. If we're laying on the couch and you spit in my mouth I'm gonna be pretty disturbed. If you have me with my legs over your shoulders and I'm a writhing mess, then you can do anything you want to me."
"Hey man Im really sorry youre going through this . I know it might feel like you did something wrong and its deffinately shitty being cut out like you were. That said, people deal with grief and illness very differently. It is entirely possible that your boyfriend is really struggling with his situation and just unable to share that experience with you. People dont usually like having loved ones watch them suffer. While it will be hard do, do your best not to take it personally."
Fuck man you just made me realize that my family is pinning it on me because they don't want to trouble themselves...
"Yep. An ex fuck buddy of mine. Quite the dick he was, with quite the dick.

I think he had issues with his sexuality, because pretty much as soon as he would cum he’d boot me out the door. Closeted bi with a dose of shame about liking men.

But damn it was good sex."

And then his gaping maw falls wider and the morning breath of a dragon with rotting corpses between his teeth wafts out...and I turn over and gasp into my pillow wishing for a hazardous chemical mask.
"That's right, it's so simple right? 

But my sister is such a narcissistic manipulator that she keeps pressuring everyone into pressuring me. 

No fucking shame at all. "
"I had a fuckbud whose dick was legitimately as thick as my wrist and and 9 inches long.  He absolutely knew how to use it.  He was beefy and hairy and handsome and bearish and..:

A complete fucking twat.  What little personality he had was directed towards being mean to people.  He literally never texted back unless he was “looking”.  Sometimes it was a week later.  Sometimes a year.

But damn if the sex was good. Like, leave your ass sore and throbbing good.  Like, I still jerk off thinking of him.  

I’d love to be one of these queens who says they got what the came for and the treatment didn’t affect them.  TBH the experience just made me feel really bad.  I’d say the experience was a net negative.  Yeah, the sex was mind blowing but it was inconsistent and left me feeling worse about myself.  If I could do it over again, I probably wouldn’t, and even in casual sex I’ve become more dismissive of guys who are jerks.  Just because you’re not settling down with someone doesn’t mean you don’t deserve respect."
"Because this is the first meeting... A humble piece of advice.  Play it cool, and no PDA's aside from a pat on the back or a hand on the shoulder for a moment.  Let them get a sense that gay people are chill like everyone else.  I promise this will go a long way in building the foundation of your relationship and your boyfriends relationship with them.

Make sure your boyfriend talks with them about his major or work or where he grew up. Let them see the interesting and charming guy he is.  Let them see the sophisticated badult hebis. Eventually they will change their view of same sex couples and, perhaps the world."
Shitoris is worse.
"...violently, furiously, masturbating through my bloody blistered mess of a penis when my dad came in..."
"Tell all those ""everyone's"" to let them borrow their cars! Or chip in for a rental!!  And when they say, they can't qualify to rent a car, then say ""Ta da! That's just the point!"""
The gay term is houseboy.
"Playin nice got you nowere and so you hafta play th devil now. Walk round yer place without a shirt on and loose shorts, rubbin yer abs sumtimes stretchin like a lazy cat, do pushups, crunches etc til your hot and sweaty in front of him. Flirt with sum visitor friends but treat him nicely aftr, be moody and distant one day but nohomo cuddly and afectionate the next. Nuthin fukks with a guy more like playin him hot and cold. Tell im yer shoulder, arm, etc hurts cuz youve been trainin hard and have him masage it. And yeah continue to wressle him so he can feel up yer bod and feel dem gainz too. Would drive yer poor bro crazy lol 

Cunfuse him, make him think bout you always til you know he cant take it anymore. Then one night drink togethr in yer room but dont make the first move. Make sure his drunk too so he has an excuse fer himself then take of yer shirt cuz you feel hot. Tell him you like him so much and you trust him and then act like your very drunk and helpless then wait fer him go to town on you. Now you got him in th bag. Level 2 is much more exciting cuz now you have his yuuuge guilt to play with. So many ways to skin this kitty it aint so much fun cuz its too easy"
"""It's okay to cry"""
"You may grow to resent him. 

I lived with a bf for almost a year and I would go to bed and he’d be playing video games in the living room and when I woke up to go to the gym or to work he’d still be playing video games. He would sleep all day and I’d come home exhausted and hungry and he’d ask me to order food because he was hungry and of course had no money (we had food in the apartment that he could have cooked but he always waited for me to come home because he knew I’d be too tired to cook and would order food). 

I cleaned up after him and kept telling him to clean up, get a job, etc. After a while it felt like I was his daddy (and not in the good way). Seeing him like this was a complete turnoff and I couldn’t be intimate with someone I felt I was parenting. So I kicked him out to live with his actual daddy - who was also paying his share of the rent - which he spent on weed and video games. 

Run now. "
"One of the top 5 best sex I’ve ever had was a guy who was below average. He just knew how to really work it, it’s not just about the penetration. "
"Oh come now, it's just long range kissing."
Well let me just consult my underwear... yes something moved. So yes hot. 
So you *were* the bitch then... 
Because god wanted you to hit the prostate while fucking missionary style. 
He said this is disgusting and if I am trying to draw attention this is the wrong way to do it.
Thank you for coming
"Some people may just be using this as a means to reach out and befriend you, thinking this is the best way or they don't know any better.  Just let them know you're probably not the best for that type of advice but you still want to be friends.  And the mom might be reaching out as a way of letting you know her daughter really needs a friend, or as a way of letting you know she's an ally (which is always good to have).  But not gonna lie, that one's a little weird.

Regardless, communication is always key in all relationships, be it platonic or romantic.  Just talk to them and let them know.  If they're quality people, they'll be cool with it and you'll have made a friend."
"My husband is a ""house husband"" as he puts it. It started due to health issues and we just continued it once we settled into it. It works fairly well most of the time. The only issue is when he decides to take on some huge projecct, then wants me to join in after I have worked all week. I am like ugh... I am exhausted can we not just sleep and relax! LOl"
You’re 24.  To most people in society you are *also* a “kid”.  It’s not that pedo-ish.
"Glad that turned out a lot better than you were dreading. :)

And, when I lived at home with the Dads, I always locked my door to my room when I jerked it. "
Everybody has become more gay in the last ten years. 
"Goodbye, Asshole. "
"I used to have dinner parties with a huge group of friends.  The age range was anywhere from 25-65.  I'd say it was 50/50 of gay/straight couples.

One night we were all drunk sitting around the table sharing stories.  One of our older drunk friends, confused, decides to *loudly* ask, **""Well, I just don't get it!  The butt doesn't self-lubricate?  Can you use crisco for lube?!**

Her husband was pissed but we all fell out.  I haven't laughed that hard probably ever.  Why was her first guess crisco butter????"
I love waking up next to your boyfriend too.
"In high school I became fuck buddies up with a closet bi hockey player with a girlfriend because I was a hormonal teenager and the only out gays in my school were pretty fem and he was the only one I could find that was my type. I was desperate. I ended up breaking it off after guilt took over me becauseI realized I'd hate to be cheated on and it wasn't fair to her. 

I am 22 now and they are still together. My conscience still haunts me sometimes today because they are still together and she thinks he was loyal throughout. "
"Literally me staring at this muscular hunk in my class, all I wanna do is pull his pants down, suck his dick and take turns fucking each other "
I mean...I wouldn't be opposed to it. I can stay home all day and game and exercise and clean! I do housework and can cook a mean breakfast! But no kids. 
"Same. I prefer to know someone first.

If I just up and fucked some stranger, my insecurities would get in the way of my enjoyment. With someone I know, I'd be comfortable."
"Oh my god, I'm not the only person who does this?"
No. Ride his dick and eat it like it’s just another fixin at the bbq. Thank me later. 
Tell her to write an essay on the struggle of homosexual men throughout American history. If she gets an A\+ maybe you'll consider it. Time to educate her ignorant arse. 
"Yup. Had an asshole neighbor, the kind of guy who would steal your parking spot and put his garbage in your can. Found him on Grindr and hate fucked him a few times until he and his wife had a kid and moved out."
"Nah, I'm a very average 5'10 and I've topped guys taller than you. You like what you like, no need to analyze or justify it.

Edited because short guys were triggered."
Someone bitched you out for bringing something that you need to help you walk? Fuck that guy. Never allow anybody to demean you that way. 
It wasn’t an enjoyable experience but I’m gland you came
/r/wowthanksimcured
"Wow, even him... I'm really, really sorry to hear that! Do you have any plans? Will you stay with your boyfriend or...? 

Either way, maybe it's better this way. They're very toxic people and you don't need them in your life, as much as your love for them might say otherwise.

I hope everything goes well and that you'll be able to cope with it all eventually!"
Your dad was a bit of an idiot. He was a 16 year old boy once he knows what your doing at that time. If he's anything like my dad we just didn't speak about it ever again and acted like normal. 
"That’s just a mix of rating him so highly and not rating yourself highly enough.
I’m sure it’s a common feeling but I wouldn’t worry about it.
If he’s with you, that’s all that matters."
"Well, just know that you have a family right here, one that will support you through thick and thin, one that will always love you, and one that will never question who you are. 

Life sucks, hopefully everybody here can make it just a little bit better."
"This was actually how I was outed, but it was my brother. After he interrupted, he went back to his room, I messaged him asking if he saw anything on my screen and he said no but he knew I was gay anyway because he once saw my tinder matches. He was just waiting till I come out myself and that he'd support me when it came to telling my mam and dad. Good luck dude, I hope it goes as equally as well for you as it did for me! "
"Only you really know the situation. Everyone here is going to say ""no"" unless they're a fantasy whore that wants to see your follow up post. Do what you want. Just know that there may be severe consequences, or none at all."
"Do not let drug dealers use your car.  Ever.  Drug dealers tend to use other people's cars when dealing so that if they get caught, it's not their car that gets forfeited to the state.  

Also, if he misplaced some drugs in your car, good luck explaining that if it were ever found by police.
"
"I will stay with my boyfriend, yes."
"Fuck that mate! 

Send them a link to the nearest hire car place they'll get the idea.

You are TOTALLY in the right."
"I was once asked in a very joking manner if I'm the Lucy or the Ethel in the bedroom. I'm guessing Ethel would be the top, but I really don't know."
That I find all men attractive. 
I thought it was all about the size of a man's wallet?
He couldn't even microwave food for himself? That's pathetic.
You just need to find someone as ugly as you are. There are plenty of ugly fish in the sea. 
"It comes from porn. The more muscular and larger guy dominates the twink. 

Real life is different, and you have your preferences. Anyone super surprised hasn't had a lot of real experience "
"Yup I flatly told her, ""Sorry we're not close enough."" "
"Haha GL =) 
Advice: just own it and start the conversation like hey dad don't you knock.. ? Just be for you enter the car. Eager to know how it went "
How's your wife?
I didn't. I tripped him on the way past me and made him spill his drink. As a bonus the bartender saw it and I'm pretty sure he got charged for my next drink.
My bf and I trade roles as far as this goes. In everyday life outside of the house he's definitely the more dominant guy who would protect me. He's ex-military and well trained. In law enforcement. I'm more vulnerable due to medical issues. At home he enjoys me being more in control and dominant. I'm generally the big spoon and he feels safe and protected in my arms. It's definitely a balance and it has worked very well for us so far. I love our dynamic. 
It's bussy. Get it right.
Wellllll if he's adopted.....and he's an adult who consented so not much wrong here
"People need to understand the word pedophile means you're sexually attracted to pre\-pubescent children. So you're not ""pedo\-ish"" unless you're ""kinda"" attracted to children. C'mon, people lol"
What does your brother think? Does he feel the same as them?
"Deciding to build a garden when our backyard is mostly rock below the first 2-3"". So all of it has to be built up. 

Then in the middle of that deciding that he wants to fully re-arrange the garage because he thinks if he does he will have more working space.

Then getting overwhelmed by it all and deciding he needs/ wants more help. "
Yeah it's a common occurrence for me. Shooting isn't all that its cracked up to be. Once I shot myself in the eye when I was 15. Mom thought I had pink eye lol.
"Always knock before entering, rude."
I had someone ask if i was the bitch or not.... i wasnt happy. 
"""There are more people here than I expected. I hope everyone fits."""
Bottoms will love you. 
so that's how long distance relationships work
"Parents will surprise you buddy. Glad it was easier. I think my parents worried more about ""normal"" life than anything, until they realized that this was my normal. I had issues with extended family, but my semi- conservative parents stuck by me and (finding out later on) defended me on more than one occasion including cutting ties with some hate filled cousins of theirs. EVERYONE knows someone gay now, and we have those activists that came before us to thank for that. The notion that if people know gays as family, friends, brothers etc..they are less likely to discriminate. Its taken time, but its gotten so much better. Congrats dude, be safe, live a good life. "
I had to practice saying it aloud in my car. Now it just rolls off the tongue. 
"&gt;Right away a week later I caught him cheating on me sexually.

&gt;He's a really kind, caring, sweet, and loving person. 

no"
"Just talk to him about all of this. You've already taken his dick up the butt so it shouldn't be embarrassing to talk about which contexts you find X to be a turn on and what context it's a turn off. Youre allowed to change your mind and try things out to figure out what works and what doesn't for you, him, and both of you. "
Yes I have. And I don't believe those who say 'I have not measured it'.

"Yeah, I learned that the hard way....quite literally."
"Don't confront him. Fuck him, just let him be, you don't need that shit.

 But do go out and buy another sticker.

Winning is not always by putting up a fight. Sometimes it's about endurance. "
"I thought he was doing okay, if he didn't want me to be around he could have just told me. I just want to be there for him and it hurts that he doesn't want me too."
"[My husband (white guy) and I (the other guy).](https://i.imgur.com/9teUm5k.jpg)

"# ??? what ???

tbh gay culture is just being confused all of the time"
Thanks. Your BF sounds exactly like mine. I'm already feeling like his dad. I'm already starting to resent him. I even have to cook for him as he doesn't want to learn how to cook or take care of himself. One point I broke down from exhaustion and just couldn't anymore for a week. I told him he had to fend for himself even if it meant frozen microwave dinners. He had a breakdown over that but now at least he can do those. 
"Na, don’t tell your room mate.
But do tell your other friend to stop being a little creep."
"If asked by a straight guy. ""It depends on the situation. Which do you want me to be?""  Or ""Which do you think you'd be?""

Then laugh like a crazy person.

"
Look on the bright side - maybe he'll think of you when he masturbates during his next relationship.
"I think it's pretty common.

 Guys with big arms and a jungle in their pit look hot af to me. Sometimes, I wish to bury my face there after they hit the gym."
"That'd be a hard no from me. She made her bed and now she can sleep in it. Maybe if she weren't such a bitch, she wouldn't be in this predicament. "
I take them off. The guy looks hotter all of a sudden. 
"You are not the only feeling like that. I think it comes with age, that many guys separate the love and sexual when they grow up. Many people live in a committed relationship, but where one of the guys have a lesser sex drive, and opens their relationship so the other part can fulfill his needs. 

Personally, I can relate to both, but am probably more inclined to not hook-up on a first date - as in my opinion sex gets so much better when you have the emotional connection as well. But hey, we are all different, and absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Do exactly what is right for you and your gut feeling, and I’m sure you will have a wonderful time out there."
"I don't know why parents ask **why** 

What answer do they expect? ""I wanted visual stimulation so i could beat my meat mom!"""
I feel so attacked lmao
"I never feel that way myself but men like you are an absolute treasure to the gay community, and should be cherished. "
Nice! Congrats on your first gay experience. Keep enjoying yourself and use condoms!!!
"When I was single, I went two years with nothing. I reached a point where I realized that something would happen eventually and if I stopped trying and thinking about it, it would happen naturally. And it did."
Congratulations! Personally I felt better after deleting Grindr even though I had some fun on it. It’s addictive and wastes the time you could use to better yourself 
Definitely a grower. I wouldn't worry about your soft size. 
"Good luck. In the 8th grade my dad caught me watching gay porn early in the morning. This was before I was out and my dad is pretty homophobic. I thought I was screwed. Well, instead he just gave me a small talk saying that I shouldn't be watching that. He also asked me why I was watching it. This is around the time when I first started watching porn so I just said ""I was curious."" And we left it at that. 

Now everytime I come across the video that he saw me watching I shudder."
It won’t hurt that much once you get used to it ... 😢
"Even in the wake of treading through troubled waters; we will do whatever we can to protect our loved ones. As the other person commented; he’s trying to protect you by preserving your good memories, shutting you out-to not have this overshadow the good times, and I know it hurts like hell-but you’ll understand in future. No one wants to be seen in a vulnerable state, which is clearly the case here.I wish you both the best (especially for his prognosis), I ask that you not internalize his decision-as you having done something wrong; be positive, be strong, and know you have the support of a wonderful community to turn to for your darkest of days: let not your heart be troubled, let it be filled with love, and know that it is with the best of intentions-that he’s asked that you not see him in his vulnerable state. Godspeed brother "
Exactly. I’m almost 22 and even I’m feeling like Damn! Only if I had a sucker like him to drool on me all day. Life Sucks!
"No, I definitely meant house*wife*."

"""Daddy was a hard man."""
Any bottom will do for me.
"When Dad asks if you want a hot dog, just tell him ""no thank... I've been gobbling weiners all afternoon!"""
"My best straight friend asked if the butthole gets stretched and if it’s permanent.  I rolled my eyes, put my pants on, and got out of bed. "
"I never thought about it quite like that, but yes, I do the same thing. I think it's because ""I'm gay"" sounds like you're making ""an announcement"". By bringing it up in those other ways you mentioned, it communicates the same information, but does it in passing. It doesn't make the central topic of what you're saying **about** the fact that you happen to be gay.

By saying it as an announcement as ""I'm gay,"" it adds significance to what you're saying, and puts the listener in the position of perhaps feeling obligated to respond to your announcement. You could instead use the words ""I'm gay"" in the middle of a story and still have it be kind of subtle, but you'd have to be slick about it.

All that being said, are you okay with saying ""I'm gay"" if you need to? If not, then you need to find out what's going on there and get yourself comfortable with saying it. If you decided to practice by saying to random people ""I'm gay,"" they might respond with, ""yeah, ok, why are you telling me this?"" If you told them first you were uncomfortable saying it to people and wanted to practice, they'd probably be great about it."
It spreads ignorance of gay relationships to answer. Because they're asking more than who is top and bottom.
"I don't know your age/situation, but try to make friends should it go wrong with the relationship with your bf."
Complete with dainty negligees that barely hang below one’s bussy. 
"Research students aren't representative of the student body. Chad from Delta Phi with a 2.7 GPA is going to spend his summer at the beach, not in a lab. Relax. "
"He started getting incoherent towards the end. Thankfully, we were all there to support him. It’s just a pity he didn’t last longer. "
"I'm sorry to hear your family are such evil fucking cunts. You are far better off without them, as painful as this is for you right now. You don't need such negativity in your life - you're free now!"
I think it has more to do with being comfortable with yourself than a particular esthetic. People who are comfortable and confident tend to project that whereas overly groomed guys may be perceived as less comfortable in their own skin.
This dude knows what he is talking about. 
"You like him, he likes you... he’s legally an adult (you’re both kids to me). Go for it."
"I had insecurities about my dick in high school from watching porn. After I slept with a few guys, I realized I'm fine, what I got gets the job done, and porn gives you unrealistic expectations. I also found that my 5 and 15/16 inch cock was bigger than quite a few of the other guys out there (not that I measured or anything). "
good thing it's not only me
"I’ve had “bitch or butch?” A few times but my favourite version was “Do you nudge the fudge or get your fudge nudged?” 

"
"You thought he was 21-22, because to you that's the age he looked. That alone affirms there's nothing ""pedo-ish"" about asking him out. Stop overthinking."
What you're honestly doing is enabling him. You're giving him opportunities to get his act together and he's not making an effort. You've allowed him to cheat on you and take your money. Why are you putting up with this?
"Probably because a lot of people don’t have to force themselves to be more “macho” than they really are or worry about being too feminine like they did in the past.

"It won’t help them to pretend you never existed, you are their gay son. Whether they like it or not. You are their gay son, whether you like it or not. 

Focus on your life and don’t seek their approval. If you need to see them, go see them but nothing can change your orientation. They don’t get to choose their children. You don’t get to choose your parents. 

Remember that it is like telling a child who is diagnosed with autism not to be autistic, and then disowning him and telling him he isn’t your child when he isn’t average. He is still your child,  and he is still autistic. 

It is unfortunate that they demand the impossible, it is a shame they are unwilling to love you unless you pretend to be someone else. 

Don’t seek their approval. Don’t ask for them to change. Don’t let them off the hook either. 

I have an older brother who isn’t accepting, says I am dead to him, and all that shit. I don’t play those games. If they get offended, well fuck em. I do know that all of them know not to be ugly to my husband. I have no interest in harming anyone, but I don’t need them, their money, or their approval.

My parents have cooled over the years, bu I don’t ask for them to be in my life. "
"Guy doctors probably see a million dicks a day, your penis reacts to touch not gender. It will only be awkward if you make it awkward. I’ve had a few encounters with doctors and my dick, and they doctors usually always have cold hands so your penis won’t get hard because it’s cold. I do believe they do it on purpose, I don’t know how but every dude who has touched it has always had cold hands. 

Additionally, I believe a guy would know how to handle it better as he has a penis too.."
"I prefer bottoms who are going to laugh with me, moan with me, roll around in the sheets embracing awkward little hiccups with me. I don't give a damn if you're sub or do, top or bottom; I just want to have sex with a human."

"Typical far left, fascist 'anti-fascist' ideology.

The irony seems totally lost on so many. This is excactly why there is so many problems in the western world at the moment. So many people seem to just not have the ability to be able to talk with others that have different opinions. The only way to actually progress the world is to talk, and actively engage, and that includes with people we have very opposing views with, in particular. Just being aggressive and wishing a painful death is stupid, spiteful, over emotional and not rational.

Would have been much better to intelligently and passionately put your point of view across on why his view is wrong. May have actually made him think, and question his views."

"I hate to say this, but...I'm almost certain it means he blocked you because you looked substantially different (or probably not as attractive) in your subsequent pics than you did in the first one that resulted in him calling you cute.

Try to make sure all your Grindr (face)pics have similar, angles, lighting and no filters to ensure consistency (and to minimise the odds of this happening again)"
"It baffles me that an emotionally and financially stable guy like you is with someone like this. But if you can see that there is no drive in him to pick himself up and get his life together, then you need to find yourself someone else, you deserve someone who's an equal not some man child, and judging by what you're saying he's not a very good house husband either."
"Consider yourself lucky to even have a door.  My room was just at the top of the stairs.  No, door or anything.

All my masturbations had the volume muted."
[Here ya go ](https://imgur.com/a/nQPX85C) my boyfriend does drag and I try to support him everyway I can.  He's the most genuinely kind person I've ever met..
"You seem very well-thought and level-headed for your age. You sound like you've got at least an idea of who you are. That's awesome. 

I've had this happen to me too occasionally; girls finding out I'm gay and suddenly getting super close physically (I'm not very close physically even with people I'm close to) and ""yas bitch""-ing everything by assuming that's who I am. 

Don't be dismissive or combative, just keep being you. Sometimes it'll turn out they're too much or not a good fit, but sometimes it can work out into a genuine friendship. Don't be afraid to joke around, play in that gray area of femininity that being gay allows if you feel comfortable doing that. Or tell them ""yeah, I needed to go to the mall anyway. I might not be much help, but maybe you can help me since I always wear the same pair of sneakers."" 

Friendships and even casual human interactions are two-way streets, speak your truth and all that. If you're up for the task, teach these people that gays have that rainbow flag because we come in all different colors and even that you're more than just ""a gay.""

Good luck 😉 "
"Hmm that is true..as a crossdresser I agree..but you can find a crowd that fits and all..like me and my bf had this thing on our trip where we just dressed up super nice ate chips drank coca cola and watched series..nothing kinky or anything just us being us..I feel it's just how it's portrayed normally that's the problem..the perception that you have to be this ""persona"" to dress up "
"&gt;Don't confront him. Fuck him

Boy did I badly misinterpret those first 5 words."
Dude there are tons of people out there ranging in attractiveness. You're not the ugliest or the prettiest....most of us aren't. You're going to be fine. Getting the hobby and stuff is important tho. Building an identity around who you date is a sure fire way to end any relationship that may crop up.
Kudos to your dad for addressing the issue this morning instead of making you suffer in silence - even though that's what you thought you wanted. I'll bet he was awake half the night figuring out the right thing to say to you. He did good! 
"Can't speak for bottoms as I only ever top but for me it the ""breeding"" aspect and I assume for them it's the same. I mean yea it feels better but my primal urge to inseminate everything is strong. Guys, girls, couch cushions, my toaster... I must dominate "
Look at the bright side. He's never going to do that again.
"Yes, this will require informing us of developments."
r/humblebrag
"Nope, bad attitudes are my biggest turn off. If I'm bottoming the top better be respectful as fuck, I can't stand a top who thinks he's an alpha gay or ""less gay"" because he only tops. You're still putting your dick in a dude's ass, dbag. I don't bottom for pure tops anymore because a lot of them are like this, in my experience."
I much prefer to say “I like guys” instead of “I’m gay”. Idk why. Maybe I it’s less of a label that I might be expected to arbitrarily adhere to.

"No man, that's the attitude you've gotta reject. In no way should/could this ""ruin their lives"" You are still you. The same son they raised for almost 2 decades. By saying it'd ruin their lives, you give in to their logic, when it is fundamentally wrong. "
Maybe you’re trying too hard?
I had to get therapy to finally get the courage. 
I think the dick tapping is to make their dicks hard before going in 
"He’s actually equal to you, his flaws are just less obvious. The more you stay with him the more you’ll understand that"
"what video is this gif from? it's not for science or anything, i just want to masturbate to it. thanks"
"What happens is that you have something inclusive (pride flag) but then people want to feel ""represented"" with something specifically for themselves (the other lgbt flags) and then people decide things need to be totally inclusive again (this new flag) etc. People are just always complaining about being included vs being represented. And yes I agree that all of the lgbt flags are ugly but this one is the worst."
"Sounds like he’s deeply troubled about expressing himself sexually, which is completely understandable (you said very religious). The signs are there, but if you want to pursue him, I’d either be super patient or find ways to make him comfortable about it that don’t involve coming onto him. It sounds like direct confrontation might scare him off. 

This may sound silly, but a long talk, maybe over a bit of wine to loosen the mood and the inhibitions (don’t get carried away), focused on how close friends you are, etc. See where it leads. 

Just an old bi guy’s suggestion. YMMV. 

Good luck. I’ll be pulling for you two (no, not that way. Ew.)"
"I think the fetish is called ""cuckolding"". "
"You're a good brother. If you don't want to cover something you can also say something ""if you have questions about [ie the butt stuff] you can always come to me"" or something like that."
"You might want to phrase that a bit differently than you did in the title. I agree that it’s wrong to have little kids do sexual dances for people, but that is a bit different than saying “keep them out of gay culture”. I mean, you agree that taking them to a (non sexual) pride parde is fine, so clearly it’s not about gay culture. It’s actually sexualizing kids that you are against - it happens with straights too (see child pageants), and it’s wrong either way."
Was riding this guy and he said my boy clit was nice. Think it was meant to sound horny but I had to stifle a laugh
I did because bottoms kept asking the length 
"Lol. Ditch the victim mentality.

Your family is being torn apart by your idiot father. Not you."
"No, but I was jerking off with a friend on FaceTime some years ago and he managed to get cum in his eye. It was hilarious."
I actually love it when I find porn in which less muscular guy dominates more muscular one - it feels fresh 
It is really nice. I recently am in my first real gay relationship and it really nice to wake up and cuddle in the morning. 
I feel better now 😙
"The first fuck bud I ever had. 

Even before that term was apart of my lexicon. 

I was in highschool on the rugby team. He was a year older and the biggest douche you’d ever meet. He had a missing tooth from hockey season and I thought he was the hottest thing since sliced fire. I had just come out and held back before changing and showering after rugby as to not make anyone uncomfortable. He appears and I 100% thought he was there to beat me up and he would have been successful. Easily had 40lbs on me in raw muscle. 

But....that was not what happened. 


He basically loved things in his ass and sucking dick. We BARELY exchanged words. Save for the word routine we had developed when we he wanted to hook up. 

Of course, like the dumb slut that I am... I confused lust with love and got it bad. He never acknowledged me anywhere outside his car or a park at night. And even then he would just go to town without saying anything. 

One day, about 4 months of hooking up later,  I initiated the verbal sequence and he just walked away. 

That was about 11 years ago. He got married and just had a kid last year with one of our female classmates from highschool. "
That’s unfortunate 
Like for real. Spit in my mouth and call me a faggot. Don't coddle me. 
100&amp;#37; this - you don't want to find yourself in your family's debt in a time of crisis.
"What exactly is ""a huge project"" for a house husband? 

Binge-watching *Queer Eye* in a single evening?"
"I'm usually of the opinion that if it wasn't me, it'd be someone else... so might as well be me."
It's a way for some guys to keep their fitness resolutions: they hope they won't skip the gym when they have a commitment to go with a friend.  
And people think it's only all just about sex for us.
"I think it’s a sign of masculinity so, yeah. I remember being young (11/12) and getting really excited seeing shirtless guys in movies or TV, I couldn’t wait to specifically grow armpit hair. 

When my husband and I met, he shaved his— I asked him to stop for me. He did....! 

So I believe it’s pretty common "
I did too but was drinking with one of my straight guy friend and he said has never measure. I didn't believe him. Next week we were sitting together and he told me he measured it. We high five cause we have the same dick size. Then I asked him if he measured it just to tell me. He said yeah and I grin hysterically and pulled him in and hug him. That made my night. 
"Could be more people being more comfortable to be out because generational.  I also wonder if there is some reason the gay students would more likely be at campus for the summer, you are only around a portion of the student population right now."
"Loving someone doesn't necessarily mean that you have to have a full blown relationship that leads to marriage.  Just enjoy what you have now. Be clear with each other about your future plans. This may be a transitional relationship, or a deep friendship, or a LTRelationship. Just enjoy it for now."
"It's like: ""Knock, knock: who's there?""--except with an extra ""knock"", lol."

"In a very happy relationship. Only ones I really have on imgur to link are kind of funny. Hope you're a ga(y)mer. I have posted these before, but it was a fun time, so happy to share again.

Me and my boyfriend at a convention. In cosplay. I'm Noctis (black-ish hair), he is Prompto (blonde) from Final Fantasy XV. He is a cosplayer, it is kind of how we met, and I have since gotten into it.

Because that’s what’s used for fisting commonly ?

"Domineering personality types often exhaust me, but a little bit of masculinity here and there is definitely attractive.   "
I’ve done it in the moment. I’ll be honest.  But only during intense sexy times. It’s hot in the moment.
My boyfriend and I catch each other checking out guys all the time. 
"Ask questions. Pay attention. Ask questions out of whatever they answer. 

So first peck around looking for common ground. Ask if they do this or they're interested in that (usually start off with something you're into. Whatever they answer, you can ask them why they are or aren't interested. Then you can go on and talk about why you are or aren't into it (but make sure the reasons why you aren't into it aren't aggressive or hate filled. A more chill dislike is better).

Aside from that just feel the flow and if the conversation becomes stagnant, talk about the things around you. Common experience is the easiest conversation, that's why people talk about the weather. Or talk about some event that has happened recently or will happen.

So basically just be aware enough to ask questions about everything."
"as someone who’s been in the closet for a good part of his life and has been VERY afraid of talking openly about his sexuality, you guys have been so helpful. i thank you all for the responses. :) "

"Even if they are cousins, who cares?
They can't get pregnant..."
"We can spend the rest of our lives fighting who we are, but should we choose to do that we will most certainly let some amazing people and opportunities slip through our fingers."
I think “Boycunt” might be worse. 
White people.
The massive ears and dog-like nose are a huge turnoff. 
"The religion, and the deep-seated homophobia it's planted within him, are the root problem. Aside from all these other sexual gambits people are suggesting, you should try having a conversation with him, very broadly, about his faith and if he feels any conflict, potentially broaching his views on sexuality. Even in a very abstract way, like ""Who would you spend your life with, if you didn't have to worry about what others thought?"" or ""Do you ever feel like your faith keeps you from doing things you want to do?""

It sounds like you want something to happen with this guy, but whatever does happen, he will probably keep withdrawing into the closet unless he addresses these issues. You can't force him to, but maybe you can point him in the right direction."
I love that feeling too 😍 I also love the feeling when he tells me to come closer and pulls me toward him. 
What do you think they did last night 😏
"I don't see how anything good could come out of this scenario, so that would be a hard pass from me."
"It feels better, and I love cum in my ass. I’m monogamous at the moment, so I get all the bareback I want."
“This service will be followed by a reception.”
For the most part. Most of us dont come out till long after highschool 😂🤣
"I'm average sized and still feel this pressure. It sucks because I really do consider myself vers, but I've been afraid of trying to top more because of my insecurities over my dick size. I know there are men out there that really don't care, but with how much gay men talk about penis size its soooo difficult to get out of that headspace. "
I'm with ya there. Smaller or average sized dicks are great. I have a giant dick and thought I was all cool until  I came out and got a boyfriend and now its like ...oh shit. Doesn't really....fit...and causes lots of pain...not a turn on to just constantly feel bad for someone you're trying to bone.
"Well, it was good."
"Nope. If he’s a jerk, it kills my interest. "
What are you doing to help with your depression?
This is why you send several photos *before* you get emotionally invested. 
I had a friend ask me if I was the one swinging the bat. 
"My dick actually disappears after I exercise. Probably no bigger than half an inch. Erect I'm just under 7, so I can't really complain. I used to not shower at the gym when I used to care what others guys thought. I kinda get giddy after guys see my junk flaccid and are amazed on how big it gets."
"Here's some things that don't dictate whether you like topping or bottoming:

Height

Weight

Dick size

Muscularity

Age

Ethnicity

Masculine or feminine 'acting' 

Here's some things that DO dictate whether you like topping or bottoming:

If you like a dick in your ass

If you don't like a dick in your ass

That's it. Go have fun and bottom away!"

"It usually seems like in situations like these, after a long amount of time when the parents are getting older and older, they realize the insanity of the fact that they disowned their own son for something so stupid.  I wouldn't be surprised if at some point they come back begging for forgiveness.  It's up to you if they deserve it."
"I'm a house husband. My partner makes more than enough for the both of us. Plus he works in academia and thus gets the summers off as well as spring break and six weeks in November/December. Which allows us to travel extensively. 

If I worked I'd only bring in a small fraction of what he makes and we wouldn't be able to travel almost half the year. It's definitely a sweet gig if you can find it. 

My biggest problem is not gaining weight from lack of working. Meaning I have to go to the gym (which is hate) and watch what I eat (which i also hate). As well as finding things to do to fill my like 14-15 hours a day of free time not spent sleeping.

Edit: for before the stereotypes roll in my partner is only 2 years older than me. "
Did you steal my dream man?
"I have never liked the idea of random hookups and never done one. I'm an exclusive - monogamous kind of guy. However, that seems pretty difficult to find or maybe I'm just not that desirable, that's completely likely as well.


As I'm approaching 30 and all my friends are married off and having babies I am struggling with feeling lonely and 'left behind' I think is a good way to put it. Doesn't help that I recently decided to change my career path and go back to school.


No idea where to find my happiness, I guess I need to learn how to make new friends because I'm very social and a lot of my motivation comes from doing things for others."
"Openly gay enlisted AF I’ve taken my boyfriend to family unit events and eaten thanksgiving meals with my Senior leadership. I also on occasion wear rainbow tanks to the on base gym. 

Open discrimination against race, religion,gender, and sexuality is heavily frowned on and can get people into serious trouble. The ever day office politics are different in every shop, so develop a thick skin. And asking as your good at your job and don’t make any trouble no one cares . 

Id be happy to answer any questions if you got any "

"I've been in past relationships where this happened and in my opinion it's a huge red flag and the countdown to the end of your relationship has begun. 

That's why in my current relationship, I had a talk with him about it THE DAY we got exclusive. And simply asked him if we should be the kinda couple that still uses Grindr/Tinder or not, and that I'm okay with both if we decide from the beginning and are honest about it.  Also told him not to tell me he wants us to delete the apps, if he's then going to download them again, because that's pointless. So we both agreed in the end that we want a relationship without the apps.

I think this is a good way to do it. Because you talk openly about it, and then it becomes a common choice rather than something expected or forced upon. "
And most importantly don’t do it in front of the salad
"Fuck you're right... I never asked them why me, OMG. 

This is a very good defense I'm going to start tell my family what you said. "

I pictured two guys eating Doritos in tuxedos before I remembered what the topic was.  lol"
"I blame myself a lot for the situation too. I used to be extremely overweight at 330 - 350 lbs and had to deal with a lot of baggage and rejection. I lost a lot of weight. I'm down to 220lbs. He's the longest relationship I've had so far. He's the first person I've ever lived with.

Before that my last relationship was 9-10 months and it was with a chubby chaser I started dating at 275 lbs. It turned into an really emotionally abusive relationship when I got down to about 240. He would try to ""feed"" me and kept telling me about how terrible I looked and how I looked better at 275 and how he wanted me to be 350+. 

My current boyfriend came in at this time and helped me through that and gave me the courage to dump the other looser. Until recently my current boyfriend was actually high functioning. He had a part time job. He was putting himself through college. He got an associates degree and graduated December 2017. 

That's why I wasn't quick to kick him to the curb. Honestly I'm blind-struct by his changes. That's why I tried doing counseling instead. Right now this is really unusual of him and he isn't at all like the guy I knew up to December 2017. I don't know if it's just the stress of real life punching him in the face. To me it seemed like he thought getting a degree would mean he could just waltz right in and get any job. Or I don't know if I just got played by someone looking for an easy path in life. 

I just want him to get better. I want him to get motivated again and taking care of himself. I want him to get a job or go back to college and get his bachelors. He just doesn't feel like the same boy I fell in love with two years ago. "
Where is the damn question

"I had a guy lick my lips, and not just like a quick slip, it was full on puppy kisses on my lips, and he refused to have a normal kiss. Awkward, right? Well, it got even worse when he stopped, looked at my bottom lip, and said/moaned ""Ohhhhhrrrruuuufffffff"" and panted.

Literally left to go home immediately."
I’m 26 and my boyfriend is 19 so its not really that weird! There are some random times when I notice the age gap and I’m like lol Jesus but it doesn’t happen regularly

"Do:

1) inform them of your orientation

2) know what things you want to communicate and summarize

3) Respect and Honor them, and expect them to Respect and Honor you

4) set a short meeting, have a Start &amp; a Stop, have an exit strategy

Don’t s:

1) Do not invite their judgement (do you still love me?) assume they can deal with it. 

2) Do not over explain or justify, just tell them “I am gay” if the keep questioning send them to PFLAG

3) Don’t ask their opinion, keep it light and breezy, you already know they don’t approve

4) Do not ask for their approval, this isn’t negotiable this is information.

5) Do not agree to a meeting with a pastor, or other authority

In summary, have a plan on how to get it done and get out of there. Don’t hang around. Plan to inform them, hug them and go on to next thing, no need to offer false hope that you can fix it. "
