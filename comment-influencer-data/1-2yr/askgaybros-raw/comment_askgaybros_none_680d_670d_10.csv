That's like literally gay pride :D
You are a slut.  But you can choose whether or not to feel bad about it; the only person who can slut shame you is yourself.
"I know 3 people who came out as bi before lesbian or gay.  Realistically, these scenarios do occur. However, I think we should take a person's word for their own sexuality. I sure as hell hate being told I'm not gay, so I sure as hell am not about to correct someone else on their sexuality."
Why does it matter if he knows? Sounds like he doesn‚Äôt treat you differently 
I stick my tongue out the same way...üòõ
"That gay men are pedophiles and actively seek to harm children and/or are a detriment to children (and families) in some way ""inherently."" "
There's a lot of gay guys who hit on straight dudes so that may very well be true.
"gay men will ""pave the way"" for bestiality."
"Harder to make friends gay, Even harder to make gay friends hard,"
"men are gay because of lack of attention from their father. or too much attention from their father. or too much attention from their mother. or not enough attention from their mother. take your pick, i've heard them all."
"I can‚Äôt comprehend why anyone would be upset by this. If a person behaves this nonsensically, run away from him, fast. "
"**I actually have a good one**

We were in a *biology class* of all places, studying penises and vaginas, and somehow the conversation turned to homosexuality, I truly don't remember how.

And a girl, who was one of the top students, said ''I heard that if the woman is pregnant and has sex, the baby will turn gay, because he'll learn to relate pleasure to penises''. And she was 100% serious, for real, this girl thought this was truly how it worked. She was 16. "

"According to porn (and, as we all know, porn never lies) you should go into his room and get caught sniffing his dirty underwear while jerking off. 

In response, he will throw you down on his bed and fuck you to teach you a lesson. "
"Tell him ""dude is cool you are gay and all but your comments on my dick are making me feel uncomfortable"".

If he keeps doing it then fuck him, some gay guys think they have a pass to being creepy with both man and woman."
"&gt; If he keeps doing it then fuck him

Figuratively."
". ‚ÄúBecause these animals do not watch movies.‚Äù

Oh my goodness I'm dying üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"It's actually hilarious and harrowing just how ignorant and how far behind these people are in terms of mental and social development, that they could rationalise an act of nature as something sinister. The notion that an animal has the capacity to observe gay sex, rationalise it and then mimic it is utterly staggering bordering on mental instability."
"yeah this happened to me in college. I was embarrassed until the downstairs neighbor told me ""we had no idea you had game like that""
 

so I owned it

As a straight guy... god I fucking love this sub.
rural isolation
"Your co-worker is the problem, not you. But I'd still go talk to him and say that I want a good professional relationship with him where both of you can thrive within the company. You don't have to like him but you will have to work with him..."
Your ex is a huge fucking cunt. Jesus. 
"That's I'm half boy half girl.
That's it's contagious. 
That's it's hormones disorder.
That's it's mental illness.
That I don't need to worry about my sex health cause I can't have kids anyway.
That guys should be aware I may rape them."
I got fucked in my hole like a straight woman would by her man
Why the hell would any rational human being have public sex in an African reserve lol
"I just don't get why people have to bring sexuality to the work.

The guy (who's married by the way) finds the blonde is ""a fuckable bimbo"". So why doesn't he keep his toughts to himself?"
"FUCK. I'm so sorry that happened to you. I'm going to assume this is real, because there's serious shit here, and if it's not real then me offering advice won't hurt.  

Please go and get emergency PEP. You only have 72 hours from when you were possibly infected with HIV to get PEP. It should be free and you have to take it for a month. While HIV isn't a death sentence anymore you shouldn't have to live with something like that if you can prevent it.  

In addition to getting PEP ASAP please go get a rape kit done to document this in case you ever want to press charges against him. You may not want to right now or feel like you can right now, but if you don't get the evidence right now then it's gone forever. ALSO, since this was done through an app you have recourse with the app and the police. The police can subpoena the app for info of this monster.  

And last but most definitely not least, please go see a therapist, possibly one that specializes in trauma / rape. You've been through a LOT, against your will, and you need to process this. You don't have to tell anyone that knows you but please get help.  

And if you just do ONE THING, PLEASE go get PEP. Your life depends on it. "
"*Oh, those big fucking lions are watching us and its making me super horny. Let's fuck right here.*"

"Just relax man! You are a gay male, Men tend to talk about sex a lot no matter who they fuck. Straight guys talk about it all the time "
Most of my friends are straight and i don't fancy any of them.  life is so unfair!

"Yet another reminder for those who try to tell us we ""have all our rights now"" and should stop pushing the pro-LGBT movement: we aren't even close to where we should be.

When parents are murdering their own children for being gay, there is still a fundamental societal problem of a homophobic culture."
HINT: it's because they're racist.
"My boyfriend and I save the anal stuff for special occasions, like every Saturday. We're fine with blowjobs and handjobs for the rest of the week."

"Relax, He probably won't even care "
"Guys that think that putting a dick in an asshole is enough to turn people on are what's ruining gay porn. Regardless of their sexuality. Like I'm not expecting some Oscar worthy performances but shit, even my face is more expressive when I'm eating a chocolate donut. "

I think it's much more rampant than people would like to believe and cuts across both sexes. 
"I wouldn't assume that he's lying just yet. He's going through extreme grief, and that makes people saying all sorts of crazy things. You two have been together for ten years, which probably means you have a lot of good things with each other. Couple's counselling is likely necessary now, and both of you may need some personal sessions, just because of how much it hurts."
"It's common and tame, but the idea that I consciously *chose* to be gay is absolutely ridiculous considering all the casual homophobia that exists basically everywhere. "
"I'm a tall and muscular sort of guy who is 100% into smaller, lean guys.

A lot of the appeal for me comes from overpowering their weaker body and taking what I want. I love to manhandle and bend them into whatever position I want when we fuck. Smaller guys are easier to pick up and throw around, and I also love the contrast between my physique and theirs. Being a strong, built man fucking a tiny, passive twink feels so fucking right for me. Like it's supposed to be that way. 

Apart from sex I love being a big spoon and making my guy feel safe. I definitely have a sort of big brother personality, so I enjoy having someone to watch out for and comfort.  "

"I don't see why people are so judgy about it. I'm bi, and I've dated and slept with WAY more women than men. Back when that was the case, people told me that I was just confused and that I wasn't gay because I don't ""act gay"" and I still liked women. And now that I'm engaged to a man, people are just like, oh well you're gay then. You can't be engaged or married to a guy unless you're gay. You're never gonna sleep with a woman again so that means your gay. And I'm just like, how bout all you fuckers let me decide who and what I am and who and what I wanna fuck. Why does it matter to everyone else? So what if I'm greedy or whatever? People are people; if more people just went through life thinking like that instead of ""people are straight or gay or bi or trisexual or asexual"" or whatever, we'd have a lot less judgement and hatred. I'm a man who likes to fuck. How 'bout that."
"Oh man, I'm sorry op. Truly one of the worst statistical unicorns you could be. Nobody deserves that.

I'm very comfortable with myself and my sexuality so it doesn't bother me the least being subbed here, reading the posts and even commenting sometimes.

Usually (my experience, everything people have ever said to me, everything I've ever read) you're gonna end up finding your soul mate and you stay married forever. But this a gay relationship that I'm talking about...so there's an even bigger chance for success!

When you have a straight best friend and you're gay then you can be assured that he's having the same feelings as you! He isn't JUST there because he enjoys your friendship and has enough boundaries in place to fall madly, but secretly, in love with you silly! He there so that he can be your knight in shining armor, sweep you off your feet, put a baby in your belly, and be with you forever. Also, he can't wait to fuck/be fucked by you, he's just waiting you to make the first move. ;)

You'll be glad that you chose to destroy a friendship and pine over someone who would normally never be with you, because guess what? IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT FOR YOU!"

"the turning point where 'home' is no longer a place or a physical building; when 'home' simply becomes his presence. I struggle with very very deep and often times unbearable anxiety. The last time I had a relationship, I remember his natural scent would be the only thing that could calm the confusing storm in my mind. He would get night terrors a lot which would cause him to sweat out in his sleep, and his blanket would smell so much like him. During my worst times, especially when I was alone, I would go to his bed, and take the blanket to the couch where I would just envelop myself and pretend to watch TV. I miss those moments of unbreakable security."

Now you don't have to argue over whether or not Mom and Dad are jerks.  Instead, the conversation is about your feelings and your relationship, and how you make each other feel a part of each other's lives.


PS God knows you've been in too much therapy when you start recommending ""I feel"" statements to other people."

But if you do, you will get protection. Whatever level of anger you think he will have after finding out he's been reported, trust me it's not going to be much worse than it already is.

It was Tuesday night (so there weren't many other customers) and I'm assuming out of pity he kept me company in the bar waiting area. After about an hour, when it was abundantly clear my date wasn't coming, I was about to leave and he told me that he was off in 30 minutes if I fancied going for a drink.

The funny thing is that I have a gaydar that was ¬£2.99 from Chinese eBay, and I thought that he meant that he wanted to keep talking about reptiles (He didn't know much about them but likes snakes, and I'm a font of tedious reptile knowledge).

After liberal application of vodka (and rather a lot of cocaine) it was time to call it a night by 4am, I'm preparing for the usual one night new friend in London thing of 'adding each other on social media with a vague promise to go for a drink again that'll never materialise' and he asks me if I'm up for a nightcap before bed. 

Sure I think, he seems to like to party, and I did have lots of really nice blow, why not. We went back to my place, huddled up in blankets waiting for the space heater to warm up (This was December, it was cold) on my roof terrace to get more shitfaced, he suggests that we huddle up under both blankets so it's warmer...

""Oh, he's comfortable for a straight boy"" I think.

His hand is on my thigh, whatever, must be the drugs, he'd blasted a lot of powder and it makes people touchy. 

Space heater kicks in, making the air around us feel like it's a warm summers day. Blankets are discarded. He asks if it's OK if he gets naked, something about wanting to enjoy the view naked (this place had a spectacular skyline view of the city). Sure, why not, I try to act like my dick isn't already very hard at the idea and subtly move so it won't show in my pants.

After another 2 hours of drugs and talking, him sat there in all his wonderful glory, he flat out says ""You're not interested are you..."" 

""Interested in what?""

""Me""

""What? No! This has been a great night, you're really good company!""

""Company? Do you think I always strip naked in front of virtual strangers just because i'm enjoying the conversation?""

It was at that point that the realisation that he'd been hitting on me for 7 hours slapped me in the face. I can be the most oblivious idiot sometimes.

"Where do you work? Unless it's routine behavior in your industry that men get away with, how is it okay for a (potential) co-worker to call another ""a fuckable bimbo"" at work? Surely that is an offense that he can and should be fired for?"

It really depends on whether the bitch likes it.
"Instead of "" wow, look at all these backwards brown people"", it's actually ""the interference of white colonialism and western religion caused intense economic instability and introduced homophobic ideals into their societies even though historically there wasn't prior homophobia""

Like this honestly isn't even the first time. Latin America, India, Africa, North America, Pacific Islands; white people and western religion has historically indoctrinated PoC with homophobic ideals and destroyed many of their original cultural ideas about non-binary gender roles, and non-hetero normative sexuality through territorial dominance and extreme exploitation of human rights and environmental resources. And it's somehow their completely at fault for the fall-out and repercussions of colonialism and imperialism.

I'm not saying they're excused for persecuting lgbt people cause they're not, but it's far to easy to point fingers at another country of people and say ""you're doing it all wrong"" when our western culture has had a direct hand in making theirs so horrible towards gays while reaping the benefits of their labor and resources for our countries."

That the only reason people are gay is because of some traumatic event in their past.

To be honest I'm kind of dying to have a bf because I would love it if people saw that we aren't ashamed of being a gay couple in school - but ofc that would be far from my actual feelings and I wouldn't get a bf for a reason like that

What's more, a few members of our Parliament have drafted another law ""against public expression of non-traditional sexual relations"", which is supposed to outlaw coming-out. In the commentary on that draft it says that ""the spread of homosexuality leads to the spread of paedophilia, even though homosexuals are trying to hide this fact"". Thankfully, it was deemed excessive.

A few of my collegues subscribe to similar opinions, which is mildly infuriating, because it's almost impossible to prove them wrong when they are basing their views on personal dislike towards gay people."

100%."

"After me telling my ex that we were done he was screaming and throwing shit at me trying to get me to fight him after he realized it wasn‚Äôt working he grabbed a knife ran into the bathroom and started cutting his wrists. I broke the door down and watched him slide his wrist. I got the knife out of his hand and was holding his wrists trying to stop the blood. He looked me dead in the eye and said look at what you made me do this is all your fault. 
That psycho only spent a day in the looney bin and stalked me for years after "
"That gay people are creepy predators.

In high school, a guy I barely knew greeted me first (in the bro way- last name said loudly and jovially) in the bathroom while I was washing my hands, and I replied and asked about why his leg was in a cast. I didn‚Äôt even hear his answer since I didn‚Äôt really care- was just making small talk. Like I said, I barely even knew him, so I didn‚Äôt even know why he was even talking to me.

Apparently right after this, he remembered rumors he heard (‚Äúoh shit- isn‚Äôt he gay?‚Äù), then proceeded to class and told everyone he was creeped out because he thought I might have been hitting on him in the bathroom.

He was a tall footballer with about twice my bulk. He talked to me first. But apparently he was scared of what the little 5‚Äô6‚Äù kid could do in the crowded bathroom."

You just said you hate being a man and wish you had boobs. I think gender nonconforming is an understatement. I‚Äôve never felt anything like that. 
"When I meet a guy that I'm interested in, I just ask him out.  I don't bother trying to figure out if he's gay or not.  Almost every time, they say yes.  I don't frame it as a date, rather just as grabbing a coffee or a beer, whichever seems more immediately possible.  

Once I'm sitting down with them, it's easy to peg if they're gay or straight or flexible."
"I 100% agree. Which is exactly why I DIDN'T say ""all bi people are lying about being gay or lesbian."""
"So I just got home from work, and I'm starting to undo my tie, when I see my boyfriend standing at the archway of the kitchen in nothing but an apron, and he's holding a spatula in his right hand, and I can clearly see he's aroused because *something* is poking through that apron. 

Suddenly he said ""Dinner is ready...üòé""

To which I unzip my pants and grab the spatula, spanking him with it across his hairless, toned ass. He flinches, and let's out a subtle gasp in my ear. 

I'm still taking off my shoes and and shirt, bit he helps and goes down on me right there in the kitchen. After a couple minutes of a blowjob, I pick him up, taking him to the bedroom, and I embrace him in this fiery passion, and we pretty much fuck the shit out of each other.

The chicken burned but fuck it, we ended up going to Chili's afterwards. lol"

"Well, your talking about a place where a lot of people genuinely believe that practicing homosexuality causes you to break out in rashes, sores, and other physical afflictions. When you hear Africans talking about ""saving the backs of our brothers"" as a reason for prohibiting gays, that's what they mean. 

I remember Stephen fry interviewing a high ranking politician, possibly the president of an African country and he went on and on about that sort of thing, so it's not like these are just the crazy tinge either."

"Wall of text here, if you're in a rush, skip to the bottom couple paragraphs.  

He told one little lie 10 years ago.  Maybe at a point in time when he hadn't fully come to grips with his sexuality.   Many guys often go through that phase?   

A lie like that can spin out of control.   At first, it was supposed to be just a little thing, right?   But then as more time goes on, it becomes harder and harder to come clean about that lie.   And a lot of that is out of fear of how you're reacting now, frankly.   

It's another form of that ""bi now, gay later"" progression that you also often see.   More feminine gay men are looked down on more than more masculine gay men as well.   There's a lot of pressure to conform to the gender norm, and that can drive people to some peculiar ideas about themselves.   That's how he felt, even if intellectually he knew it didn't make sense. Knowing that it would be awkward explaining those feelings, he probably avoided answering your question ""why won't you ever bottom?"" for awhile, and finally told you a story when he couldn't brush off the question anymore.   

And then he did something silly.  Instead of just saying ""I really don't enjoy it"" or ""I'm not ready for it"" or something like this that would be more understandable, he decided to make up a story that would put the matter to rest for good so he wouldn't have to keep saying ""no"" when you asked anymore.  

So now years later, he's more comfortable with his sexuality, he has probably lost those hangups he had a decade ago.  When he was  come clean about it.

I say this by way of trying to help you see where he might be coming from.   I'm not justifying making up a story like this, but I'm showing you how this sort of thing can happen.    It's important to put yourself in his shoes, try to understand where he's coming from with this.    

""Because I'm a man.""  That hurts to hear, doesn't it?  After all, if you've been the bottom, what does that make you in his mind, right?   I'm sure you know his understanding about that has probably evolved in the 10 years since.   But at the time, it would hurt you for him to say that he felt like bottoming would make him less of a man.  He didn't tell you the lie to hurt you.   He told you the lie so as NOT to hurt you by telling you.   He felt that way, but knew that he shouldn't have felt that way.   

And, truth be told, other than missing out on the chance to top for 10 years (assuming you've been monogamous and faithful), this lie hasn't really hurt you.   And with 10 years and an otherwise solid relationship, does it even matter?  

You do have a right to be upset.  Even angry.  Let yourself feel that way, let the feelings run their course.   While they're doing that, don't make any big decisions.  Don't blow up your life.   Once you're feeling calmer about it, and more level-headed, then sit down with him and talk to him about it.   Tell him how you feel, but also *listen to him*.   Try to understand where he's coming from.    After you've done that and you really understand both sides, and you've taken time to fully process the whole thing, then you can start thinking about whether or not you are able to forgive him.

Things like this are a really big shock, but don't rush into it.  Don't act rashly, or make life-altering decisions from a place of hurt.  Like I said before, don't blow up your life until you've heard his side and had time to really think about it.  I wish you the very best, and I hope that everything works out for you, man.   Above all:  Whatever happens, you're going to be okay.    "

"&gt; I feel empty. And lonely. 

If you didn't already feel empty and lonely there is no point feeling empty and lonely now.

People have way more gross diseases than this one. Don't feel dirty. You are not dirty. 


&gt; And that no one will ever want to be with me, except perhaps as a fetish fuck and then just discard and block me. 

This tells that you have some prejudices towards HIV. Get yourself educated, the right man won't care about this. If you want to be a fetish fuck that is all up to you.

&gt; I wonder if its even worth still living, as if gay life wasn't already hard enough. 

It is worth living. If you didn't want to die before I don't see any reason why would you want to die now that you have a virus in you?


&gt; I hate myself. 

Stop. You need to get yourself healthy back again. 

&gt; I took a single risk and, look what happened. 

Yeah, it happened. Did you enjoy the sex at least? Not much point dramatizing it, you had sex, you didn't put your life savings in a promising start up and now you're facing bankruptcy.

&gt; I will be tainted with this disease for as long as I live. 

There are many people living with chronic diseases. No one is tainted by them, you will not be tainted. You are tainting yourself right now.

&gt; And I am only 21. Yep, thats right, 21. My life has been changed. Forever. 

All the better, it means you have a stronger organism to fight HIV back and live a normal healthy life. Forever. 

&gt;It will never be the same as I once knew it.

Yes it will, in about 3 months. 

&gt; I don't know what to do next. 

Go to the follow up and start your treatment. Read about HIV, educate yourself.

&gt; My parents will be so emotionally distraught once they find out the son they were once so proud of has gotten to this. 

They don't have to know. This is something private. If you want to tell them then do, but you have to be really comfortable with it first. You don't have the bubonic plague and need to part ways with them. "
