Thanks stranger lol"
"Post that in Showerthoughts, sit back and watch the karma roll in. Straight folks love to live through us ."
You were so close to a threesome.
"Everyone does, yes"
You can be bi
"So difficult.... Try to put yourself in her shoes. She comes first, I'm afraid. Give her a generous divorce settlement. It's not your fault, of course, but your wife will feel that you've been fucking her around."

"This is not very out of the ordinary, but I think it‚Äôs funny nonetheless;

We had this one single handicap toilet at our base. This was the only place you could lock the door and be certain you were alone.

That room was commonly known as the ‚ÄúHandifap‚Äù, and I swear to god everyone jerked off there."
"Some green flags here : he's into aftercare, and he listens to your needs. All very important things in BDSM. some doms think they get to do whatever they want and consent be damned. Yours seems like a good one.

"Oh hell, why not? Me and another sailor met at the MWR, and after some talk, went to the locker room for work. We made out and slowly undressed each other before taking turns sucking each others cocks until we both swallowed each others loads. It was fun, and a bit risky that anyone could have walked in at any time. Been a long time since I did anything like that."
"Yes, especially when you‚Äôre expecting smooth and then find there‚Äôs a perfect path of hair leading down south..."

"‚ÄùTIFU by driving 25 miles for a hookup.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt hookup with anyone that I have to ‚Äúcommute‚Äù to."
"Eh, I just think that gay guys tend to be more upfront about what they want, doesn't mean that they all go for sex. I can say for myself that I've never went out with a guy for sex."
I couldn't agree with you more.  Knowing she's taken care of is my highest priority.  I'm not moving and will still be in her life.  She's still the most important person in my life.
"Um, okay. So he lied to you, then did a classic manipulation tactic to try and make you forget. Sounds like my ex..."
"Uh, you should talk about whatever issues you had so it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Or you could just give him a blowjob, I guess? This post is weird. "
They‚Äôre just jealous that the straight guys they date aren‚Äôt nearly as hot as us ‚Äòfags‚Äô. 
"I wouldn't tell her what happened, just end it. Otherwise be prepared for the whole school to know. "
"well, Russia is really complicated. I'm a gay-friendly straight guy from Russia and it doesn't really surprise me. There are gay clubs in every city, there are a lot of state-approved LGBTQ festivals like ""Side by side"" in St Pete, though at the same time they keep making those ridiculous laws. "

"I hate to be a downer, but their passports have since been canceled, the person who validated the passports and their boss have been fired, and there has now been a criminal case brought against the two men for ""damage of federal documents"". Luckily, the punishment is a super measly fine. Still, very sad. Fingers crossed that things will change.

"You go to the police. This is blackmail and since you know who he is, you can easily get him paying a fine that much bigger. If you do get fired from this, he's financially responsible for it. *This guy is a complete moron.* 

After that, you go to your boss saying that there is someone blackmailing you, and that he has really sensitive material of you (Don't mention what it is. Just say that it is sensitive.) 

If your boss is worth a single dime, he or she will understand and ignore any emails sent by this person. Or, in the worst case, see it and fire you but then you can EASILY sue this guy for financial recompense. "
"Umm, I once jerked off the side of the ship into the Arabian gulf at night. Probably wasn't 50ft from the nearest watchstander, but that is a whole different kind of dark! Also hooked up in the locker room once, but that's a different story."

"Is this the [Hatoful Boyfriend](http://store.steampowered.com/app/310080/Hatoful_Boyfriend/) thread?

~~(but seriously, this is kinda cute)~~"
"When I was an E3  in the dorm, we had dorm room inspection. There was this random E-6 inspecting my room. While I was waiting for it to be done, I took my phone and got on Grindr and saw a profile next to mine which I had never seen before. That profile mentioned being military and discreet and had a picture with the  body without head but I was able to tell it's him because of his tattoos on his arms. So I decided to ask him directly if he had Grindr or not. He was surprised and took him some seconds to say yes. Then we had a good conversation and ended up with my dick in his mouth and him swallowing my cum. After that day, we became FWB and he loved my dick in his mouth and ass. "
"Ok, Gosh...

"More accurate: ‚ÄúDates sometimes lead to sex, and sex sometimes leads to dates.‚Äù

Plenty of straight people do hooking up. Plenty of gays do proper dates too. "
"Parachuting down during training, pulled my cord hella early to get a adrenaline wank. And yes, pun intended. 

Edit: (I'm not military, fantasy ruined)"
"This is too cute to be real, I don't believe it"
"Honestly springing a threesome on someone, especially a hookup, is really bad form. Not everybody is into them, nor were you able to vet the 3rd party. I mean what if a really fat old dude had walked in?"
"Two bi guys, two happy trails, me, and one gym class. Was a tough semester"
"You say it felt right.... so that's great.  I really don't see a problem.  You're both discovering what you really like and I say go for it.  Gay guys your age have girlfriends only because it's the thing to do and they don't want to admit to themselves that they'd rather be with another guy.  Now you both know.  Well, this is how I see it anyway.  When I was your age (about 9 years now), I had to pretend to like girls too.  Believe me, you aren't the only ones.  There's literally millions of guys your age who are going through the same thing."
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs common but it is hot.

"Same.

But I have had sex with plenty of guys I never went out with."

No :/ honestly the thought of a female around me during a sexual scenario just turns me off lol

"He won't. You'll find each other's limits and you'll explore scenes and stuff.

"I had been married with children at my 10th high school reunion.  Big gap to my 50th reunion when I returned with my husband.

My Latin teacher, in her 90s, made a great speech."
"I remember for YEARS I listened to my friends who are girls complain about how gross it was.  The first time I was going to have a guy cum in my mouth, I was scared as hell.  I was nervous it was going to make me puke.

Then he did it, and my first thought was, ""that's it?  That's what they've been complaining about?""  After that I always enjoyed it.  "

Its gay
I have been dating my girlfriend for a year now and all my life (until this incident) have thought I was straight. So I'm not pretending to like girls and I agree that its unfair. I will tell her what happened and end our relationship. We have been off and on lately.
I wish I had a mom like you Momma Diana.

I don't know how to feel about this.

"I think part of it‚Äôs about more blurred lines. For gay men, who are your friends? Who are your romantic interests? Things get complicated fast, feelings get hurt, etc. For straight men, women are kinda aliens, and that creates bonding space for straight guys to think of each other more as teammates. I definitely don‚Äôt believe that straight guy thing where ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such thing as a totally platonic male/female friendship,‚Äù but it is true those relationships can be fraught and complicated and full of miscommunication. Gay friendships are often the same without a little work.

I think there‚Äôs also a lot of insecurity that comes from our ability to look in the mirror and kinda know whether we‚Äôd be attracted to ourselves / just how attractive we are. Straight guys think to themselves, ‚Äúwho knows what a woman finds sexy! Hopefully me.‚Äù Gay guys say, ‚Äúdamn, I ignore a lot of messages from guys who look a lot like me.‚Äù That insecurity manifests in all kinds of ways, meanness definitely among them."

Yeah you are right. 
"Worse... Before grindr ever existed I went on a date with a great guy.  Hot as hell.  My type exactly to the letter.  We got a little tipsy and we ended up back at his place and I had some of the best sex I ever had.  Multiple sessions that went all though the night and into the morning.  Cuddling when the sun came up in clean white sheets.  A perfect night.  Next morning we're exhausted and having a coffee to wake up. I'm in a dreamy state.  This guy was my perfect ideal of a boyfriend.  I ask him about a framed photo on the desk of a guy he had his arms around.   He gets really embarrassed... Like turned beat red and went silent.  I was like: ""This is your boyfriend isn't it.""
He said yes - but that they had an open relationship and that everything is cool.  He asks if I am mad.   I tell him: ""Not at all.  I had a great time.  Also I don't have to face your boyfriend when he returns."".  Inside I was angry, disgusted, and sad.  "
Really small penis.

Thank you for your service! (Pun intended!)
"I think it's mostly confirmation bias. The only older gay people (for the most part) the younger generation runs into are at the club or on dating apps like grindr. The only interactions they have with older gay people is when they are being hit on (sometimes inappropriately) , which paints the picture that they are predators. This is obviously not true, but there isn't enough representation outside of those environments to give they a better picture of the older generations of gay men. It's the same thing that drives stereotypes about the gay community in general, limited exposure."

"First of all - sweet story! Congrats for finding a guy like him!

&gt;We haven't spoken all day, which isn't normal since he's always sending me goofy pictures of himself all day.

Might be that he got a little bit nervous around you because he's scared of losing you.

Talk with him and be honest - without it, there is no healthy dom/sub relationships.

Don't worry about having limits. We all have them (doms have them, too!) and we need to respect them to stay safe and happy. I think he understands it. Just like u/throwaway17061 said, there's a lot of green flags here, looks like he knows what he's doing.

My dom never asked me to cross my limits and we're happily almost 7 years together.

A word of warning - know your limits in advance. Read about different types of sexual activities and never promise that ""you will think about doing this or that in the future"". Limits have to be clear. In my experience, trust and comfort can help you push them, but it must be your decision (not under influence of someone) and your motivation can't be only to satisfy your partner."
"I dunno, I like to see body with some bulge or ass in pants. These tend to be better taken, and the ""mystery"" is alluring.

"I lived right next to hillcrest for some time.. gayborhood of san diego. I really liked parts of it, having company over was a mess because there's almost no public parking... But that's not exclusive to gayborhoods, that's just how urban areas often are. 


Anyway, if you like other gay guys and are social I think it's wonderful. I honestly miss it quite a bit, I met some amazing people.. I ended up joining a gaymers group, and gay board game group that I enjoyed because I tend to drink excessively if I go out to bars so nice to have gay friends that I met outside of a bar atmosphere


I like just walking down the street, seeing gay couples hold hands, so much gay friendly stores and restaurants, it's just really nice and makes me feel completely normal to be gay...  the idea of possibly meeting a guy at a coffee shop or out in public and the likelihood of them being gay and hitting it off is just exciting.
When I'm in a gayborhood and it makes me think, aw this is what straight people feel like all the time."

"Sounds manipulative. 

Idk bro, it‚Äôs hard to give an opinion on whether or not to forgive someone when you don‚Äôt know exactly what‚Äôs being forgiven. I mean, a lie about drugs could range from him telling you he never did anything when in fact he smoked weed once 15 years ago, to being a heroin dealer who‚Äôs been lying about where all his money is from. That‚Äôs an extremely wide range and some things in there would be forgivable to me and some aren‚Äôt."

"For me personally a relationship never would have gone this long if someone was habitually at least 30 minutes late. I always try to get places at least a few minutes early if there is a schedule or agreed upon time.  
  
It‚Äôs not your fault for ‚Äúruining the mood‚Äù when your SO is being inconsiderate of your time. To keep someone waiting around for an hour or two? One has to know damned well they‚Äôre going to be running that late early enough to give the other person the heads up so their aren‚Äôt waiting like a jackass.  
  
Hopefully a simple solution, more than 20 minutes late without a heads up? Leave. Don‚Äôt wait. You‚Äôve got better things to do than to be treated that way. "

"It honesty depends on the ethical system: (edit: yes = ethical, no=unethical - sorry, answered it backwards)

Virtue Ethics: Hard to say. If it increases your self-knowledge or holds with any principles you may have, then sure. Otherwise no.

Stoicism: Probably not. If you're asking about it on Reddit, your mind is clearly troubled about it already, and that's what stoicism defines as unethical.

Cyrenean Hedonism: Yes. You could die tomorrow, and experiencing as much pleasure now as you can could be the most ethical thing you can do before you're gone.

Epicurean Hedonism: No. You're probably not going to die tomorrow, and eventually cheating with this guy will go wrong, and you'll accumulate much more pain than pleasure.

State consequentialism: I don't think I know enough about your respective socio-economic conditions to make a call on that one.

Utilitarianism: Yes, if his wife and kids never find out about you in particular. Or if you're just one of a stream of many. Because that would mean more pleasure (Utilitarian good) from the cheating than pain (utilitarian bad) from the fall out. But no if they do find out and you're the main mistress.

Deontological: Yes if you're following a personal rule like ""Help poor gay guys trapped in straight marriages by an unjust society"". No if you follow a rule like ""Adultery is wrong/ Always be honest.""

Pragmatic ethics: Tough one, but no. You're not really doing anything for society either way.

Care ethics: Hell no. You monster.

Role ethics: Nope. You have a place in this ethical system, but it's far and away on the unethical side.

Anarchist ethics: Suprisingly no. This aligns with ""Do unto others as you would have done to you."" And I doubt you want to be cheated on.

Postmodern Ethics: Who knows? What's right? What's wrong? Mismatched ethical systems, even in fairly homogenous societies, mean there will always be an ethical remainder that cannot be resolved.

So yeah, depends.

Sorry to any real philosophy students if I got anything wrong. I'm just a bored engineer who thought figuring out how this problem aligns with all the systems listed in the Wikipedia ethics article is a perfectly reasonable way to spend 10 minutes when I've got a million other things to do.

"When a man can pay his own bills, has a car, a stable income, and dresses like an adult. That shit turns me on."
"* Breathe through your nose.
* Watch your teeth.
* Light suction as you go down.
* Use some of your saliva. Just like jerking it feels better lubed.
* You can use your tongue to play with the head, or go down the shaft to his balls.
* Yea it's a blowjob, but using your hands around the shaft can add some extra stimulation. 
* Everybody's different so listen to your guy. He's making noises, he probably enjoys it."
"Y'know, hookup/dating platforms aren't exactly complex, and they don't *force* you to interact with people that you don't want to interact with. It's more sensible to just talk to the people that you like and avoid people that you don't without using pretty limiting and stereotyping blanket statements.

 They mostly come off as rude and are based off of some pretty harmful stereotypes in the gay community (fetishising/putting down certain ethnicities, operating within a pretty rigid system of identities like twink, bear, fem, masc, so on)

Basically, it just reduces people to one-dimensional slabs of meat, and that ain't always great."
Thats not how straight guys work honey.
I know right. I've only driven that far for dick once and it was worth every mile. But it HAS to be some dick that unbelievably worth it.
"That's true, I'm not considering breaking up with him. But I'm worried that he'll get bored of sex with me eventually :("
he wasn't really angry about the game. he was just joking
"Sexual health clinic, go now "
"My mother walked in on us having sex and put a note on the door asking me to come talk to her about my ""study buddy."" Turns out she was wondering why we were being load ax fuck. It was slightly embarrassing explaining to my mom why a 17 year old was fucking my butt."
the fuck?
"Damn, that must really suck. I'm sorry that this had to happen to you. Let us know if you wanna talk things out yeah? 

On a side note, you mentioned that his independence   was what you admired. Perhaps we could learn from that and slowly become better in being ourselves?  Whether or not you're an introvert, you're definitely capable of being great, even socially. 

Stay strong pal:) it will take time.

The fuck is grapefruiting
"This seems like a good opportunity to let your cousin know you know his sexuality and support him.  It's also funny / something you can laugh about.  You guys are 24 not 14, I think the time for walking on eggshells about his sexuality is over. "
"I remember reading about how it‚Äôs treated as a mental illness in Russia. The population is conditioned to be against it. 
Maybe someone can find some evidence."
"This sounds fake as hell. Make sure to space out your paragraphs so whatever free writing class your doing this for gives you full credit! 

""Everyone awwwed and then some of the other tables awwed too!"" 

Lol. No. "
Excellent
"This term caused a humorous misunderstanding for the navy.

*In the early 1980s, the¬†Naval Investigative Service¬†was investigating homosexuality in the¬†Chicago¬†area. Agents discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as ""friends of Dorothy."" Unaware of the historical meaning of the term, the NIS believed that there actually¬†was¬†a woman named Dorothy at the center of a massive ring of homosexual military personnel, so they launched an enormous and futile hunt for the elusive ""Dorothy,"" hoping to find her and convince her to reveal the names of gay service members.*

"Didn't know people had respect for them in the first place.

But to get to the main point: rapping and queer bashing have always gone hand in hand, no? Rapping is all about being hypermasculine and any deviation is not tolerated."
I don't even have a gaydar for gay men
My wish is that nobody would feel bad about what they are. And that everyone will find the love they crave.

"I was really shy and introverted in high school, then did a complete 180 by the time I was done with college.  Adjusting to life as an adult and the responsibilities that go along with that felt exciting and I was ready for a change. Fuck high school, it‚Äôs full of asshole kids and it sucks. Grown ups are more ... grown up. You‚Äôll start getting along with people better when you‚Äôre an adult because adults respect each other *a lot* more than kids do. 

Figure out who this person is you want to be and what matters to you and become that person. Now is the time to make that change. Step out of your comfort zone and start conversations with people, don‚Äôt wait for them to. Know that you have something to say that people want to hear, know that you have skills that companies will actually pay you money for. Nobody likes someone who is just boring and sad all the time. Stay positive and hopeful and active and get excited over things. 

Most importantly, don‚Äôt take the weight of the world‚Äôs problems and other peoples‚Äô problems onto your own shoulders. The world feels ugly when you do that, and it‚Äôs not. There‚Äôs beauty everyfuckingwhere, and a lot of sweet caring funny people all around you all the time who would love to get to know you better if you just let them. 

Graduate high school and bust outta the gate ready to grab life by the nutsack, start to carve out your niche in the world, mack out on some hot dudes along the way, and rock n roll the shit outta your shit!"
I think everyone has this issue. Haha

"YOU ARE PAST ""HINTING""!!!!!! Talk to him even before you get amorous!!  You gotta tell him that he's not listening to you...he's being too rough...AND a bleeding ass IS NOT the sign of a skilled lover. Don't let your fear of ""losing"" him stop you.  Someone who treats you like this will only continue to USE you in other ways!"
"I've been doing this for years... 

You guys are just now figuring this out? 

You'll be surprised by how basic gays are everywhere tbh

The Gay Agenda
And straight means all girls? Do you want to fuck every pussy in the world? Probably not. Just experiment. You are young. Live a little. 
I read enema first...

"My type is a hairy, 6'0 dom top stud who treats me like a prince and fucks me well, uses his turn signal, has intellect, a good credit score, and a six-figure income.

"Back then there wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äústraight‚Äù and ‚Äúgay‚Äù, just ‚Äúdominant‚Äù/top and ‚Äúsubmissive‚Äù/bottom.  It was pretty much grown men fucking fresh faced twinks who just joined the army or took up their trade/craft who were stuck being sub bottoms out of a sense of ‚Äúpaying their dues‚Äù and ‚Äúrespecting their elders‚Äù.  Then when they got older they then turned around and fucked the next generation of young studs.

The ‚Äúout and proud‚Äù gay Greco-Roman warrior is a romanticization at best and a myth at worst..

I‚Äôm not sure if their relationships are comparable to thegay relationships of today.  If anything, they‚Äôre more comparable to the horror stories of college freshmen pledging to fraternities and getting sexually abused by upperclassmen."
"Yes definitely. There's something kind of cute about being with an inexperienced guy. Getting to teach him shit, being the first one to make him feel certain things"
OP are you just practicing you're creative writing skills or something because this and your last post are just way too cute and perfect  ïÔø´·¥•Ôø© î
OP's not into getting humiliated and pissed on... that's not all that exists in the BDSM scene.
HURR DURR WHY WONT YOU TOLERATE MY INTOLERANCE!?!!?!?!?!?!?
"I heard it in person a lot in Seattle. A lot of the gay scene I interacted with seemed to think it was socially unacceptable for a masc man not to like feminine men. ""Discriminatory"" was thrown a lot, and I rolled my eyes so hard my neck snapped and I'm dead."
"I wouldn't invite a gay man to have sex with my wife and I, only another bisexual guy. I would honestly consider it kinda rude."
"I brought my boyfriend to my 10 year reunion. I wasn't the only one to come out after high school so we weren't the only gay couple. Everyone else was totally cool with everything.

I say bring him, have some drinks and have fun "
In other news the sky is blue and water is wet 
"I can tell just from your post you're using way too much water. You don't need a deep clean unless you're doing some deep fisting. I'm guessing that's not the case. 

Just do what you were doing, and use less water. Maybe take some immodium several hours before sex as well."
"they just have a casual interest in actually hanging out.  nothing serious.  

when they say 'lets hang out again' you should reply with 'ok when are you free?'

see how that unfolds."
"&gt;I desperately want to go and just cause a lot of physical harm to this man, the only this stopping me is the threat of prosecution honestly.

Dude YouTube doesnt demonetize LGBT creators. The demonetize everyone. 
NEVER! Clutch that bible and make sure to sleep in separate beds too. 
"I mean, you‚Äôre helping him cheat on his wife, sooo...."
"The answers here seem to mostly imply that wealth is simply a matter of personal choices and daring-do.

The fuck.

I don't know where y'all live where upward social mobility is so damn easy, but I live around hard-working people, smart people - and a good chunk of them is dirt poor. 

It's not because they're lazy or chasing a dream - it's because they weren't born into wealth, and the only educational and employment opportunities that they have can't provide them with anything beyond basic sustenance.

So yeah, I'd date a poor guy. Would also date a rich guy - as long as he didn't keep insisting that being poor is a mindset."
Exactly....what a bitch
"The one thing I learned from all this is that Russian air cadets have good taste in underwear, look too twinkish for their own good, and some, have good pecs/nips.

"Never let pigs in your house without a warrant. Don't even open the door for them. Lesson learned there.

As you were told, never speak to them beyond basic stuff at traffic stops without talking to a lawyer. If they try to pressure you, record it, that's legal anywhere in the US. (Despite what they'll tell you)

I dunno what they're gonna try and book you with. If I had to guess I'd guess he said he was raped. That's the only thing that makes sense, as barebacking isn't a crime. I'd look into gay advocacy groups ASAP that can get you a lawyer.

Don't sweat it. Honestly sounds like he was a freak. "
"It actually really surprises me he‚Äôs the first open gay person in the Olympics.  I would have thought someone would have been out by now, but I guess not.  It‚Äôs nice that young kids are starting to have role models they can look up to. "

Damn how long was that dick

"I had a lot of straight friends that wouldnt care about getting naked in front of each other. 

It seems like the best way to act straight is to get naked in front of other guys. Quick we know their secret now!"
"Seems like you have a few options (keeping in mind that you don't want to continue switching off like you have been): 

1. Anal just won't be a part of your sex life. There are still plenty of other ways to have sex and enjoy each others' bodies.
2. Open your relationship a bit and find bottoms to ""share"" for threesomes. There are plenty out there who'd be happy to lend an ass.
3. Open your relationship a bit more and pursue other bottoms independently. "
"The fact that he never told you that he had a boyfriend in the first place is so deceitful, I'm sure you were definitely heartbroken. "
21 hookups over 90 days is pretty decent but I just don‚Äôt know where people find the energy for that lmfao. Last week I had 3 hookups and it got to the point where I was thinking how I‚Äôd rather just be at home :/
[deleted]
Not all guys like anal sex. And not all same sex male relationships have anal sex.
"And so the solution is just to ignore the fact that people have individual identities and deny them all safety and a chance for a few a future, just because they subscribe to a belief system? Shitty people are shitty people, man. There are shitty muslims, shitty Canadians, shitty Christians, shitty everythings, but it‚Äôs not those qualities that makes them shitty. Any hostile beliefs that the average Saudi citizen has are because they‚Äôve never known anything else. Isn‚Äôt it better to teach them why people are worth loving and protecting by doing the same to them? 

I‚Äôm a bi Canadian and you‚Äôre right- I absolutely do open my arms to these people. Of all people, the gay community should understand why fear driven by a single label is destructive. "
Hell yeah!!! I get hard every time I see it happen 
"""You convert hex to binary really fast."""
My brother used to have them as pets. They wake him up in the morning because they think no one should sleep passed 6am.
"If you both love each other, there is certainly no reason that needs to affect your living situation. I wouldn‚Äôt even think about a divorce (not sure why everyone is bringing it up) unless one of you wants to remarry. If you both still love each other, you can each pursue people in romantic and sexual manners and still live with each other for support and for your kids. Freddie Mercury did about the same thing."
"Feminine, dont like football, dont go to the gym, dont do sports at college. That's a gay guy in a nutshell, liking dick is not necessary at all/s"
"It's pretty common though you may need to suspend some disbelief.  I tend to be more sub and love wrestling around (if I lose), and doms like me because I look like I would dominate other men."
"To be honest, the strangest/weirdest is probably the stuff said by the 6 y.o. girl who I look after fairly often. A rough translation into English:

*‚ÄúAlex, you‚Äôre so nice! I wish we could play every day. But don‚Äôt worry, when you die, I will bring a beautiful flower to your grave every day, I promise!‚Äù*"
"""Very well, if you're sure. Then better be, Anal Warts!"""
I'm Asian but I never felt bad about being Asian. I think I'm pretty hot :p
You just blew OP's mind. 
"&gt;I was dumb as fuck

Well, then at least don't be dumb right now and stop asking for medical advise on reddit. Go to specialist."
"On the smaller side here.

* I mostly bottom. Tops don't seem to care very much, thankfully. I am embarrassed to try topping before I get to know the person better. I've only tried topping once. I think I was too nervous and couldn't stay hard enough to penetrate.
* I'm very self-conscious in locker rooms.
* When people make dick jokes or a group of guys are exchanging lewd banter, I tend to stay quiet. I know it's not like anyone knows I have small dick, but I feel like my insecurity would just shine through. I wonder if having a small penis has made me a more insecure, less confident person overall. I confess that the size of my penis crosses my mind fairly often, probably once a day or more.
* **EDIT - a positive:** even a mediocre cocksucker can easily fit my whole dick in his mouth.

That's about it."
"Be firm, it's your body not his. He is taking, you are allowing. If it gets out of balance your relationship is doomed anyway.

He needs to be willing to accept a ""no"" then work towards a compromise."
"oh shit.

someone end me :/"
Life without sex much more frustrating. Especially sex you don't like. IMO 
Getting to make out with dudes is certainly a beneficial aspect.
