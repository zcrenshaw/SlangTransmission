"Today when I was pumping iron at the gym with my masc str8 military bros I saw the most unimaginably nelly queen this side of Fire Island on a bike in the ~~women's~~ cardio section. At first I thought he was a goddamn female because his shorts came above his knees and his hair wasn't buzzed, but when I got on the treadmill to do my masc sprints he smiled at me and said something.

I took out my headphones because I couldn't hear ""him"" over my Rammstein. ""what's that?""

And then ""he"" opened his mouth and basically puked up a fucking rainbow when ""he"" said, ""oh I just said hello. How are you?""

I froze. Now that this fucking faggot had opened ""his"" mouth I knew that everyone in the room was not only aware that this drag queen was gay, but also could see that ""he"" was talking to *me*. I looked over at my masc bros but thank God they hadn't noticed; they were too busy miring each other and feeling each other's swole quads and glutes. But time was of the essence, if they found me talking to this drag queen I knew they would remember I was an androphile (I'm so str8-acting that even people who find out I'm an invert sometimes forget) and stop letting me into the gang shower with them. 

I turned back to him. ""I'm okay, bro. But could you keep it down? I'm just trying to work out. But hey, have a good workout ok?""

""He"" smiled at me again (such a feminine gesture, ugh). ""yeah, you too.""

Then I don't know what came over me, but I guess I was feeling generous since I know that fem fags like ""him"" are constantly desperate for the attention of Real Alpha Men Like Me, so I winked and told him, ""nice form brah."" and even though I puked in my mouth a little bit when I said it, I knew that I had made his day, maybe his entire week! I'm all about helping the poor and downtrodden, so it's always nice to give a few pity flirts, maybe even a pity fuck once in a while. Fem faggots may look, act, walk, and talk like femoids, but at the end of the day they have a dick, so they're human and should be treated as such, even if everything else about them is revolting. "
Just sounds like typical straight bros going to the bathhouse dude. Like is it really that gay to be surrounded by naked wet men cruising each other? 
"Everyone knows that the opinion of random ladies on the street is important and we should rethink our gayness. 
Well, rest in peace, brother, for you are deader than dogs. "
"Well not during but close enough to it:

We were in his yard naked laying in the sun having just had sex. My dick was still in him. The home is VERY secluded, long driveway and thick foliage etc. That day a package delivery came in and needed to get dropped off at the door. I was laying on top of him and we were both belly down when we heard truck driving up the gravel driveway...and we were about 50 feet from anything resembling cover except our sandals and a lounge chair cushion.  So I rolled us off the cushion and kind of just held it in front of us and we waved over the top...because we didn't know what else to do. Guy put the package down in the middle of the fucking driveway and SLOWLY BACKED DOWN THE ENTIRE WAY TO THE STREET.

Oh and this was immediately after we told each other we loved each other for the first time.

Also yes my dick was still in him the whole time getting caught turned us the fuck on."
"A guy was giving me a blowjob that was probably one of the best I've ever had and in the middle of it all I sighed the words ""goodness gracious!""

I honestly don't know what I was intending to say when that came out... Living it down was tough though."
"You just gave all the girly boys here a reason to live man. Have an upvote. 

You're going to get so much karma from this post! "
I was eating this guy out and out of nowhere he screams ‚ÄúGet away!!!‚Äù And proceeds to shove me as he lets out this massive fart. Must‚Äôve been about 10 seconds long before we both just start dying of laughter.

"Back in the 70s I took a guy I just picked up in a bar home to a lesbian friend's apartment.  Her male room mate was out of town and she said we could use his bedroom (we had all been out clubbing together).  After we got started I realized from his size I would need lube for anal sex.  He got up and went into their bathroom.  Came back and said he found a tub of Vaseline.  Got back in bed and greased his willy up and slid right on in and started pumping away.  After just a few seconds we both realized something was wrong and things were starting to burn.  He turned on the night-stand lamp and looked at the jar ... Vicks Vapo Rub!  At least he was able to wipe it off.  I, on the other hand, couldn't."
"I have to breathe and remind myself sometimes how many younger guys are on this sub who just haven't had the life experience yet to realize that there are so many things in another person that will end up mattering more to you than ""masc"" or ""fem.""

"Maybe more prone to abuse but at least gays will stop asking questions like ""I think this guy is gay, how do I approach him?"" Or ""Is this guy gay?"" Or ""AM I GAY?"""

"None of this is your fault, you just got tangled into somebody else's mess. Do not doubt yourself or anything  you ever did bc there is nothing that you could have possibly done to make him get on grindr. 

Please please just leave him behind. Do not get back with him if he asks to!! Try your best to not obsess over this trauma and focus on the moment. This is not your fight, but remember the next time you see lgbt people not being allowed to express themselves, it not only hurts them, but others too, like you were here. 

Take care of yourself, call shelters. 211, etc etc. put all your belongings in a storage so you dont have to leave it at his place. I have been homeless, but everyone's situation is different so feel free to message me if you feel like there's something I can help you with. 

You are very strong. And intelligent. Most people would put the blame on all gays being sluts and ""taking away their man"" and not the oppressive culture. You deserve someone who can appreciate your intelligence. Wish you all the best "

"Ahahha that's so funny. Just imagining it.

Erm. Post sex, we were lying in bed together playing around and laughing, then I gave him a light hearted slap on the thigh. Little did I know I actually slapped his balls. The look of shock on his face was so funny I couldnt stop laughing, but I was so apologetic. His tender nuts were fine."
"This is the ideal sibling relationship. You may not like it but, this is what peak performance looks like."
"It honestly doesn't matter how well your family took it or how ""chill"" they are. If you're private and it made you unhappy, and he took your reaction lightly, you need to stand firm and express why you were uncomfortable. He should be able to understand where you are coming from, even if he doesn't agree with your reaction. Dismissing someone's desires and their hurt feelings isn't a good look on anyone. "

One thing you experience in college are people who have a very inflated opinion of how smart they are and how much they know. It's a low form of elitism and common snobbery. The comment about psychology was meant to be demeaning.

"It seems to me that it‚Äôs likely he could be questioning his gender. That‚Äôs a tough situation for him. And also for you. 

It‚Äôs also understandable that since you are a gay man you won‚Äôt find a trans woman sexually attractive. There are couples that managed to stay together after one partners transition but if you think you can‚Äôt make that, you don‚Äôt have to."
My barber today kept rubbing his dick on my elbow every time he went to trim the sides of my hair and that‚Äôs all I could think about. I reckon there were about 3 questions he asked me that I didn‚Äôt even acknowledge because my mind was far gone into a very different place 
"You might want to try a more trans-friendly subreddit, like/r/asktransgender. 

I'm in a similar position. My boyfriend is straight, and I'm a trans man. We were together for over five years before I realized I was trans and decided to transition. We've stayed together so far through my transition, over six months now. I'm not gonna lie, it's a bit of a mess. He still loves me; I still love him. I'm the same person I was before. But he's not attracted to men. He's not grossed out; we're to comfortable and familiar with each other for that. But the attraction really isn't there anymore.

It really hurts to see that the process of me finally becoming comfortable with my body is making him lose interest in me, physically. It's not his fault, though. He can't change his sexuality for me, and I can't change my gender for him. I don't know if we'll stay together; I suspect probably not long term. But whatever else happens, he's still my best friend.

I don't know where your journey will take you, but my advice is to take it one day at a time. There's no need to have an answer today. Be open and honest with your partner about your concerns and fears, and remind them that you love them. I've definitely heard of trans partners who ended up describing their sexuality as straight/gay with one notable exception. Whatever happens, it's neither of your faults. "
Damn.. someone get this man a glass of water cause he thirsty af. 
"Something kind of similar happened to me. We chatted for about a week before coordinating the hookup, he was pretty cool and mature for his age and his profile said he was 18 and he had just graduated which kinda weirded me out too. Then as the day before came about, he text me and came clean that he was actually 17 and his bday was in a week.
 The fucked up thing was that I was actually going to invite him over that next day and i kept thinking to myself ‚Äúdid they bring back To Catch a Predator and am I on it? Is Chris Hanson gonna walk in my door?!‚Äù I freaked out and blocked him and reported his Grindr. However he hit me up a month later with a pic of his ID and I met him in a public place and I verified his ID was real (I worked at a bank and knew the identifiers). He apologized profusely and understood why I was pissed and actually thanked me because he didn‚Äôt know how serious of a situation he put me in. I accepted his apology along with a BJ to burry the hatchet"

"I have lived my life in three separate committed relationships.  Over forty years together all told.  Each relationship between humans is a unique event, based on it's own particular terms.

My first lover and I were together for 16 years.  We lost our virginity together.  We met in the military.  This was back in the bad old days, when they would still send you to jail for being gay, then a dishonorable discharge.  Very much loving and living in the catacombs.

This relationship ended due to the AIDS train wreck.  Simple as that.  We watched all our friends die one by one.  For years we were wondering if we were going to get it too, because no one knew what was causing it.  The town we lived in had a candidate running for mayor who kept saying, ""the cure for AIDS is a 357 bullet"".  The politics and the way people treated us was horrible.

By our mid 30s, only we were left.  We were going through the emotions that people don't normally experience until their 70s, and we were completely isolated, condemned by family and society, and no where to turn for genuine connection.  My first lover simply snapped.  He left me saying, ""I'm completely in love with you, but I hate being gay"".  He went out to be straight, and it ended disastrously for him.

I went celibate for a while, to avoid rebound, and then met my second lover.  We were together 7 years.  Gosh he was such a joyful romp.  It was like having a second bite at the apple of youth.  We always kept separate houses, but we are always at one or the other every night together.  We went our separate ways on the best of terms, and respecting each other utterly, but due to religious differences.  I am a committed Christian, and he is a totally committed Wiccan.  In the end he did not feel like he could make that difference work.  But we love each other and honor each other all the way.

Again, I went celibate for a couple of years to avoid rebound, and thinking that the jig was probably up.  I was content with the love of those two men, and the idea of remaining single for the duration did not disturb me at all.  Then my third lover came up and bit me on the tush.  He and I have been together for a little over twenty years now.  I think this one is going all the way.

"Alternate viewpoint: Since everybody can see how widespread it was in the ancient world, society never really goes from the antiquity ‚Äúwho gives a crap, all the Roman emperors have male lovers‚Äù of 600 BC - 300 AD to the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a sin kill them all‚Äù phase subsequently after, and errybody stays cool with it up until today

Maybe wishful thinking"
"I think you should bring it up and tell him that‚Äôs not okay with you. Unless you really didn‚Äôt mind it. But it sounds like you have some negative feelings about it, so I‚Äôd be honest and tell him."
"Man, that's so gay."
"Yeah; I think he‚Äôs working trough stuff. 

After accepting that you‚Äôre gay, lasting until even some time after you come out to everyone else (arguably until the day you die), there‚Äôs a conflict over identity. It‚Äôs part of the human condition, but more pronounced in the gay community.

On one hand, you‚Äôre supposed to be yourself. On the other hand, there is a pressure within the gay community to conform: to change. Again, this happens within any community, but it‚Äôs particularly strong in the gay community since you‚Äôre unlikely to see an example of the community that is not either conformed, stereotypical, or superficial. 

So there‚Äôs a very strong voice of ‚Äúbe this way,‚Äù when you‚Äôre gay. And it‚Äôs easy for a lot of people to deal with that, usually because they‚Äôre pretty close to ‚Äúthis way.‚Äù For others, being ‚Äúthis way,‚Äù requires sacrificing important parts of your identity.

So people in that place basically have to choose what part of their identity to sacrifice for the other. They can be ‚Äúthis way,‚Äù and gain the ability to participate in gay culture, or they cannot, and end up feeling isolated from gay people. 

So they end up resenting gay people who are so easily ‚Äúthis way,‚Äù because makes it feel like those people are the reason the choice has to be made. 

In the end, of course, the choice doesn‚Äôt have to be made, much less that people who are ‚Äúthis way‚Äù are to blame. But to realize that takes time. You have to find your own people and grow secure in your own identity. 

It‚Äôs not an excuse, of course. But if we want to improve our community, we need to understand the feelings of others, and be aware of how people perceive our community."

"This is actually how I ended up sucking my first dick.

Dude was my best friend at the time, and it totally went down just like that.

At this point we had already made plans for me to stay over his house that night to play Sega and watch movies, so guess what I did 4 times that night. lol

"I don't mind it in porn, but it bugs me when some gay men only crush on straight men, or think straight men are more attractive, or superior in any way, or find (real or fictitious) stories ""hotter"" if they involve a straight man who gets ""turned"" rather than a gay guy who knows himself and is sexually confident."
"I lit a candle to set the mood, and we were in bed with things getting hot and heavy when the candle burned down to the base and started smoking, so, simultaneously, the room went pitch black dark *and* the smoke alarm went off. (If you haven't experienced this, a smoke alarm going off is a real boner killer.) So, I had to feel my way to the light switch, knocking over a chair in the process, and then I had to stand on the chair, still stark naked, to disable the smoke detector. About this time, my roommate started knocking on my door to see if everything was OK... So, attempt to set mood --&gt; mood is ruined. "
"Hi, so I am living HIV. This is actually the first time  I‚Äôm gonna talk about it in a public forum...but it‚Äôs worth it.

I‚Äôve been living with HIV for almost three years now. My close friends know, but not my family. I‚Äôve been undetectable for almost the entire time I‚Äôve had HIV because I got it treated right away and I took and continue to take my meds every day. 

Everyone that I know that has HIV goes through it differently. Some people refused to get it treated and continued to partake in their dangerous habits (drugs and unprotected sex), some people got super depressed, some people told no one, and some people, like me, just got into action. It sounds to me like your friend is somewhere between OMG and it‚Äôs all gonna be ok. That‚Äôs a good place to be.

Like many have said, if he hasn‚Äôt started treatment yet, he needs to get on that. There are programs out there that help with the cost of the pills regardless of his health insurance situation. His primary doctor can tell him more about that. I would also recommend that he switches to a primary doctor that specializes in HIV. I did, and it was an immense help. 

My doctor got me on the best meds. I‚Äôm on Complera, a small pill I take daily, and can take with any liquid (gurl, I‚Äôve had it with my dinner cocktail). If he seems like the responsible type, he should be fine.

Once you‚Äôre on meds, the doctor will probably have him come once every few months to check liver and if kidney levels (common side effects). I never had a problem, but worse case scenario, they‚Äôll put him on diff meds.

Getting HIV also made me start taking care of myself just in general. I started going to the gym regularly and eating healthier (I‚Äôve lost ten pounds and am in better shape than I ever was)

Medical stuff aside...what can you do?

Just be. Literally just be there for him.  When he goes through a hard time, what does he ask of you? A shoulder to cry on? A drink? To not talk about it? Sleepover? Whatever that is, just do that for him.  And respect him when he says he is fine. THE BEST THING MY FRIENDS HAVE DONE WAS BELIEVING ME WHEN INSAID I WAS FINE. 

My life is not about my disease. My life is about everything else that makes life great. My life is about my nephews and my career, and the boys I date and those that break my heart. My life is bout dancing and singing and the play I‚Äôm working on. My life is about my kitty and RUPAUL and Stevie Nicks. My life is not about the virus, my meds, my condition, or any of that. My life is about me.

And lastly, yes. There will be times that are worse than others. I‚Äôve dated guys who after I said I‚Äôm poz, even tho I‚Äôm undetectable, they run like the wind...and that hurts EVERY SINGLE TIME. Sometimes I get down cuz I can‚Äôt remember if I took my meds and it frustrates me randomly that I even have to take them...but the more time progresses the less that stuff bothers me. And my friends are there when I need to vent. And they remind me I‚Äôm amazing.

I would not be alive without them. 

So just be his friend. Just like you‚Äôve always been. Love him. Just like you always have. Don‚Äôt focus on his disease. Celebrate his life.

"This thread is fucking hilarious, comments included.

What happened to me is not as funny written, but it was so embarassing when it happened. It was with a guy I really liked but due to circumstances, we had to wait to see each other, so when we finally fucked for the first time (and keep in mind I was really into him), I got so nervous that at one point I thought I was kissing his bicep until I realized it was actually mine. That guys¬¥ face, Jesus... he actually asked me if it was my first time ever. "

"I was FWB with a guy that was a non smoker, then smoked, then eventually quit.

Without too much TMI, smoking makes his spunk taste terrible. Also making kissing a really unpleasant experience.

Also annoying when you guys are out doing whatever having fun and then he has to take a smoke break.

It's not something you can ignore, and it sounds like you are already against it from the beginning. You shouldn't pursue anything further unless he quits. 

Also, don't get together with him promising that he'll quit in a month or two. Smoking is super addicting and if you get invested and he doesn't quit it'll put a strain on the relationship."

"It could work. Both of you have to be crazy honest during the transition. You must be incredibly supportive of her during this time, transitioning is no joke and can dredge up a lot of shitty memories and HRT can create a lot of highs and lows at the beginning.

If you want to do this because you love her more than anything and plan on partnering with her for the foreseeable future, great. But if there‚Äôs a part of you that will resent her for transitioning, don‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt stay with her if you‚Äôre trying to be compassionate. Don‚Äôt stay with her if you think ‚Äúthis is what I‚Äôm supposed to do to be supportive.‚Äù The vast majority of relationships do not survive a transition.

"Honestly, if someone ranted this to me at a bar I'd probably bang them.  ""I'm too fat and black for grindr""  hahaha!!!"
"Yes. 

Therapy did fuck all for me until I told my therapist everything. I never hid my gayness, but I hid a lot of stuff that I was ashamed of, and in doing so I inadvertently messed up my own treatment. She couldn‚Äôt help me because she didn‚Äôt know what was wrong. "
"By first trying to see it from his perspective. He is in enemy territory trying to win over your family, he might be a bit defensive just on the fact that he‚Äôs out numbered and trying the best he can to make an awkward situation more workable, which can sometimes involve diving into super awkward things on purpose. 

If you try to see it from his perspective, and talk to him about how you understand how hard it must be in his shoes right now, that takes the edge off of the feeling of being attacked and lets his guard down to see your side of things. 

TL:DR - If you want empathy, you first have to give it yourself. "

"He loves you. He seems like he's still coming to terms with his sexuality, so I wouldn't spring anything on him. Just let him figure things out for himself. I wouldn't hold up my love life and hustle though waiting for him, unless of course you love him too. Just keep being there for him as a friend for now. It's tough, human sexuality can be a tricky thing. "

"Gay dating is REALLY hard. The best thing to do is actually not turn to apps but try your best to immerse yourself into the real world around you. Go volunteer, join clubs, get educated, work hard, and stay out of the house. 

We have such a limited pool of candidates who all have issues since being gay often brings its own mess. It‚Äôs challenging enough without limiting yourself. But apps are proven to generate self-destructive behaviors, lackluster connections, ghosting, and a mentality of seeking mass approval to quickly inflate your own ego. It‚Äôs like a high from drugs to make you feel good even if it‚Äôs only temporary. 

That last point is dangerous. We can often find ourselves having a difficult time getting validation or connections in the every day. Tuning to online sources that streamline you to an anonymous mass audience can be oh so tempting. After all, there‚Äôs built in ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù buttons. But it‚Äôs not a form of validation that‚Äôll make you feel fulfilled. 

As a gay man or woman, it can be beyond tough to find relatable companionship even just at the friend level. Avoid pitfalls where you tie your happiness down to the screen of your phone/laptop. "

"I can understand how this can be a hurtful situation, but allow me to look at it in a different light.

My mother often did the same thing, asking me about girls even though she knew I was gay, and it bothered me a lot. So, one day I called her out on it, and asked why. 

She then told me that there were a couple of reasons, first and foremost that she didn‚Äôt want me to feel ¬´locked in¬ª by expectations again. In other words, if I ever actually fell in love with a girl, she didn‚Äôt want me to feel like I had to ¬´come out¬ª as straight or bi again, if that makes sense. Her stance was, so long as you love that person, their gender didn‚Äôt matter. Which was even more progressive than I was at the time. 

The second reason was that she didn‚Äôt know whether it was okay by me to ask me about boys. She didnt want to make me uncomfortable. 

In my case, my mom mostly had my best at heart, and she didn‚Äôt want to force me into any booths, and she simply didn‚Äôt want to make me uncomfortable. 

I don‚Äôt know your mother‚Äôs intentions, and I don‚Äôt pretend that I do, but the best course of action is almost always to communicate, and not let things fester. If this is making you uncomfortable, let her know in a non-hostile and calm way. 

Edit: 
My point here, was that most parents simply want the best for their children, but far too often we have completely different opinions on what that is, which causes conflict. That conflict is only made worse if we don‚Äôt communicate together, which most of us find difficult to do if we don‚Äôt feel we don‚Äôt have the other person‚Äôs support. "

"I believe this entire thread-- as well as OP-- are struggling with a linguistic issue over the word ""bath house"".

In America, ""bath house"" means exactly one thing-- a place men go go have sex with other men. The last time it meant anything else was a hundred years ago, before indoor plumbing was common, when it literally meant a place you could go take a bath.

In Korea and Japan, ""bath house"" is a spa. You go with your buddies-- or with your wife and kids and grandma-- to soak, steam, relax, and maybe get a treatment like a scrub.

In Korean, the word is [""jimjilbang""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jjimjilbang), which used to be translated as ""public bath"", until they started opening in America and people looked at them funny. Then it started getting translated as ""Korean Spa"".

In America, Korean and Japanese spas have always been popular with Korean and Japanese people. But then about ten years ago they started being a cult craze with white people too. I have taken my straight friends (of both genders) to spa. Straight people love spa. Gay people love spa. Everyone loves spa.

If you go with dudes, you will see each other's dicks. That might be a bit weird for work colleagues (in America, at least. Normal in Korea or Russia). If you go with ladies, there will be a co-ed area where you hang out with shorts and t-shirt.

"So, there's a few things to unpack here. First, the organization that ""banned"" drag queens was Glasgow Free Pride, which is different from Glasgow Pride -  Free pride is meant to be more radical and anti-commercial. This is in no way a mainstream position to be taking. 

Second, Glasgow Free Pride disputes that they were banning drag queens, instead saying that ""There was a decision to not book any drag acts, which has been overturned. Free Pride now welcomes drag performers of all genders and gender identities."" ([source](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/23/pride-event-drops-ban-and-will-now-allow-drag-queens/)). Not only, in their view, was it not actually a ban on drag performers, but it was one that they overturned when they saw the furor that their original decision (imo, rightly) caused within the LGBTQ community. ([here's a fun article by Miz Cracker from this season of RPDR on it](http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2015/07/29/glasgow_free_pride_banned_drag_queens_because_drag_is_offensive_but_that.html))

Third, this is a story from 2015. Why is it being brought up so much now, you might ask? Especially on right-wing websites like the [Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/29300/pride-parade-bans-drag-queens-over-fears-theyll-emily-zanotti)? With no reference to the fact that it wasn't really a ban, and the not-ban was overturned, and Glasgow Free Pride is an alternative offshoot of Glasgow pride that doesn't represent necessarily mainstream views of the LGBTQ community? Probably because they see an opportunity to sow discord in our community, and when we believe and share stories like these that might attempt to pit gay and trans communities against one another without reading more deeply, we play right into that narrative. Let's move forward together!"
"I‚Äôm bent over bf hitting it from the back, our parrot decides to show us he can fly and comes in hot landing right on my bfs back. I laughed, almost peed myself and then we were back at it. "
Then what the fuck are you doing
"Had a situation with a mechanic today that made me think of this question. I went to check on my car around lunch time and the only guy manning the shop is the one that immediately caught my eye when I dropped it off. 

He was late 20s, bearded, and he was muscular with some padding. In the morning he was wearing full coveralls, but then at lunch he had the top of them unbuttoned and tied at his waste and then had a white tshirt tucked into them that was see through in spots from sweat. A little tuft of hair was coming out of his collar and he was wiping grease off his hands when I came in.

I play it cool but the guy literally looks like he walked out of bear porn. He shakes my hand with a giant mit and then walks me over to my car. He pointed to the engine and I leaned in. I wasn't able to see what he was talking about so he leans in behind me to point. He pushed half his chest into my back and is pointing with his arm across my shoulder. I don't think he was making a pass. I just think he is the kind of guy that doesn't really mind touching or thinks about it.

After looking at the hood he notices I got dirt on the front of my shirt and takes a rag and starts wiping it off for me. He just totally wiped my chest for ten seconds working on the dirt. I felt like saying maybe I should just take my shirt off because it felt so much like a set up at that moment, but I chickened out on the joke. It just ended there."

I'm so sorry for what happened. You seem like an absolute sweetheart. I can't offer advice at this moment but I hope you manage to get everything back on track and sort things out. Sorry for him as well. He doesn't seem too nice a guy. He should have talked to you. Maybe he has a lot of his homosexual feelings repressed and isn't truly comfortable with it.
"No it can't.  You are attracted to what you are attracted to.  This is a man you've known for four years. You need to have an adult conversation about these things.  Tell him about how you feel and ask him to let you in on what he wants for his own happiness.  If that doesn't include you, then he has made his decision. Then you just have to determine if you can be happy without being attracted to him.  For most people that's a no.  Then you have made your decision."
"One time, I was out walking my dog and noticed a cute guy checking me out from across the street. On further inspection, said cute guy was my reflection from a store window. So yeah, I would apparently fuck me."

"Okay so I had this belt, two hoops to loop it through. Few times hooking up people have had trouble undoing it. One even asked if I had a chastity belt on lmao "
"Certainly **not** your crush anymore - *right?* Jesus christ.

If it just ""slips out"" of him during ""a heated moment"", then you sure as hell know that's not the only time he says it. Normal people don't just blurt out that word."
Then there was the time I was topping a guy and my ass is in perfect position for the dog to jump up on the bed and start licking my crack.
Marry him and have his babies.
"""it's not *really* magenta, you're just a pink guy who hasn't come out yet"""
"yup.  It tends to grow up, and is especially noticeable when the penis is hard.   Guys in porn shave, so it's not seen as very common if you watch porn.  So, yeah ... it's totally a Thing and very normal. "
Anal prolapse. My friends favorite pornstar (woman) had it. 
"I think people claiming to be non-binary are the most ridiculous things the modern era has produced and they spit on the real challenges LGBT people face as well as the entire movement to forward LGBT rights. Bitch, if you want attention, pretending to be an oppressed minority is NOT the way to fucking do it. "
That not all of us know each other
That's because guys will swipe right on every single profile they get and text the matched they find attractive. 
I'm British and I fail to see the problem here.
"It's soft and cold, just like a woman."
"This one time I was super drunk and I noticed a straight dude wrestling with another so I just went up to him and decide to wrestle him too...well, one thing led to another and nothing happened."
Sometimes yes. We will be talking and I will notice how nice his chest is or that he has a nice face and wonder what it would be like if we kissed. For boys I have a crush on this happens all the time
Forbidden fruit.. 
"No. I usually do wonder what their dick looks like, though."
So just your guys' usual sex routine then? ;)
... Ivanka?
because porn
She had a Grindr profile to hunt out the sinners
What holds you back from meeting new people?
"Let me ask my husband, he's 24 years older than I am, so he has more experience with these situations."
When he wakes me up in the middle of the night to eat my ass
"&gt; He tells me he isn't trans, he still identifies as bi

Gender and sexual orientation are not the same thing. You can be trans but still be ‚Äúbi‚Äù or attracted to more than one gender "
"Aren‚Äôt you a little young to be going to medical school? What country are you in? I‚Äôm a second year med student in US

Otherwise, this is an interesting experience. You must have a strong character to be getting yourself into this and I hope it only strengthens you. Outside of that, i am sorry you have to do this for money. I wish you the best in this and in your future in medicine. 

Stay safe. "
"This is an amazing, eye-opening read, and it hits so close to home. How have I never seen this before?! Thank you for sharing this, and take your gold, sir!"
"You are doing the number one thing that is best already by simply being there for him. Be an ear but don't push. Most importantly make sure he knows whatever his sexuality is, it's okay and that his secrets are safe with you. Be the friend he needs which it sounds like you are already trying to do."
Precise. Concise. Direct. 
That it isn't a choice.
"Right. I don't want to ruin anyone's marriage. Who wants to be that person??? But I enjoy him and his charm, which makes all reason go out of the window when I'm standing there looking him in the eye."
You aren‚Äòt overthinking and you aren‚Äôt acting like a prima donna. A line has been crossed and this needs to be said. 
"That the gay community wants to preach about kindness and acceptance, but on the other hand is extremely toxic and rude to each other with grindr and the hookup community. "
The men‚Äôs underwear section of the JCPenney catalog always intrigued me even before I knew what sex was. 
"Saw mike Rowe getting dirty on dirty jobs, he hammered home my daddy fetish...woof daddy! "
10/10 shitpost.
"aw. I can‚Äôt imagine how useful a place like this would have been when I was trying to navigate life as a closeted gay kid in a small town. I welcome those kinds of posts, there is always someone willing to read the whole thing and give some helpful advice. "
Madonna sucks.
"If you are really a 6'5"" 235 muscular beefy stuff, I'd be your top man all fucking day every day. I'm 6'0"" 190 toned on the way to muscular.

Want to meet up? "
"Honestly, although it is creepy, i only like it when the guy has a really nice smell."
You are not overthinking it. Tell him abt it again next time.
Not worth it.. means I have to deal with him longer. Id be better off just leaving him to his devices then thats all on him and ill be living my own life without that toxicity 
"We got the domestic partnership as soon as it was offered, and then haven't bothered since.  However, I am facing life threatening surgery this next month, so we are going to have a quiet marriage just to guarantee legal and inheritance rights.  Just in case."
"Dude, that love isn't unconditional. If they loved you unconditionally, then they would love you for the person you wanted to be.

I'm gonna be blunt here, but in truth they don't give a shit about you, all they give a shit about is maintaining the aristocracy, and keeping up appearances. That's exactly how you've landed up marrying a girl you don't want any physical or emotional relationship with, and on top of that, still feeling like you owe them a living!

Don't leave it a year, you're just wasting valuable time in your life where you could be living a life for yourself, and not for someone else. Bear in mind, you're wasting your wife's time as well, regardless of how you feel about her.

Its gonna be hard whenever you do it. Just grow a pair and get it done man. The sooner you do it, the sooner life will get better for you."
My boyfriend could post naked pictures today and I wouldn't care. He's got an amazing ass. People should see it. 
"Straight?  STRAIGHT?  STRAIGHT BOYS, WHERE?  OOGA BOOGA WHERE THE STRAIGHT BOYS AT?
