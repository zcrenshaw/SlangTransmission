"&gt;I understand that it‚Äôs a tough pill to swallow and it‚Äôs partially my fault for springing it on them so suddenly. 

Stop this line of thinking. There's really no way to gently ease them into it. It's not your fault, it's who you are, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. It's their responsibility to come around to you, and who you are, and to love you. This is their failure, it's not yours."

"Coming from a black male, I understand this. I used to wonder why guys didn‚Äôt find me attractive or why my white friends got more messages than me, but in the end, it‚Äôs not something you or I should worry about. If a guy likes you, he likes you. If not, oh well. Keep it moving.

In a way, I‚Äôm pretty thankful to have gotten the ‚Äúpreference‚Äù rejection. If it weren‚Äôt for experiencing that, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have started eating healthier, working out more, or have obtained the confidence I have now. I knew I couldn‚Äôt change the color of my skin, but it allowed me to take a good look at myself and focus on the things I could change to become the best version of myself.

With that said, I‚Äôd suggest getting off Grindr even for a short period of time. It can really weigh you down emotionally. I did it and I started to think with a clearer head. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you in the slightest. The app is filled with superficial guys who have the power to say whatever they want because they‚Äôre behind a screen. Remember that they‚Äôre not of any importance to you. 

Chin up big guy. "
"The only ones at fault here are the people who will choose a bigotry over their flesh and blood family.  Don't accept any guilt at all.  You don't ever have to edit who you are for those who would claim to be your intimates.  

Kiddo, I have been living on the gay parish for decades.  I have seen this situation unfold thousands of times.  Realize, that in most cases, the family does not come back around.  Don't arrange your life around the day that they come back and reconcile.  Most don't get that.

Starting now, look to your present, and look to your future.  Start cultivating wholesome associations and social groups.  Start cultivating up a family of your own choosing.  Place yourself, and place your relationship with your boyfriend in broader wholesome groupings.

I urge you to look into gay friendly churches and charities.  Check out the group called PFLAG.  (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays.)  This latter group can really help fill in the void when left out in the cold by family.  They will understand the whole situation having seen it so many times before.  They will also know of all the wholesome gay activities in your area that you and your boyfriend can access.

It is important that you not isolate.  Not as an individual, and not as a couple.  Move on with your life, and place yourself in life renewing circumstances and associations."

I thought it was a joke until the updated conversation. Hmm

No I'm not.
Wow he's only worried about how it affects him? What an asshole. Don't tolerate that negativity in your life. Being blood relatives means nothing if they're going to just make you feel bad about yourself. You deserve better than that.
"He (apparently) needs you... you don't need him.

Do not waiver in your position. If he shares some genuine, heart-to-heart thoughts with you, then continue conversing with him if you like. Do not send him any photos, etc. Do not do anything that feels unbalanced.

Stay on your strong foundation... do not let this guy chip away at that unless he really shows he's real. The work is all in his court... all you need to do is talk to him at your pleasure, and when it's no longer pleasurable, then move on. Plus, there is some reconciling that need to happen too, I guess, since he was such an asshole to you in the past."
He wants to be your BF not just a friend. You told him what you feel toward him. The truth is the ticket.
"First of all...

&gt;  he has mellowed out, even though he still does coke, weed, alcohol, and smokes. He is high often, which leaves me worried about addiction and perhaps deeper psych problems.

If this is your definition of mellow, boy oh boy. By the sounds of things this is a deeply, deeply troubled guy who could use the help of professionals. Whether he is gay is the least of your worries here, the bigger question should be how badly was he abused as a kid.

The video game thing is irrelevant tbh, I play games all day and ignore my boyfriend when I do. "
People don't care much about criminals and they see any kind of violence or violation of them as justice.
"It's not about feeling sorry for you or being a burden: you literally need help to survive. Being homeless is a terrible experience and you need to do whatever is necessary to make sure that doesn't happen. Call your friends. Explain what has happened. You do not need to provide the reasons why. This is essential. Staying with a friend is dramatically better than staying in a shelter.

After you've secured a place where you are safe, you need to make a plan. Already applying for jobs is really good. You're on the right path. But you need to consider a timeline of when the jobs might come through and how long until you can move.

Take only what you owned with you. This includes things that you have bought or were given to you as gifts. In most states and municipalities, this is an illegal eviction and if your family deprives you of your property they are doing something illegal."
"Massive big internet *HUGS* to you.

I'm speaking here as a man who was suicidal several times over the span of a year and a half, *because* of my inability to handle the emotional stress that I was under at the time.

I want you to hear three things more than anything else:

[A] This is NOT YOUR FAULT. You may be tempted to believe that it is. Don't. He is suffering massively. But *you* didn't cause it, you aren't responsible for it. He'd be suffering if you weren't there, too, because this is rooted in *him* and how he learned to handle hurts long in his past. This can be a hard thing to believe, for you and for him, and it's entirely possible that *he* won't believe it until he's gotten help and worked on it for a while. But it's true nonetheless.

[B] You CANNOT HEAL HIM. Oh, you can help take away the pain for a while, and he should be damned grateful to you if you do. And you can help build spaces where he can ... *hide*, maybe? ... from the pain, where he can exist for a while insulated from it. But as much as these help --- and oh, man do they help --- they're band-aids. Incredibly useful powerful almost *magical* band aids, but they don't get at the root problem, and so they have only a temporary effect outside the immediate context of each individual incident.

[c] YOU need to have help, too. It's great if you can stand by him and help him carry this burden, but you have a responsibility to yourself to see that you don't get hurt, too. If it's more than you can take, then protect yourself, but be as kind as you can be in the doing of it. But if you *do* stand by and try to help, then you will need help yourself. He's *going* to behave in ways that hurt you. Eventually, if he gets help and heals, he'll stop, but that's not a short-term thing, and when he hurts you, you're going to need people you can lean on. And even beyond that, the ... I dunno, when I was carrying my husband through a period of emotional turmoil less serious than something suicide-inducing, after a year of it my soul started to wither and die and by two years I was crushed under the weight of it --- but I had no help. So I urge you to make sure you *do*.

Alternative suggestion:  Why not try having two blankets in the same bed; one for you and one for him? It eliminates him being a covers hog, you're less likely to feel him fidgeting around if he has trouble getting to sleep, and he can't sleep diagonally or lie on top of you without bringing his entire blanket with him.  It might be a good midway point to give you the extra distance you need to get a good night's sleep, while keeping both of you in the same bed.     "

Then it's done. If you rarely spend time together, what are you actually losing?

I know it's bad to have a brother reacting like that, but it's better to accept that you're losing someone (who you didn't even kept contact anyway) than trying to win him over right now. Maybe with time he'll be more accepting and you can try talking with him again, who knows."

He needs to be seen by a good psychiatrist as soon as possible. Even before you clean him up would be best so that you are not ""sanitizing"" his person and so the psychiatrist can get the full flavor of his condition (no shoes, no shower, etc.).

He definitely has a serious problem.

"Sounds like you are sexually attracted primarily / only to men and you know it.  The fantasies about dating a woman most likely come from being shown straight couples as the primary romantic model in your parents, movies, weddings, songs, etc etc.  You should try to be more open minded about dating / falling in love with men, because it's going to be easier to broaden your thinking about what coupled life *should* look like as opposed to trying to change your mostly hard-wired sexual attraction.

Apparently he has a long history of being sort of the male version of a fag hag, but has never crossed the line as far as anyone knows. "
"Since we're gay, we tend to challenge every aspect of our lives because we can't just follow the typical life script that all our friends follow.

Yes we are sweetie and thankfully we are both healthy and strong being HIV + for over 25 years. We lost a lot of friends and family. I‚Äôm ok with old ‚ù§Ô∏è

"A lot of us started right where you are at now.  We went on to find a place in life, and earn a good living.  We made a circle of friends, found committed love, and built a family of our own choosing.  Please don't give up in this dark moment.  As trite as the old saying is, it is none the less true, it is darkest right before the dawn.

Let me join the others in urging you to gently put aside your false pride, and to accept the help of your friends.  Accept this help graciously, and be willing to help others once you have established a place of your own.  All of us have moments when we need help in life.  The issue is to pay if forward once we can help others.

Let me offer one little piece of advise from my own experience of being in your boat.  When you get your place and your job and start setting up your life, pause a bit on charging into the romantics.  Most of us gays who have taken ugly blows from family and society tend to charge into romantics, looking to those relationships to make up for what we have lost.  However well intentioned, this approach is ass backwards from what is most effective in life.

When you land on your feet, take the time to cultivate gay friends, and to find wholesome gay activities and circles.  Look into gay friendly churches and charities, and discover the hobbies and activities that give you joy in life.  Try to place yourself in those activities in gay settings.  Learn friendship and gain self respect first, and then having established this, move on to the romantics.

We are all rooting for you kiddo."
"Did you meet on Grindr or do you just find it a convenient messaging app?

Can kinda see how he may have got the wrong idea."
"I think it depends on the person and their situation.

In the vast majority of cases, being gay is going to make life harder. Reduced dating pool to find a partner, sky high rates of substance abuse, homophobia, religious oppression, discrimination - there isn't a country in the world where gay people don't face at least one or two of these issues.

Providing they mean it in a really honest ""I'd love them just the same, but I'd prefer they weren't..."" way, I don't think it's inherently evil to want your child to have the easiest time in life as is possible."
"I don't make a point of it, but having an openly gay character is plus point in my decision making process on whether or not I watch a show, but only one of many other variables."
"I‚Äôd Go for it, but both of you need to know what you want.

"I don't automatically assume they're gay but I tend to look out for guys who

1. dress super well,
2. deflects questions about their sexuality,
3. don't eye women when they pass (seriously too many straight guys' eyes follow a woman when she passes), 
4. interested in arts and humanities,
5. like what the other guy said, there's always *something* with the eye. 

Of course this is not always true. A guy who dresses well can just be a guy that dresses well. Men who don't eye women may just be decent men. But what I noticed is that most of the gay men I know have some of these characteristics."

"Let it go.

You have a crush on him. Cool. Is he gay?

You have no clue whether your friend is gay and you coming onto him could ruin your friendship. You can come out if you want to, but don't come out to him BECAUSE you want to date him. Come out to him because you want him to know and support you as a friend.

Don't put any pressure on him, don't ask him out on a date. Not until you at least know whether he is.

Don't shit where you eat, basically."
"To me it's ""gay eyes"". Idk how to explain it but there's just something in men eyes that can help me assume whether they're gay or not, on the other hand I pretty much don't want to assume and unless it's proven that they're gay I won't gossip around or anything."
"Well, I'm not in high school anymore so I don't really ever hear it used that way. If I did, I would relentlessly mock them."

Natural definitely.
"I have spent almost my whole adult life in three committed relationships.  The first started in our late teens and went 16 years.  All of my partners were and are twinks, and they have all three aged magnificently.  My current partner of twenty years is as sensual and sexy as a human can get, and my first two partners have gone on to successful marriages as well.

The key is to maintain a consistent diet and program of moderate exercise.  Avoid drugs and abusing alcohol.  Avoid smoking like the plague.  Take care of your body, and it will take care of you."
"I rarely ever message other guys online. 

From my experience, I have had many many, one more time MANY guys go out of their way to tell me that I'm not welcome to even be online.   I have very little connection with anyone in the gay community. There are MANY gay men out there that feel it is their responsibility to actively HATE people. 

I once went to bear event and was asked to not participate. The event was for WHITE bears ONLY. 

RACISM is a thing in the gay community. Might as well be a  KKK rally half the time. "
"That reminds me of my second ""encounter."" I thought the guy was way out of my league and there was no way he'd be attracted to me. And yet, he was."
"Definitely ran into my Philosophy prof on Grindr once...he had a faceless profile and tried to stay discrete but I eventually convinced him to send a pic validating it was him. 

I asked him if running into him on Grindr meant I passed his class and he blocked me until the end of term. "
Is it THAT prevalent? Most of the gay men I know would prefer a monogamous relationship. I am in a mongomous relationship.

"Getting my ears pierced was a very strange experience, I‚Äôll tell you that."
"This reminds me of my **movie experience**. I was traveling to another state for work and ended up sitting next to this super handsome guy. He was about 6 foot 3 inches tall, muscular/athletic build, well groomed and well dressed. I was desperate to talk to him and did my best not to stare at him or make my interest very obvious as to not make him uncomfortable. I began to listen to my music and would hold up my phone while displaying the album art of the gayest music I could think of (Britney, Beyonce, Gwenn, Madonna, etc) hoping that it would hint him that I am gay since I have been told that I do not make it very obvious. I had already planned the topic of our conversation in case a conversation broke out. And it did. We chatted about books, our reasons for travel, our interest in fitness, etc. Out of nowhere, he says we should exchange numbers so we would link up sometime. I was in shock... he was asking for my number!!!  Keep in mind that during this entire interaction, I was unsure whether he was just an extremely friendly straight guy or if he was 'interested'. He gave me his phone so that I could input my number and saved me as a contact. I asked him to message me so that I could add him back. We continued talking during the entire flight until we arrived at the destination. We said goodbye and went our separate ways. Later that day, I messaged him with a friendly ""*Hey this is -Specter from the airplane. It was nice meeting you today. I just got off from the hotel's gym and was wondering if you knew of any cool spot I should visit while in this city*"" he responded with a few ideas and then I remembered that he had mentioned working night shifts so I gathered all my courage and messaged him ""*Hey, you don't work tomorrow morning, so that means you could stay up late. Would you be down to get a couple of drinks with me?*"" HOLLY SHIT! This was the first time I have ever dared to be this forward. Soon the text app showed ""*typing...*"" the suspense was killing me! He then replied with ""*I'd love to!*"". AHHHH!!!!! HOLY MOTHER OF GOD! I was about to go out for drinks with this total stud of a man! I found his IG and saw several of his pics... he used to be a model... and did I mention that this guy was totally out of my league?! We met up and had dinner and drinks. I paid for it all since I was the one who invited. We stayed at the bar until it closed. As we were walking back to the car he asks ""*What now?*"". In my mind all I was thinking was ""*LET'S MAKE OUT!*"" but I calmly replied ""*we should look for another venue*"" he replied with ""*I don't really want to drink anymore, but I'd be totally down for a movie*"". I was confused... A movie? At this hour? I asked him ""*Are there any open theaters at this hour?*"" he replied with ""*Not really. I would offer us to go to my place but it's a total mess since I just came back from a long vacation.*"" I proposed we go to my hotel room and watch a movie there... I was so inexperienced and to this point, I was still questioning whether he was just a super friendly straight guy or if he was gay and interested in me. We arrive at my hotel room. This was the first time I had ever been in a hotel room with a complete stranger I didn't know how to feel about it. I loaded up a movie and offer him a pair of shorts and he begins to undress right in front of me!!!!!! AHHH!!! My heart was rushing, my eyes kept wandering in his direction, but I kept turning away because I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable. He puts on the shorts and kept his undershirt and underwear on. We laid down on the king size bed keeping distance. While we were watching it he takes off his cap, this was the first time I saw him without it and I said ""*that hair style looks really good on you dude, you're a very good looking guy.*"" And he replied with ""*Thanks! I think you are a very attractive guy as well*"" AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I was SO EXCITED!!!!!!!!!!!! MY HEART WAS RUSHING!!!! But I had to maintain my composure. I said ""*Thanks! How are the shorts? Comfy?*"" He replied with ""*Yeah, comfy enough for us to cuddle*""
**FUCK YES!!!!!!!!!** OHHH LORD THANK YOU!!!! HE IS GAY AND HE IS OBVIOUSLY INTO ME!!!!!!!! Hahahaha With a smile on my face I said ""*Sure, let's do that!*"" I asked him if he wanted to be the big spoon or little spoon, given that he was bigger then me he said ""*I'll be the big spoon, I think we'de be more comfortable that way*"" and we proceeded to cuddle up. Did I mention that he was tall and with an athletic build?! He made the bed look like a size smaller than it actually was... He was a marvel of a man. As we were watching the movie he caressed my arm and kissed me on the neck. **This was my chance... there was no going back.** I turned around and I kiss him and we begin a super intense make-out session. I was so high on the rush and so turned on by him and we proceeded to have the best and most intense sex I have ever had in my life. We cuddled up and went to sleep. The following day, I had to wake him up since I had to go to work. He left and told me to keep in touch. We added each other in social media and we chat every now and then. We lived half of a country away so nothing else came from it. I recently got into a relationship with the most wonderful man ever and now it is all a wonderful memory that will never repeat itself. Damn... I think I went overboard on the comment... I just get to excited when I remember this experience. It was a total movie experience! Hahaha"
One good thing about being a homo is that I‚Äôve gotten to choose my own family.

That's normal. Kissing a hot guy gets me horny. Holding hands too. 
I don‚Äôt think I would be able to go through with it. Even if my partner mentions it as a joke I‚Äôm almost positive I‚Äôd be super upset. Sex is intimate to me. I also want to marry my current partner one day so I don‚Äôt see it happening. But a guy I was dating two years ago propositioned this exact thing and basically told me he‚Äôd be my boyfriend but he wants to fuck anyone he wants. I broke it off immediately.
I think you should quit smoking; it's very unhealthy.

"I've read lots of your posts and comments, so I'm very familiar with you. 

From what I've learned about you, you suffer from very low self-esteem (you've called yourself unattractive, and useless on many occasions), and have very high standards when it comes to the men that you'd like to date: You're very picky (you've admitted this yourself many times), and don't possess the qualities to attract the guys that you consider physically and intellectually appealing. 

You've repeated incessantly how the only men that are interested in you are not worthy of your time, due to the fact that they don't  measure up to what you consider is ideal: They're too old, too ugly, not the race that you prefer... You dismiss them immediately, without giving them the opportunity to know you. 
You're lucky: there are plenty of men who attract no one. Despite of your many flaws, you've had dates, and more than enough sexual encounters. Many don't get even a man to be interested in them, yet you keep on complaining. 

I was very sympathetic and understanding when I started reading your posts and comments a long time ago, now I find them very annoying. I read your name and I know what to expect already: an endless and very tiring pity party. 

Most of your posts consist of you lamenting, regretting, feeling sad and lonely, and putting yourself down in very concerning and disturbing ways. Very frequently, I feel like you do it for attention. You keep bashing yourself so that others can continue commenting, and when the negative ones poured in, you cherish them because they feed your need for feeling like a failure. 

You are quite aware that you need professional assistance in order to improve your life; you've claimed that you've already consulted professionals in the mental health  field, and that they haven't been able to help you with your ""many problems."" They haven't been able to do so, because in order for them (or anyone, for that matter) to help you with your problems, you need to want, you must desire with all your heart to get better. And you don't want to. You don't do anything about it, but complain all the time about how lonely you are, how old and ugly are the men who message you, how aggravating your mother is, how depressed you're feeling, how you're getting older and nothing is changing... 
I truly believe that you like feeling like a victim: you secretly enjoy ""being misunderstood"" and sad all the time, because that's easier than do the work to better yourself. You're lazy, and I'm very sorry to say this, but you're also pathetic. 
How many comments have you received about what you need to do from Reddit alone? Hundreds of them! You do nothing! All the time you whine about how difficult your circumstances are, and that there's nothing you can do because ""this and that..."" 
If you really would like to change, you'd find a way and put the effort to do so by now. You live in the United States, you have multiple options. You just don't want to. It's easier that way. You're in your middle twenties already. Are you really going to let the time pass and carry on this way? How sad... And pathetic. 

This comment comes from a good place: I sincerely want to see you get better. You're quite clever and even witty, according to some comments that I've read from you. You have potential to be a valuable human being. You know what you've got to do. 

STOP COMPLAINING ALL THE TIME AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR SITUATION!

"What age are you two?

Honestly, there's not much to be done. If he doesn't want your company, you don't need his. How was your relationship with him until now?"
"At least you're only 23. I'm freakin' 29 and feel this way. 

Feels bad. "
"If you're still attracted to him, go with it.   If you're not interested, be kind about how you let him down.   Despite his seeming confidence, that is a deveststing thing for a man.  And obviously, he knows he's small.   

And don't think less of yourself if you're not interested in him because of this.   I know it's not fair to him, bit you can't control your sexual attraction.  

As long as you're not being a jerk about it, you can't blame yourself for how you feel.   "
"He could swear off his sexuality and be celibate. That I can believe. Plenty of people do it. As in, he is still gay but tries to not act on it.

But if he tries to be straight, all he will likely do is end up wasting his and some poor girls life in a sham marriage. "

"In a non-sexual way it's used as sort of a literature archetype, describing an average, plain, inert guy down the street who has an ordinary job, ordinary life and ordinary uneventful behavior. 

In sexual/flirty way, imagine the above guy but he is thicc in all the right places and mows his lawn shirtless, unaware of his attractiveness and always greets you politely when he sees you, but you want him to smash your bussy while peeking through your curtains to see his sweaty, muscular torso glistening in the sun"

There is a contingent of these people too.

2) stop sleeping with flatmates

Anyway, to me it sounds like you‚Äôre jealous that they spend more time with their gf than with you. Not saying you want to be their romantic interest, but from the way you worded things maybe you subconsciously do have feelings that go further than being friends?

What I would suggest: talk to them. Tell them how you feel. That their behavior hurts you. "

"This is the most perplexing bit. Most homophones don't think being gay is in any way genetic. So they couldn't maker fun of him without contradicting themselves.

Unless it's some small town in a religious area. I don't think logic would necessarily be that important.

N.B. I'm not saying small town people are all dumb!"
"&gt; You need to love yourself before anyone is going to love you.

I keep seeing that every now and then and it's probably the worst piece of advice anyone can offer to someone with insecurities, anxiety or depression.

*I'm not saying what you say isn't true*, but it completely disregard the amount of pressure an anxious/depressive person already experience and it adds on top ""you must love yourself first"" of a plate already full of stuffs to deal with.

Also, ""love yourself first"" is such a general statement. How much do you need to love yourself? Because for some it's the journey of a lifetime, for others they *accept* -PARTS- of them and it's enough to have a substantial relationship. 

**Finally**, no, depression is not okay, but making people feeling guilty of their depression is even worse. I think what OP might be hinting at is to *accept* how you feel instead of repressing it. *Acknowledge* how you truly feel. *Acknowledge* that you are not alone to feel like that.

Only once you have accepted your state of mind you can start dealing with it.

Just my two cents on the matter."
"i think it's mostly more ""ignorant"" than anything else. willful ignorance, however, is just plain stupid. "
"Everyone is lying to you. No, you're not technically ugly. Sure. That's true. 

But in the gay world of grindr and tinder you're not what people are looking for. 

Being black hurts you on grindr, and even worse being overweight too. That's the truth. You're average, but you're black. And most gays in the U.S. don't like black guys. This will be downvoted, but it's the truth amongst a sea of answers that won't admit it"
"It‚Äôs not a big deal at all. You can always get seltzer to soda at the bars, and everyone will love you for DD‚Äôing. Many people don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt drink for a number of reasons, and it isn‚Äôt something to be ashamed about. "
Yeah I have stretch marks on my ass and hips. I was borderline obese when I was younger. Still chubby but not as much as I was back then.
