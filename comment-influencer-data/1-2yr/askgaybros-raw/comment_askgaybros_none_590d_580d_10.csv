"Don't wanna sound mean, but this felt like reading a script for ""Get Out II"".

Ghost the hell out of him. "
I'm living in a world where a sock gets more dick than me. I'm gonna cry myself to sleep now. 
I shove my head inside and suffocate to death and then the butthole absorbs my brainwaves and I take over the host.
"""But then I realized that the labels don't matter and instead of thinking ""I like a guy"" I thought ""I like (insert his name)"" and that's true."" That's pretty key, and cute. Glad you all decided to take the plunge, wish you nothing but happiness."
"In my experience, holding hands and having eye contact makes sex about ten times better."
"I was at a (straight) bar with a mate, a few drinks deep and I was talking to this guy. Boy was he hot. At some point in the conversation I feel my hand moving up to his face and I swear to God the thing had a mind of its own and I remember thinking ""ABORT ABORT!!!"" To no avail. The eagle landed. He basically said ""Sorry dude but I'm not gay"" and my response, which is kinda my canned response when people say this is ""Well, no one's perfect."" I just remember thinking that I'm lucky he didn't deck me because I TOTALLY would have deserved it if he had."
"I don't take it as a compliment, but I don't find it insulting either. I just hope it makes them question the gay stereotype and realise that you can't tell what someone's sexual preferences are just from their appearance or behaviour. "
Doesn't sound like much of a friend 
"Sense8 also has a very hot guy's frontal, but he wasn't hard. "
"Speaking from personal experience, I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs a lot easier to risk making an ass of myself than it is to go to a funeral. 

I get what you‚Äôre saying about not wanting to come out and say ‚Äúhey man so the other day over the chat we heard...‚Äù at the risk of having the wrong idea and what not. No one likes the idea of their dirty laundry becoming public, sure. But you‚Äôre better off coming to him and asking about it. If you got it wrong, then you guys will have a (potentially) awkward conversation about a totally normal kink. If you got it right, you guys will have a (definitely) awkward conversation and potentially save your friends life. Domestic situations are tricky and if things are bad they generally only escalate. 

"
"Not me, but a friend of mine went to a bar with a group of his friends with the agreement that it would be 'Cheesy pickup line' night. He walked up to a guy and pulled out his shirt tag and said 'Yep'.

The other guy was like 'Yep what?'

To which my friend replied 'just had to check, that you were made in heaven'.

They're married now. (._.)"
"I've been doing it for a while, but it eventually gets boring. What I do now is to alternate between the socks in a pair. 

When I'm fucking one sock, I keep the other sock nearby so it can watch me like a cuckold."
*hugs*
"I was fucking a latino guy once and out of nowhere he screamed ""YEAH GIMME THAT BIG WHITE COCK"" and I almost burst out laughing but I came instead"
"me: im fat

also me: \*eating pizza\*"
"Vegan here, I swallow."
"You're not a pervert. You're not a creep. Finding people attractive and commenting about it is normal. It does seem that you have poor taste in friends, though.

Spilling that kind of information and starting a witch-hunt, that's called ""being a cunt."" "
"considering how single i am , every guy is my type."
"the only people who care if I'm gay or not are the ones who want to fuck me.

all my friends and family know and any coworker who asks knows (and it only has positive results)

nobody i know has ever reacted poorly or with negative comments.  coming out usually gets a indifferent silence or some mildly supportive comment or a 'why didn't you say something?'

i can freely comment on guys i find surprisingly cute in public.  both girls and guys im with will take a look - girls because they're interested guy's because they want to check the competition

i can watch any gay movie on netflix and my roommates will probably watch it with me (they've mostly been straight)

i can pick up guys at any club or pub and anywhere in public is fair game too

i can get married and divorced if i want

employers always go out of their way to show that orientation is a protected ground in the workplace

LGBT education begins in primary school despite some religious objection

LGBT rights are protected by law

People commonly realise that assuming someone is straight isn't a polite course of action and adjust their language to reflect that

I don't really think about coming out to people who ask.

I was beat up once because of it but that was mostly my own fault, and is the only negative experience I can think of.

I regularly go on dates and never think about who's watching (no one is watching).  PDA is fine and most guy's I'm with are fine with it too.

etc. etc.

ps: I'm in Canada"
I've come to the realization that I have to have my hookups with a good amount of intimacy and romanticism or I can't get it up. If it's just going to be a kinky fuck it's got to be with a boyfriend or someone I have a significant relationship with because without the intimate connection I'm just a limp noodle
"I was very drunk, in the closet for about 20 more minutes when I told a very attractive straight guy at a house party that if he needed anything I could help him out *wink*wink*. He's like no thanks man, I'm ok... I'm straight. He then proceeded to tell all my friends and I cried myself to sleep on the kitchen floor. Lol good times. "
Go you!!! ‚ù§ Parenting done right! 
"Girl

I wouldn't trust Ikea for that"
"They kinda do mean them as compliments.  Whether anyone wanfs to admit it or not, society has a very specific image of what a gay man is, an image that even gay men themselves buy into.  That‚Äôs literally the reason why the term ‚Äústraight acting‚Äù exists and why some gay guys conflate being ‚Äúopenly gay‚Äù with being flaming as fuck. 

That‚Äôs the reason why when a male athlete comes out as gay, he‚Äôs applauded as a hero and an inspiration to struggling gay kids, but when a female athlete comes out as a lesbian, everyone just shrugs their shoulders and are just like ‚Äúmeh‚Äù."
"The only similar thing that have happened to me was when I was watching a football match with my older brother. As a good big bro, he was forcing beer into me. I was very young back there, so a beer was enough to get my control somehow slip out of my hands...

He yelled at the screen angrily, because the player of the team he was cheering for fucked up something, and I said ""his calves, though""... (Ôæâ_-ÔΩ°)

Fortunatelly, my brother didn't understand what I said, lol. But I got like really hot and nervous inside. I reached sobriety in a snap of fingers!"
"You're 18 and an adult. She can't do shit without your consent. She can't send you anywhere.

I suggest trying to find an alternative place to stay if you worry it's not going to be safe for you."
"Fuck, man. Put this in /r/letsnotmeet immediately.

Glad you're safe."
If he could fuck me that would be lovely. 
I can give you more than a few inches ;)
"Crippling insecurity, commitment issues, too high standards, or just preferring casual sex without emotional commitment. Or, just not wanting to date at all and focus on one's self.

There's probably more, but those are just what I can come up with. Of course, this isn't entirely unique to gay men. Straight people experience all those same things, too."
Definitely the 2nd one. If you arn't eating ass like its your first meal in weeks then you're doing it wrong
"You're supposed to be her sexless, eunuch gay confidante who's always more lonely than she is."
He deepthroated me.
"Bro if you get embarrassed you give them power. Own your remarks and if anyone asks you about it just say ""yes he has a nice ass.""

People are gonna think what they will of you, but it's up to you to decide what bothers you when they gossip."
"When you really think about it. It's this obsession with what we do in the bedroom!! It's really actually creepy, the way the homophobes are soooooo worried where we put our dicks!!  "
"I respect people's beliefs, but to be honest it's hard for me to understand religious gay people."

"Good for you! No, seriously, asking people out takes nerve.

Now go out and do it again."

"Once on Grindr I got a new message and in typical Grindr fashion, the first message was a dickpic. I remember thinking OMG that cock is big, if I had to guess I'd say 9 or 10 inches. This was followed by a few more pics, some ass and body pics. The background in the pictures seemed familiar so I asked for a face pic as I was thinking it might be someone I knew. They send a full body pic with their face and it turned out to be my cousin. Right now as I type this I actually remember my uncle (his father) jokingly referring to my cousin as being well endowed to embarrass him once, I guess he wasn't joking. "
"In my opinion: don‚Äôt ghost him, tell him why you won‚Äôt see him again. His words have consequences. "
"*Cute boy at the gym glances at me between reps*

Me: Omg I can't believe he just proposed to me!

"
"Run. I've heard stories about these Muslim conversion camps, and it's not pretty. Some might even kidnap you and whisk you off to another country where you'd be completely cut off from any aid or legal resources. "
Found the sock.
It was cute until the question you had. 
I don't know her
I was born and raised in the Wish a Bitch Woods.
"&gt; that was intimate as fuck

And that, is what makes great sex, great sex.  The intimacy.  Intimacy can make what appears to be vanilla sex into the most mind-blowing experience you have ever had.  

As far as chemistry, let's see.  Great sex with extreme intimacy, then you massaged him with aloe gel, then you walked him back to the train station where he kissed you in front of others?  What do you think?
"
Socks have been getting loads of dick since the dawn of time. It's just the way of the world.
My whole face. Plus beard. 
"No, I don't think so. I think your friend is quite of a cunt, honestly... I'm really sorry for you man :("
"I don‚Äôt want to scare you since I think it‚Äôs really possible he was just fucking with you or trying to make you leave, but it‚Äôs important to entertain the idea that he was serious, just in case.

You probably gave him enough personal information for him to know or figure out where you live. Knowing that, make sure that a close friend or relative knows about this entire situation in case something should happen. Give them everything you know about this guy: name, address, car, everything. 

You may also go to the police station and speak with an officer. It‚Äôs really skirting the law since he was speaking vaguely and generally; I don‚Äôt think the police (or DA) would treat it as a legitimate death threat. Regardless, I would push to have the complaint documented in a police report: something on the record. If something should suddenly happen to you, the police will then have a prime suspect. If you have a good, proactive PD, they may offer more help in some way. 

Check all your locks (doors and windows). Make sure that you still have all of your keys. If you are close with any neighbors, you could ask them to keep an eye on your place for anything weird (could disguise it as disgruntled ex or whatever). 

If this guy starts to come around or seems to be popping up everywhere, contact the police immediately as he may be stalking you. If you get any secret admirer type texts or letters, police. A stalker is not to be trifled with. Ever. 

It‚Äôs *very* easy to just assume that the stuff we see on TV could never happen to us. The unfortunate reality is that some people are truly disturbed. 

You may not be imminent danger. That‚Äôs very possible, probably even likely. Regardless, I wouldn‚Äôt want to gamble my life based on probability.

^(I have no specialized knowledge of the law. However, my great aunt was murdered by her ex-husband. You never think that it can happen until it does.)"
"Nah but on Grindr I came across the profile of Nico, the 6'8, silver fox, very straight seeming owner of a Greek stand at the local farmer's market. Had bought olives and bantered with him before. Had no idea he was one of us. *Fantastic* fuck. I know height doesn't always mean a giant dick but it did for my buddy Nico. Ranks in best tops I've had."
"It cost a lot of money to make and not enough viewer turned in. 

I love Sense8 and I'm fucken sad they ended it. I'm just happy Netflix agreeed to bring it back for a long episode to conclude it "
"The sperm didn't consent though, you're a monster if you swallow it. "
"Next thing you know, he married the fleshlight"
"Holly shit... Fuck, you had the good reaction.

Just to let you know you have been read (you must be scared to death). But I don't have a lot of advices... The idea of letting him go hit on some other boys is not pleasant, but i really don't know what you can say to the police (""death threat"", I suppose, but where would be the proofs). If it can reassure you, it's probably more a lambda sociopath who likes to play with the mouse and feel power, than a real killer."
"Yes. Straight guys very often become touchy and charming to their friends who came out. They probably just enjoy the shift in power - being gay is still associated with being weaker, less masculine, ""beta male"". When someone reveals this to their straight friend who is not just plain homophobic, from the straight guy's perspective it's basically like bowing before him and accepting him as some kind of superior. It brings more comfort and trust to their friendship but also creates some responsibilities (e.g. ""you accepted me as alpha male of our pack, in return I won't let anyone hurt you"").


That's why straight guys often act very protective over their gay friends. Unfortunatelly, all these little gestures of care from straight guys can be easily mistaken for love interest. And there's that..."
"But now we're gonna have a bunch of men with average penises thinking theirs is too small because the mainstream media will only put big cocks up there. I saw that same shit on American God's on showtime. I've have not seen dicks that big in real life, and I'm at the gym a lot. "
I skip *to* those parts. But whatever floats your boat. I tend to skip the bits where the bottom gets a quick BJ from the soon-to-be top. We all skip something.
"Yeah, it's done. I feel terrible because he was the first guy I tried anal with. I wish I could undo that."
You will just get some girl to do it. I hear gender equality is a thing now. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
People are just racist
"A saying comes to mind:

You can be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world, and there's still going to be somebody who hates peaches."
"Hello there! I'm not entirely sure if r/askgaybros is the best place to look out for a friend, but you should consider joining our dysfunctional family! We have thrilling discussions, pet trolls and many, many kind souls that will make you feel at home."

"As long as he blinks in between the stares you're good.

Also I'm jealous, he sounds nice."
There's just too much mental gymnastics involved with being a religious gay.
You short guys are all the same. You make comments like that but then YOU'RE the one that gets pissed when I try to stuff you in a duffel bag.
"Na, don‚Äôt distance yourself. It‚Äôs good that he asks questions cos even though they are annoying, he‚Äôs at least trying to educate himself as it‚Äôs something he knows little about.

As long as he doesn‚Äôt out you, I don‚Äôt think you need to worry too much."
"dude, penises are great, period. all penises, big and small, straight or curved, cut or uncut, like - dicks, man. dicks!

this is how I know I'm gay."
"Why did he think that you would just be cool with the whole being a racist thing??

This boggles my mind. So much mental gymnastics must be going on in his head. "
"I intentionally dropped a pen in front of my love interest, just to bend and tempt him into giving me some dick. I'm pretty sure it was a thing in some girly movie...

It did work out, HEH."
"Yes. I started off bottoming and realised that if there isn't a certain amount of intimacy, care and just general concern for the person you're putting your penis in, it just won't work. I only realised that because my first hookup didn't give a shit about me - he just wanted to dick me down and go. As you can imagine, it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. Now, and especially when I top, I like to start with lots of foreplay and start fucking in missionary. There, I like to hold guys close, kiss, hug, the lot. Then once we're sufficiently comfortable with one another, we can get to pounding. If at any point I can feel there's not that connection, I won't do anal -- I'll get them off and leave. So in short, intimacy is everything. "
"You try doing the Lord's work and instead, you get crucified. Typical!"
Dump him. TOo fucked up. TOo much work.
He didn't care if I would be okay with it or not. He mentioned one of the reasons he identified with Trump is because he believes in saying whatever you want to say and not caring how it affects other people. Just like how Trump says whatever he wants to say no matter how it makes the country seem.
she's a cunt
"Me: God I get so many messages from really old men... 

Me as a really old man: God none of these youngsters even give me so much as the light of day, Ageist douches!"
"Yea I always take my puppy and my cat out of the room when I know what's going to happen. They're like children, you don't have sex infront of children."
"I'm 5'6"". Give me a few inches please."
"On October 3rd, he asked me what day it was.  
It's October 3rd."
"Not treating his sexuality or the word ‚Äúgay‚Äù as a taboo topic. ALSO! Don‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúpartner,‚Äù haha that‚Äôs a small thing but straight parents seem to be completely averse to saying ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù or ‚Äúhusband‚Äù when referring to a future life partner for their gay kids. And it always feels kind of ‚Äúdistancing‚Äù or awkward when my dad will say ‚Äúif you had a partner‚Äù or that kind of thing. Idk, small things.

I appreciate you so much. Please tell your son that he‚Äôs lucky to be so comfortable with and aware of who he is at such a young age."
At least you bursted either way lol
"I hope this won't offend and anger people too much, but I can imagine that happening. I do not like it when guys are too extremely feminine, it can bother me a little, and no it's probably not right of me, but extreme femininity is annoying in women too, and extreme masculinity annoys me as well."
"I'm a girl &amp; I sadly happen to know certain signs of abuse. Try to bring up your friend's boyfriend in a neutral subject  (when he's not around obv) &amp; observe your friend. You'll know if something looks forced or not right in his mannerism talking about his own BF. Do this ASAP after this incident. 

Another thing abuse victims generally have is jumpyness &amp; habit of sticking to 'rules'. If your friend startles at loud voices where there is no need to, then you have your answer. If however he's a skittish person from the beginning, then you look for the next thing: the obsession with sticking to rules, specifically time related. 

By that I mean if he doesn't want to stay out of home or do something and brings up the issue of 'time'. 'Its late', 'I'm tired', 'I should go home' etc are indicators of curfew like time limitations, imposed by their partner. It always happens if one partner is more dominant. They like to impose control in whatever way they can &amp; curfews are always the beginning. 

Another thing you can do is just drop by unannounced. Observe your friend, his partner, the state of the house/ whatever seemed to be happening before you arrived &amp; whether it was appropriate according to the day &amp; hour. But most importantly notice his BF's reaction to your unannounced arrival. If he's unpleasant more than usual, but it doesn't look like they were doing anything important, there's another sign. 

But more than anything, sometimes abuse victims are in shock &amp; don't even realise that what's happening to them counts as abuse. The abuser takes over &amp; one sort of doesn't *see* his/her actions for what they really are. 

What you can do, first &amp; most importantly, is tell him that you're there for him &amp; that he can talk to you. This is such a simple thing but people don't realise how rare it is to get that. If he thinks he can confide in you, he will try to talk &amp; soon end up disclosing the reality of the situation in some way IF he is actually being abused. (This will not happen in one day though.) 

However, I sincerely hope you just end up not finding anything &amp; your friend is just a kinky bastard: )"
"I knew I was gay when I was your son‚Äôs age but I didn‚Äôt come out to my parents until not long after my 15th birthday although I think they kinda already knew but they were fine with it. 

My parents just treated me in the same way as they did beforehand and I‚Äôve always had a close relationship with my parents and my older sister. My parents would ask sometimes if I had to deal with any negativity from people but I never got a lot of that stuff, the odd comment here and there but nothing I couldn‚Äôt handle or sometimes my sister couldn‚Äôt handle. 

Respect to your son, that‚Äôs a very courageous thing to do at his age and good luck to him and your family. "
Why was this show cancelled?! Ugh. It still bugs me!
"You need to get some real advice from a real expert. Call the national or local suicide hotline and speak to an expert. We have a way of going to the worst place instead of the most reasonable place. Build a better plan. Leave your wife, find a new job, get joint custody, then come out. Don‚Äôt rush everything all at once, but it sounds like getting away from your wife is the first best step. But speak to someone more experienced. Call the hotline. "

"This is hilarious.

At *least*? That's a lot of dick even for a sloppy bottom.

"I was at my friend's house party, and repeatedly ran into a guy. At the end of the night, we were chilling in the kitchen and talking about random stuff over a drink. When he had to leave, I came in for a hug, but I was too drunk so I basically hugged him with both arms and A LEG. I didn't realize I was trying make out with him or something. The guy just awkwardly gtfo right after, then it hit me. Now still have PTSD when I come back to my friend's house."

"There's no reason for a vegan not to swallow. There's no particular ethical concern about the treatment of animals (read, the man getting a BJ) and besides, if you're gay the spunk is dead no matter where you put it. I've been with vegan guys who swallowed before."
As a bottom I can confirm - beard is definitely a plus

That's something you should be reporting to HR. Don't let them tell you it's nothing.
"From what I've seen it's common among gays to have more specific types. Some gays are into muscle guys, some are into bears, some are into twinks, some are into geeks, etc.

So maybe you don't fit the generic society ideal that attracts women but you fit a specific niche that some gay guys like."
That's so fucking cute. Just read the other post of yours and it turned me on a bit lol. I had a friend I would mess around with but he was actually straight even after I told him my feelings for him. I'm happy for you and I hope things will be great for the both of you. 
"This is a great story, from beginning to end. "
"I'd say it's cute too. My best friend is like that. We've been together 19 years and counting. I came out to him and he gets low key jealous if I start talking to dudes. He'll mother me. ""Is he nice? What's he like? I'll kick his ass if he hurts you."" "
‚Äúnot caring how you affect other people‚Äù=lacks total empathy or emotional intelligence.
Wow. I'm surprised that worked lol. But you never know right.

I would think a good boyfriend would at least listen to anything you say, maybe disagree with it and tell you as an adult he disagrees, and lastly not running to someone like it is the latest gossip.

"I'm currently a senior in high school. I came out in 10th grade. My friends were mostly cool with it, my parents were kinda weird about it.

Had my first (and so far only) ""boyfriend"" my sophomore year with an adorable twink, and I gave my first blowjob to him in an empty movie theater... but he broke up with me after two months because he wasn't ready for a relationship yet. He ended up being a really talented poet, and he's won a bunch of awards. It's awkward to hear the occasional less-than-flattening line about me in his poems.

Had a few romantic misfires, including a straight guy that intentionally led me on for three months for the attention. Had a few hookups, but I honestly didn't enjoy them. The sex was awkward and the guys were weird, so I don't think that the hookup scene is meant for me.

Right now I'm flirting with this gorgeous twink in my gym class. He set off my gaydar the second I saw him, but his gaydar was clearly not as honed as mine. I could tell he was into me, and I knew he was trying to figure me out, so I decided to just tell a joke where the punchline was about some guy not realizing that I'm gay. I saw that he was trying to hide his smile when I told him.

He ended up following me out to my car in the parking lot after class even though he doesn't drive to school. He managed to awkwardly mention how he couldn't give blood, as a way of hinting his gayness, and it was cute that he thought I didn't already know. This all happened on Friday. I think I'm gonna ask him out this week!"
"You made my day, friend."
"&gt;THIS IS NOT WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

I'm really sorry, but for some reason that's so cute and funny. ‚ô°

Buddy, there is no reason for embarassment at all. I know you feel that way -- it's normal because we tend to guard our feelings and showing them leaves us vulnerable -- but doing this required balls which sooo many gay or straight guys couldn't grow when they had a crush.

Be happy that you know where you stand. There is a world full of different guys and you probably couldn't think about any of them without this closure.

Take some time to heal your wounds and smile. You did something big today!"
Good on you; I like that you have taken it slow and just.. be there for him..

"No because I find it tacky and tasteless, male or female.

By all means if you have posters and calender's at home with half naked dudes/women (Hey even I'm guilty of having lewd desktop wallpapers) that's a-okay but in a work environment show at least a little bit of class..."
"I may tell him. Hopefully, it would at least make him question his thoughts."
"That's interesting, both story and issue. Congrats on having younger siblings who look up to you!

Kids have all sorts of ""OMG THIS IS SO COOL I WANT TO DO IT, TOO"". Superheros, police officers, soldiers, monsters, barbers, wizards... and reasonble adults don't tell them ""no, no, you can't be that/dream about it"". If he finds being gay cool, theoretically there's no reason to forbade it -- especially since it won't influence his sexual orientation in any way, it's something decided by our brains without our knowledge or will.

There's big ""but"" to that, though. While playing superhero is pretty much just running around and pretending to punch invisible monsters, playing gay could lead to situation where he will start kissing or hugging other boys. That's something you should prevent. While it'd be a purely innocent act, it may create lots of social issues that will make a him victim of bullying or ostracism.

I would say, try to guide his fascination in other places. You're his cool big brother, he will follow anything you do. Try to make yourself not only about ""being gay"" but also about ""always helping others"", ""loving animals"", ""playing football"". You have a good influence on him -- use it to show him the world full of possibilities! You could always start by showing him your hobbies."
... Does insulting the intelligence of people on the Internet make you feel good about yourself? 
"Yeah, not exactly my finest hour. Lucky for me the guy was level-headed enough not to take a swing."

"Well first of all your boyfriend has no business telling his friend your private conversations. 

Second of all, it's not uncommon for a lot of people to be anti-gay before they come out and then switch.  2016 was 2 years ago, does he still have those views?"
"Not ikea, but go to an outdoors store and find one of those superlight nylon hammocks. You should be able to figure something out from there"
I made a grindr twink my boyfriend sooo never give up? :P
"I'm happy to hear that you didn't have to deal with much negativity, I hope that will be his experience too.  I don't feel like I will treat him any differently, he's still the same kid he was yesterday. In fact, the last thing I said after this long emotional talk was ""I love you but this room is gross, why are your clothes on the floor? I know that Xbox isn't on because you were getting ready to play it, your math homework isn't done."""
What the fuck
"That surprises you? 

Shameless will make your jaw drop then."
"This is a side step- but I think it has potential to help. Have you heard of the 5 love languages? Humans desire love in 5 different ways (at our most basic level) and we usually have 1 that is the most direct form of affection. They're: Physical (kissing/hugging). Quality Time (just hanging out together). Words of Affirmation (""your blue eyes are the most beautiful!""). Gifts (""I remember you said you like Reese's Cups so I picked some up for you""). and Acts of Service (""I did your chores!""). People in relationships tend to GIVE love the same way they want to receive love. But that's not always the way their partner NEEDS love. So when there's a disconnect, it's not b/c one or both parties aren't trying (always), it's b/c there's just an actual disconnect/miscommunication.

The fact that your bf has already expressed he has communication troubles when it comes to emotions sounds like a big step. Idk how serious you plan on being, but talking to someone qualified could always help. Having this conversation when one of you is not feeling an extreme emotion is important. Tell him how you feel. Then tell him how he can best make you feel [blank] (whatever it is you're looking for). Then, in return, ask him how you can best help him as you are sensitive and know he has difficulty in the emotional department.

Hope this helps. The Love Language quiz is so easy. Found on Google!"
Most I've done is try to start a conversation by asking a question I already know the answer to just to have an excuse to talk to them. 
"Yup, that's also what a straight friend told me. ""You're cool, I don't mind being friends with a gay guy who act like a 'real guy', at least compared to those overly effeminate ones.""

And what's fucked up was, at that time I was flattered. Even as a gay guy I just wanted to fit in so bad into a heteronormative society. Nowadays I get it that fem guys can't just suddenly ""act straight"" but I still can't shake the feelings that they at least should try to act ""less overtly gay""."

They‚Äôre ‚Äústraight‚Äù. The same you find on Grindr at 2am when they just got home and left their gf at home. 
"I'm 4.5"" and fairly thin, too. And I'm vers. I've found many guys that were willing to and even enjoyed bottoming for me. And I've found several that were specifically looking for small cocks to bottom for because they're very tight, inexperienced, or just prefer it. I'm not saying it's common at all, but there are definitely guys out there that prefer your size. I'm one of them, for that matter.

I will say that position is important. Some positions are pretty difficult at my size because it won't stay in, but the bottom on his back with his legs up seems to work best."
"Theres one for a straight sex swing, but not a gay one. Sorry."
"One of my childhood friend's uncles was staying with him and his family at the time. They live a few houses down. I only met him once when I was prob like 12 and he was in his 30s. He was pretty gay then and I remember him rubbing my back weird and he was creepy. 

I had a shirtless torso pic as my pic grindr (lol) and he pmed me all this dirty stuff like, ""Mmmmm I'd love to suck off my hot neighbor"" and then sent me a bunch of dirty pics, that I did not wanna see. I just ignored it. Weirdly, he was also using the name of my friend's dog as his username. 

Few days later I was just jogging down the street and I see him walking that same dog and another dog they have and he's legit staring at me for what feels like forever. I only see him through my peripherals though and just keep going. Figures I haven't seen the guy in over a decade and now after that weird shit on grindr, there he is. He didn't say anything though.

Later that night he messages me and he's like, ""are you that hot guy I saw running down the street today?"" and I'm like oh fuck and I said, ""No so sorry, I use fake picture, I am big man and also does not speak English good so sorry for cat fish."" Then I deleted my grindr cause I used to delete it once a week. Haven't seen or heard from him since. "
"&gt;I don't want to break his trust

He's already broken yours. If it was clear from the beginning that you had a monogamous relationship, then he's cheated on you. You should tell him and reconsider wether you want to keep the relationship or nor."
What a sociopath.

"One time I was AT a gay bar with a friend and some of his friends.  We had a couple of beers by this point, and my friend and I (both eager bottoms) were tittering over this hot-average guy.  Feeling uninhibited I went over to the guy and actually said: 
‚ÄúMy friend and I agree that neither of us would kick you out of bed unless it was to fuck on the floor!‚Äù

The poor guy (and his fag hag) didn‚Äôt know what to say and I just retreated away lol."
"My advice to you would be DO NOT travel to Australia without voicing your concerns to your dad before departure.

Call your dad, explain the situation to him (don‚Äôt sugar coat anything be 100% up front) and tell him if he doesn‚Äôt address the issue with her that he will have to come to Switzerland to see you, instead of you traveling to a different continent to be abused by your homophobic stepmom. "
"My first lover and I got together right off the top, and stayed together for 16 years.  After some initial choppy weather, his parent owned us, and loved us, and embraced us into their life.  When my lover was leaving the military they invited us to stay with them until we could set up our own house.

Well, I came visiting after a protracted mission away.  On Saturday morning we woke up in a playful mood.  I flipped my lover over laying him on his belly, and jumped on him from behind.  I commenced jumping up and down high in the air, being silly, and pretending to ravish him.

For his part, he commenced extremely affected and effeminate squealing, and whimpering, and imploring for mercy.  It was all a tickling, silly, playfulness.  Then, something made me look over my shoulder, and I saw my mother in law slowly closing the door.  She had come to invite us to breakfast.

We just knew, forever after, she would carry that image in her head as to what our sexuality was all about!  You can't make people unsee things.  :  )"
"I think he enjoys scaring people too, since he didn't have any weapon and didn't stop you from doing anything, you were cuddling, he could have easily pinned you down.

Though, I think this is worth reporting, you can't know if he ends up actually doing it one time. People that knew killers do say they've heard the people talking about stuff like that but never thought they'd actually do something."

"I spent the better part of a semester of college getting close with this one guy in my class. I was certain he was gay, so it was just a matter of building a repertoire to eventually work my way up to asking him out. This involved becoming friendly and sitting next to each other every day, etc. Finally got the courage to ask him to lunch one day after class- he obliged. That was basically all the signal I needed. After another week or so I start the awkward conversation leading up to a ""do you wanna go out sometime"" but never got that far- he cut me off and said ""sorry I'm not gay"" which honestly surprised me. Then he wanted to know *why* I thought he was gay while I just wanted to know why he didn't stop me months ago if he knew I was hitting on him the whole time.

That was one of the only times I ever put in the effort to court someone and it was such a waste of time. Never again... "

"Given the fuck up JK made when she veiled his sexuality in the books and then tried to take all the credit for revealing he was gay after the series was over, I would think there‚Äôd be some effort to fucking fix that in a film about Dumbledore as a young man.

Especially given his relationship with Grindelwald has been specifically stated to be that he loved someone who let him down, and they had absolutely *no* problem leaning on Grindelwald‚Äôs sexuality to make him out to be a sexual predator in Fantastic Beasts. The romantic nature of their relationship was absolutely key to the backstory in The Deathly Hallows.

"Trust me, there are easily as many guys into nerdy folk, they're just more likely to be introverted or nerdy themselves. It's less visible but *definitely* out there. "
"I don't think his behavior is any indication that he's interested in you. It sounds like gay people are just strange and unfamiliar to him and he's asking questions out of curiosity.

If he hasn't disclosed your secret to anyone so far, and he still treats you with respect aside from his questions, I don't see why you'd have to distance yourself.

(If he *was* interested in you, he'd probably tell you in some way. Even if you suspect he's interested with you, I wouldn't push it by asking him about it, since if that was the case it sounds like he's still unused to the idea of men liking men.)"

I love that we have somewhat similar upbringing, values and ideals. I love that you have your own interests and I would love to learn about all those things from you. I love to spend time with you, to talk with you about life, to playfully fight with you. I love your handsome face, you belly, your hairy arms. Man, I would love to spend my days having fun with you and to spend my nights in your arms. My only wish is to spend my life with someone who makes me feel the way I feel about you.

"Your BF has some serious boundary issues. Your relationship should be a *private* matter between the two of you. To be honest, it sounds to me like he's not ready for a genuine adult relationship. He's putting you in the position of fighting for him against an entire religion, and that's not fair to you at all. He needs to make up his mind about who he is and what he stands for. No one should be put through what he's putting you through.

FWIW, I lost a close friend to Catholic brainwashing. He used to be married to another man, and now he's celibate and teaches catechism at a church somewhere out in central California. "

That said, I happily mow my own grass. I take pride in keeping a neatly manicured yard. Plus, cutting grass, weedeating, flowerbed maintenance, etc is great exercise. Beyond that, no kid would do a satisfactory job like I do my own self. My husband and I love to do yardwork, and it shows."

He did seem pretty nice - he was 7.5"", moderate thickness, but with enough rimming and fingering I managed to take it alright (and you know what, after a short while it felt fucking amazing I need to bottom more) and he softly said things like ""am I making you feel good bub?? ... good... *smooch "".

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúgay community‚Äù the way most people seem to think there is. We unite to fight for our rights and then we all go back to our lives as individuals.

"You inhale the fumes, not drink the liquid. They‚Äôre called poppers because they used to come in glass tubes you broke to open. They give a pretty intense, though short-lived, period of euphoria during which pretty much anything related to sex - sucking dick, getting sucked, rimming, getting rimmed, fucking, getting fucked -feels 100 times better than without poppers. Immediate negative side effects can include some anxiety, loss of erection if you use too much too quickly, inability to cum if too much too quickly, and death if used with medications like Viagra. Poppers come in several formulas, and some can cause seeing spots for a short period after using them, and some formulas can cause long term vision damage. 

They also relax smooth muscles like the anus, making it easier to take a dick or toy, and I find it easier to deep throat in a wider variety of positions than without. "

"We had been dating a few months and it was just before Christmas. He told me he needed some new shoes and asked me if I'd help him pick them out. He's a bit high maintenance and loves labels and department stores. After dragging me through Nordstrom and every other high end store, he still couldn't decide on any and asked me which ones I liked best. We went back to Nordstrom to get them. I'm pretty basic and was bewildered that he'd spend so much money on shoes. He grabbed the shoe on display, told me he was going to get them, and asked to go see if they had a pair of pants he claimed to like in his size. Meanwhile, he very discreetly asked the sales associate to grab the shoes in my size from the backroom. 

Christmas day came and I was pleasantly surprised when I discovered the shoes were actually for me. He also got me the latest season of Game of Thrones on Blu Ray. Definitely a keeper. "
