"Obviously she, the customer, knows more about how the store loyalty cards work than you, the employee. Because SHE KNOWS"
And this is why I wash all brand new clothes before wearing.
"I've never been so attracted to a random faceless stranger on the internet than I have at this very moment.

My god that's a fucking great comeback to a childish customer."
I think I love you a bit. 
"One thing I used to do was to say something completely acceptable to put them on the defensive:

C:  mumblemumble

Me: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

C: Rage about not paying attention!

Me: I'm so sorry, but could you speak up a bit?  I have a bit of a hearing problem.

C: Ashamed.

Hehehehe."
"I hear...

they ALWAYS come back"
"Of course. Everything's in ""the back"". One day, some poor, unsuspecting trainee will open the door to the back and be killed by an airplane propeller, because it turns out that Amelia Earhart was in ""the back"" all along."
I love when you just get blank stares when you try to explain something to these people. Like if they don't acknowledge you said something they're automatically right. 
It is quite amazing how often a little reminder of cameras change a person‚Äôs tune!
"I can't stand customers who try to pull stuff like this. ""Oh I found it such and such place and it says it's this amount. There's a bunch of others there too"". Um. No. I placed the items and marketing and that is not even close. "
"Mother fu--...      

Has anyone else noticed that despite everyone having a freaking mini-digital-assistant on hand at all times, more and more people treat service/retail workers like we should be acting like their personal concierge??"
"Maybe she thought once you order something online it magically appears in the store? Or in the magical ""back"" room. "
"I had this exact scenario once, in the end I lost my rag and said ""I stopped being paid five minutes ago, so you're asking me to stand here for free. Just buy the lot, and bring back what you don't like, or I'm leaving and security can take you out."" Which is what happened, got an ¬£800 sale (even though a lot of it probably came back!)"
Who waits until the night before they have enough company to eat 78 bagels to buy food for them? Not to mention why would she expect you to have that many left over at the end of the day? Most bakeries where I live have almost bare shelves at closing time.
"I guess for him, the small number always came first.
When people have limited life experience, they assume their experience is the gold standard."
He'll be back tomorrow.
"&gt;That is a VERY good idea. You really don't know who tried it on before you, and that's a pretty unsettling thought. "
I once had a customer get pissed at me for shipping their part to the address they haven't lived at for 2 years.  They had given me that address two days prier to their complaint.  Somehow I was supposed to know they had moved and they were just giving me the old address...  
I love it when they tell me they know the owner.  I'm the owner.
"I just need 6 dozen

Just. 6. Dozen. Yeah.... That's not a lot at all. üòï"
"That's insane! That can's nearly 30 years old!

Good on you and your manager for calling out her bullshit :\-\-\)

edit: I guess I accidentally came for y'all by pointing that out. Have fun with the existential dread!"
"Actually had a manager some time ago that told me to make an announcement that the registers would automatically shut down at a certain time (I think it was 20-30 minutes after close at this point and these people refused to leave).  Made the announcement that no sales would be able to process once the registers completed their automatic shutdown procedure.  Amazingly, the people that swore they didn't speak English when we told them to leave because we were closing were suddenly able to understand that.

Also, our registers did not have an automatic shutdown.  But when you tell people you won't be able to run their purchase they suddenly become more incentivised to get their crap and get out."
"I used to love shopping at a boutique in my downtown area that had a sign above the register that said ALL SALES ON UNDERWEAR AND LINGERIE FINAL. NO EXCEPTIONS. I asked the cashier about it and she said they had to put it up because they‚Äôd had a few customers try to return obviously used and soiled underwear. She told me that once a woman had placed a pair of panties that were obviously soiled on the counter demanding to return them and the smell was so bad that the cashier couldn‚Äôt stop herself from gagging. The lady got super offended and demanded a manager. The manager threw the woman out of the store after seeing the disgusting panties. They had to call maintenance to pick up the panties with gloves, dispose of them and clean the counter thoroughly. "
"Did she really expect you to be like ""oh hahahah you got me! Guess I have to do what you say!""

...of course she does. "
‚ÄúI used to work retail‚Äù liar 
"Had a lady try this with salad dressing once.  Had about 40 bottles, all expired for years.  Some varieties we had discontinued several years before."
"It's my dream to one day own a business and have someone ask for the manager, say I'll go get them, and spin in place, greet them as the manager, and ask them what they need help with. When they ask for the Owner, I give them a business card. They call it, I pick up my cell phone, and tell them I have to deal with a problem customer but I'll get right back to them. While standing in front of them. Making eye contact."
"Years ago, I was on a lunch break between classes at a local community college and stopped in a bookstore to buy my weekly comic book fix.  As I was selecting my 10-15 comics, an old friend happened to walk into the store.  

We talked and caught up for a solid 30 minutes until my wristwatch alarm sounded to alert me it was time to head back for my next class. My old friend was in the middle of a story and not wanting to interrupt him, I silenced my alarm.  After another 10 minutes I realized I was now late for class.  I apologized to my friend and ran out the door to my car.

Later that night at home, I was unpacking my bag and found the stack of comic books among my class work.  Embarrassed, I called the bookstore and left a message saying I would bring the comics back the next day to pay.  I barely slept that night worried that I had messed up bad and would be banned from the store. 

Going back to the store the next day, I was nervous.  The owner was behind the counter as usual, reading a book and drinking coffee.  I put the comics up on the counter and proceeded to explain in painful detail what had happened. 

As I come to the end of a story that, despite being 100% true, sounds far-fetched, he looks over the top of his glasses and says ""Enh, you're in here all the time.  You're good for it.  Take 'em."""
"Sheesh, all these retail workers skipping their mandatory psychic training. "
"That can is exactly 28 years old!

^Oh ^god ^I'm ^nearly ^30"
"How old was the guy? Not relevant at all, but wondering if he was a thalidomide baby? 

Regardless, the sheer determination to overcome disability has always left me humbled and full of admiration x"
"Oh god I used to LOVE compensating customers for gas back when I was a retail GM.

I would do the math in front of them - look up the distance from their billing address to my store, look at what kind of car they drive and estimate it's MPG, and then factor in today's gas price. Then I'd issue a credit for usually about $1.20 or so to their account. People never realize how ridiculously small that expense actually is."
"""Why are you not smiling?""

""My grandfather died""

Bonus point if he really died... But like 5 years ago. "
"Yeah - except you get into the catch 22 of ""wash before wear"" - discovering it doesn't fit/has a problem, you take it back to the store, and the store says ""you washed it, too bad"" - got caught in that a few times. "
"With so many people leaving, you can probably get away with talking to customers however you want right now. Your boss may not be able to afford firing you. "
"It was REALLY statisfying! So rarely there are these moments to get back at cheeky, childish grown ups, without crossing the line.
"
Next time tell them your register closes at like 15 min past the closing time and you will not be able to make a sale because it shuts down. If they really need it they will be fast or just leave. A little lie to keep your sanity and not go home 2 hours after closing.. 
"How do you not realise your tank is full???? 

I thought I couldn‚Äôt be more amazed at the stupidity of people but apparently it knows no bounds "
"I manage a thrift store. My team and I get to make the prices. I price anything that looks like it's worth over $20. Sometimes I help at the registures when it gets busy. I love it when a customer comes though my line with a switched tag that now says $1.99. Uh no, that was priced $19.99. ""How do YOU know???"" My response, ""I'm the manager, I personally priced said item myself this morning."" "
I love you more ‚ù§Ô∏è
She probably got confused with stores that do do that (I work at one).  Still doesn‚Äôt excuse her from being rude and trying to argue with someone who works there more than she shops there.
"It‚Äôs baffling how uninvolved they think we are. Like we do literally nothing but stand around with our eyes closed for 40 hours/week. 

When I worked at a coffee shop, people would try to return stuff from a different, very well known coffee shop that we had no affiliation with, while insisting they purchased it at my store. I personally unboxed every item, placed them on the shelf, and straighten them every couple of hours. All of the signs are handwritten by yours truly. But sure, that random ass mug I‚Äôve never seen before and doesn‚Äôt scan is certainly from here."
"Same thing happened to me! Someone would come up to me asking for a chicken, I'd say they've still got half an hour left in the oven, and then they'd kinda just stare at me while still hoping to get one. Like?? What do you want me to do about it? I can't bend time to suit your poultry needs."
"""Ma'am, I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you."""
"I once had a guy claim he was the owners son in law and always got a discount at the copy/print shop where I worked.

Me:  ""Really?  Harry only has one daughter and I'm pretty sure I'm the one who married her"".  

I wish I had a photo of the look on the guys face."
"On an related note, we had a regular shoplifting recently. My other boss, the other part-owner, was watching him on the CCTV stuff $300 worth of baby formula and lunch meat into his pockets and bags.


Unfortunately, I wasn't there to see it, but the boss chased after him with his security baton and detained him until the police got there. They filed a tresspasser report, and since the shoplifter had priors, they booked him too.



What boggles my mind is that we all know where the dude lives. We're the closest business in comfortable walking distance, along with the liquor store across the street. He's pretty banned from coming back, and we sent his photo and report to all the other nearby stores. He's pretty much fucked unless he can convince someone else to shop for him."
"People get on your case for doing the right thing? Jesus. Even if you weren't having frequent ""secret shoppers"", you did what was legally AND morally right. Good on you. "
STOP ARGUING WITH HER
"I've never had the guts to fire back with ""can't you?""  So hearing you do it and knowing you didn't get fired kinda fulfills a dream of mine.

Well done!"
Unfortunately true!
Depends what country you're in - that's one of the perks of our coloured ~~monopoly~~ Canadian money.
"True, though I find it hard to believe he's never stumbled onto a pair of 34/30s while buying his levis. That's our most frequently purchased size so we have a lot of them. He had our stores charge card and shops here regularly. "
I'm happy she didn't get what she wanted for once in her life.
Or within a week anyway. He most likely wouldn't be stopping there in the first place if it wasn't the most convenient stop for him.
"I find ""customers"" these days are looking for anything to complain about. Technology has made many things easy and accessible but heaven forbid you have to wait 2 weeks for furniture you ordered or have to go to another store to get something you want. It's called being an adult. Be one."
"Mid thirties to early forties, ten years ago. I got the impression that he's always been this way and never knew anything else. He definitely humbled me!"
Urgh you have my sympathy. Customers always seem to have trouble understanding special deals. Constantly. 
"Reason no. 1 why i at least attempt to verify that all addresses are current and valid. If I make a mistake filling in the label, I'll own up to it and make things right. But if you gave me a bogus address, its your own fault if the person you're sending things to don't get their package."
