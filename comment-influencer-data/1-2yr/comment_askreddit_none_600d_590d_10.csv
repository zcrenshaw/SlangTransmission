"Yes, Communism. Are allowances for housing/food/education making the 90% of migrants who are unemployed and unemployable in your country productive, or is it fostering an entitlement complex? Calais is stocked full of people going to Britain for gibs. People deserve more than an allowance, and human nature is to covet/want more. Bad precedent. The allowances go right back into the wallet of the guy who owns the factory full of robots. "

"It might sound crazy, but in 8 hours you might possibly be able to learn how to create computer from scratch. 
&amp;nbsp;
If you already know how bin/hex system works and how to encode information using them (school material). The you have to learn binary logic, which is easier than it sounds, and now you're familliar withh basic electronic devices - logic gates. Then you learn how to assemble them into more complex devices, like triggers ans adders and out of them more complex ones multiplexors. Then, you learn to develop a CPU architecture. Now, you can build your own calculator in miecraft, and assembler doesn't seem like a black magic anymore.

"Sounds like that dude sucked at sex in general, in my honest experience most people do.  It's a **skill**, and one that people either can't or don't dedicate time and energy to level up.

Because of his size his lack of skill  resulted in hurting his partner.  I'm in the top fraction of the 99th percentile for girth (girth being where most non-cervix punching pain comes from) and my second most regular sex partner has vaginismis (sp, I'm on mobile :p).  

I've honed my skill in a very promiscuous and adventurous non-monogomous  relationship, so theres a pretty wide breadth of experience, both personal and shared, to support the following philosophy I have come to operate on:

Lots of foreplay, lots of lube, constant communication with the partner on what feels good and what doesn't... That's all it really takes for nearly every sexual partner to enjoy themseves. 

TL;DR: Sorry you got hurt by a dud, but it hurt because he was big *and* unskilled, not because he was big."

"I disagree. I'd argue that despite being on different sides of a left-right spectrum, Bernie and Trump are closer than Neo-liberals and either in terms of their characteristics and general policy preferences.

Neoliberals = Anti-Tariff, Pro-NAFTA, Pro-Free Trade, Pro-globalization, Pro-corporations, Pro-Social Safety Nets (the form they take varies, but government has a role in softening the turbulent waters of capitalism), Pro-democracy, Pro-human rights, Pro-educated elites guiding policy on the basis of research and empiricism.

On specific issues ~~they~~ *ah screw it, we* may be closer to one or another, but in general in terms of economic policies *we* are anti-protectionist which is something that cannot be said of Bernie or Trump.

In terms of politics neoliberals are anti-populist, and populism is characteristic of both Bernie and Trump.

EDIT: Also Trump's defining policy seems to be his positions on immigration. Neoliberals are for realizing the dream of free movement of peoples across and within borders. Neoliberals despise borders."
