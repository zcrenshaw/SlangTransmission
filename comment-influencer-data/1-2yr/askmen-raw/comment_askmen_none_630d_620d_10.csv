Depression. Nobody likes a weak man regardless of why they’re feeling weak. 
"I've learned that both genders excel at skimming through a hundred comments and picking out the five that support a pre-conceived bias. Then we all take that strengthened bias and re-apply it to the entire opposite gender while we demand to be treated as individuals.

Also learned that literally every woman is obsessed with chapstick. "
"- gets legitimately happy about things she enjoys (Huge green light mental health-wise)

- has no problem introducing you to all of her friends

- asks you questions about yourself and genuinely listening to the answers"
"You’re fixated on an outcome, sex, which will undoubtedly create expectations whenever you interact with women. Having expectations will ruin your ability to be present, to act naturally. Women are incredibly intuitive and will sniff that out. You mention how long it’s been since you’ve had sex, that’s in the past. You worry about how a women will react to your past, that’s in the future. You’re living anytime but the present, and that’s creating dissonance. Right now you could learn guitar, lift weights, study physiology, meditate, write a book, but instead your mind is behind and ahead. Right now you can live and grow and savor existence, but you’re fueling negativity. You can’t be happy in a relationship until you’re happy being single. When you can live satisfied in the present, then you’ll have women."
"Ain’t that the fuckin truth. I got left once when my dog died. Her dog died years prior and she was a wreck for months. I was right there for her everyday. My dog died and she left the second day because she didn’t want to be miserable with me and watch me cry. 

"
"Domestic violence, it’s ridiculously common but almost completely overlooked because most men assume they’ll be blamed if they complain."
"Hey OP, we had somewhat of a similar situation here. My sister wasn't ready to be a mother but she was convinced by the baby's father to keep it. Long story short: they break up, she leaves for across the world, child stays with us (grandparents and me, his uncle) every weekend and with father during the week.  
Child was 2,5 when she left so vague recollection of his mother was there.  

The way we decided to handle it was to always be honest with him but to not volunteer information ourselves if he didn't ask for it.  
So when he'd ask where his mommy was for example we'd simply answer where she was. If he asked why she left we answered honest that she wasn't ready to be a mommy. But we'd never volunteer information ourselves until he asked for it.  
We figured, if he thought about it enough to formulate a question about it, it meant he was ready for the answer.

Nephew is 11 now and still comes to his grandparents every weekend. Don't think we would handle this differently if we had a second chance.  
Hope this helps OP. Good luck"

"The refusal to acknowledge that women can be emotional users in relationships is so frustrating.

They claim we use them for sex? Well we get used as emotional beat sticks all the time."
"Pancake ass. Like I'm totally fine with just plain flat, but when its flat and saggy? Nope."
"It would probably be easier to list any men's issues that actually get attention.

Suicide, depression, homelessness, parental rights, health (primarily prostate cancer), false rape allegations....those would be at the top of my list.

And that doesn't even touch on the relationship aspects.  Everyone knows the expression, ""happy wife, happy life"". No version for the happy husband that I am aware of.

I am harder as a parent on my boys than my daughter.  Because the sad reality is that when they become men, nobody will care about their problems except their mother and me."
"#THEY REALLY, REALLY, REALLY DON’T LIKE INITIATING FIRST IN THE DATING SCENE.

What I've been doing seems to be working well enough already thanks
"there are several. but one of the earliest ones was when i stayed at her one night and had to be at work the next day early in the morning. i put my work clothes on and got ready and to my surprise, she packed me lunch.

talk about brownie points!"

Yeah but they're not the women you want to approach anyway.
"What to do about all the men who are being automated out of a career and are too old to retrain but too young to retire, but who desperately need a purpose to feel worthy of remaining alive.

"Several months into our relationship, I had a nightmare that she died in a car accident on her way to work and I didn't hear about it until later that day. I woke up hyperventilating and took me a good amount of time to realize where I was (in bed). I look to my side and there she is, sleeping away. I grabbed her, held her, and started bawling like crazy.

Might seem weird, but to me, that had me feel like she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

That was 6 years ago.

Broke up on Saturday.

I feel like shit."
"Example: In dating men are expected to make the first move, it puts the onus of dealing with the quantity of rejections on men.  As a result, over time, a portion of men either cant handle it and drop out, get bitter, turn it into a game of maximizing their returns, etc. 

An additional side effect is that this also encourages passivity for women which reduces their agency. They are limiting themselves to what actually comes after them, rather than actively seeking out what they desire. An additional side effect of this is that they are not immunized to social rejection to the same extent that men are. "
"Learn to accept that she likes you for being you. You don't have to measure up to anyone, not even her.

Take your victory, and run with it! :-)"
"She allowed me to be exactly who I was. No nagging, pestering or whining about what  ""I should be"", she simply enjoyed being with the person ""I was"".  There was no question about me needing alone time or time with my friends, she also craved a little time apart. Which meant she didn't grill me about where I was going, who else was going to be there and demand that I check in by phone every hour or so. I know guys that put up with more monitoring by their girls than their parents ever did. I couldn't be with someone who thought they owned me. And I treat her the same way.  I could not wish for a better, more stable, more loving, more wonderful spouse."
Bad teeth.
"Back in undergrad after my now-wife and I had been dating for maybe about 3 months, I had a bit too much to drink. When we got back to my room (to which she practically carried me) I say down on my bed. I was too drunk to take out my contacts properly, so I put contact solution in her hands, put my contacts into her hands, and then she put them away for me.

A couple of minutes after that, my stomach which had done so well the whole night, decided enough was enough. With very little warning, I proceeded to vomit literally over my entire room. It was a small residence room, and I had had a lot to drink so it went pretty well everywhere. I then proceeded to pass out.

Upon waking the next morning to one of the worst hangovers I ever had, I realized that my bed sheets were gone, my floor was clean, and my girlfriend was sleeping on the floor. I had no idea why this was the case.

When she woke up, my girlfriend told me that after I threw up and passed out, she proceeded to spend the next 2 hours (at which point she was also quite drunk) to strip my bed and put my sheets in the wash. She then mopped my entire room at about 3 AM to get the worst of the vomit up. After cleaning my room as best she could, she then slept on the floor to (a) make sure I was ok and (b) because she was afraid I would throw up again (hence why she didn't want to sleep on the bed next to me). 

I couldn't believe how awesomely she took care of me after we had been dating for such a short time, and how instead of saying ""fuck this!"" she decided to take care of me. That was one of the big moments when I realized just how awesome she is. 

She's obviously done a million more awesome things since then, and I continue to love her more than anything in the world. We've been together over 10 years now, and I couldn't be happier with our relationship!"

"Yeah. On two fronts for me:

1) I'm able to do more things now because I'm either fitter or more confident in my physical abilities.

2) Being able to push yourself in the gym or on a run translates to being able to do the same in everyday life. If you can push that extra kilometre or kilogram, then you can push through and finish that project. "
People lie about how unimportant your looks are. Its more important than your personality IMO.
"Honestly, I'll echo what others have said- enthusiasm is completely the number one thing, bar none. Sure, a girl might have impeccable technique- a perfect blend of hands, lips, and tongue, expert timing, the ability to fit more than two/three inches into her mouth (surprisingly rare, in my experience, although maybe I'm just a funny shape)... but if she's not clearly into it, clearly wanting to get me the fuck off with *anything* she can do, it doesn't compare.

A lot of it is just about the experience overall- get *physical* with it. You know how your SO looks when he's standing over you, fingers through your hair and knees bumping your shoulders? How he gets hard, for *you,* how he looks when his cock is bobbing a little with every heartbeat? 

*Eat that shit up.*

I'm serious.

You *want* to make him groan, to feel his hips thrust a little because he can't stand staying still for long. Kiss him, just *suck*, like you're trying to get as much of that heady blend of pre-cum and sweat and the sheer taste of his *skin* on your tongue as you can. Grab his thighs and put your hair back- you don't need to make him feel like you *want* that cock in your throat, you need to make *yourself* feel like you fucking need it.

Picture a void in your mouth- I mean, hell, you've got a tongue and lips and so on, but it's *empty.* 

Look at him, straight in the damn *eyes*, and feel that emptiness. Watch his body- how it shifts, how his cock bounces when he steps toward you, how there's that little dribble of wetness at his tip and a swell and a shape all his own in that thing. Feel empty. Feel like you're missing something, and imagine what it'd feel like to have that emptiness suddenly full, with his taste and his feel and shit, if you suck and give up any thought that making a mess is bad, if you just get desperate enough for it, maybe you'll get to taste what that cock feels like when it explodes.

Not just any cock. *His* cock. For *you.* Isn't that worth just fucking *going* for, restraint be damned?

tl;dr: Gotta want it."
"Very early green flag is how she treated other people. I'm a stickler about the (sort of cliche) of being able to tell a lot about a person with how they treat someone that can do nothing for them. 

As we got to know each other, another green flag was her willingness to compromise over things (and of course, our relationship depends on me doing the same).  There are things that I believe we each will not, and should not compromise on, and those may not be the same for each of us. I would never want her to compromise on something that goes against who she is.

For the most part, our compromises have been small since we seem to be on the same page about most things. "

"I'll start with a few things that I've done in 2017 that were absolute mayhem (and that's saying a lot!)


* Drove my car into a wall. 
* Flew 1000 miles to get rejected by a girl I thought liked me
* Be shitty to my parents and give them constant suffering

I would love to hear everyone else's stories!"
"She showed genuine and enthusiastic interest in what I was saying, and asked me questions which showed she actually *listened* to what I said."
"Honestly, how the relationship dynamics have not kept up with relationship expectations.

Things like men are still expected to do all of the chivalry stuff, make more money, be able to provide on a single income, and not be emotionally weak while also being emotionally open, equality in every thing etc.

While I applaud the advances women have made economically and socially, they have not adjusted their relationship expectations to match the changing dynamics. Much of it is unconscious of course, but it is still a problem.  "
"When my wife and I started dating, I was working night shift. She was one of the only people who was understanding of my odd sleep schedule, she would do little things like buy me new earplugs so I could sleep better and invite me over to her place for ""breakfast"" in the afternoon after I woke up. "

"If she's into celebrity gossip or reality TV.

I've tried not being a snob about it, but it really is a pile of wank, and I just can't be doing with it.

Plus I find people who love drama-filled reality TV (Jeremy Kyle, Mauri, Trisha etc) tend to bring that drama into real life in all sorts of ways.  And I'm too old and too ugly for that kind of bollocks in my life."
"If they were a picky eater or had a lot of food allergies, I would be out immediately. I already hate it when you work in an office environment and there is a co-worker who only eats processed meat and thinks Indian food is too ethnic and we have to accommodate that person during every outing.

I can live with watching movies I think are boring or doing activities that aren't really my thing, but I love trying different foods and I love cooking new recipes and it would be way too much of a conflict with my life if she didn't feel the same way."

"Got my first girlfriend at 27. It's been a few months now but it's weird knowing that someone wants to spend time just being around me. Not particularly doing anything, but just in the same room. I find it so awkward still.

"This.  My ex-wife used to hit, slap, and insult me in public all the time. I'm not a small person by any means (6'2""/beefy) so it seems I should just be able to take whatever she felt like dishing out.  One day I found myself driving to work with a black eye after she'd thrown a rolled up newspaper at my head and caught me in the face, thinking about what ""I fell down"" style lie or excuse I would tell to people.  

During the divorce process, the court ignored all of the abuse issues 'because he's bigger, this must be nonsense.'  They literally ignored it, said it couldn't have happened.    She's someone else's problem now -- and by all accounts she's not any nicer to her new husband.   To this day, even when her friends and family call her out on her abusive behavior, she deflects it as 'he's not a man if he complains about little old me...'"
That there's a lot more women that hate men than I originally expected. 
Not exercising. Bonus points for making it a point of pride.

"The stupidest thing I did in 2017 was getting back together with my ex. I'm not sure what I was thinking, she was really hot but certifiably insane. It ended very poorly and my heart in tatters again.

And then I ended up messing up a great friendship because I was too needy and inadvertently made my friend choose between us. My friend said she didnt want to take any sides but it was clear that she sorta chose my ex over me. It was a double blow really. 

Thankfully I learned from all of this and I managed to not make any more major mistakes this year. "
"We had been dating a little more than a month, and I had more than two weeks off for Christmas vacation, and I was going home to see my family. My mother jokingly invited my new girlfriend. I told her, and she said yes.  We drove 9 hours to my home, spent 10 days there, then drove to the other end of the state where we spent New Years with my friends. When we finally got back to my place after about 10 hours of driving, I asked her if she wanted to go rent a movie and get a pizza, and she said yes.  So, after spending 24/7 together for almost 3 weeks, we still enjoyed each other’s company.  I think we both knew at that point we were good for each other. We’ve been married 11 years with two children. "
TIL Popeye animators were size queens. 
"The main 'problem' is me being too independent and being happy by myself.

In my early 20s I was a bit of a NiceGuy, although I was too emotionally closed-off and anxious to be a real one. When I finally started dating around age 25 it was clear that I had some personal problems and really wasn't ready for a healthy relationship. So I decided to really work on myself, went to therapy, started working out a lot more, all that jazz. 

That really worked out, especially the therapy part. So I'm now actually happy by myself. I also have a pretty good career, interesting hobbies, I'm well-read and doing ok financially due to not having a girlfriend (lots of time and money saved). 

Now that I'm slowly picking up the pace in terms of dating, I'm finding myself having pretty high standards and not a lot of tolerance for stuff like 'the chase'. I'm relatively confidident and don't really care about my lack of experience, but still it's quite noticeable at every stage of dating, and sometimes that can create problems. For example, most girls that I go on dates with have had at least one but usually more serious long-term relationships. Me not having that experience is uncommon. It's not necessarily a dealbreaker for most girls, and I think I can explain it well, but let's face it, it's frowned upon by society and not an asset in any way."
Get on a bike or a treadmill and start moving your body 
I learned that it is so good I got married and am not in that singles game anymore.
"The assumptions that get made by default based on gender. 

My SO's parents disapprove of me and claim my mother did a bad job raising me because I'm not interested in stereotypical guy things like cars and sports. 

They're constantly pointing out other successful, archetypical guys they know to her behind my back in a vain attempt to separate us despite us being together for 2 years.

Also, a family friend of mine who's divorced from his wife had the kids with him. She came to pick up the kids from his house very obviously shit faced. When he refused to let her take the children and endanger their lives, she became violent. He called the police and reported it as an assault/domestic abuse. Cop car pulled up, no questions asked they put **him** in handcuffs and started to force him into the back of the cop car. After all, only men are capable of physical abuse, right?

I know problems like these exist for the opposite gender as well, but you tend to hear about that side of the problem a lot more in mainstream media."
"Taking my newly bought shoes with me on my Japan trip. As my only pair of shoes.

"While we always look at the girl, what I've found is that you need to look at yourself. Ask yourself some questions: 

*Do I get enough sleep?
*Do I get enough exercise? 
*Do I eat well?
*Do I like myself? Am I happy?
*Do I have good quality friends in my life

If you're miserable before you have a good SO, odds are you'll be miserable after you've come down off that initial relationship high. If you want a relationship that will stand the test of time, you have to have your shit together. I've found my marriage has improved like clockwork every time I make a change that makes me a better person. Self improvement should never stop. 

As for the girl, look for someone who is emotionally stable and constantly striving towards becoming a better person. So long as you genuinely like each other and have a lot of fun together, you have a good shot of making it. Another thing you should look for - after a few months, you should be able to feel totally unguarded around them. Being totally relaxed around a person is a big part of sustainability - if I feel like I have to put on a show or am walking on egg shells around my SO, well, that's not sustainable. "
"In the military, especially in the infantry, we were always told that if a domestic situation went down that you, the male, should just leave. It doesnt matter what happens, the male will always be arrested and detained until the story gets sorted out. It was taught to me as a private and I taught it to my guys when I became a team leader."

But you may end up leaving her because she's a bitchapotamus. Or one of you could step off the sidewalk and get hit by a car.

Enjoy the moment. And make a conscious effort to fight fears of the future. "
"A copy of my recent post:

Perhaps it is not a ""quality"" per se, but in my opinion every man should take on fitness with a serious passion and set forth to lose fat and gain muscle. How much muscle gain you may desire is completely up to you. Over the past 4.5 years I have religiously pursued a (non-competing) bodybuilding lifestyle that has blessed me with a body I am proud of. The benefits are vast, I will list a few.

 • A greater sense of overall well-being

 • Being able to reliably view yourself as ""sexy"" is good for confidence and good for the soul

 • A greater ability to handle stress

 • A tangible increase in how healthy you look to other people. Health, coupled with a good hygiene sense, shines through every part of your body. 

 • Men, most of all, will in general give you a greater amount of respect. This has implications both in your personal and professional life. I have been able to gain quite a lot influence and privilege due in part to my healthy and strong appearance. Unfortunately, this can be quite unfair to other people in some cases, but it is how our world is.

 • Women are, on average, more attracted to you. The caveat is that being fit and visibly strong does not do as much for your love life as many men would think. If anything, gay men give me vastly more attention than women, but the increase in my ability to attract women is nonzero. Still, it is no silver bullet in this regard so take this part with a grain of salt. 

If a man is able to dedicate himself to fitness throughout the years, even if for 6 hours a week, I guarantee you that your work will not go unrewarded.

"I fell for a girl who had a boyfriend and wasted a whole semester suppressing my emotions with alcohol and drugs, totally ruining my grades and messing up my plan.

This showed me I need to grow the fuck up."
"Both. I think people are just more aware of everything thanks to the internet. This awareness can bring attention to issues that previously were relatively unheard of, but also cause lots of stress and anxiety since you're constantly comparing yourself to so many people, even if it's just subconsciously. That can lead to anxiety itself or addiction, depression, and maybe exacerbation of existing problems."
"Back when I used to gym a lot, I noticed a strong uptick in confidence - not exclusively in dating but just with anything in general. Gave me a more consistent ""Yeah, I can do that"" attitude toward things."
"The drive to continue to improve herself.

I don't mean ""own more stuff"" or ""get more social cred.""  I mean:

* She has literal notebooks full of vocabulary words that she found interesting and so wrote down to review later.
* Originally she wasn't that experienced of a cook; nowadays she bakes our bread from scratch and has an expanding portfolio of dishes she knows how to make.
* Whenever we'd be sitting around chatting and either of us were uncertain about something, we'd immediately go look it up so we'd know better for next time.
* She's gone from being disorganized and frazzled almost nonstop to having various forms of to-do lists that she checks daily.
* While she's inherently an introvert, she's adopted an array of leadership skills which let her cope with her daily responsibilities much better.
* It's more important to her to learn new things than to just get by.

All of these things show, to me, that she's really *invested* in this life.  I need that in a partner so I don't feel like I'm the only one who cares about making our corner of the world truly better."

"Recovering from a relationship? Good luck, especially if you just broke up and your ex's friends start to rally against you. In a break-up, it's often assumed by default that it had something to do with the guy.

Getting into a relationship is its own trouble too if you're afraid to make the first move as well. You just become practically invisible and unwanted."

"She dealt really well with disagreements and tiffs - she never pouted or held grudges, didn't run off to her friends (or worse, an orbiter,) and didn't weaponise things I'd said for later wheedling. We didn't even argue much, she could just handle standing up for her own interests maturely and without drama. She did and still does find her own space, cool off and then talk about it calmly. I guess I do the same, so we work well in the regard, we try to actually listen to each other. "
"I’m on the cusp, having started dating in earnest around 24. My issue has been that I’m not terribly forgiving.

Like..I started dating when I was done with grad school...so my expectation is that my partners be mature, act mature, and be able to communicate.

There’s a lot I wasn’t aware of. Having started so late (and had an awesome first girlfriend), I wasn’t used to stuff like extreme jealousy, insecurity, passive-aggression, etc.

So any thing around that or other unfortunate relationship tropes tends to make me lose interest pretty quickly. I don’t have patience for bad behavior the way someone who might have dated since they were younger and experienced this already might.

So where other people might realize that that freak out she had 3 months in was fueled by insecurity because she’s developed feelings and give her a pass, I’m going to think she’s crazy or was hiding serious personality issues until she got comfortable."

We don't say ""You have to be happy friendless in order to have friends"", so why do we regurgitate this for relationships?"

"Sexual harassment, assault, and misconduct. Ive been pressured into sex that I didn't want and when I try opening up about it I'm basically told to just man up. Including by women who complain about how women get victimized all the time by men.

"When my wife and I were just dating, my older brother died.  He lived about 6 hours from us so we all drove up there to pack up his things, hold a small get together for his friends up there, things like that.  Digging through his soaked, burned out bedroom desperately trying to find something, anything, that felt like *him* to take and keep with me.  Most of the time I was emotionally absent, treating it like a community cleaning program or something, but every once in a while I would find something that he had held onto since we were kids and I would lose it.  Even though she had only met him a few times, my wife was crying harder than I was.  She told me that seeing me so hurt was the hardest thing she's had to put up with and it broke her heart to know there wasn't anything she could do.

We had to drive his car back to my parents house 6 hours away.  On the drive back we talked nonstop about all the important things.  Our future, how we felt about kids, religion, politics, race relations, love, money, school, etc.  About halfway through the drive we got to talking about travel and where we had never been.  We planned a trip to Boston.  On that car ride, after being so emotionally empty, and seeing how much she truly cared about me and my family, I was truly happy with her.  I could pretend none of the horrible shit in the world was happening and there was just warm, happy, love.  I knew before we were even done planning I was going to propose in Boston.  We got engaged and married after that trip and have been deliriously happy since.  I still think about my brother every single day.  The only positive thing that came out of his death was that I really got to see who was on my side and who was just talk.  My wife is the single best thing to ever happen to me, she saved my life, and I am thankful for every second I get to spend with her."

"In my last relationship, we'd be lying in bed naked, cuddled up and talking, and her hand would start wandering southbound...then her mouth would follow...and not long thereafter I'd be pounding away at her having fun.

It was a nice change of pace, but my previous girlfriend, we'd be in the same situation, but my hand would wander, and she was very submissive and enjoyed what I'd do with that hand. So I'd get her off, then she'd open her legs and let me finish.  Which was also great.

Point, I suppose, is having a willing partner who's enthusiastic about sex and comfortable being naked is more important than who grabs whose bits first."

"This. To add something that isn't with a social climate and more with expectations, I would say that there is still a bit of a stigma with ""going dutch"". Some women still expect the man to pay for all of the food, even if the guy is of a lower economic level.

"Mostly when I was younger...lots of pressure from family to not date White women. My mom once had a relative I’d never met approach me at a reunion and warn me not to “bring nonwhite bitches home”.

Once, I was walking with a female friend and had someone call out from a passing car, “Why you can’t date a Black Woman?!”

I have a Black female friend who disapproves of who I end up dating (she dates White dudes but feels a way about me dating White women), and doesn’t like me dating women more than a few years older than me.

Another friend literally cried when i started dating a White woman :/

As I got older, and people became more aware of the idea that i did t care about their opinions and would likely cut them or ofmmy life if they insisted on sharing their opinion, that all tapered off.

My mom went from pointedly asking me what race my SO was to just being happy I mentioned seeing someone..her options were to respect my choices or be kept totally unaware of them."

You know how guys in porn have massive things? Well there's surgery you can get to make yours bigger. HOWEVER, it involves cutting some tendons inside the body behind the base of the penis.

I think teenagers are actually more equipped to handle that because they are still rapidly changing. I think I might have dealt with it better a decade earlier, but the fact that I waited so long emotionally stunted me as far as relationships go. 

As far as dating went, it was easy to catch up. Tinder and online dating make it easy to set up a lot of dates easily, and as you go on more dates you get more experienced in dating. You make mistakes, but you learn from them. "

- Obsession with crap music. I don't go to gay clubs because it's always cheesy 90s pop on a loop. There are almost no gay alternative clubs, rock bars, or anything like that. It's all glitter and neon and shirts are verboten.

- The rampant cheating. Good lord. And on that note, the normalisation of ""open relationships"". And, not unique to the gay world, but the absolute blatant way some people will circle like vultures, just waiting for your relationship to end so they can try and fuck you/your partner/both. 

- The assumption that you're automatically a hyper-leftist genderfluid rights crusader. And the subsequent mass unpersoning when it becomes clear that you're not. I posted an angry react on the BBC3 video of that racist l'Oreal model who got fired for being racist saying Britain is the most racist place on the planet and immediately lost like 5 friends over it.

"Copypasta of the Unified Creepiness Quotient:

&gt;Now, if I could establish an informal Creepiness Quotient to describe the feeling someone gives you in the first few seconds they're hitting on you, I would do it as follows.

&gt;Creepiness = ( (Awkwardness x Forwardness) / (Attractiveness) )Persistence

&gt;Now, let's look at the factors here, with ""you"" being a nonspecific potential creep who is hitting on ""me,"" a nonspecific person of sexual interest:

&gt;Awkwardness is the extent to which you demonstrate your inability to operate effectively in my chosen social environment. A person who cannot initiate or maintain a comfortable conversation with me is an unappealing choice of partner. Immigrants often score highly on Awkwardness, which is natural--they're working in an unfamiliar social environment. I think that's unfortunate, because usually it's not at all their fault.

&gt;Forwardness is the extent to which you convey that your goal is purely to use me as a sex-thing. If I think you like me because I'm interesting, this is noncreepy and good. If I think you like me because my part fits your part, that is creepy and bad. Men from some cultures tend to be more forward than men from others, depending on the appropriate gender roles in their societies. In my own personal experience, Indians are high on the Forwardness list. I'm not remotely qualified to offer a guess as to why, beyond ""lol culture"" which is not explanatory of anything.

&gt;Attractiveness is a saving grace! Maybe you're hot, maybe you've got a great voice, maybe you've got nice arms, maybe you told a great joke, maybe I like your clothes, maybe you belong to the same subculture I do. Maybe you aren't an obese scuzzlord with halitosis who smells like BO and salmonella. Rules #1 and #2 aren't all there is, but they definitely help. I don't think your ethnicity makes you more or less likely to be attractive as a rule, though some individual people have some degree of preference.

&gt;Persistence is bad news. Persistence is when you don't take ""no"" for an answer. Persistence is when you apply pressure, is when you get aggressive or defensive, and is when you demand explanations for why I won't date you. At high levels, persistence is when you start to give off rape vibes. Persistence is what you get when someone believes they are entitled to sex with me or entitled to a relationship with me, and my opinion on the matter is an inconvenience. Persistence is a creepiness multiplier. An awkward, unattractive dude who says ""ey, you got nice tits, I got a nice dick, so, wanna fuck"" then leaves when I say no? He's creepy, yes. A dude who is otherwise normal but who won't leave me alone? Way creepier."
"""Stop trying to impress me, I already like you and it doesn't make me like you more.""

The habit of bragging and building myself up was something that I hadn't successfully ditched from being a teenager, and it was something I needed to hear. Made me realize that I did it far more often than I realized, and that it was very obvious. I was just telling a story as far as I was concerned, but it totally made me see my own behaviour in a new light. I did stop, and I stopped in other domains of life too. People definitely started responding to me better afterwards too, so it was definitely something I needed to hear. "
"If I know anything it's that every man wants to be called ""Daddy-roni"". It reminds us of fatherhood and pasta the twin pillars of manliness."
"But...forearms are visible in T-shirts, etc. etc. too. No one calls those intrinsically attractive. So maybe it's not a forearm issue per se? (Then again, there are subs devoted to forearms, so who knows.)

Yes, the ""rolled-up sleeves of a dress shirt"" look *is* quite hot, and I can't explain why. But it's more to do with looking classy/put-together and casual at the same time. It's a good look."

"&gt; I'm amazed at how many comments in the AskWomen version of this thread are straight up hating on men in general.
&gt; 

One of the top comments was that men here almost always think about sex in some capacity. I responded by saying that obviously that's the case, because according to the survey on here last year, most men here are in their late teens/early twenties and in college.

The _immediate_ response was ""weren't most of them virgins too?"" and the further answers ""yikes"" and ""that explains a lot"".

I feel it's hilarious too me how often people cry out against slut shaming (which is FINE, slut shaming is horrible) but once someone  needs to smack some men around, just slap them with the good old ""they are virgins lol"" and virgin shame them.

And then they wonder why a lot of men don't want to tell others about their virginity. Well, surprise, apparently a lot of women do care about it.

Also, all that shit about ""reddit made me lose respect for men in general"". What the fuck? "

"Speaking from experience, dogs. 

If you happen to be looking for a dog the weeks after Christmas is a great time to shop for one. Breeders are trying to sell puppies that people didn't buy as presents so they're cheaper. As well as people who bought or received a puppy for Christmas are figuring out what a terrible idea it was to give/get a dog as a gift, or they simply aren't as prepared for a pet as they thought they were. 

Obviously adopting a dog from a shelter or rescue is always a great idea, and you should check there first, but many gift puppies and dogs end up there right after Christmas too for the same reasons. 

I got my dog last year on Dec 28th from this exact situation. I got a (probably) purebred Pomeranian for pennies, and I also got the satisfaction of rescuing him from a situation that was terrible for him and the family that had him. All because someone thought a puppy was a good Christmas present. (Spoiler: they're usually not, unless it's a Christmas present to yourself.)"

Men who have a normal, healthy interest in sex are treated like perverts and ""aggressive"", even when they have no history of unwanted advances or inappropriate comments. Heterosexual men are supposed to never ever talk about sex except in the bedroom, behind closed doors, after the room has been thoroughly checked for bugs.

Talking about sex is fine. If you can't deal with that, remove yourself from the conversation. "

"I was mulling this over earlier. There's a massive push in sports for #ThisGirlCan right now. It's a great movement that I fully support, because any assumptions that lean towards girls being somehow less capable of doing things is mysogynistic bullshit.
But what about the boys who are struggling against the expectations of everyone around them to 'be real men'? Where's their hashtag? Girls have had it worse in society for, well, forever, but that doesn't mean we should leaves boys behind. There's a crisis in schools with girls out performing boys at every level, because not once are these young boys ever told how to deal with their testosterone and their feelings; short of being reprimanded when they don't know how to properly express themselves.

"&gt;#Spontaneous desire
&gt;Spontaneous desire looks like this:  You’re walking down the road and suddenly think “Wow, I would love to have sex right now.”  Or, you’re just sitting in a chair and suddenly you get an erection.  This of course is recognized by your brain and you think “Wow, I’d love to put this erection to use right now.”  I’ve seen things that say men think about sex every 7 seconds (which seems a bit much) to a few times a day (which seems too little), and often if we’re thinking about sex … we want sex.

&gt;Ask a group of women how often they just suddenly want sex out of the blue, and you’re more likely to get answers that range from once a week to once a decade.  Of course, there are some who have spontaneous desire pop up more often, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  It’s just not what the average woman experiences.

&gt;Unfortunately, our society has been trying to tell us that spontaneous desire is not only the norm for both men and women, but that it’s the proper pattern for arousal.  In our movies somehow the lead couple manage to spontaneously want sex at the same time.  They just suddenly are overcome with a desire to have sex.  What are the chances of that in real life?  Slim to none I’d say.  It completely ignores responsive desire as a mode.

&gt;#Responsive desire
&gt;Responsive desire work the opposite and it looks like this.  You aren’t aroused at all, but then your husband starts rubbing your back, or stroking your hair, or kissing you and you start to think “Hmm, that feels good…I might be up for some sex”.  Or maybe it’s Friday night and you “always” have sex Friday night.  You know, it’s not scheduled … but it’s expected. So you allow your husband to undress you and start kissing you and you’re thinking “Well, I’ll do this for him”.  You’re not really aroused and so, with the help of lube, sex begins and then you start feeling something.  Then you start to think “Oh, wow, that’s starting to feel good.  Maybe I do want this….oh yeah, I definitely want this.”  That’s responsive desire.

&gt;Luckily, we figured this out in our marriage a few years ago, and so my wife will sometimes say “let’s just get started, and I’ll catch up”, because she knows that her arousal patterns is almost always responsive.  I think she’s only spontaneously wanted sex three times in our marriage, and even those are suspect (TTC).

&gt;If you don’t know about responsive desire then your sex drive can be confusing
Now, if you’re a wife and you don’t know anything about responsive desire, and you’ve been listening to our culture all your life (how can you not), then you probably believe that sex should only happen when you’re already aroused.  I can’t tell you how many men have written me with the phrase “when the planets align” when describing their wife’s willingness to have sex.  Because in order for their wife to believe she wants to have sex these things need to happen:

&gt;1. She needs to spontaneously have a desire at the same time he does
&gt;2. Both her physiological arousal and her psychological arousal need to be in sync (see arousal non-concordance)
&gt;3. The triggers of our sexual excitation system need to outweigh the triggers of her sexual inhibition system (I’ll write on that in a post soon, I promise)

&gt;Frankly, the planets have a better chance of aligning.  More often, these types of wives just give in and give duty sex because they feel they are obligated to.  And guess what happens?  Turns out they enjoy it a lot of the time!  Most of them have orgasms, and think, or even say, in the  moment “Why don’t we do this more often?”  But, then the next time her husband wants sex … well, they fall back on their culturally influenced system of “am I in the mood for sex?”  This confuses a lot of men, because they see their wife enjoying sex, having orgasms, maybe even saying they want to do it more often … but it doesn’t ever change.  They do everything that society tells them they should do to have more sex.  They help with dishes, they make sure their wife enjoys herself during sex, they start with a massage, they go through every checklist.  But the problem is that they’re working against a flawed model.  The problem isn’t that they aren’t doing enough in most cases.  The problem is that their wife is thinking she needs to be aroused before any sexual contact begins.

&gt;When the reality is that the data shows that only about 15% of women find they have exclusively have spontaneous desire whereas 75% of men do. On the other side of the spectrum, about 30% of women and 5% of men will never experience spontaneous desire (I want to run my own survey on this to confirm).  This can cause some serious confusion and problems if you are expecting all desire to be spontaneous and the bulk of women experience responsive desire more often than spontaneous.

"Dude, your biggest regret is basically being Captain America. Don't lose that fire, you did the right thing. That guy is one horrendous douche, bullying an autistic kid, then sucker punching you Don't worry though, he'll probably die from opiates in the next couple years."

Life is stressful as fuck yo 
"Remember that scene in The Watchmen where Rorschach gets attacked in the prison cafeteria, and after crippling one guy, turns to the room and roars ""I'm not locked in here with you. *You're locked in here with me!*"". That kind of flipping of perspective is helpful when thinking about personal confidence issues.

For example:

But what if I'm not good enough for her?

*And she's good enough for you? Why?*

What if she finds my nervousness and awkwardness a turn off?

*And she's not acting nervous and awkward? Are you spending all your time together thinking about yourself?*

What if I'm a bad kisser?

*Who said she was a good kisser?*

What if she thinks I'm bad in bed?

*How many guys will she have to have slept with to have an educated opinion on the matter? Probably a lot more.*

Ok, we're on a date. What do I do now?

*It's her date, too. What's she doing? Why or why not?*

Put more succinctly: if you've got chemistry with someone, your energy is better spent watching and listening rather than fumbling around with your own self doubts. She's got her own self esteem issues she's worrying about. She's not sitting back confidently and watching you squirm, no matter how calm and collected she looks on the outside.

That voice in your head has a name. One name I liked from a book I read called them gremlins. As in, ""oh, you're not feeling confident today? What are the gremlins saying?"". That voice is a real asshole, and you'll probably hear it in other parts of your life, too. It's the ruthless critic that knows all your weaknesses and exploits them cruelly. It says all the horrible things that can stop you in your tracks. And it's working against you.

The next time that voice is talking to you, ask it if what it's telling you is helping. Is the voice guiding you toward doing something better? Or just being a dick? If it's the latter, it's not helping, and with that in mind, try to lower its volume. There's a line between thoughtful introspection and crippling self doubt. Don't let that fucking voice keep you from doing things you want.

If your self esteem is so low that you don't think you're good enough for a girl.... Just break that down a bit. Are we talking about finding a girl to marry? That's a bit presumptuous. How about finding one to date for a few weeks? Are you such a useless person that there isn't even a girl out there you're good enough for *for a couple of weeks*? (That was sarcasm; of course you are)

Fact of the matter is, in dating, both of you bring something to the table. If you bring nothing but a shitty attitude and insecurity, and she brings all the love and wonder of the universe, then yes, that's a one-sided relationship and she'll probably nope out of there pretty fast. But you aren't bringing nothing - you're bringing your unique set of interests and bad jokes and boring stories and weird family and your experiences with all the heroes and idiots and maniacs you've had relationships with your whole life. You're a product of your experience, and that's going to be interesting and endearing to a lot of women. And it'll be tedious and boring to others.

But here's the real secret: it's not your decision whether or not you're good enough for any woman out there. It's her decision. Your job is to just be yourself and let her make that decision. Your job is to pay attention to her and decide if *she's* not good enough for *you*."
"As a white male it's my fault. I'm a rapist, oppressor, destroyer. If I decided not to get married, I'm a pathetic loser. If I do get married, I work harder than anyone else in the house, and I spend too much time working to provide for my family, I'm an absentee dad and I don't pay enough attention to my wife, so my wife divorces me, but, I still get to support my wife and kids lifestyle, while I live alone, eating mac and cheese, because that's all I can afford after Alimony and child support are paid. When my wife wanted kids, I was expected to ""perform"" every other day. But now that we have 2 kids, I just have to be the ATM, my body is only around to make money. So I walk around feeling unwanted, and unloved. I went to Iraq for a year, seemed like everyone moved on, now, when I feel lost and alone, it's my problem to deal with. I tried to talk to my wife about it, she immediately changed the subject. This happened a couple of times, now she can't understand why I ""shut her out."" Yes, I do have PTSD, so when I have problems, I'm an asshole. When I can't deal with the depression, I can't ""be a man and suck it up."" Men in this country are fucked.

"I have a friend who is perpetually single, never had a real relationship.

She’s pretty, she’s social, she likes typical male interests like sports and beer. 

She’s also very shy with the opposite sex. She’s not very emotional at all which some might see as a plus but it makes her difficult to establish romance with because she’s pretty deadpan. She has hesitations due to sexual inexperience which can make her come across as uninterested. She has very high standards and due to her hesitations about sex/romance she finds any excuse to rule a guy out instead of take a chance on him. "
"Lack of exercise. 

I don't have the body of Zeus, but I do work on staying in decent shape and enjoy a few active hobbies. If someone is doing nothing to try and keep themselves up, how would they join me in participating in some of my hobbies?

And, of course, there's simply the physical attraction aspect of it. I find I'm most attracted to the athletic body type. Extra weight is simply not attractive to me. I also find, though, that simply being skinny but weak from lack of exercise is equally unattractive. "

"That we are guilty before any proof when it comes to sexual malfeasance.  

We are tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion just with an accusation, even if there is no proof whatsoever beyond she said it happened. 

It's a massive societal double standard.  "
"I'll try to keep this brief. We dated for 2 1/2 years, had talked a lot about our future (marriage etc). I proposed on Christmas eve and she said she wasn't ready. The next 4 weeks were awful because it felt like she was very distant and sad that she broke my heart. Eventually asked her if she wanted to take a break and her face lit up for the first time in a long time. We ended up taking a break. She said ""I need to live for myself and figure out what I want"" and after 7 months of waiting, I decided I had to move on because it was torture. We never got back together, and we're technically still friends, although we haven't talked in over a year. 

In hindsight, I'm glad she said no, because I think I was asking for the wrong reasons, and it probably would have ended in divorce. Still fucked me up, though. "

"If there are kids involved, and it leads to divorce, physically leaving the situation will be used against you in court. It’ll be framed as abandonment. Even if it was a short term absence to ease tension. It’s very debatable whether or not physically leaving is the right thing to do. The only reason I know this is because I’ve confirmed it 3 times. 

Responding officer explained that to me during a domestic call. Took her to jail because “we have to separate you and she’s more at fault”. It was a verbal altercation. Fuck TN laws. This was where I learned it. 

Lawyer advised me to never vacate the home or offer to do so. Explained how it’d be used against me in divorce court. Just a rough patch, we worked it out :)

Friend bought a house with his wife and new kid. Couple years later they were separating and he moved in with a friend temporarily since her family was out of state. Respectable move I guess. Nope! Her attorney claimed abandonment, she got EVERY FUCKING THING. All he got was depression and really hated women for a while. She fucked him hard. 

So, in my experience I think the best thing to do is completely separate within the home. Maybe even behind locked doors and with a video feed. But NEVER abandon your home, family or responsibilities for any amount of time regardless of the agreement, written or not, that you’ve made with your spouse. "

"Not well, because I have not been searching. That's basically it. Coming home every day at 6pm and having no social circle or any hobbies that force me outside doesn't really give me a chance to ""find"" someone.

"Having an arm covered with tattoos. I am okay with a couple of tattoos here and here, but I just don't find it attractive when a whole arm or body is covered with it."
"Thanks for the post. It’s this kind of thinking that causes those who would like reach and get help, don’t and it leads down to a bad road. Then after the fact they say “we should have done something”. When it’s too late. "
He would be looking at a carbon copy of himself as I have completely stagnated. 
"I feel stifled but I can tell I'm getting more comfortable about it.
I think the issue was at first I tried so hard to make sure I gave her attention and that I was interesting. So knowing I can just be there and not having to give her specific attention, and that she'll be fine with that, is what was confusing to me. 

So while I am getting more comfortable just doing nothing around her, I still need time where I can be by myself doing nothing.

By nothing I mean like just browsing the internet or reading a book"
Just knowing where the fuck we're having dinner almost instantly instead of playing a 10 minute guessing game is a real winner for me
 Think she wanted you to hit her? 
"""Hey guy I hooked up with once, I'm pregnant, and I'm keeping it...and you're paying the child support. Tough luck.""

orrrr

""Hey husband, I'm pregnant, and i'm aborting it. I don't care if youre willing to take care of it on your own, I'm killing your baby. Tough luck."""
Yes. Number two especially. 
"Worst: Drama, gossip, high school-like social environment (cool ladies vs. uncool ladies vs. young cool ladies vs. young uncool ladies, etc). Lots of crying over nothing. And everything, EVERYTHING is a big deal. A problem that could be solved with 5 words required 40 with these ladies and still would result in some kind of issue. 

Best: I was treated like a prince. I'm not the greatest looking, but I'm not heinous, so being the only guy meant I was their eye candy. That went a long way with how they all treated me. You get all the gossip, but aren't really expected to participate (they'll try to drag you in, but you have to stay strong). 

Problem with being treated so well is that, when I entered the real world after I quit, I took a huge hit to my ego. It actually played a significant role in a bout of depression I battled in my late twenties. I went from man on top to another average Joe who had to earn the respect of some accomplished men and women who didn't give a shit who I thought I was. Confidence killer. 

Years later, after some adjusting and self-care, I find it hard to work with women. The bad shines brighter than the good (especially their tendency to make a big deal out of the most minor of issues). I've become comfortable not being the center of attention and working with a nice mix of men and women. "
"Personally, I can think of a few... 

1) the pressure to love up to a legacy. I'm the oldest in the family and my dad is a CEO type figure. Not that he ever pressures me but ever since I was a kid I've felt the need to make him proud and live up to that success. Kinda hard to top that... 

2) inability to be emotionally vulnerable especially with the opposite sex

 3) the old school expectation to be a provider. Between insurance, 401ks and straight salaries it can be overwhelming to plan not just my future but incorporate the idea of supporting someone else as well. I have a provider mentality and find pleasure in serving others or giving gifts but it's still stressful especially when there is a drastic income difference between me and an SO. 

Anyhow that's just off the top of my head. Both genders have challenges that are extremely hard to relate to for the other gender so I applaud you for trying to understand and better yourself in the process "
Circumcision to make infants still being legal. I don’t care what you think about it but if you think women have their body autonomy for abortions then infant males also have their own bodily autonomy as well. 
I'm sorry to hear that. Life will improve I promise.  Mourn the break up but keep fresh in the mind the problems you two had as this is the catalyst for moving on and improving. Concentrate on yourself and reclaim your hobbies. 
"Quarter life crisis: you're having one. Look it up, I'm sure you'll find much wisdom on the subject."

"Dating in 2017 has changed dramatically. There’s been some sort of shift since I started dating back in 2010 or so. I feel a great sense of entitlement coming from women as well as bad manners, lack of intelligence/can’t hold conversations and these young 20 somethings want the guy to be making six figures. I’d also say the biggest thing I’ve noticed is loyalty or the lackthereof. People these days date several people at the same time and I’m sure fuck several people at a time as well. If you’re dating in 2017, wrap it up boys. 

Here’s to a fantastic 2018!"
"She put up with my many personal foibles without a fuss.  

Also, made me laugh like no other woman before.

Face mask gang... we out here
"Lots of green flags. 

Stable job in her field, plus ambition
Lived in an apartment on her own
Doesn’t drink often, no trouble when she does
Great relationship with family
Friends are good, kind people
Always encouraging me pursue hobbies without her
Is a seriously kind and generous person
Dresses well, like an adult
High libido, healthy attitude toward sex
Instant, deep trust

"
She told me exactly what she expected out of a relationship and life partner. Things she wouldn't budge on. Basically she told me what she wanted and that she didn't have time to fuck around and play games.
"""I like your shirt""

""Thanks! By the way, want to get dinner sometime?""

""Ugh why do men always assume that being nice to them means I'm attracted to them?"""
"Make up. I’m not saying to not wear make up just that a lot of guys don’t really care. Same with clothes. If my wife just throws on jeans and a tank top and throws her hair in a pony tail, she looks as good as when she spends an hour on “dolling herself up”"
"It's like the underwear v bikini thing.

Dress shirts are ""meant"" to be worn sleeves down, so when you roll the sleeves up you're exposing something.

Bikini is meant to be worn in public, it's hot but that's the idea there's no stigma attached to it, underwear is private, if you can see it it's exposing something not ""meant"" to be, hence it's a scandalous thing.

It's probably also to do with how it brings a casual/family look to an otherwise business/formal look. Being able to show off your success (dressing like a businessman, etc) but still embracing the family/casual side (roll up your sleeves to help cook dinner) that is inherently attractive."
"Sounds pathetic and sad but honestly just emotional intimacy. Like sitting on the sofa together watching shit on TV holding each other close, her resting her head on my shoulders or curling up on my lap sometimes, was cute.

I haven't had that kind of feeling for someone for a long time now."
Schroedingers birth control. A couple get pregnant and it is solely the woman's decision whether to have the child or abort it. The man had no decision even if they would be willing to raise the baby in their own. But if the woman wants the child then the man has to pay child support whether he wants to or not. Not saying I do not support choice just saying men have no voice in it. 
Don't delete them dude. Change your expectations. Those things are magic if you're into fat girls.
"Shopping. I could spend so much time in a mall, or hours at a Marshall's. It's the go to thing I suggest when anyone wants to hang out."

Unfortunately, my experience has been the opposite. Practically no matches at all.

"Don't forget lit, as in ""This song is LIT!"" The word has seriously become its own worst enemy thanks to overuse."
Actually i think it's done in purpose to get a perspective on how sex changes the way the person reacts to a certain situation
Being afraid to be honest with others and tell them how I feel. Taking things too seriously. 
Google “spontaneous/responsive” desire.  Fully understanding this has helped me and my wife to improve our sex life massively.

"Never saying ""flying spaghetti monster"" again might be a good start. "
"And then you can pick your partner up, or hold them down, consensually of course.   It's fun to demonstrate your strength in a caveman way and have it be appreciated/encouraged/enjoyed."
"""I'm your daughter's boyfriend, not your employee. I furrow a different field and sow my seeds in a different trench, if you know what I mean."""
"Cankles. Bowed legs. Unkempt or excessive body hair. Outtie belly button. Balding (sorry - I know how shallow that is!) 

And using the phrase “cool beans” or any overuse of some lame or played out catchphrase. "
"""Oh, my last boyfriend did/took/said/whatever"" too often.

Call me when you're over him."
Unresolved bitterness over exes. Drug problems
"AW is a huge confirmation of the reddit rule.


Step 1, be attractive.

Step 2, don't be unattractive.

With the corollary of ""we expect men to be mind readers and know if they fit the rules.""

I don't answer with my real name of course but I've always got a decoy name in the chamber"
I just watch Maury to feel better about my life
"Depression: you always have to put on a confident and happy face or else you look week

Societal Norms: I am an extremely emotional person so when i get hurt i fall into depression (see above)

Anxiety: Always having to live up to expectations. Whether it be that I need to be this extremely confident guy who can talk to anyone about anything when in reality i have extreme trust issues and i hate opening up to anyone cause i feel like i’ll just be taken advantage of (this has happened way to many times)

Insecurity: I am one of the most insecure people i know. I’m extremely skinny when all my friends are pretty built. I’m really shy when my best friends are extremely outgoing. I’ve never had a girlfriend and when i think i have one she goes and stabs me in the back and saying that she played me. 

What sucks too is that when i try to explain stuff to people i feel like i’m annoying them. like i’ll explain some stuff to them multiple times cause it is still bothering me but i sometimes get the feeling that they are tired of hearing my problems. so i tend to keep a lot inside. Idk i’m in a rough point in my life because of some girl (see above) and even though it happened a month ago it still stings cause she’s still constantly on my mind. there are times i wish i never met her but then there are times where i wish i did things different. idk. i have no idea what i’m doing with my life too so that’s fun as well. "
"""I feel like we've turned into brother and sister instead of husband and wife""

Silver lining is we're working on it slowly."
"This isn't shallow, imo. If she doesn't take care of her hands and feet, just imagine what the rest of her is like."
"There are a lot of ornery lesbians and shut-ins with a grudge against men in that subreddit. Pay them no mind. If i followed their advice literally, I'd never interact with women. 

When i think about it, Askwomen is a really bad place for inexperienced and insecure/depressed men. It would really bring you down if you didn't have enough experience and self esteem to ignore the hatred and negativity towards men. If you're a straight male and your self esteem isnt solid, stay the hell away from super feminist communities. They will not help you."
also: why do guys think everything is flirting
This thread is a bunch of normal guys thinking they aren’t good enough. Relax guys. Life isn’t a predetermined set of goals to the finish line of death. 
"""Um who are you and how did you get in my room?"". Good times... Good times"
"My girlfriend does more than me I'd say.  I usually do in the morning, but in the evening she always does."
The amount of women that were repulsed by me skyrocketed 
"Please don't hate women from what you've read, some of us are cool!
"
This is true. I’ve noticed that it seems ok for a woman to put her hand on a man. It’s not spoken out against as the reversal is. They bought should be addressed. 
I think it’d be cool to go back 10 years to get back to a pre cell phone addict/ datting app culture. 
"So pretty much the worst reaction someone can have to a minorish criticism?

Not only does she get pissy, she actively *blames* you for daring to want sex. Shit's not right. "

Grapefruit juice is a damn good juice though. "
My family is horrible but I'm a great person too. 😔
And yet at the same time we're expected to be making all of the advances in the dating world.
"My assumption is that guy waiting in the wings that’s a “friend”, but really wants to get with her."
The nice guys who go from 0 to 100% creepy real fast. Like being nice rewards them with points they can exchange for anything they will ask first but when denied will be (violently) demanded.
No I'm a cutie and I don't feel weird
Oh look a total cunt.
"Your face is a sign of emotional maturity!

Dudes will go if they think they can meet women there.  Paint it (no pun intended) as a way for single guys to meet single women.  Maybe have a singles night once a month?
