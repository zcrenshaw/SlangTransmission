"She told me she lied about her age and was, in fact, 15. I was 23 at the time. I asked for the check, drove her home and refused her multiple attempts to give me a blowjob. She then sent me multiple nudes of herself and said she was going to call the cops because I had child porn on my phone.

"It was what she didn't say. I took her to a bar/putt-putt place that I though would be fun. I asked her questions about herself, tried to make conversation about the activity, the food, etc. Nothing. ""How are you liking your job?"" ""It's okay"". ""Do you have any siblings?"" ""yes"". It was like talking to a Magic 8 Ball, but less responsive. Worst date I've ever had. "

"After seeing each other consistently for a couple weeks, I brought up that I couldn't keep paying for everything myself and asked that she financially contribute to dates as well. Her response was ""maybe you should work harder then"".

I couldn't fucking believe it. My reply was ""well, I could do that, or I can simply date one of the thousands of other girls out there who aren't entitled like you.

"Guy at my gym would constantly stare at me for uncomfortable lengths of time, found me on social media, hugged me (guy I don't know, at the fucking gym), and would occasionally come up behind me in the middle of a set to call me a ""sexy bitch"" in my ear. I told him that I was straight and not interested but that would only deter him for so long. 

I ranted about it on reddit and was accused of being homophobic for not accepting his friendliness. I stopped going to that gym. "

"I had agreed to go on a date with a co-worker (we both worked at a restaurant). She offered to cook me dinner after an upcoming shift we were going to work together, so I said sure. The day of the date comes around and I realize that I have no real interest in dating this girl, so I'll just let her down gently. Well as soon as I walk into the restaurant, she runs up to me and says, ""Are we still on for tonight? Because I don't have my car today and you're my only ride home.""

Damn. So I then resolve to accept the free meal but do and say everything I can to make it obvious that there is no future in our relationship. During the drive to her place (which was 45 freakin minutes away) I steer the conversation to the fact that I would be graduating college in a few month and I was excited to move out of the college town and to the big city for my career. And that's when she said it:

""Oh well by then we'll be in love and my daughter and I can move with you!""

I didn't even know she had a kid. But regardless, that is just NOT something you say on a first date."

"Assuming you didn't make that typo on purpose...

Don't comment on their appearance. It takes a lot of social grace to do that without looking like it's a come-on, and if you're worrying about looking like a creep you probably aren't there yet.

Don't linger. Don't stare. Don't hover. A lot of nonverbal creepage happens when men stare, stand too close, or maintain physical proximity when it is no longer necessary. It's one of the more common ones I've noticed.

* **For staring**, find other things to look at while you are talking to them. Eye contact is important and you don't want to be looking everywhere *but* their eyes, but every few seconds just find something else to flick your eyes to and then back. I was told at an early age that my habit of holding eye contact was intimidating, and I've overcorrected and am since trying to relearn to hold eye contact, so I have the opposite problem. 

* **For hovering,** try to keep your distance so that you could just barely touch their shoulder with an outstretched arm. If you get closer, don't stay in that zone for more than a moment. If they get closer, let them. Just don't be the one to cross that line. Also, try not to loom. If a woman is sitting and you're going to have a conversation, find somewhere nearby to sit. If you're exchanging brief words, increase the distance to more than an arm's reach. I've heard a lot of women complain about men looming over them. 

* **For lingering,** this will be a little harder than the first two. If you end a conversation with any sense of finality, either go back to what you were doing or do something else. When the conversation ends, so should the eye contact. If you were chatting at the water cooler, get your water and walk away. If you were sitting at your desk, go back to typing or scrolling Reddit. Let your body language and gaze indicate that the conversation is over as agreed."

"Her ex hadn't dodged a bullet, but he'd definitely dislodged one. This was the first time we'd met (from tinder), and within 2 drinks I had seen more red flags than a Chinese pride parade. 

The ones I remember because I retell this story all the time: 

- Would never go out with a guy who doesn't buy my drinks and food for me (I made her buy her second, fuck that)
- Ex had dumped her two weeks prior, this was her first date since 
- Would still get back with the ex if he'd stop being a dick
- Doesn't go down on guys
- Had said some bad shit to the ex's mum about him since breaking up
-When I said I was going to go home said she wanted to come over 'to piss him off'

Her whole demeanour was bitchy, and I've genuinely never experienced another person like them since! "

Quite apart from being shitty to you (which it most certainly is), that’s also shitty to gay people.  It’s rather reminiscent of Kevin Spacey trying to cover up his predatory behaviour by saying he was gay.  Predatory is predatory whether you’re gay, straight, man, woman, trans or whatever else."

"So I started seeing this girl some time ago.  Met at a bar, hooked up, then proceeded to see each other for about two-three months.  I knew it was a bad idea from the start (she was 22, divorced, had a kid, at the time I was 32 with zero attachments), but she was cute and into me.  At the three-ish month mark, I couldn't see her for a couple weeks due to how our work schedules lined up.  I explained this to her in a couple texts, and she seemed to understand.

A few days later, I get this text from her, and I'm copypasting from the text itself:

&gt; I want to be up front with you. I really like you and understand your situation. I really would like a relationship with someone who understands me and likes me flaws and all. Saying that, I am racist towards black people due to my situation and for other reasons. Yes my roommate is black and I have a black uncle....I also refer to Jackson's half brother as a bastard and it because that is what it is. Neither it nor its mom deserve anything from me. I just want to be up front and completely honest.....

Racist towards black people.  And she knew that my previous gf was black herself.

That pretty much ended everything right then and there.  Because holy motherfucking shit."
"Definitely my current gf of ten years. I am just so proud to go out with her and introduce her to people, everybody loves her. She's very personable but a great listener, she doesn't try to dominate conversations but always contributes. She can talk to anyone about anything, and she's genuinely interested in what they have to say. Looks wise she is a gorgeous petite brunette with wonderful wavy dark brown hair, and a beautiful hourglass figure that just pours into a Little Black Dress. If were to be invited to an embassy dinner, I know she'd make me look so much better than I deserve to look - she is the epitome of class, grace and elegance to me.

But I still find it hilarious when she farts, of course."

"&gt; First time, more often than not, automatic defenses fire while I'm assembling the true answer.

Had a girl ask me outright

*""____ will you go out with me?""*

First thought: ""She can't be serious, must be a joke or about something else"".  
We were talking about a mutual friend asking her out recently and I commented about how I respected people that would just ask outright (***SO*** obvious in hindsight) so I reasoned it away as being just her messing around.

By the time I'd worked it out we'd drifted apart.

Never underestimate low self esteem and anxiety. My mind immediately decides worst-case scenario so I always take the path of least possible negative repercussions.

"When I was in school there was a girl who used to pinch my ass all the time, and when we were seated next to each other in class she would try to feel up my leg. One time I was in shop class on the band saw, and she walked up and asked what I was doing while rubbing her boobs on my arm. I could have cut my damned arm off!

I was conflicted because as much as it was intensely irritating and invasive, part of me liked it and the rest of me was mad at that part. So I just used to give her the stink eye and not really know what to do. I never really told anyone.

I imagine if this was in an alternate reality where women are considerably more physically powerful than men, I would have been scared out of my fucking mind. As it was, it was just super irritating and the humiliation of nursing a semi afterwards was even worse."

"Halfway through the date, he started peppering in references to how small his penis was. I laughed at the first one thinking it was self-deprecating humor but it turned out that he had a small dick humiliation fetish and wanted me to indulge him in it.

Byeeeeeee."
"More people have touched my dick without my consent than with it, though the thing that messed with me the most was actually just a kiss. When I was a kid, must have been around 10, my mom was high, and called me into her room. She shut the door behind me, and I could tell something wasnt right. My mom told me I had to kiss her, which is normal for some families, but definitely not mine. I said no, and went to leave her room, but she just blocked the door, and kept telling me I had to kiss her. Eventually, I broke down crying, and she kept adding to a list of punishments she was going to give me if I didnt. Eventually I caved in, and it was pretty awful. When she finally let go of me, she said, ""I hope you remember this any time you want to kiss a girl"". I think the worst part is that she intentionally did the whole thing just to fuck with my head, because she has always regarded me as her golden ticket in life, and in her mind, me finding a girl is threatening to that.

What sucks is that it totally worked, and I cant even think of kissing a girl without those memories coming up and totally turning me off, and I've missed out on some good opportunities with girls because they got the impression that I wasnt into them cause I couldnt bring myself to kiss them. Oddly enough the few times that girls have taken charge and kissed me have been perfectly great."
"Was talking about the dating scene. She told me she thought it was disgusting that I would go out with a Mexican.  When she saw how horrified I was her way of backing out was saying “I’m not racist, I just don’t think we should mix bloodlines.”"

As a linux user I can confirm
"Not me, but a relevant story.

I have a close girl friend I've known for a couple years. She's awesome. And to be honest, she's insanely hot. Easy 9/10. Tall, blonde, awesome body, gorgeous face, amazing butt. A really cool personality to go with it.  I've had a secret crush on her for a while. 

One day I was bored doing some Facebook creeping, and decided to look back at her photo history. 

I went back several years. And what I found was pretty shocking. She looked totally different. Her teeth were horrible &amp; crooked. She had a terrible extremely short haircut that made her look somewhat like a boy. She was a lot heavier. Skin was awful.  Really I didn't find the girl in those pictures attractive at all. 

In those last few years, she totally changed her appearance. She dropped a bit of weight. Grew her hair out &amp; died it. She got porcelain veneers for her teeth. Changed the way she did her makeup to hide her acne. Basically...she got hot.

During that time she had a long term boyfriend. The boyfriend started dating her when she looked totally different. He stuck with her through a period when physically, she looked more like an ugly boy than an attractive woman. And in the end, he ended up with this insanely sexy girl.  I am almost positive by the end of the relationship, his physical attraction must have grown 100 fold.

I'm not saying you should be in a relationship hoping a girl can change herself like that. But I am saying that looks do change. Sometimes for the worse. But sometimes, given the right encouragement, they can  change for the better. And aside from actual changes in appearance, attraction can certainly grow as your feelings do. 

So you may be just as likely to fall into attraction with someone as you are to fall out of it.

Even though conventional wisdom is to not get involved with a girl unless you find her very physically attractive...I'm in the boat that sometimes if you're getting other things out of the relationship, sometimes it might be worth holding on to for a while, enjoying the person's emotional qualities, and seeing how the rest of it grows with it.

I was a little nonplussed but happened to have similar views. We decided to go back to my apartment to play some smash bros and as soon as we walk in he asks to take a hit from my bong. I get it for him and go to get some water to drink. He takes a massive pull and proceeds to cough all over the place. Not a small cough but huge hacking and whooping coughs that sound like his lungs have inverted in his throat. I ask him if he's okay and tell him he should drink some water. As he continues coughing up his internal organs, he has this really dazed look in his eye and doesn't answer so I ask again. He finally responds by saying that he thinks I need to call 911. I'm very skeptical that he actually needs that but I didn't think it prudent to argue so I ask if he's sure and he nods emphatically so I pull out my phone and call. I explain the situation to the dispatchers and they say someone is on there way. He decides he has to lay down so he lays across my couch as I go to let the EMTs in. They come in asking him what happened and he tells them he smoked too much and might be overdosing. I can tell they have to stop from laughing but they manage to simply say ""I really doubt that. Could you stand up please?""

""I don't think I can.""

""I'm sure if you try you will.""

He immediately stands up and doesn't even waver. They take him by the shoulder and walk him downstairs to the waiting ambulance and as they're walking out I'm trying to see if he wants me to come, (I really don't want to.) He doesn't answer and one of the EMTs says it's up to me. I tell him it's a first date and I don't think I should. He just goes ""Oh"" and shuts my door leaving me alone, finally.

The kicker is he had been boasting proudly that he just passed his examinations to become a nurse. A nurse who didn't realize you cannot physically overdose on marijuana.

Oh and two months later I got a bill from the hospital."
That’s a record scratch moment for sure. How did it get worse from there?
"When my hair was a lot longer (half down my back) I was at a rave one time and I had a few people grab my ass because I assume they thought I was a girl. At one point I took my shirt off and a bunch of people were like oh shitttt until they saw I was covered in hair, lol. When I was outside some drunk guy walked by and went ""I love you"", to which I replied ""I love you too"" in the deepest voice I could manage. Not what you're looking for but It was interesting "
"She started singing to the radio in the car. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not a singing snob, I’m not good at all. But this girl was not very good and she had the confidence of a Grammy winner and was singing so hard and loud to a song that did not need to be sung (singed, sang, songed?) like that. The song was “How to Love” by Lil Wayne. We were only like 5 minutes into our second or third date and it was very uncomfortable for me to jut sit there like 😳. That was 6 years ago and I still cringe when I think about.

I stopped talking to her shortly after that. Not because of her singing, but because she was hooking up with a good friend of mine while still trying to get with me. The singing experience was just the icing on the turd."
Would do nothing. She's an ex for a reason.
"Went on a date and 15 minutes in she's telling me how her parents own a huge medical supply company. I thought this was cool so continued to ask her about it. She tells my how her parents are no longer in love and are just staying together for the company. She then goes on saying how she's just waiting for them to die so she can take over ""her company.""

Check please!"
"Privately or publicly?

"I'm a forester. I'm either creating planting prescriptions and ecologically classifying an area that is about to be logged, or monitoring the growth of trees that are 1, 4, 8, or 10 years old.

"Oh wow. I only realized this later in life and I needed to read this. 

Listen to u/Taskerst, OP. 

It's okay to let your guard down for the right person. You'll know her when you have her. 

In the interim, don't be afraid to take risks, go outside of your comfort zone. Be confident but friendly. Never be arrogant.

Don't assume anyone knows what you're feeling. Don't assume you know anyone more than what they wish you to know.

Too many men your age are too caught up in their reputations or concerned about perceptions. Fuck that.

Be you.

Never settle.

Cheers!"
Cant tell if she is into you or she is pissed off at you. lol
"Even if the shoplifting wasn’t alarming enough, a person who commits illegal acts and then *resists arrest* when she is caught doing those acts is a nightmare waiting to happen. This is a woman who not only believes her interests are more important than everyone else’s interests, but also believes she shouldn’t be penalized for it (at the risk of even incurring jail time.) "

"Not me but a friend of mine tokd me this one the other day...

He had just slept with a girl and they were laying in bed together, she checks her phone and lets out a little giggle, so he asks her ""Whats up?"" She says in a really cutesy, this story is so funny kind of way, something along the lines of 

""Haha, Facebook just reminded me of the time that my friend and I bought these little birds, but we forgot to feed them so they died""

He made an excuse and got out of there"

"Fuck It. I'll tell a slightly different story than what others have. I was traveling in Australia. On the last weekend I was going to be in the country I got invited to a gathering of friends at a beach camp. Met a woman there and we really hit it off went for a walk on the beach that night, kissed on the sand but nothing more. At about midnight I left for the airport and flew back to America.

The lady and I had exchanged phone numbers and addresses. Now this was 1989. The was no internet. Phone calls from the US to Australia cost a dollar a minute. Letters took two weeks to go and get a reply.

For six months we wrote to each other and spoke on the phone briefly a couple of times a week. Finally I had saved up enough money to get back to Australia. I went and stayed with her and her five year old daughter. We lived together for 6 months but I was on a tourist visa. So I had to go back to America. Spent another 5 months there, sold or gave away all my gear and headed back to Australia.

That was 26 years ago. We got married so that I could stay. Against all odds we are still married. 

So long distance relationships can work. But b they certainly aren't for everyone. "
"I married her. We've been together 13 years and have 2 kids. I'm the luckiest man on earth.

When I first met her, there wasn't anything physically outstanding to her. Now she takes my breath away."
"Bull fucking shit.

I...nobody can be that dumb...right?

Right?"
"I was once with a girl I had been seeing.  Things were starting to get hot and heavy.  I hadn't shaved in a couple of days and when i rubbed my face against hers she moaned ""ooooohhhhh, you remind me of my dad.""

I had to stop."
People talked to me more than before. 
"I was born in 84. I fondly remember the days when the internet was this unexplored, amorphous, and slow loading world.

It felt like wonderland to a 10 year old me, AOL chat rooms to flame, forums to beg for mod in, and mIRC to pirate Dragonball Z episodes off of, down the rabbit hole I went.

No tutorials, tooltips, or setup wizards. I had to just stumble blindly through the labyrinth, surviving mostly on trial and error. Stuff is just so big, stable, and figured out now. For whatever reason, maybe nostalgia, it feels like it’s lost magic."
"That guys are just as nervous, shy, awkward and afraid of rejection as the girl. Sometimes more so since it’s the cultural norm for guys to approach women. Yes we all watch movies where they guy is super suave and it all works out blah blah but shit like that never happens. Dates can be awkward and not go so well."
"Be direct about it. I guess if they're really shy they might panic even if they like you, but its equally on them not to let the opportunity slip way.

Take the initiative in finding out. We all really, really wish women would take the initiative. Just be as direct and straight forward as possible. Don't fuck around dropping little hints that will just fly over his head. Just grasp the nettle and ask."
"A woman I wasn't interested in once pulled my face down to hers and kissed me in front of a crowd.  I think I just said sorry and went for a drink.  

About two weeks ago there was another woman who was pretty adamant that I stay and dance with her even though I wasn't interested.  She'd grab me and pull me in as I tried walking away, which I tried a few times.  Security for the club actually showed up to escort her out.  I tried to argue in her defense at first, then they told me she was apparently falling over people and asked if I'd be responsible for her which made me 100% fine with her getting kicked out.

The experiences were uncomfortable, but I never felt like I was in danger.  They don't give me trauma.  My main reaction to the second situation was surprise."
"Women do not typically have insatiable cravings for semen in their mouths (I dated one exception that had a fetish for it).  Some are ok with it in the moment, but many are not."

"I've been working for a local contractor for about a year as a side job. I've learned a ton about wood working, and home improvement. Even some basic plumbing. I've also gotten physically and visibly stronger. Women seem to love that I can fix almost anything around the house now.

"My aunt by marriage is this way. Worst of all, they moved in with my grandmother. Now if I call, she always picks up the phone. I ask if my nana is home, she'll say yes. Then I have to ask to speak with her before she'll actually give the phone to her. If I don't ask she'll just hold the phone, not talking or anything. Wtf. I only call to talk to nana, so just hand her the phone already. It annoys everyone in the family. My mom just stopped calling and let's nana call her. "
Also avoid talking about actual rape
"My paranoia sense is tingling.

It kinda sounds like auntie and uncle are deliberately trying to keep the rest of the family away from nana. Like they're trying to make nana think no-one else loves her so she'll give them everything in her will. Or they are currently stealing or otherwise exploiting nana and don't want anyone too close lest they might realize something's amiss."
"... ""Oh yes, I love to read."" 
Cool, whats your favorite book?""
""Umm... erg... ahhh... Horton Hears a Who!""

I'm not sure whether it was the absurd answer of the that they thought they wouldn't get called out on such (apparent?) bullshit. To be fair if they'd have just admitted to being illiterate I'd have been ok with it."
"&gt; It was like talking to a Magic 8 Ball, but less responsive.

"&gt; I imagine if this was in an alternate reality where women were considerably more physically powerful than men, I would have been scared out of my fucking mind

Yeh, this is the challenge I have with all the sexual harassment stuff at the moment.  I have to try and imagine what these things would feel like if I was afraid of women...  because women do do these things, it's just that men very rarely feel upset about them. It's clear when you talk to men, that most men have actually experienced sexual harassment quite a few times."

"oh sure, but I wasnt sure if it'd be welcome since this is asking men specifically. but since you asked, here are some others, I'll say it from the first person:

* Dont sneak up. Say my name or come at me from in front of me if you need to talk to me. Like dont wait until you're one foot behind me and go ""Hi"".
* If we rarely talk or only _ever_ talk in a work context dont randomly ask me about really personal things.
* Personally, I dont generally like being complimented on my appearance by guys I'm not also friends with out of work when it's the _only_ thing that is said. It's okay if it's like ""oh nice nice jacket, listen, this report you wrote..."" but not so much if it's like ""nice jacket"" and then you just walk away. Feels awkward to me.
* While alluded to, it wasnt explicit, so here it is. Dont touch me. Ever. (sans handshakes as part of work greetings).
* related to what TalShar said, also don't follow. It's the same as lingering, but with movement.
* Dont stare towards the door of the ladies room, seriously one of the creepiest things.
* Dont call/text me for non work related matters unless we talked about it before hand.

Thats all I got for now (as far as office related creepiness is concerned)

"Yes, hinting sucks. I don't do hints well. I've had a couple of girls tell me they likes me at school. Looking back it was obvious but fuck was I a dumbass back then. You could have rubbed your boobs in my face and I wouldn't have noticed."
"In my opinion, continuing to do new things together is really important. Like, anything; it can be big things like traveling to a new country but also small things; go to a Christmas concert, a craft festival, a free event at a museum, or to a park to watch a meteor shower.  And also be mutually committed to being _kind and polite_ to each other.  Niceness and gratitude are part of making an effort to continue to be an appealing partner.  Both people must go out of their way to be helpful and appreciative.  

Continuing to be an appealing partner also means maintaining some decorum, and taking some care of your appearance.  It's easy to become disinterested, bored or resentful if your partner doesn't even act like someone you would've been attracted to anymore (e.g. rude, unshowered, etc.).  It boils down to consciously avoiding complacency."
"Thing is, I don't actually care about dick size too much - I prefer the average-to-smaller-than-average size of the spectrum because it makes blowjobs easier and my cervix doesn't get battered - but the last thing I want is for someone I've never met before trying to get me to participate in their verbal humiliation kink while we're eating Indian food at 6pm on a Tuesday. I don't particularly want to do that *at all*, but especially not in an otherwise desexualized setting. Guh ross."
"Stop talking to them, we don’t need that kind of negativity in our lives."
"Well, sexually, you have to keep experimenting, don't be afraid to ask for new things or to do something old in a new place. If your partner is set in their ways, take a lesson from our farmers and rotate the few techniques available so they don't wear out their welcome. 

Emotionally, it's a different story. Romance isn't a constant thing. You're not going to be in romantic bliss for the rest of your life and, sadly, there isn't much you can do when the romance dies in someone else. The one lesson I learned with regards to romance, and the one I keep dear to my heart, comes from the novella 'The Pearl' wherein the main character almost never speaks to his wife because they know each other so incredibly well that they don't need to.

Now, while this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and might actually be a sign of compatibility and a strong relationship, it's in those situations that the spark of romance dies. You see, the way I see it at least, romance isn't a roaring flame - that's passion - romance is an ember that you must care to. You blow too harshly and it'll burn itself out, leaving a cold existence behind it after a moment of brightness, but if you don't blow at all it'll fizzle and die. 

Ultimately all embers fade, though. And what's most important, and should be most important, is that you had enjoyed the spark of romance while you had it. 

Or you can try cuckoldry. I heard it's all the rave with millennials these days."
"Yup. Having the weekend off is a huge plus too. I used to manage a restaurant and a retail location for a corporation I worked for and my days off were Monday and Tuesday. 

WTF does somebody do with Monday and Tuesday off other than sleep and exercise? Nobody is around. 

Plus, with a national focus on work life balance, most desk jobs let you leave early on Friday and even have a bridge full of beer for staff to say hello to the weekend with.

Desk jobs kind of kick ass."

"I had an ex that poked me in the face while cuddling. Repeatedly. After 10 minutes of this I said ""What do you want?!"" ""I'm hungry and wanted you to offer to go out."" Jesus woman how was I ever supposed to figure that out? "
"Tell yourself this: ""Boy, when I think back on this years from now I'm going to blush from how stupid I was."" 

That's your job. To be stupid. It's the basic definition of being a teenager. 

But know this: being a teenager is about learning how to be an adult. Part of that is painful and embarrassing relationships. 

Take a deep breath. You've crossed a milestone. And there are better things to come. Much better things. Some of them because of what you're going through now to help make you a better, smarter person. 

When I look back at the stupid things I did when I was a kid I now realize that if I knew what I know now I could have had a hell of a lot more fun. 

Here are the basics:

* learning how to breakup is an important skill.
* Lots of girls/boys will happily go out with you. Asking costs you nothing. 
* Teenage romances aren't for the long haul. Don't plan your futures together. Just have fun together. 
* Be safe and respectful. 
* When you're heartbroken look around for the others who are heartbroken, too. It's very common. Commiserate. Make friends. Laugh at each others tales of woe. 
* Don't plan on getting back together. It won't work. Instead, simply say to them, ""Thank you for our time together."" 

Take a deep breath. Remember that you are not yet fully formed. There is a vast future ahead. And people, even people you have never, will never meet, care about you. 

Hang in there, kid. You'll be OK. "

It's up to you, but your parents gave you that name and it's followed you all the way through your life, are you sure you want to abandon it just because you think other people don't think it's pretty? Also, names have a funny way of becoming as likeable as the people who bear them."
"Female here. I was on a first date with someone and as we were leaving a restaurant, a homeless guy approached and  the guy actually made some sarcastic remark to him while refusing to give change.

When I finally got picked up by my boss at the end of the day I asked what was up with that guy ""oh he's a fucking creeper-that's why they put him way out here"" well you coulda warned me. 
If only that was the last time an older dude with power made moves on me..."
"Ooo, I dated a girl kinda like that.  She didn't do that immediately, but after a month, when I was at her house and petting her cat.  Suddenly it was ""oh, do you want to sit in daddy's lap?"" and ""daddy likes you.""

Girl, we've been dating for less time than Shaun Spicer had a job with the current administration.  Don't use the ""daddy"" word with me yet."
"Sheesh, you got raped, and being tied down that would probably result in another charge along the lines of deprivation of liberty. Imagining myself in your situation, I probably would not have gone to the police, but thinking about it, apart from the double standard on this not being seen as serious if the roles where reversed, I would want to report her to protect myself just in case this women got pregnant and claimed it was a result of a romantic liaison with you, and you become financially obligated to her."
This guy reinstalls windows.
"It’s more fantasy than anything now really. Whenever I see a woman that looks like she’s in her late 30’s and 40’s I can’t help but to think “Man I’d love to get a phone call from her while her husband is on vacation.” Not That id ever act on it, and not like it would ever happen so I don’t have to worry about acting on it anyways. 


One day A MILF will walk into my life and find my 23 year old ass adorable

"That all men could blast ropes of cum like Peter North and I would eventually be able to when I got older. 50 now, nope hasn't happened yet. "
The only big surprise was that how fun the sex was didn't correlate too closely with how sexy she looked.
"This. It doesn't seem to cross anyone's minds that, *gasp!*, guys can be shy too."
She texted me to say she and her friends were at some club and I should join them. I had stuff to do some I only made it into town as they were all piling out. When she saw me she ran half a block toward me before leaping onto me and wrapping herself around me. I find her unbridled excitement at seeing me so sweet and endearing and it left no doubt in my mind that this girl wanted the D. It's nice to feel wanted.
I think she wants a fucking drink just like I do. Good for her. 
"I had a very similar experience in high school with a friend of my sister's.

""Will you go out with me?""

*She's messing with me. This is some kind of joke designed to embarass me. I'll just say no.*

We actually had this exchange or something like it a couple of times. I just couldn't accept that she was *really* interested in me.

I ended up tutoring her in math and even renting a room from her (completely platonic) for a while in college. By that point, she'd moved on, I'd realized how stupid I'd been when I was younger, and developed something of a crush on her. We were pretty good friends, though, so that was good. I'm happily married now, but I do regret that we've grown apart. "
"&gt;Never underestimate low self esteem and anxiety. My mind immediately decides worst-case scenario so I always take the path of least possible negative repercussions.

"I knew a girl who was super mormon. Her thing was to seduce guys to date her and use the opportunity and their attention to try to convert them to the LDS church. I nearly fell for it, and watched at least 4 other guys fall for it at first then get out, and one guy who DID fall for it, thought he was in love, joined the LDS chruch..and get dumped by her while she moved on to recruit others. It was like her mission."
"High school. A girl invited me over when her parents were not home. Smoking hot. We were supposed to ""watch a movie."" We sat real close. The movie started in the middle, which I thought was odd, but I was just happy to be there. I never made a move. I went home after about an hour, when the movie was over. I cry about this every day."
"Yeah see, I feel like I'd need clarification as to whether he's into me or not before I go and sit on his face. But thanks"
"&gt; I have 2 kids and both of their fathers are useless, i hope you turn out better

I love that it sounds like she intends to have a kid with you in order to find out if you're a more 'useful' father. Like, not have a relationship and *then* have a kid, just get knocked up first and then hope she can pussy-whip the guy into supporting her for the rest of her life."

"I had this a few weeks ago, I was so confused. He was an attractive 29 year old, so you'd have thought he'd have had enough sex to know that ain't how shit works. Tried shoving it in. I said ""No that needs lube"". So he went back to the vagina for a couple minutes before pulling out and trying again. He was SO CONFUSED when I said that having a bit of vagina juice is not sufficient and he needs REAL LUBE. Like, from a tube!

Never had anything like that before, hopefully won't again. He also seemed to think it was okay to spit in my mouth and kinda all over me...that was an extremely odd one nighter."
Apparently by being ignorant of the incredible difficulties posed by having a desk job.
"This is why I think Terry Crews's story is quite relatable - sure he could have tied that asshole into a prezel on the spot, but the guy could have ruined his career with a single phone call. There was a massive power imbalance and that's what makes it so horrible, not being able to fight them off because you don't have power, either physical strength or influence."
Dated a girl once who had zero sense of humor. The only time she tried to make me laugh was by playing it off of something funny I said. It's weird to explain but very boring personality. She would also stick her entire tongue in my mouth during a french kiss. I asked her to back off on the tongue but it didnt sink in. If you had to kiss a squid that's probably what it would feel like. I noped out of that one after a few dates.

My personal labor-of-love project is on the night shift; my day-in-the-life starts in late morning when I wake up, play games, have lunch, basically what people do when they get home from work, but then when the NBA games start, I'm livetweeting, watching League Pass, and finishing my day by putting my morning column into Wordpress, where it runs automatically at 4 AM while (most nights, not today apparently) I sleep."
"Yeah, bby, give me a call."
"Great point, although I do feel this applies to men as well as women"

"The first time my French ex took me to visit her parents (it was a spur-of-the-moment thing, we were driving through France and she figured we'd stop by and see them). While I was taking stuff out of the car, her dad apparently looked at me and asked her in French ""I see you're picking up strays now?"". She had mentioned that he was definitely an ""old fashioned"" person, but she had *hoped* he wouldn't be racist.  Apparently, the lines he had in mind were pretty clear. 

She was so mad that all I remember was just a very angry back-and-forth in rapid-fire French between the two of them, allusions to me by both of them and then, positively red with fury, she told me to put the stuff back in the car and that we'd be staying at a hotel in town. 

It became a big thing, her mother had to come to smooth things over and it definitely strained her already fragile relationship with her dad (who didn't make an appearance because apparently he had an ego the size of a planet and one of his bigger failings according to my ex was never apologizing), but yeah. I did ask what the conversation was about, in an effort to understand what his objections were, but she didn't want to talk about it and the most she said was that he was a garbage person and I was better off not knowing (pretty strong statement for someone to make about their dad). At least I'm proud of her having stood up for me, despite not knowing a lick of French at the time."
Had a girl answer her ex's call not ten minutes after we were done having sex and set up a time for them to meet (and in all likelihood fuck). So I left an upper decker and walked outta that place with my head high
I dated (lol it was 1 fucking date) a music teacher who could ***SING***. Like that opera/classical style shit.

"Oh wow. I read your comment as her saying she's been cheated on and thought it was pretty harsh to say that reflected poorly on her. I didn't realize she was telling you she was a habitual cheater! 

Good thing you didn't overlook that. "
I feel bad that she got treated that way but ultimately she is an adult and is capable of handling problems herself. If she wants me to help out I'll be more than willing though.
"30, why are we here? just to suffer?"
"I didn't. The best damn first kiss I ever had, she saw me working up the courage and just straight-up planted one on me. Held that kiss for oh, three minutes easy (it might've been three seconds. It felt like a lifetime.)

She said ""I saw you thinking about it, you can kiss me if you want to, y'know.""

"My sons and I speak very openly about damn near everything. My youngest had a rough patch with getting up to speed as a gay man. He buried himself in school and achieved his goal to become a physican in one discapline. He stuck to it a while then went back and began practice in another area. He realised he was missing out on life so he began to date online. He told me all about a wonderful guy he had been speaking to and that he was going into New York City for dinner, drinks and a show with him.
I was really happy for him and wish him well. Next day I get a call from my son, he sounded like he wanted to explode with laughter. They met in Grand Central and in 2 minutes the guy texted his about 20 pictures of guys cocks, all the guts were seated on toilets. My son asked him what was this about and the explanation was basically he meets guys and they go to public restrooms where the date stands in a Macys bag and blows guys sitting on the pot. He then clearly stated he didnt mind if you dropped a deuce, he was blumpkin friendly. My son excused himself as he wasnt looking for hookups but a meaningful relationship, this young man began to holler ""if I aint getting nut you best drop nuggets or buy me a big mac"". My son double timed across the main hall with this nicely dressed young man screaming ""NUT, NUGGET OR A BIG MAC MUTHER FUCKER YOU OWE ME"". He chucked a twenty at him and sprinted for a cab. Its one of our many family jokes now 
"" Nut, Nugget or a Big Mac, Muther Fucker"" 

P.S. he met a great guy doing Drs. without boarders in the Dominican Republic and they have a beautiful daughter who is the light of my life as a Grandpa. ""Nut, Nugget or a Big Mac Muther Fucker"" was on the grooms cake."
"Met a girl in Japan while I was over there, we hit it off and decided to try long distance. We'd spend a few months at each other's places each year. 

She got a chance to come work in America, said she was doing it to be closer to me but picked a place significantly further than the closest one, she got wrapped up in friends and I got fed up with not being a priority (she didn't even come to visit me the year she was in the US). One night she told me her and her friends were staying over some guy's beach house and that was the breaking point. 

4 years of loneliness ended there. I'll never ever try long distance again. We don't get to turn time back and to lose 20-24 like that is among my biggest regrets. The relationship did help me grow as a person so it wasn't a complete waste but, yea I'm good."

"Girlfriend tells me she's going back home to Japan for Christmas and invites me along. We've been dating for 6 months at this point her living with me for the last 3. She knows I'm not marrying type and everything but it's the longest relationship either of us have had in a long while (I think longest ever for her) and I'm happy to go along. 

Meeting her family is a bit weird. Her family are polite but ridiculously formal and quiet around me and of course they don't speak any English and I don't speak any Japanese.

She's also really strange around them. Completely different personality. Especially in the presence of her Dad. We finally go to sleep that night at our hotel (I insisted we stay at a hotel because things were so fucking weird) and she suddenly unloads on me about how her Dad and her uncle sexually abused her for fucking years and when she told her mom she slut shamed her into silence and just let it keep happening.

I'm totally livid. Like WTF? She begs me not to make a big deal about it so I finally promise not to.

I have to have a few more meals with this insane family and can't help visualizing myself shoving my fucking chopsticks into her smug Dad's eye every time I look at him and he gives me his best ""I'm looking through you stare"".

Finally she takes pity on herself and we spend the rest of the time traveling around other parts of Japan having a much better time.

This Christmas we're renting a house on the beach in Kauai."

Old drunk lady at the bar pulling her tits out"" ""ew girl... no""  Then we laugh about it later.  It's only ""traumatic"" if you make it that way.  I think it is not as big a deal for us as we are expected to be able to defend ourselves.  Even if a man does these things there isn't a real ""threat"" to us (prison stories not included).  For women though there is an implied threat, that ""perpetrator"" could more than likely over power her whether physically or metaphorically (Weinstein-esque) and men just do not face the same threat level.

 this was maybe 15 years ago, for societal context.

i was the doorman at a bar where a chick grabbed my ass while i was turned around counting money or something.  i was in an exclusive relationship at the time, but that doesn't really change things and of course she didn't know that.

i turned around and brusquely told her that wasn't hers.  i wish i'd been a little more gentle in my tone, actually.  she was just out having fun with her friends.  she looked chagrined and said that i was right, and she was sorry.  "
"If it's not reciprocated with enthusiasm, you're doing it wrong.  Flirting is a dance done by two people with a mutual goal in mind.  Sexual harassment is a fight, with one person trying to take something from the other.

Not sure the difference? Ask yourself a few questions:

* Are you putting the other person down (even subtly) to get what you want?  
* Is this a ""I want to get to know them"" thing, or is that just a rationalization for horniness?
* If you watched someone else do this, would you classify that person as ""thirsty""?
* Are you objectifying them?  I know that gets complex here, but are you actually looking out for their well-being and do you respect them/their decisions?
* Are you respecting their physical space, bodily autonomy, and decisions?
* Is this actually something they consent to?
* **What will you do if they say no, or you otherwise don't get your way?**  
* Is the attention *actually* reciprocated?  Can you tell the difference?"

Sometimes a gal that doesn't seem to give a shit what you have to say in a group conversation will suddenly turn to me and have tons of questions and time of day for me when it comes out that I'm in the middle of a successful career with plenty of room for growth.

"I started dating a bit later in life but I think this advice applies regardless what age you start dating. The first couple relationships are more practices of self discovery than finding a life partner. You have all the notions of what a relationship is and isn't and you discover, you have no idea who you are and what you actually want in a relationship. When you look back in your first relationships, you realize you put way more blame on the other person than you do yourself. 

I think this is why all those, my crazy ex trope, exist. I have heard millions of stories of crazy exes but very little moments of self reflection. I'm not saying my exes were perfect, but I know I was far from it as well. 

So I guess my advice would be that in relationships, we are all battling our own conception of what the ideal partner is. As you keep dating you start to realize what you want in life and what you need as a partner. Just because you break up doesn't mean anyone was at fault, it just means you both discovered what you needed and each other isn't it.

I think it's important to understand who you are, what you can change about yourself and what you know you can't. Their will always be fights in any healthy relationship, their will be compromise, their will be change in both parties. The better you understand yourself, the better you can communicate that, the easier you will navigate through these relationships. 

One more piece of advice, be careful with expectations and try to live in the moment. Don't worry about if she is the one or not, focus on the moments you do spend with her. Are you happy? than spend more time with her. "
"Not me but my best friend with his wife: When he *informs* her that he wants to hang out with me and the guys without her it's *selfish*, when she *tells* him that she's gonna hang with her posse without him it's *maintaining a healthy distance in their marriage*"

"The girl I'm lucky enough to be dating now...she just avoided all the pitfalls of being a modern person, like:

- instead of being a boring, sad piece of netflix fodder, she had passions, and interests, and could talk about really cool stuff (which happened to be my hobbies as well), from video games to movies to music.  She was furiously independent, and the only girl I knew of at the time who lived alone and fully supported herself with a career.

- I met her on FB - she's incredibly fucking gorgeous, but wasn't a ""facebook celebrity"" and didn't chase attention from internet strangers, which is a major issue in my social circle and personal pet peeve.  

- In public, we are affectionate but not grossly so - just clearly super in love with each other, and in bed we are total fucking freaks

- She gets along with my friends like bread and butter - my dude friends gel with her well, she isn't petty with my female friends

- I think probably due to her self affirmation from the first point, she isn't constantly making me jealous, or has ever played a single game to ""prove"" my loyalty, or to get her way, or any of that shit.

TBH, we've been dating for a year and I'm at the point where I'm almost suspicious that she can be so great of a person, and that she likes *me* out of all the humans she could get out there.  Now that I had this kind of thing, I can never go back.  It's like I've never been in a relationship before until now.  I just hope I don't blow it and that she's everything she seems to be."

"And what's the common denominator there? I believe it's you, my friend. C'mon, if women didn't enjoy sex then lesbians would be celibate, surely.

I think you need to communicate with your partner(s) more to ensure that you're helping them have a good time. Not saying it's entirely your fault that communication doesn't seem to happen but women are definitely capable of enjoying sex"
That was a rollercoaster ride from start to finish. Damn
"Back tickles, I lay on my stomach with my shirt off and she runs her fingers over my back very lightly.  I get goosebumps every single time.  After about ten minutes I get sleepy and I then sleep like a baby.  Usually right as I'm drifting off I'll feel the blanket being slid over me and her climbing in bed next to me.  If I ever become single again I would legit hire someone just to tickle my back."

"Those things have happened to me.  I've had my ass patted by a female boss, and when I was 12 years old or so, I was grabbed and kissed by some older girls.  I've had various experiences like this over the years.  I don't really feel traumatised by any of them though.  The one when I was 12 was probably a tiny bit traumatising at the time because I had no idea what was happening.  But I'd forgotten about it after a day or so so I don't really care."
... Did you fuck Amy Schumer or something?
"Goes both ways, though.  It's pretty tough to expect someone to ask again after they just got rejected, unless they're one of those creepers who can't take no for an answer.  So if you find yourself wishing someone would ask you again after you fumbled the first one, you may have to suck it up and take the initiative.  Lead with ""I was wrong"" and then express your interest in them in simple genuine terms.  Apologizing for the automatic defenses is a good move too.

MySpace was way fucking cooler than Facebook.
"Yesss this! I dated a guy in his thirties where I was his first significant relationship and he did this. It put sooo much pressure on me and on the relationship, it made it really difficult and suffocating. It meant it was all about his built up ideas of what it would be and not about us at all.

I appreciate that it's impossible not to have some expectations and hopes but please keep them grounded in reality if you can at all, and pay attention to how things really are right now instead of hanging all your hopes on where it might go.

Other common mistake along these lines is getting way too serious way too quickly. Imagine you're going swimming in the ocean with your partner. It's fun, it's lovely to do together, and you've both got the same goal. But if you keep running ahead and diving under the waves while they're still just dipping a toe in the water, that's not actually going swimming together. Take it easy, you won't always be at the same depth at the same time but try to keep within reach of each other."

Don't assume that every piece of criticism leveled at you is because you're a woman.  
"While it helps that they're sexy, love can make any woman beautiful."

"When I said I would shave my beard because I was getting tired of it.
She did a huge deal of it, saying I would look ugly and ""10 years younger"" and how no beard wouldnt fit me and blablabla. Okay.
A month after, she said she wanted to cut her hair short because she was tired of having to wash it and it was too hot blablabla. I said to her that she looked prettier with long hair and- ""WHAT, ARE YOU TRYING TO CONTROL ME? ITS MY DECISION! IM GONNA DO IT"". And so did she. And I shaved all my beard."
I wasn't thinking anything.  I was staring into space.  Stop asking.
"Right, but from his perspective he may be in the same spot.  You could reverse the genders in your situation and you'd have the same situation.

"I know you're asking men but i (woman) thought I'd give you an awesome quote I read the other day...

Confidence is not ""they will like me"". Confidence is ""I'll be fine if they don't"".

I know if someone thought for example I was stupid or whatever the reason may be...I wouldn't care because I know they'd be wrong. 

Confidence....you have to work on what's in your heart and mind. No one else is gonna give it to you."

"&gt; There was a massive power imbalance and that's what makes it so horrible, not being able to fight them off because you don't have power, either physical strength or influence.

Yes, it's the power that makes all the difference, for sure.

"Not your fault, bro.  Hers.  She's the one who decided to blame all black people for the actions of, at the most, three people.

Three.

That's on her.  Not you or your race.  And it's why I stopped seeing her, because she couldn't look past that."
Yea 00-06 for sure.  ‘96-2000 hit me hard too. 
"Date her.  Just freaking date her.  You know those things you used to do when you got started?  Do them again.  For me, that means going dancing together at the club, doing projects together, and similar.  To you, that'll mean something else entirely.  But do whatever that is."
"Date them. When it’s over, they’ll never want to talk to you again. HS girls can be petty. Use it to your advantage. Problem solved. "

"**Only after writing this did I️ realize how long this post got, but I think it gets the point across. Sorry for the long-winded story.**

**TL;DR- Be thankful for what you have.**

I worked a lot of shitty jobs before it. From fast food, service industry stuff, to really hard manual labor (landscaping, literally scooping out old rocks around the house and putting new ones in, working on the farm, planting fence posts, etc). Real back breaking work. 

Every time I sit down and think, “God, this sucks.” I remember back to when I was first going to college. My dad sat me down the night before when we had a campfire. It was just him and I sitting beneath the stars at my place. It was so gorgeous. You could see the entire Milkyway Galaxy from my backyard. It’s one of the things I miss most. 

He and I were sitting next to the fire, just relaxing and taking in nature. My dad is an ol’ farm boy, blue collar worker. He’s worked the backbreaking jobs before. His job for a majority of my childhood was working with cattle (installing machinery that would milk them, feed them, clean out the manure, etc. he would usually have to be about waste deep in the manure as well when they were first installing it). 

It was nice to see my dad relax for a bit. His back, at 50, was constantly getting thrown out. His knees always hurt. Neck cramps. Arthritis in his hands. But for a moment we got to just spend time with each other. After about 10 or 20 minutes, he looked over to me and said, “Son, I am so proud of you.” (I’m the first man in my family to go to college). 

“You have worked so hard and been so involved in school. You did better than I ever could. You’re smart, the people in town know you and love you, you’ve developed into a great young man. I’m so proud that the man you turned out to be is my son.” 

He paused for a minute and looked up, “You’ve got it great. If you really study and really do well, you can do whatever you want, I just know it. But for the love of God, Swingingsalmon, don’t do what I had to do for jobs. Your body will get wrecked. I don’t sleep for more than a few hours at a time. I have aches and pains all over, but I did it for you and your sister. It was worth it. You know that I love you guys and would give the world for you. Just make sure that this [college] is worth it. Get a good job. Don’t work like I had to.”

That has stuck with me for so many years. I can still remember it so vividly. Every time that I think about how hard work is, I sit back and realize that I’m not digging ditches. I’m not waist high in manure. I’m not shoveling rocks day and night. Sitting at a desk is easy work. I am able to have a great opportunity with the place I’m at now. 

Throughout my life I learned to be thankful for what I have, because you know what? A lot of people would kill for what we have. When it comes to the weight of the world and what other people have to go through, working a desk job isn’t that damn bad. They’re paying you in one paycheck well beyond what some people see in a year. You have a roof over your head and food on your plate thanks to your desk job. 

Perspective and thankfulness for the fortune you have to be at that desk job will take you far. "
"I think men are more pragmatic about the roller coaster nature of marriage. We joke about nagging wives, ""I have a headache"" nights, burnt dinners, and sitting in a chair at the mall holding her purse while she shops. We hear these jokes and gripes for our entire childhoods and we still pull the trigger and bend the knee because... Well hell it beats dying alone.

A lot of women seem to have a fairytale idea of ""Happily ever after"". Even the more realistic women seem to desperately avoid the idea that there will be moments where your marriage just plain sucks for a while, and theres nothing you can do except try to tough it out together. 

TLDR; I ish women didn't buy into the commercial hallmark/Debeers/Disney marriage marketing so much.

"- Don't poop in front of each other. Esther Perel (who wrote *Mating in Captivity*) says that for most people, intimacy/comfort and romance are somewhat antagonistic. You need to do things to preserve some mystery and distance and resist the urge to just become utterly unconcerned about the other person's opinion of you.

- Keep seeing yourself as a work in progress. You don't have to be sweatpants-level comfortable to feel secure in a relationship. You should *want* to be better for your partner.

- My wife and I do two dates a month. One date has to be a new thing of some kind---new restaurant, new movie, new place, new trail, new activity, whatever---and the other one can be new or old. Responsibility for planning the new date switches off every month between us. It doesn't have to be super elaborate; it can be as simple as ""let's drive to this part of the city and just drive around and try to find cool stuff for a couple hours"". 

This has worked for us so far. We've been together for almost five years and married for a bit over one. Don't know if that's long term enough. "

She let it slip that she thinks black people are sub-human. I paid for my meal and left.
"Not my current job. It's OK. My job previous to my last.

I worked in house as the IT with my manager. I genuinely liked all the 120 people I worked with. Some could be tough to deal with but once you learned how to handle them I got to like them. People I sat with were genuinely fun people who I had a laugh with. I really liked working there, I miss it."
"&gt;Dont sneak up. Say my name or come at me from in front of me if you need to talk to me. Like dont wait until you're one foot behind me and go ""Hi"".

"Last year of University, I was doing a drinking game with a group where a bottle was spun twice. The first person it landed on had to spin it the second time until it landed on someone of the opposite sex. They then had to say whether they would like to kiss the person it landed on or not.

It landed on me first. I then spun it and it landed on the girl I was closest to. I then said my answer was 'Yes', I would kiss them.

They then had the bottle land on them, and by chance spun it and their spin landed on me. She then answered 'Yes' as well, when people in the room went 'oooooo'. She then left to go into the kitchen with one of her friends.

I then decided I was hungry, so left the front room to go into the kitchen too. The two of them were in there whispering when I appeared. Her friend left, saying 'I'll leave now' while smiling at her. So it was just me, and the girl I said I'd kiss in the room.

I then walk over and grab an apple, and turn to her. She then walked up really close to me and stroked my cheek while smiling. She then reached both of her arms around my waist and I did it too as a cuddle. We then pulled apart with our arms still around each other.

She was staring at my lips, while I looked at her, and she said that I had very nice lips while smiling. I then thanked her and told her that she had very nice lips too, because she did.
After about 5 seconds of silence while looking at each other's lips...

While we were embraced...

Our noses were no more than 10 cm apart...

I pulled one arm back from behind her back...

And took a huge bite out of the crunchy apple right in her face and said, 'Ah, that's a juicy apple.', then left the kitchen.

"I genuinely have never understood why ""person of color"" is supposed to be acceptable despite the fact that switching the words around makes it a slur."
"When I do household chores and she does nothing, it’s just radio silence. She doesn’t care and sees it as “progressive”, “fighting gender roles”, etc.

The rare occasion where I’m the one laying around and she’s doing stuff, all of a sudden it becomes about how I expect her to do everything because she’s a woman.

Her taking a gender studies class is honestly the worst thing to happen to our relationship. I can put up with it for now. "

"At the end of the date we ended up back at her place... Things were getting hot and heavy, clothes are flying off, I look around the bedroom and I notice like 6 picture frames are face down.
