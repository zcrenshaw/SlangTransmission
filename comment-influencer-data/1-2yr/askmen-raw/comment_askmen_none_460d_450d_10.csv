"It's difficult to be around other human beings and not develop some type of feelings. I've been with my SO for over 20 years now. I've never strayed and have never had the desire to actually do so.

But that doesn't mean you stop meeting people. You meet an attractive person who you would have considered pursuing if you were single and that spark doesn't just go away. You just learn to tuck it away and say ""that's just not the path I chose to take."" I care about my partner and the bond we have far more than I care about a potentially brief fun fling with anyone else. It feels...wrong.

I can't imagine actually cheating on someone. It honestly staggers me how common it is. People who cheat...I'm not going to say they disgust me, but I just don't understand. If you're unhappy in a relationship, break it off. Don't make life worse for three+ people, with yourself being one of them."

"Women say something to the effect of: they don't want to be harassed in the street, they don't want to be hit on at work, they don't want to be hit on when going to school, anywhere else, etc. etc. etc.

I asked him if Marsellus Wallace looks like a bitch
"I think for me it's admission and then a lack of confidence around girls I like. I can attract girls who are just my friends who I only feel platonic for, because with them I'm carefree and joke around. However with girls I like, I convince myself they hate me and I act strange. Due to this though, it's quite funny, anyone I have a crush on immediately knows. Lol rip me."
He will remember that for the rest of his life.   He might forgive but he'll never forget.
Not so much called but my current girlfriend laughed uncontrollably when she first saw my little curly fry.

"I've elected to age gracefully. It's something that is within your control for the most part. I stay in shape, take care of my skin, eat well, and I don't try to dress like I'm still in my 20's. 

There's nothing to be gained in running from your age. The energy of youth is amazing, but christ we are dumb as fuck when we're young. I have my shit together in ways that would have made my head hurt when I was in my early 20's. I wouldn't trade the experience or insight I've gained for anything. 

I had the experience of being young. I'm grateful for it. But I'm on to some other shit now. I'm a different person than I was. Truth be told, I like old me better."

"That's it. Women responses to men in person are most of the time ""no thanks, i have a boyfriend"" or ""not interested"" and in some such cases they are demeaning or outright abusive, not all men have the confidence to deal with such rejection. Dating apps remove that risk. "
"I think this is the most well rounded answer.  Just going to elaborate in case OP is ~~a woman~~ someone who likes to play with penises, and might not fully understand *how* they're different.

Background:  I can't speak for all men, but in my experience, when I'm having sex, what gets me to the brink is a combination of four things:  (1) warmth; (2) wetness; (3) the ""velvet glove"" feeling, which is dictated by wetness and the texture of a woman's vagina; and (4) depth of penetration.

When you masturbate without lube/lotion/spit/whatever liquid, you're definitely not getting the wetness or the velvet glove.  And while your hands might not be *cold*, they just don't transmit the same kind of enveloping warmth that a vagina does.  Thus, without any form of lubrication, all you're really getting is the depth of penetration feeling.  The point where your grip is the tightest basically simulates the point where a woman's vagina would be gripping your shaft if you were having sex, kinda like sliding a ring up and down your finger.  (But note:  You usually don't change the point of *skin* that you're gripping.  Instead, you're basically scrunching the skin upward and then back down, so the only thing changing is where you feel your grip on the *underlying tissue*.  This technique is used because the head of the penis is sensitive, and the amount friction created between a dry head and a dry hand can actually be painful.)

The lube experience is different.  Obviously, you have wetness.  Warmth is generated by the friction that the lube allows.  In this scenario, your hand can just glide over the head instead of sorta pulling at it. 
 Nothing can *truly* match the velvet glove feeling of a vagina, but using lube definitely gets you closer to it.  And finally, depth of penetration is largely the same as you'd have in the non-lube scenario.

""Ok, but if you're getting all four factors with lube, and only one factor without it, why don't you just use lube every time?""  Simple answer:  it's messy.  As a corollary to the messiness, lube also creates a masturbation session that's difficult to stop and/or give up on in the face of unexpected interruptions (e.g., someone ringing the door bell, your dog tearing stuff up in the other room, etc.).

Hope that helps.

Edit:  Clarifying the friction aspect.  I also changed an accidental ""you're"" to ""your,"" knowing that the grammar police are always present.

Edit 2:  Just realized it's irrelevant whether someone reading this comment is female.  Gay and bisexual men -- hell, even straight men, apparently -- might also get something out of it, and thus it seemed a little insensitive to leave them out."

"Gotta mention this one: About 15 years ago I had a good friend who went dateless for nearly a year and was getting creepier and more desperate by the day. It was at the point where the rest of our circle didn't even want to take him out with us anymore because he was seriously making us all look bad, but none of us wanted to say anything because we didn't want to ""offend him"".

Finally, another of our friends pulled the poor guy aside and had a long discussion about the rapist vibes he was giving off, and how he was his own worst enemy when it came to finding a date. He WAS a bit offended, but it worked. 

Two months later, he was at a bar with us when he met the woman he later married. He's only married today, and his children exist, because one of his friends (not me, to my embarrassment) had the cajones to pull him aside and tell him to chill the f* out. That's what friends do."
"""You could make love to a cheerio and it wouldn't break."""

Women in bars etc may just be there for a drink with a friend and will be uncomfortable if approached. Women on dating apps are definitely there to get dates. Rocket surgery this is not.

I also never noticed I was a morning person and my anxiety plummeted.

Hard work doesn't guarantee success. Most people work hard all their life and will never rise above the means they were born into.

If I see a very attractive lady in public I generally assume she's not single.
Why won't women approach some men?
I'm gay
"Since we're revving up uncomfortable truths about dating, let's go the whole way and drop some fucking bombs.

**Height** absolutely matters - though it's more nuanced than people think. While the taller the better, in general 5'10'' is the minimum necessary height to be considered in the ""safe zone"". [CoffeeMeetsBagel did a study on this showing if you were 5'10'' and up, pretty much every woman was okay with it.](https://coffeemeetsbagel.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/8-women-liking-men1.png) But heaven help you if you're shorter than her - her attraction falls off a cliff. 5'6'' and below, you're basically bumfucked in the world of dating (esp. online dating).

**Race** absolutely matters. OKCupid did a landmark study ~4 years ago showing Asian and Indian men received the lowest replies consistently. Tinder also [did a study with similar results; women almost exclusively swiped right on white guys and left asian/black men in the dust](https://i.imgur.com/sqi8wlO.png).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**edit:** getting a lotta responses from the ""I'm 6'0'' and white and I can't get a date! CHECKMATE!"" crowd. Listen. I'm not saying these traits give you instant access to government-mandated pussy. I'm saying it just makes it a ton easier to get girls. If you still manage to screw up, that's on you. Similar to how being rich makes it easier to stay financially solvent, but it's still possible for a rich guy to go into major debt if he absolutely squanders all of his resources."

"When I was 13 I had a problem with inopportune boners around girls...and one of them said ""you keep that disgusting _thing_ away from me.""

Then there was the girl who, after an extended sex session where I was truly fucked out, grabbed my dick, let it limply flop back down as I was lying on my back, and said ""NIEDERMAYER! Dead."" Her pet name for my dick stuck with it for the rest of our relationship."
"...poorly.

Funny enough she was a total starfish so I still have no idea what she meant."
"This is very subjective, if we're talking purely about looks here - trashy behaviour is another bucket of monkeys. I can only speak for myself here, but to me it's when there's just a bit too much sexual signalling going on. Low cut top or a short skirt is sexy, but both can look trashy. Smokey eyes or bold lips are sexy, but again both can be trashy. Not always, I don't do a mental checklist in my head, but in general, there's definitely a line where there's a bit too much effort being made to look fuckable and it becomes trashy. The irony of course is that most of the time they're probably not even trying to look fuckable to men, they're competing with their friends or it's just how they feel comfortable dressing.

I guess there's an element of ""less is more"" going on here, but there's definitely also point where restrained sexiness becomes plainness. 

EDIT: All this goes out of the window in the bedroom. By all means, my SO can sexualise that crap out of herself as much as she likes and it will do nothing but delight me."
Did she think you were joking and you had an extra dick hidden somewhere that was bigger?

"I had a girl outright say it was small, and by all the research I've done im actually above average.

Its then i was convinced women who are assholes (not all women) who want to piss off a guy or just be a jerk will call a guy short or make fun of his member.

Im 5'9 and ive also been called short by women who were 5'4"
Look at the men in your family with beards. 
"I’m a girl but I get this completely. I’m very shy around people I like. But I’m 100% confident, bubbly and can be myself around guys I don’t. Which makes them think I like them when I don’t. It’s a struggle alright "

"YOU CALLED A BROTHAS DICK A CURLY FRY

FUUUUUUCK, I’m dieing. It sucks because you said this while he is vulnerable which elevates the effect of what you say. Essentially, don’t bring it up. And show that you love it until he eventually forgets.

Which is going to be hard since you called it a curly fry.

Personally, if a girl said that to me I could care less. Because if I’m having sex I like the girl. Personally actions mean more then words but not all guys have that view. 

OH MY GOD SAY YOU LOVE HIS BIG CURLY FRY. It’s so stupid cheesy."

"This is actual science. There was a study that a TV show recreated successfully where women were asked to smell shirts of guys who did no work, wore cologne, or sweated and were asked to guess who they thought the most attractive guy was based on the smell of his shirt and all the women picked the sweaty shirt (which was worn by the least attractive guy, but they weren't shown the guys until afterwards).

The fact that situations where approaching would be appropriate seems to be rare nowadays doesn't help.

EDIT: ""If you're approaching women like a sane man that's not going to happen""

I've been accused of being a creep simply by having a normal conversation  with a woman while having no romantic interest in her at all. I've been accused of being a stalker for trying to get to know another woman as a person. These days, even approaching as a ""sane man"" can still get you slapped with the creep label."

"I'm female and I absolutely agree with you. It's so liberating to accept the fact that you ***are*** going to meet people you could have ""potentially had something with"" in your life. I can usually tell who those people are fairly early on into our acquaintanceship/friendship. I don't believe in soulmates, there are way too many beautiful people on this planet for you to only be compatible with one. 

Having said that, it's all about your commitment and choice to stick with one person until the bitter end. Whenever I start feeling some sort of attraction/crush toward someone else, I fully welcome that feeling and act with caution accordingly, whether it is limiting my time with them, or keeping the relationship only professional etc, and know that I have a loving and wonderful SO who I would never want to hurt."

"In 18 years, I've had 4 crushes I can think of.  I never felt guilty about my feelings, but then I never did anything about them either.  The first one got kinda serious, in the level of feeling.  For reasons too complicated for here, I told my wife about that one a couple of years after it had already died on the vine.  Also for complex reasons, not only did it not drive us apart, it brought us together.  

The three since then never got that far, because as soon as I was aware that I was developing a crush, I told my wife about it.  I have a saying, ""foul things grow in the dark and wither in the sunlight.""  Shining the light on them stopped them from growing into malignancies which could threaten my happiness or my wife's happiness.  I could even allow myself to really enjoy the company of these women, and enjoy my feelings of affection and attraction for them - without worrying that it would turn into a temptation.  At the same time, I love my wife even more for the trust and respect I feel from her, that she can hear about these little crushes and not feel threatened.  I would say we feel more emotionally intimate because we both feel like, if we can be honest about this sensitive topic, there really isn't anything in the world we would feel we needed to hide from each other.  And I guess that level of intimacy makes us both feel safer and more secure that nobody could lure us away from what we've got."

"I’m married, so I’m not in this situation myself, but I’ll give you my read on popular culture. 

Men have been sensitized as a gender that the way we have treated women in the past leaves a lot to be desired. This is largely an overwhelmingly good thing. 

However, what this means is that men who have been properly socialized in this modern era no longer assume that an attractive woman wants to be approached in public apropos of nothing.

Men take risks when approaching women. It used to be that we risked nothing but the sting of rejection. Nowadays, even though that by and large is still true, the current cultural context of #MeToo is causing a lot of men to reevaluate the discomfort that a cold approach could make a woman feel as well as the risk of being perceived as a creepy harasser. Ironically, this environment is going to tend to weed out all but the creepiest of harassers. The less arrogant and confident are going to hesitate. 

However, dating apps provide a safe venue to approach women because the assumption is that women using dating apps are open to being approached. And women get harassed there too. But at least it’s not face to face and they have some ability to limit contact. "

And I think that Simpson's episode where Homer meets a smoking hot female version of himself is a really good example of the type of challenge a relationship could face and ultimately what a relationship is about. Relationships aren't about finding that one person that is perfect for you. It's about finding someone who works well with you and who is willing to sacrifice as much for you as you are for them (or maybe just an appropriate balance that works out well). The value of a relationship is what you put into it and while there might be girls out there who are hotter or maybe even compatible to you in ways that are very tempting there is no way to know what they're willing to sacrifice for you and to risk something that you DO know is a great thing is something only someone dumber than Homer Simpson would do.

In both situations, there is absolutely nothing wrong with your sex organs, but it still makes you feel vulnerable to the thought.  "
"&gt;Okay, I’ve heard the whole “it’s because you’re too pretty! It’s intimidating!” bit before, but is that even a real thing?

Yes. Some guys have varying degrees of social anxiety. You also don't have a banner draped across your chest that says ""I'm single."" So no one wants to approach you for fear of being a creep, which is what every guy is when they get turned down. When they hit it off, they're Casanova. If they get rejected they're just some creep.

Apps and sites are less personal and have the implication that you're there to find a guy."

"You're spot on, I just want to point out that you have to approach this the right way else the person will get defensive and will be too busy defending themself from the creep label to actually hear, understand, and internalize the advice. 

Specific examples are the key as you point out, they keep it from being a conversation centered around ""you're a creep,"" and more around ""this is creepy behavior, I know you don't want to come across this way, and you are capable of better."" 


Not sure how much it will help in this scenario specifically but IMO creepy behavior is usually related to a problematic way of thinking about relationships. If you're out looking for an SO actively and intentionally, every attractive person you meet is going to trigger ""are they *the one*????"" type thoughts and inhibit your ability to actually get to know them as an individual and make a real connection. You try too hard to force things too fast, and it comes across as desperate and disingenuous. 


The best advice for this is to quit thinking of every member of the gender you're attracted to as a potential mate and start thinking of them as a potential friend with an open mind towards more, *not* an expectation towards that more. If the behavior is something you'd feel uncomfortable doing towards a platonic friend you don't know well it's definitely not something to start out the gate doing as you get to know someone. 


TL;DR: Be gentle if possible, but honesty is more important. Tell your friend to quit obsessing over possible outcomes and be present in the actual reality of the moment, instead of living in the fantasy land of possibility. "

"Yes she had one big one.  Actually that was the ""complicated"" part.  I sensed that she was spending too much time with this one coworker after work, she talked about him more and more and then *stopped* talking about him... then one time she went out shopping for something with him, and they were out way later than she said she would be home.  So I confronted her about it, a bit angry at first, but when she denied it I realized ""wait, this is a hard thing to admit to, especially if you haven't *done* anything and you're in denial...""

Because I had been there.  So that was when I told her about my thing, the first one, that was long over with at that point.  I rolled the dice and bet that if I told her about it, it would make her feel safe to own up to what was going on with this coworker.  It worked, she did, and we had a long talk through the night about it.  We both agreed that having a crush needs to be OK, because it's going to happen and we can't have our relationship threatened by something as hard to control as the weather.  You might people you like, there's a spark...the only way to prevent it is to lock yourselves away from the world.

"Not necessarily a story of victory but a story I'll always remember about my dad's friend..

Years ago my father's friend Chuck was getting a large amount of squirrels in his yard and on/near his house. At one point he started catching them and releasing them beyond his property. After a while he questioned if the squirrels he was catching were the same visitors or new ones so he started spraying a quick dash of orange spray paint on their tails.

Now Chuck was a fire chief and was sharing his stories with his fellow firemen. Every once in a while they would catch a squirrel and spray paint his tail orange and toss it over the fence into Chuck's yard. Over time this drove him nuts so he started driving further away and now past the highway to leave the squirrels he caught thinking there's no way the squirrels could cross the highway and make their way back to his yard.

So one week the firemen caught a bunch of squirrels, spray painted their tails and dumped them into chuck's back yard. He lost his mind and felt thoroughly defeated until he went to work to tell his coworkers the news and they broke it to him they'd been messing with him for weeks. "

"I prefer ""The grass is greener where you water it"".

All fulfilling relationships require some degree of work and compromise and sacrifice. Just like how your lawn looks nicer when you put time and effort into keeping it healthy and weed-free. Your neighbour's lawn might look nicer than yours, but you're not the one putting in the work to make it that way, you don't know if it's real grass or how much effort went into it, and you can't just go over and use your neighbour's lawn for free without consequences.

"&gt;Edit: Okay, ya’ll know you can just approach people like a normal human being, right? I keep seeing everyone talking about “well I don’t want to be accused of harassment”. If you’re approaching a woman like a sane person that’s not going to happen. If you just walk up to a woman and ask for her number, that’s weird. 

That's not what happens.

Out in public, I have no idea if you're single or searching for someone.  I have no clue on your status.  

If I'm not attractive in a woman's eyes, and I try to strike up a conversation, oftentimes *I will already be on some warning list*.  

Let's say I *do* manage a conversation for like 15 minutes.  What are the chances that the woman is actually single?  Here's a tip: usually a woman talks to me when *they're already taken by another guy*, so there's no threat of me trying to impress her on this, which is why *I'm having the fucking conversation in the first place*.

The reality is that it's impossible to tell unless you talk to a woman, but there's now almost no circumstance outside of officially being at some fucking place or app that dictates that yes, the woman *is* looking for a date, where this is even remotely possible.  

For guys, it was always a guessing game.  Now there's consequences involved if you're wrong.  

EDIT: I will add that I find women that don't grasp this, that either cannot or will not understand this predicament of decent guys (I don't mean nice guys, I mean guys that really mean well here and respect boundaries) to truly lack the empathy of the situation and just make the entire situation worse.  I don't necessarily think this comes from a bad place.  Women don't want to be just seen as a physical object, but want to be respected for everything else.  Except... well, they do the same fucking thing to guys.

I have little sympathy for the dating woes of women honestly, mostly because most of their problems can be solved by *themselves having agency*.  Don't want to go out with a creep, or to go out with an asshole, or to go out with a dumb fuck?  Search out for the guy.  But oftentimes it's the fear of rejection.  You know, the very thing guys have to go through.  If women think it's bad that they have to be rejected 10 times before getting a date, then imagine being rejected 100 or 200 times before even getting a fucking chat from someone."

"Don’t forget embarrassing. I don’t want to bring even more attention to just how bad the mistake was. That’s why I avoided bringing it up. But when everyone started saying it wasn’t a big deal, I felt like I had to come clean about the specifics in order to get the right advice for it. 

Yes, I messed up, I’m emotionally immature and I’ve never been in a long term relationship before even though I’m in my late 20s. It comes from a variety of factors but the most important thing now is resolving it or just bowing out gracefully after said fuck up. "

* Invest in yourself. Your education, your health, your heart.

* Habits are a lot easier when you’ve been doing them for 10+ years.

* Experience new things. 

* Learn new things 

* Don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. 

* Be frugal but not at the cost of the quality of your life.

* Wait for the right person. I really wish I had listened to this. "

"I'm a lady in the same situation! 


But I didn't realize how  frustrating it would be when *other* people assume that you need to be in a relationship just because you have the opportunities in front of you. Like no, not going to lead these people on just because their nice, or it's a free date, or because I'm lonely.

"I was on a date a few months ago, and me and her were sitting adjacent to these two older woman in an outdoor restaurant section. 

Here's some background, I'm a darker-skinned African-American in Eastern Europe; not exactly a common sight. The woman I was with was white.

So naturally, over the course of the night, the older women sitting adjacent to us were proceeded to stare like it was going out of style. My date picked up on it, and in a low voice, asked me what their deal was.

I replied, ""Well, I'm very, very black and you're very, very pretty so those could be underlying factors.""

We developed a FWB relationship a couple days after that date, and last time we talked, she actually credited that line to her first realization that I found her attractive."

"A bit of self-fuflilling prophecy and overpromotion. People mistook using too much porn as having ED, and then it took on this pseudoscientific cult thing. A number of lives were improved by nofap, because it was about self-improvement and getting past the comfort zone. I did nofap for a month. I did notice a difference, but it was because I was filling alone internet time with exercise, socializing, or reading. It did make me thirstier for girls and that did finally lead to me starting to have a more courageous abundance mentality. Sex went from ""if I'm lucky one day a girl will like me enough to bless me with her vagina"" to ""I want it, let's go get it!"" (there were other factors involved, but deciding I wasn't going to masturbate for a while was a big one). A lot of guys do need that boost. While the origin is on paper not masturbating, it's that the abstaining from fapping causes a guy to make changes in what he does as well as how he seeks pleasure."
"I don't usually reply to these but I'll bite.

For the last five or so years there's been a huge social movement that men should not impose themselves on women.  That us initiating conversation is ""frightening"" and unwanted.  We've been made out to be ""shrodinger's rapist"" so often that many of us just don't bother anymore.

We can say something that gets misconstrued and it goes all over social media and there goes a career.  This is especially if you can be publicly mapped to a workplace.   It doesn't even really have to be accurate.

It also doesn't help that there are people out there specifically looking to create a problem that can blow up into something that gives them social currency.  I've seen a few friends in particular get burned by this one.

To be absolutely honest, it's not worth the risks or the drama to approach some people in certain situations.

"Not my friend, but my sister.

Her standards are absurdly high and specific.

- European men (we're American)

- Must be at least 6'2""

- Multimillionaire

- Blonde

- Must collect or be involved in the art world

"Yeah, I had to have a tough conversation with a friend. I introduced him to one of my female friends and it was clear right away he had a big crush on her. Totally cool, I'm not going to help you (gotta stay neutral between friends), but I'm certainly not going to stop you either, and it'd be awesome if two great people started dating. 

Eventually, he asked her out directly, and got a really clear 'no' from her, with a genuine desire to remain friends. On subsequent hangouts, he flirted with her more than ever before, and she was visibly uncomfortable to the point where multiple people pointed it out. I had to tell him straight up that it was getting creepy and disrespectful. Luckily, he's a great guy and had no idea he was acting that way. Has never been an issue since, but still never a fun conversation. "

"It's work. 

Women don't ask for your number, text first, ask you out on a date, or initiate anything the vast majority of the time. They just show up. Also one woman's ""come and get me"" is another woman's ""Fuck off I'm only here for my friends""

There is no universal sign given to approach. Women play employer and we apply for jobs. 
Your comment saying ""if you just approach normally, you won't be accused of anything"" is a painfully gendered response. It's said often by women who refuse to pursue and can't fathom unwarrented negative rejections. 

So there's a lot of reasons.

Maybe he approached 7 women this week, and doesn't feel like approaching you too. Maybe he's scared/nervous. Maybe he is a confident absolute unit of a man and you weren't attractive enough, or maybe the ""signs"" you thought you were giving weren't signs at all. "

When I was in college, my two female roommates were out with a couple of female friends, they got drunk, one of the friends got lost, they went looking for her and found her with a guy and they were telling me about how he probably had bad intentions.

"One day, I discovered a plastic bag jammed in between the toilet and the bathroom wall. I hadn't put it there, so I asked my SO what it was. He told me not to think about it and that he'd deal with it. A week passes, bag's still there, so I ask him about it again. He says ""it's nothing, don't worry about it.""
Another week passes and I inquire about the bag numerous times. Again, he won't tell me what's in it, and that it will be dealt with. A few more days go by, bag hasn't moved and I tell him this is ridiculous and make a move to touch the bag. He screams ""Noooooooo!"" and rushes by me, snatches it up and literally runs out the door with it. 

After about a month, I remember the mysterious bag and ask him what the fuck all that was about. 

He proceeds to recount a quiet morning, when he, sans underwear, farts in a new pair of expensive jeans. Except it wasn't a fart. It was a shart. A shart so foul that it trickled down his legs all the way down to his socks. 
He puts the evidence of his anal mishap in a bag behind the toilet in order to contain it until he manages to book the laundry room. 

But no good times present themselves for booking. He considered cleaning it by hand, but when he opened the bag he was so grossed out by it that he just couldn't. And after a certain point,  he'd just try to pretend the bag wasn't there. So when I made a move for it, he panicked, ran out and threw it in the woods. 

I nearly ruptured a spleen from laughing so hard at this confession. "
"As a straight guy a girl kissing girl, or guy kissing girl you can empathize with because at least one of each couple is kissing a girl and you get it.

I think that this is the correct way to go about it and I applaud you for accepting the inevitability of aging.  I myself am trying to do the same thing.  I feel it's working well for me.
Did your wife ever reveal her crushes?
"I like to believe that there IS the one, it's just that you don't just find ""the one"", you cultivate it. There are probably plenty of women out there who would be compatible with me, but are any of them worth it after the 7 years I've shared with my fiancee right now? Hell no. She's grown so close to me that she's essentially in my mind, 24/7. We've melded so perfectly into each others' lives that nobody else could fit into that mold right now without at least a few years of conditioning.

"Damn, that's a relationship ended there..."
That's the big one
" &gt; I know people who *are bisexual* ~~were gay for a year or two~~ and then decided ~~it wasn't for them~~ *not to pursue relationships with people of their gender*.

You don't just flip the attraction switch off. How many times do we have to debunk the whole ""being gay is a choice"" thing?"
I was so confused for a sec lmao
"In a sense this works as a filter for men as well, I wouldn’t ever date somebody who thinks that way."
"Welcome to the internet. It's absolutely common that you find more negative voices about almost any topic, than you find positive ones.

It's just a normal phenomenon, that people who are happy about stuff don't usually talk about it, but people who are not want to complain and vent and therefore it seems, that an entire community is like that.

There's no other way than simply dealing with it."
If the stubble is patchy it’s a bad sign
"Mystique, duh."
"Screenshot the conversations. Have your boyfriend send the screenshots to the creepy guy and ask him to explain. You and your boyfriend should continue to call out his behavior every time he does something creepy, and if he doesn’t change, cut him out of your lives. "
