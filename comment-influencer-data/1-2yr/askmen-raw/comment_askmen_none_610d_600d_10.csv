"Making out is a good sign, usually when making out you move your hands over her body.

If you move your hand somewhere and she grabs it then you know that's off limits.

It's all trial and error bud, I am not saying when you make out with every girl put your hands down her panties. I am saying test the waters and if she responses well then go further.

"Walk away, and let him be. People come into your life to teach you something. When they're done, they leave.

Let him walk the path he chooses. If he chooses to be a dick, let him. But you don't need to be any part of it. If he comes to his senses, he knows where to find you.

You and you're mental/emotional health come first.

PS. Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. "
"Be physical when you see him next. Hold his hand, hug him, snuggle into him, sit on his lap - whatever. Just do a ton of stuff that's physically intimate but not necessarily sexual, stuff that clearly communicates how much you like your body touching his body. He'll put 2+2 together and give it another shot. In the mean time, just tell him you miss him and how sexy he is etc. You probably don't even need to bring up the event to get your point across but as a last resort it might work."

Tell her to fuck off.  She doesn't run your life.  Also, if he is letting this happen, he's not a very good friend.  I understand you don't have a lot of friends, but shit like this isn't worth it.  There are many, many other people that will be your friend and not treat you like shit.

* When you aren't hoping a relationship is going to fix all your problems and resolve unhappiness you really should be working on."

"Next time he wants to hang out ask if his girl is gonna be there. If he says yes, you should be like ""nah fam not gonna work for me"" and when he's all ""why dude"", that's when you say ""Because you're an asshole when you're around her"""
"And if this still concerns you, you can always say something like 'feel free to stop me if you're uncomfortable' (preferably in a slightly flirty way). That way you've explicitly removed a lot of the ambiguity from the situation. 

Unprompted, I've had several people tell me that they really appreciated this, since it made them feel a lot safer and it removed a lot of the pressure from the situation."
Being seen as disposable by society.

"Immediately upon reading your original post I thought “this has got to be some teenage bullshit.” And while I suppose this depends on your region and social circle... the vast majority of women aren’t going to play these stupid games as adults (hell I never pulled that shit when I was a teenager, it’s cruel.)

I’d caution you to take interest at face value moving into your teenage life. But perhaps be wary of women who approach you in a giggling group of girls, not necessarily for the “fake interest” factor but because a giggling group approach is indicative of a seriously lack of maturity on her part. She shouldn’t need an entourage to say hello to you. "
Stop caring about what women think. 
"This may sound harsh, but I agree. I put a lot of effort into my fitness level. I gave up eating a lot of things that I used to enjoy. So if the other person wants to sit on the couch and eat cheetos, I'm quite put off by that. Besides, most of the things that I enjoy require a certain amount of athleticism and fitness. So why would I sacrifice doing most of the stuff that I enjoy to be with somebody who has no fitness motivation? I'd rather be alone.

Besides, a person's weight is something that people can control. Being overweight shows a lack of focus and discipline in life, which would be some qualities I would want."

"I spent like 6 months tindering.

This is what I learned.

Super likes have a MUCH higher success rate, I would swipe until I deemed someone super like worthy then stop swiping.

If you drop your standards a bit you'll have more success. Obvious but true.

A match doesn't actually mean shit. Understandable considering going on a date with someone you just met on a dating app is totally different to swiping right.

For every 1000 guys like you on Tinder there's 1 girl. Good luck with that.

Tinder will take your self esteem into the alley outside and shoot it.

Tinder is a waste of time."

I just want to make sure that it *is* some weird game that you described and you’re not misinterpreting the situation and they’re actually in to you. 

If you’re correct and they are just fucking with you, if you’re in a scenario where something like this could take place, indifference is your best friend. Say something like “oh that’s flattering but I’m talking with X here, tell her to come join us” and stay put. If their “friend” really is interested, they’ll come up to you and that’s when you can make your move.

I’m not saying don’t ever make yourself vulnerable but in social situations where humiliating you is possibly the goal, don’t play their game. "

"South-Eastern Asians put ice in their beer. As a Belgian I was quickly shocked, but it's so hot that you overcome your prejudice. I would never drink a beer in Belgium with ice, but be respectful of others."
"What you need isn't flirting, you need to take initiatives. Lack of initiative is what separates Nice Guys from the rest of the population 

Be friendly and once you aren't a total stranger to the girl anymore but she has yet to know everything about you, ask her on a date instead of trying to figure if you're having a friendly or flirty conversation with her. Agreement shows interest, rejection/excuses shows lack of interest. 

Go on a date with her, be funny and interesting, make a move (for a 15 y/o i'd say take her hand for example). Holding hands shows further interest, her pulling her hand out shows lack of interest

Plan for the next date. Agreement on a second date shows interest, rejection/excuses means lack of interest. 

Etc.

Don't rush things but take initiatives and show your interest.Cuz if you're trying to tell if a woman is playing with her hair to flirt with you or just because she enjoys playing with her hairs, you're in for a bad time.

PS : not talking to girls to delay the moment when they'll know you too well to date you doesn't work. You'll just be the silent weirdo, she won't develop any interest for that mysterious guy who never talks. "

"At about 15 I figured out that I'm attractive enough for my looks to not be a detriment to me, but not quite so attractive that I get any real benefit from it. I've been told I'm attractive by a few people and never been told I'm ugly. I don't think I'm very attractive but if we're going by other evidence I suppose I'm average to slightly above average."

"I've had a fair amount of success on Tinder. It really pays to know your demographic and have a targeted, even polarizing profile with pictures that convey who you are and not just what you look like.

"Every guy I know who has had success on tinder treats it like a job.

My friend with the most success basically does this: he has a photographer every few weeks, takes a bunch of pictures, puts them up for 100 swipes in different order, leaves it a few days, sees how many swipe backs he gets. That's how successful the picture is. Uninstall, reinstall, try again with a different order for 100 swipes.

He creates a dataset to see what picture works best for the season.

Granted he meets the weirdest fucking girls ever (one girl walked in barefoot to a resto because she doesn't believe in shoes).

He says my pictures reflect me too much, it gives no mystery for the girl to chase after. I'm an adventurer, I have pictures of me doing all sorts of crazy activities (flying acrobatic planes, deep sea diving, racing cars, etc...) and he says that intimidates girls because most women on tinder are looking for some guy who doesn't have it all.

I switched up my profile like he said, and lo and behold, I got swipes."

"Once, at a Ren Fair, I was licking clean the knife that I used to eat my lunch. Not the smartest thing to do, but at that moment, I just didn't care.

""It's just the image of a man licking cold steel,"" she sighed.

...OK. Uh, well..."
"**TL;DR:** Dudes suck at taking pictures. 2 of my favorite ways to start it is to wear boxer briefs to show my bulge or just pull my pants down halfway to show a few inches without giving away the whole thing.

Naturally you take the shittiest possible photo: drawers around ankles, shirt pulled up, straight POV shot of Rod of Lordly Might pointing right back at the camera (or being pushed down so it points outward as much as possible). Barring the novelty of revealing that 24oz. Monster can you might have, this is the least inspiring photo you could've provided. It's unflattering and lukewarm in both presentation and attention to the finer details. You might not recognize it as such, but the tepid reply from her will key you in to the idea that maybe there's more to this than myspace angles and bathroom floors.

Work it, feel ya self. You're about to make a grand reveal, buddy. You don't go straight for the throat because you gotta rev that fucking Harley before you ride it. Drop trou and get them out of the shot. Your shirt is optional, but the key factor here is boxer briefs or athletic underwear. It can't be loose because you're looking for definition. You're trying to define that bulge because the bulge sells tickets to the big dance, and the recipient of this ticket wants to go to the big dance.

You put that phone on a steady surface, you start that timer, and you get that clearly defined package a tasteful distance of 2-4 feet from the camera. This is no longer a sloppily presented, disembodied cock! This a man that has offered his midsection (and possibly thighs) as a *frame* for the cock! Now your playmate has a new toy: imagery. They don't just get the D, they get the idea that there's a man along with it. You've got a stomach they can feel and brace themselves against, you got legs that can support and pump-  Oh, don't forget the hands. Hands are sexy, but a lot of guys don't know that. Tuck a thumb in the waistband, or give your boy a light squeeze, but keep at least one of them in the shot and close to the action.

An advanced move is to keep the pants but ditch the shirt: you want to be at a chub and pull the pants down a bit. Reveal some shaft, but don't let the whole thing hang free. At a minimum you're keeping the head inside your drawers so you can think of it like shaft cleavage: show just enough of the middle to give 'em a taste. You're teasing the pipe now, you've become the flirt. You can even video this one and amp it up with a couple strokes or a good, long squeeze.

There are so many more things that **get. 'em. fucking. going**, but those two are my go-to intro moves. I like to provide a 2-8 piece series of dickpicks, a pipefolio if you will, since it tells a story and gives a nice control of the pace. Further inspo can be found at r/LadyBonersGW, which honestly probably has better advice and examples than I ever will. Now go forth and ~~conquer~~ take photos of your penis."
You're not a true warrior if you don't get blood on your sword.
"Some characteristics of bad lays that I've encountered:

She isn't in touch with her body and doesn't understand what turns her on.

She can't communicate what she wants clearly, and just expects her partner to figure it out via telepathy.

They basically only think of sex as something that is ""done to them."" (1% pitcher and 99% catcher.)

Little movement, little response, not much in the way of physical cues as to whether or they're actually present and enjoying the experience.

Their major contribution to the experience is little more than just showing up and providing a moist orifice.

Having the attitude that the burden of performance falls only on their partner.

Basically expecting their partner to do all the legwork of mastering what gets them off while not bothering to do the same."

She said 'Not right now, later'. After that I felt confirmed in my suspicion and told her to fuck off in a polite manner.

Also my friend told me that it was infact a game the next day, so yeah. Straight up sociopathic shit imo."

Thanks for saving me that click 
"Here's some advice. Don't ever use or think about the term ""Friend Zone"" ever again.

Not only does it have a bad connotation. It's also not a real thing. There are two kinds of women in the world. Women that want to fuck you for some reason or another, and women who don't.

Don't go saying that you are sad that some woman ended up accidentally in the wrong column for you. You honestly had very little control over that to begin with.

Remember that these kids (yeah kids) are forming their personalities and identities too and have as much volition as you do. Being 17-18 is hard. You're basically an adult, but 0 people will treat you like one. It's because they know something you don't.

For the next 5 years you are going to actively try to make your life worse in a multitude of different ways. Don't be scared, it's what every single man (probably women too) go through from age 18-23ish. That's when you start figuring enough of your shit out to know who you are.

At your age, you don't need to rely on games, or chance, or ""flirting"" all you need to do is be direct. It's scary sure, but you're going to have a lot more success if you say ""Hey, I think you're cute, let's go grab a slice of pizza tonight?"" than if you are like ""So... Who do you like? (please say me)""

None of this may apply to you, but I urge you to read my comments here and consider them carefully. You're at a crucial time in your life where you will either choose to be bitter towards women, or better towards life. Rejection is going to happen. Games are going to fail. You're going to be feel lonely. You're going to get laid. You're going to get broken up with, heart broken, love lorn, kissed again, sleep with girls you don't care about. You name it. It's all coming.

You have to decide how to be the kind of man that can handle all of this and the first rule of being a good man, is not to play stupid fuck fuck games. So man up, be direct, ignore the girls who have ""Friendzoned"" you, if they are your friends, then just call them friends, if all you really wanted was a romantic relationship with them, then abandon them completely. Don't disrespect them by pretending to have a friendship with them when all you want is to pull off their thongs."
Not just women. Concentrate on being a good person to be around.

"as a female, I totally agree with this whispering thing. Because I’ve had a few guys do this and I felt immediately safer and at ease from them asking permission and listening to what I have to say: conversely, before or with other people, I always have to wonder if it goes too far, how to reign it in without being a buzzkill or offending. 

If you simply asking me if it’s okay while you start doing it, you have an infinity higher chance of going further. 

(this applies mostly to the first time together or anytime it’s going further than it has before) (I assume my responsibility to reign things in if it has escalated more historically and I’m not feeling it in the moment) "

"There's this casual acquaintance I know, I ran into him at the pub when I was with my friends (one of them knew him well). Anyway I said hi and everything, my friend and the acquaintance go out for a cigarette and I stay inside for a bit to finish my drink. I get a bit bored and join them.
He's halfway through a story about how some guy said something he didn't like so he beat the shit out of him. I get that people make mistakes and I won't hold that sort of thing over someone if they're truly remorseful. But he was telling that story with pride. He had zero regrets. I didn't doubt for a second, given the chance he'd do it again. ""Damn"" I thought, don't want to say the wrong thing to this guy. So I just slipped away to get another drink and decided not to  engage with him for the rest of the night (or preferably ever). My other friends were pretty friendly so I figured he wouldn't notice.

"It's kinda hard to describe accurately. Tl;dr, it sucks. If you want a better description, it's like a whole part of you is just removed from your existence. Person you've talked to almost every night for 4 years? That could end in a snap. Or a person who used to wave you over suddenly just walks by you and doesn't acknowledge your wave hello. It makes you feel powerless, because the decision is all theirs. There's not really much you can do to get back from it. Some girls say they'll just want to be friends, but imagine looking at a slice of cake and not being able to eat it. And you want to, but you can't, because it's wrong to bother them by being persistent. And now you're cakeless and hungry and your one perfect slice is just out of reach. I could go on, but that's my basic take on it."
"Game industry. You are expected to work more because it's your passion and many people actually enable this by working like crazy even when no one is asking them. Nobody is thanking them or giving them a raise or anything most of the time.
This makes it so basically if you do your regular hours you are considered lazy and a bad worker.

Rush at the end of a project can also be annoying if they last too long but I am kinda used to them now.

That you’re expected to be treated like shit, both by customers and management, and if you try to make your working situation better (eg asking for pay increases, taking leave during the holidays, fuck just *asking to have the rosters emailed to me*) you can go fuck yourself and find another job.

The best dating site I ever used (this was 10 years ago) charged you to message someone first.  I think it was a buck a message.  I had great luck on that site because women weren't getting bombarded with messages--if you wrote to someone you were serious.  Then it got sold to adultfriendfinder and everything went to shit.  Someone should bring back that policy.
Blood play.  She liked to cut herself and her partner and mix them.  Way too weird for me.  
"In short: Your boyfriend is acting like a manbaby. His feelings of disappointment for noticing you didn't like the gift are understandable, however his total lack of emotional intelligence is not. Guilt-tripping you over a gift? A gift you explicitly had told him you would not like if he got you one. What is he, five years old? Even worse that he still clearly wants you to feel bad (why would you WANT to make your gf feel bad) by stinging you with it, as if you're not allowed to have feelings of your own. As if he thought you'd somehow owe him something for getting such an expensive present. 

Harsh words from me I know, but unfortunately the truth.

I'm not sure how you can ''fix'' this other than taking the high road. Talk to him and show how much you care about him. Turn the gift exchange into a date, make him feel like you appreciated him for what he tried to do for you. 

But just so you understand....You did absolutely NOTHING wrong. He's the one being childish. "

"This wasn't a date but one time I was jogging in a park and this guy approached me. He asked me if I dropped a key (he had a key in his hands) and I said no. He continues to follow me to strike up a convo. He ends up asking if we can sit on a bench so he can massage my feet. I say no. He's like ""why?"" I tell him that I don't like people touching my feet. He continues to press about the issue and is like ""would you let a boyfriend massage your feet"" and I just said no. He then explains to me his credentials (he works at a massage parlor) and asks again if I'd like him to massage my feet. I said no, told him I needed to continue working out and ran like a bat out of hell.

I guess you could say the dude had a foot fetish..."

"Compatible, none. But it was the first time I actually got matches. Interpret that data however you choose.

The compatibility part is insanely complicated for me. A few female friends basically said my life is too intense for most to deal with (deep sea diving, flying acrobatic planes, racing cars, etc...) I'm also semi retired in my early 30s.

A few female friends have said the following to me: most girls want a routine, a guy with a 9-5, their one vacation in Mexico a year and a mortgage. I can't offer any of that because it's not my reality."
Same.  I can only erect for amputees.
"Not necessarily better, but buying a used ~3-4 year old car is a much better financial decision than buying brand new.

"When you have your own life and shit together, and lack nothing. The relationship should be a bonus ON TOP of an already awesome life, not a way to fill a void.

Before you get into a relationship, ou should be reasonably happy with your:

- living arrangements

- job/money

- physical looks

- social life

- hobbies and passions

- sex life (either you are fine with not having sex, or have FWBs before the relationship). You should never go into a relationship thirsty, ESPECIALLY if you are a guy."

You're going to have multiple times a year where you feel in a rut and are just sand bagging your way through it. That's ok. Just trust your process. A time will eventually come when you feel like giving it all the beans, and, when that does, go for it.

Long story short, it comes out she'd been going around telling people he'd forced himself on her.  It got back to people she knew who took it upon themselves to call her parents and tell them.  They then contact the police, all before he knows anything about what's happening.

He ends up facing expulsion from his school, conversations with police with officers insisting that he ""just come clean"" and potential criminal charges. As well as most people he knows taking the rape accusation as gospel truth.   He's basically staring at his life ending.

About two weeks later, the girl finally admits that he hadn't done anything of the sort and changes her story.  The whole thing is just dropped and she continues her life as normal.

* Positions that seemingly require professional gymnastic training to accomplish and/or can't *possibly* be comfortable for at least one of the participants.
* Age-play that just doesn't fit. Tattoos are often a big part of this. I have nothing against ink but when you're a ""barely legal teen"" rocking full sleeves, or if you're a ""schoolgirl"" wearing the entire cosmetic output of L'Oreal, what's the point of even pretending?

"One of my exes was really into being degraded during sex. Like being called names, talked down to, being slapped and choked. And God help me if I came anywhere else other than her face. Girl was fucking crazy.


Another ex had severe daddy issues and was SUPER into DD/lg in the bedroom. That got old quickly.



The third ex couldn't get off at all unless it was anal. I'm not really into that, so that didn't really last.



My current girlfriend loves to get fucked harder than Puerto Rico's recovery efforts, and I have yet to make her tap out. Best sex I've ever had in my life."
"There's nothing to get over, you're doing the right thing. Being overly cautious about boundaries in a new relationship is totally cool. Most women, especially ones around your age, are going to be following your lead (the joy of societal expectations of men in this arena). So they are unlikely to ever push further themselves, it's on you unfortunately.

You can gently push further and gauge her reaction. Is she really into kissing you back? Is it getting heavier, the kissing getting more passionate? You can also let your hands gently roam above her clothes and gauge her reaction.

It is also okay to voice your desires while kissing her and it's getting heavier. You can make jokey comments like ""that shirt's lovely but I think it's going to look better on the floor"".

It's not a science, you just need to get some experience. Stay respectful and conscientious and you're going to be fine.

Edit: Wow, didn't realize my comment would spark such debate."

Work on your social skills. Being able to talk to anyone is usually a big + for most women. 
Try to cultivate an interesting life.  I noticed that some of my friends who are maybe a 6/10 at best, were much more sucessful with women than my 8+/10s friends because they always did shit. Most people live a pretty boring life and when they see a person whos always having fun and just seemingly living life to fullest, they naturally gravitate towards them. I have a friend that is always bringing people together to hit up the beach, concerts, clubbing, bars, sports, a fuckton of other things. The ability to bring people together like that makes him the most attractive person in our social circle and he is the unofficial ""leader"" of our group.

"Maybe not the worst, but dick size anxiety. And it's not just worrying about how you compare to the average. It's not something that can be easily judged by your appearance, unless you are wearing very tight clothing while also erect. That means that you are already a decent way into a relationship before she finds out, and the reveal can be humiliating if she is disappointed. It's a bit like facing a chance at yet another rejection, only for something you have no control over.

The closest thing I can think of for women is if they have unusual nipples. It's a bit like if every woman padded their bra so that it looks like at least a c-cup, and then had to worry if the guy would still be sexually attracted to them if the guy found out they were anything less than c."
"Good for you for actively wanting to seek consent. Its easier to have to learn to be more assertive than to unlearn being too aggressive. Its ok to be the way you are.

"As bad as packing on that much extra weight *and* doing nothing to get back in shape is, this  

&gt; I know she’s complacent and taking me for granted  

should be your REAL red flag. Her gaining weight and doing nothing to change that signals that she's not interested in being sexy/appealing to you anymore. And it happened *after* you got engaged. You know what that means? She thinks she has you already ""locked down"" and 'thus' she doesn't have to be attractive for you anymore. She already 'has' you, after all. That goes back to her taking you for granted.  

The only logical and healthy thing to do IS to break up. You don't HAVE to go back to your abusive step father. Stay with other family, even if you have to make a 1000 mile trip. Years of unhappy marriage with someone whom you're not attracted to anymore (hello, dead bedroom) and who takes you for granted (you will end up resenting her for this) is far, far, far worse than making that kind of trip. Stay with friends. Stay in a two-tier motel if you must. Just get out.  

And why would you care what your abusive stepfather thinks anyway? He's an asshole, isn't he? He's an abuser. Then why would you want to impress him? His opinion means nothing. Also, going through with something that you're not fully behind and that you will certainly regret in the future, *that* would be a 'failure'. Getting out in time, that is actually a WIN."

"3 prong approach:

* Rub his back

* Wonder if I’ve been rubbing his back too long because sometimes I like the constant gentle rub-touch but sometimes I start to get a little annoyed because it’s too repetitive and I’m grumpy due to my sadness, but I don’t tell him to stop because I know he’s just trying to be supportive, and maybe he’s not telling me to stop even though he’d really prefer I do

* Stop the rubbing and go in for the stationary cuddle

Sometimes I repeat steps 1-3 again. Then I lean in close and whisper “Want me to make paninis for dinner?” That’s the ticket. "

Issues I ran into were constant “work crushes” because goddamn I’m only human. It didn’t help that because I’m unflinchingly polite, a lot of the women would always try and talk to me on breaks or even during my calls. Big hugs everyday, play with my hair and/or sit on my lap during calls. I don’t know how I never squeaked while talking to a customer. 

This was also where I learned that if you gather a lot of women together, their periods will sync up like bluetooth devices. Always thought that was a myth."
"Same. I always considered myself ugly. But at around 21 I made a conscious effort to ignore how unattractive I felt, and began to overcome my nerdy introversion, study social interaction, and learn how to be charismatic.

The near-immediate boon to my life was overwhelming. That was when I realized I wasn’t unattractive, I was average. I simply needed charisma to carry me the rest of the way.

In the years that followed, I made a ton of girl friends and became their besties. It got to the point where most of my closest friends were girls, and I spent such a good chunk of my time with them that I had a reputation among my guy friends for being kind of a “playboy” even though I literally never asked any of them out.

But after six years, one of them made a move on me, and we’ve been dating ever since. Shortly afterwards, two other girls came out and confessed they had feelings for me in the past that they simply let die because I never seemed to reciprocate. Truth is I was so fulfilled by their friendship already, and so certain that I would never get asked out that every overture they made towards doing so just kept coming across to me as them being very platonically affectionate.

Thinking back, it’s fucking surreal. I’m still nerdy and scrawny and obsessed with cartoons and other nonsense like that. But I just learned to carry myself with confidence and dress well, and my life did a complete 180."

"Look, you're giving mixed messages with the Hijab. As a jewish dude who married a christian woman, while I ran with a pretty Jewy crowd (I mean I was a Hillel officer in college, although it was the social committee chair), I never went around in a yarmulke and tallis unless it was at a sabbath or high holy day service. I made it clear while I have a Jewish Identity, I was not hung up on *religious* rules and doctrine... so honestly, dress code is almost more noticable and important to others making impressions of you than dietary ones. 

Look, I'm not for one nanosecond trying to discourage you from your personal decisions to wear a hijab while doing pretty haram stuff, but to be honest, to make such a bold fashion statement does give off more of a ""religiously observant Muslim"" vibe than a ""culturally Muslim, but also religiously liberal/open/ambivalent"" vibe.

""Am I an asshole or am I good human being today?"" While gesturing to the card on the floor. I don't think twice, I pick it up, and try to get this girls attention. She can't hear me, or she ignores me. I wait for the line to progress a little more so that we're closer. I tap her on the shoulder and start 

""Excuse me, you dropp.....""

""Don't fucking speak to me.""

""Oh, cool. I'll just keep your bank card then.""

She didn't hear me, but her friend did. Her friend looks at me all guilty like, and whispers to her friend that I'm trying to help her get her bank card back. The girl turns

""I'm so sorry, that was awful of me. I'm really genuinely sorry. Omg, I can believe I did that, I thought you wanted me to buy your drinks or something... Omg.."" All the while clutching at my hand, thinking that gracing me with her touch would somehow make everything better. I tried to pull away, but she awkwardly tightens the grip, not letting me go until she's absolved herself of all her guilt. She's now holding tightly to 2 of my fingers that I was unable to free. She continues
""So sorry. I'm so rude, please forgive me."" I reply with

""You're genuinely an awful human being. People like you are why other people don't help one another. Let go of me, I'm not telling you that it's OK, and I'm not accepting your apology. Your touching my hand doesn't make me feel better. Let go, take your bank card. Your going to end up a sour and resentful person if you keep thinking the worst of people.""

She was hot, her friends were hot, and I was a kinda fatty guy. She was genuinely surprised that her touching my hand didn't make me feel like a king.

I get it; she gets creeped on all the time. Sadly it’s made her assume the worst in people.

"Chick-fil-A sauce and their waffle fries.

I’ve put that addictive stuff on my wife’s nipples."
"Also be clear. Guys get taught ""no means no"" but they end up thinking ""only no means no"" they don't understand the subtle ways of saying no. We also grow up with pop culture saying ""just try harder"" or ""she's playing hard to get"" clear and consistent ""no"" makes life easier for all involved."
I am still listening My Chemical Romance.
Have we strayed so far from God's light?
"If I were in your position, I'd seriously consider dropping this friend."
2 chicks at the same time. Word on the street is i need a million dollars for that. 
Wait...I was supposed to stop dating controlling psychos after the first one?  
"&gt; You should never go into a relationship thirsty, ESPECIALLY if you are a guy.

So only start a relationship if you have a FWB already? A curious approach..."
"When you invite her out, mention her boyfriend as well. ""You and Jack should come drinking with me and Bloppy this Friday."""
"When someone says ""I'm a mess,"" ""I'm probably not ready for a relationship,"" ""I wouldn't date me right now,"" ""you're too good for me,"" believe them."
"Proof it can be effective!!

"I'm a pretty straightforward person, I never disguise my interest, but I start testing the waters as soon as I become interested. If they're receptive, I move onto flirting and playful teasing, then I make a move.  If they're not into me, I shrug it off and move on.

So what I'm wondering is, what is the purpose of pretending to be friends with someone if you don't actually want their friendship? "
"Online dating definitely sucks for most men, but I don't think any design changes are going to make it better. The biggest issue for men is not getting responses. Most men on those apps get ""stonewalled"" most, or all, of the time. Part of the reason this happens though, is that men usually outnumber women on the apps, *and* they're all trying to message the *same* subset of women in their area. It's the old ""80/20 rule."" 80% (or more) of the men are all trying to message the same 20% (or less) of the women. There's no way to really fix this, because the apps can't change attraction. If someone isn't interested in me, trying to talk to them on a different app isn't going to change that. If I'm not interested in them, the app won't change that either. "

"Obesity.  It's a choice and it tells me a lot about your activity level and discipline at a glance. 

Everyone has a medical excuse for being fat. I did too. I put on 20 pounds in a year after eating out every lunch and dinner and then acted like I didn't know what happened. Went to the doctor and my thyroid values were off. 
 Lost the weight, they went back to normal.  Anyway, for 99.9% of people, being obese is a choice."

I wouldn't. That's a straight up relationship ender.
LOL it's like when you're younger hanging with your friends and get a call from your parents. They start making moaning noises and say things like 'pass the weed' loudly. 
No shame there
"Hi! I do not want to be rude whatsoever, but thyroid problems is not the main cause of obesity. Yes, weight gain is real but not massive, only about 10-30 lbs. If she is active, eats healthier than you do and less often, she is either way shorter than you, or a secret eater. You mentioned you'd be thrilled when she goes down to a normal size, and you can definitely help her. Be her rock. Good luck! "
"What we need here is to drill down to a scalable, next-level, mission-critical end-to-end solution to the business rhetoric challenge. Schedule face time with your team and do a deep dive to surface world-class best practices. Then circle back to me. "
"Totally unacceptable for me, and I know my gf would be absolutely livid if I did that. Actively interacting with real people sexually - even if it's remotely - crosses well over the boundary of cheating for us."
Das cute

Couldn't explain it better myself and its really true."
"One girl I dated always like full tongued my inner ear. Like, I guess i'm disgusting because I only clean my inner ear when I feel it needs it. It NEVER mattered to her. It was gross bro. "
Rampant idiocy at all levels.
