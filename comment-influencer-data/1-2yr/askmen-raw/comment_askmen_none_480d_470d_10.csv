Fairly often. I always figured it was a natural protection instinct
All. The. Time.
"Get a bra, replicate the pictures and poses exactly as she sent them to you. Power move."
"Some of my strongest memories as a child were waking up, coming downstairs, and seeing my dad asleep on the couch with his hand shoved in his underwear. He just kept it there for comfort.

My boyfriend does it. Hell, I do it and I have a vagina. I also hold my boobs. "
"It feels like it now, but none of that really matters. 

Buckle down, do well in school, ignore them. Ambition and effort will propel you to anywhere you want to be.

Edit: Thanks everyone, I'm pretty tickled this is my top comment ever."
"Yeah, but I stopped after I got a daughter. Don't want anyone to think of me going hold her right after I've rested my hand on my junk."
"It’s a lot less “sexy” seeing someone’s every private moment. But on the contrary of these negative comments, it is *incredibly* comforting. Waking up at 3am, and rolling over, not to check your phone, but to your SO right there beside you feels so safe. Some of my favorite moments before my divorce were sitting on the couch all night watching movies as an insomniac, hearing my husband snore from the other room, and knowing I could simply tap his shoulder and he’d be up beside me or I’d be in his arms. Grocery store runs are more fun knowing its all going to the same home, and someone would be there to help you unpack it all and put it away. If you have that experience, then lose it, everything you do alone will feel incredibly empty or lost for a while. "
"I don't know which country you are in, but if you're in the US be very careful. Your post history says you're 16, and I'm assuming the girl is a similar age. If you take nude pictures of yourself and send them to anyone you can get in trouble for distributing child pornography. Getting any pictures from an underage girl is bad too. No picture is worth jail, fines, and being labeled a sex offender for the rest of your life. Just wait til you're 18 and then talk to other consenting adults.

~~If you're in a country where the consenting age is 16, send away.~~ Check the laws wherever you live. Though if you want to know what girls want to see r/askwomen might have better advice. 

Edit: send away was bad advice."
"Jesus, this might be beyond Reddit posters, consider talking to a therapist maybe"
Hair. Hair everywhere. At this point she should be bald. 
What's it like to be a massive liar
My dude does it so often that I sometimes worry his hand skin will fuse with his dick skin.
Casual racism in poorer circles and casual classism in richer ones. 
"""I want to meet a guy to settle down and have kids with because I always hoped to be pregnant by 30.""

She was 29. The date was in May. Her birthday is in August."
It’s even simpler than that: the human body likes it when the most concentrated clusters of nerve endings can feel each other
"I always get a good chuckle at the ""Where can I show pictures of my dick for admiration by internet women?"" threads.

Then they get mad that it's going to be primarily gay dudes. It's an interesting parallel I see when I hear dudes say that they would cam for money if they could but they always leave out the part where they would only do it for attractive women and not some bald dude in Kazakhstan.  "
"I had this realization when I was a teenager and it served me well: there's no one thing women want.  There are different things that different women want.  As such, acting like someone else to get dates will only get you with women who want someone else.  Instead, you just show who you really are, and the women who actually like that will reveal themselves to you over time."
"I dated a woman and, months into our relationship, I noticed she had prenatal vitamins sitting on her kitchen counter one day. It didn’t make me “rethink” the relationship so much as it gave me a miniature heart attack.

It turned out she took them to promote healthy hair and nail growth, if I recall right."
Can confirm. Like to casually shove my whole arm up my anus. I even do it subconsciously at this point.
"Brought her friendzoned boy with her on the date. And afterwards told me she had a boyfriend.

Never again will I go on a blind date."
"Dinner and a movie, I paid for both 

At the end she called it a practice date, and that she was glad we were good enough friends to go on a practice date."
Am a girl. Do it all the time. 
What kind of man doesn't grab his junk in an non sexual way all the time?
"""Wanna try getting molested as an adult?""

Edit: I hesitated to even post that comment because I thought it might be too far, but now it got gilded twice. I may be going to hell, but I'm going to hell with bling to pay my way. Thank you kind Internet strangers"
"A list of 34 male names... I recognized 5 of them as men that she had previously dated, and one as a guy she said was ""only a friend"" listed after my name."
"This could.go really well, or really badly"
"Lots of things change.

1. Personal space.
You now no longer have privacy. At all. Period. I'm personally an introvert. I like my space.

2. Regular everyday rituals.
You know how when you wake up, take a poop, drink coffee, smoke your cig, etc.? Maybe you like to watch tv or game before work? Maybe you like to take your shoes off at the end of the day and roast pot all night. Both of you adapt and change significantly. Do not lets this be a fight subject for you two. Come to compromise.

3.  Chore load.
Now two of you are using dishes, laundry, the toilet, etc. These things now stack up twice as fast. Find out how you can spit this shit up fairly. Perhaps if you hate vacuuming and she hates laundry, switch chores and take it off each other's hands.

4. Did I mention personal space?
None.

5. Toilet paper! (Thank you u/DJ_Molten_Lava)
The toilet paper consumption will not double; it will triple. And girls always buy expensive tp.

6. Not everything is bad (Thank you u/slanid)
Waking up in the morning and the first thing you see is her. You hold her close, feel the warmth of of the satisfaction of being there together. Having a glass of wine and dinner to a good movie.  

7. Stuff. (Thank you u/GREGORIOtheLION)
The stuff... Oh my god the fucking stuff. You think you didn't have the room for your stuff? Haha! Right. You find the most creative places to stow your and her stuff. I know i did...

8. When it works out well, the workload and bills are way easier. If you both work, and cut everything fairly, life is pretty comfortable. You find you work less on chores, have more money to go out (or save up) and get the things you want. If it's well communicated.

9. Compromise. (Thank you u/foxgguy2001)
Direct quote says it best. ""One I didn't really ever think about... Brands and things you like for groceries.  What are the chances you both like ... 2% milk?  Both like the same ... meals prepared.  Not a chance, everything is a compromise.  You'll have to let a lot of things go.  Other things, you don't.  We have two different types of tub butter in the fridge now, two types of bread, just certain things we each hang onto."""
They are human like myself and putting them on a pedestal is just fucking silly.
"Everything starts out like normal, then you find a few long strands of hair in the shower. You think nothing of it but do think about how it's not something ordinary. Then you find a few more in the sink... then the fridge... then stuck to your t-shirts (after you wash them)... then your drum set... 

Wait, did you touch my drum set!?!"" I told you not to touch my drum set. "
"&gt;We were both the only ones each other had sex with, which saddens me deeply that this is no longer the case.

If it's any consolation, if you believe she was unconscious, then you're still the only man she's ever been with and experienced.

Hope you're both doing OK bud."
"I was seeing this girl in college, the first time I went to her place she showed me her ""trophies"" (she actually called them that) which was a rather large collection of hoodies and t shirts that she had taken from past relationships/hookups.  "
"If you're ripped, shirtless pic in bed probably. "
"So you taste more. Most guests are there for several appetizers, a main course, and dessert. The goal is that you can eat that and feel just full, not like a circle with eyelashes like ms. Pac Man. Order sides as well. It is not supposed to be one note like a giant bowl of pasta. "
"I went out for coffee with a girl, went pretty good I thought, so we planned to meet up a few days later to get lunch. The next day she called ""Where do you see this relationship going? Do you see us getting married, or am I wasting my time?""

Yeah we didn't get that lunch..."
i do really well in school and i don’t want to tell anyone because i’m no snitch. I’ve never been like that but i’m so sick of it 
I only get it when she feels like it and so the degrees vary. She is always pretty enthusiastic but i can tell how horny she is by how hard she goes at it.
"Everyone's just people, and it's no harder to relate to or understand any random woman than to relate to or understand any random man. Differences between individuals are immensely more important than differences between the genders as a whole."
"Wish my dad had done this.

Edit: the stopping part..."
"We went to see District 9 together....about 50 mins in, she leans over, tears in her face 'when did this happen? I never heard about it on the news' ...I involuntary let out a chuckle..and she bawls harder.

Edit : yes this is real, no she wasn't high. I didn't jet on the spot, but I also didn't follow up on future dates - I kinda just felt bad for her, you know...for being so dumb.

Edit 2 : District 9 is a movie shot in 'documentary' style for the first half and then the last couple of minutes. It is about the mistreatment of aliens by humans. Aliens..as in outer space, and the mistreatment is due to their rampant crime and use of our resources since their spaceship which is as big as the spaceship from Arrival, hovers over a part of Africa. There is a guy, who leads the 'eviction' team who gets infected by their....whatever, and then turns into an alien himself. Walks in their shoes as he then becomes the subject of mistreatment.

I understand that it would be great if she compared this movie to the real issue of apartheid, but no ..she was really saddened by the fact that aliens lived amongst us and we treated them bad."
"I’m gonna let you in on a little secret, when you get out of school it isn’t gonna matter one damn bit. One day you will wonder why you ever cared. Focus on school and people who don’t go around putting others down, because they do it to make themselves feel better. 

The best revenge is a life well lived. 

Also, that chain? It’s super valuable because you worked hard for it. I bet those kids just get handed everything, which makes it less valuable. 

I have a gshock watch and I wouldn’t trade it for a Rolex, because of the meaning it carries. It’s just stuff. At the end of life you can’t take it with you. 

Next time they say some shit just say “cool story, bro” and walk off. Their opinion of you isn’t your business, and it only matters as much as you want it to. 

Time is your most valuable possession, don’t waste it on them. "
"This post should really only have two comment threads on here, one for yes and the other on how to improve your hand posturing.

"Those giant bags of TP that last 3 months, you buy em every 2 weeks. "
We were just driving back from seeing a basketball game and were heading down a busy main street in the city. She spotted her ex boyfriend and leaned over me and tooted the horn on my car and yelled out to him. I stopped close to him and asked her if she wanted to talk to him. When she got out I pulled the door shut and drove off.
"Grew up poor, have a business that creates events for rich clientele. 

I might have been lucky but I was surprised by how the rich customers treated me. I thought I would kind of be an outsider but several customers invited me over for dinner or things that I never tried in my life before like sailing a katamaran, golf and such. It wasn't to show off or anything but they just wanted to show me what they did in their free time. Of course there were cunts around but I just stayed professional with them and took their money."
Asking how to ask out a girl from his class through snapchat. When people told him it's better to do this face to face he got real defensive.

"She laughed at me and ridiculed me for my income.  Despite the fact that the prior 15 minutes was her sitting there with rapt attention, amazed at what my job is and jealous of what I've been able to do.

Then I said I make $30k a year from it, and all of the interest melted away is derisive laughter.  I left at that point."
"Yup, it's a thing. "
I remember one dude asking if all the rest of us actually changed our underwear every day. 
Har har. I noped out hard. Suddenly remembered I needed to go home and...umm...vacuum...the cat.
"Here's the deal as a person who just finished his first year:

High school is very limiting. They haven't changed and you haven't changed. Nobody really changes in that way. It's just that people who wanted to go hard at parties can go hard at parties, and those who want to join niche nerd clubs can finally do that without it being like 4 people total. Nobody's forcing you to be friends with them. Find what you want to do and do it, and if they come along for the ride, the more the merrier. The greatest of friends just want to see each other be happy."
"There was a post where a girl was asking for advice on a sort of love-triangle situation: guy friend #1 is ""in love with her"" and keeps asking her out, but she doesn't feel the same way and told him that, to the point of saying ""we will never be more than friends."" No ambiguity or ""leaving the door open for later."" She actually likes mutual guy friend #2, goes out with him, has great chemistry... but he feels bad for ""taking the girl his friend likes"" and kind of backs down even though they still really like each other. 

The thread was *flooded* by the same few people constantly ripping this girl for ""leading guy #1 on"" and how he ""at least deserves a chance, one date, to prove himself."" One person said something like ""you made these feelings *together*, so you need to deal with them together""... Sure, 'cause stalking is *always* mutual /s. Aside from the cringe though, it was ridiculous that apparently the best solution that these ""crusaders against this girl leading the guy on (even though she didn't)"" could come up with was for her to just go on a pity date with him even though she wasn't interested and had no intention of taking things further with him... you know, basically the definition of leading someone on... "
"Even if she was conscious, she didn’t ha e sex with the guy. He took it from her, and that’s completely different"
Does the anus have a lot of nerve endings? If so this could explain *a lot*...

She had a cork board with used condoms pinned to it in her closet. That's really all I need to say
"Speaks exactly to my experience.

Believe it or not, most ~~rich~~ wealthy (this is different than rich) people I've dealt with aren't racist. They're purely classist, and strongly so.

Racism seems to flourish when you have no other way to identify your merit so you create one.

Classist mentality seems to flourish when too many benefits override the difference between causality and correlation."
"She told me baby daddy was in jail for drugs.

She got hammered because she was nervous.. had a few before we met.

As we were chatting later she said ""don't you think I'm pretty?"" And replied 'of course I do that's why I'm on a date with you. I even complimented you when we met"" to which she replied ""but you need to say it more!"" We had known each other for 2 hours at that point.

I began to nope out of there but not without a drunken makeout session... she drove home plastered after I offered a ride to a cab/uber. 

Another one bit me... in the face. 

And yet another one asked me ""do you think everyone has the same size asshole?"" After she came back from the restroom. That's how I found her reddit username. "
"If they were super provocative, Boxer briefs so she can clearly see you’re hard but can’t actually see your dick, and pose appropriately. If you have a good bod, add some of that to the frame.

"I think I hold the record for worst first date.

I was young, dumb, hadn’t had a lot of action—tried online dating and matched with someone attractive who was cool to talk to and liked Ray Charles. Seems like a total winner so far

We agree to meet up and she gives me her address. I don’t recognize the city name (red flag #1) and gps it. It’s like an hour and 45 minutes away. But again: I’m young, dumb, and horny, so off I go.

I arrive at the “neighborhood” which turns out to be a trailer park in a rural town in the middle of nowhere (red flag #2). But, I think to myself ‘alright dude she lives in a trailer. So what? Don’t be a judgmental prick.’

I text her that I’m outside and she texts back ‘ok, be out in a sec’. She comes outside and is nothing like she appeared in the pic (red flag #3). It’s the classic: she’s short and fat when her pics were... very much not that.

Her dad, generic redneck man (red flag #4), cranes his neck out the door and stares at me. I smile and wave, but he’s just got this blank stare so I quickly look away and I don’t think much more of it.

In my head I’m thinking ‘ok dude, she doesn’t look exactly like her pics and her dad gives off weird vibes, and she lives in a trailer park in the middle of nowhere 2 hours away from me in a rural town I’ve never heard of, but, like, don’t be a judgmental prick’. Yeah, I was an idiot back then—I still am, but I was back then, too.

___

We get to talking and I learn that:

-her daily activities consisted of using meth and she’s done and tried heroin and cocaine as well

-she apparently made it her goal for the last couple years to sleep around as much as possible to ‘have fun’, but now she’s done with that and wants a real relationship

-her dad is a raging racist, which explains the weird stares (I’m mixed)

**as the conversation goes on I begin to notice a nearly indescribable malodor which would later be revealed to be rotting flesh**

Yes, she had maybe 25% of her teeth left, and the ones that were remaining were brown or black. Actual oral necrosis.

Finally, by this point in my head I am screaming ‘get out, get out, get out’ on repeat in my head. I feel bad because I don’t want to hurt her feelings but also, like, what the fuck.

So my solution was to just start saying stuff I think will make her not want to see me ever again. I told her I just wanted to start having a bunch of casual sex with both men and women, and that I just don’t feel like I ever see myself being in a serious relationship, etc.

Well, it worked, and she slammed the door as she walked back up to her trailer. I tried to say ‘I had fun’ as a final gesture of good will, but I think it got drowned out by the car door slamming in my face.

0/10 would noooooooooooot recommend.

I don’t even know how I would TL;DR this.

**TL;DR** Got rope-a-doped like a Kentucky-fried joke."
"I think it may be important to reframe what you are feeling is the fact that this man is a perpetrator of violence. Not only did he violate your wife (then fiancé), but he violated the intimacy and trust and virtue in your relationship. That is  the injury of rape and why it is such a horrible and brutal crime. It isnt just a physical crime - it is a brutal spiritual and relational crime. When you are feeling “how can I continue with this marriage”, you are likely grappling with feelings of the injury this man has done to your relationship even though you weren’t part of the crime directly. It is called being a secondary victim. Perhaps seeking some counselling individually might be helpful to allow you to process those feelings.

Please continue to love your wife and seek help. Don’t let what this man did to your wife and your relationship ruin both of you. Violence can’t win here."
"Great, just try and hang in there, things will get better, and you'll leave them behind when you head off the college.

I’m paraphrasing but the comment was pretty pathetic. But what’s more pathetic was this sub’s reaction: top comment, guilded many times, everyone commenting how legitimate this statement was. It was appalling. 

The thread was something like “what’s your unpopular opinion” that shows up every other week. So people can try to claim that that’s why. But if I claimed I love kiddie porn or that beating women gives me a hardon, I would be downvoted to fuck in that thread. It wasn’t upvoted because it was unpopular; on the contrary, it was upvoted BECAUSE everyone agreed with it. That’s how those threads work. "

"So in my early 20's I moved out into my first apartment in NYC, and had two women as roommates for the first two years.

The time spent living with women in the city blew my perception wide open on how often women get harassed in cities, because I'd hear them come home every week with new stories of guys pestering them.  It's a hard concept for guys to grasp sometimes because to put it bluntly, we're invisible compared to women as we walk from place to place.

These were not super attractive women that dressed in any type of way, they didn't work or commute through bad neighborhoods.  Hell, one worked as a construction support supervisor and dressed more masculine (if that makes sense) since she had to talk shit with rugged NYC contractor types.

Some examples include:

* Getting their arm licked by a random passing by stranger

* Cat called

* ""Let me see a smile!"" Followed by, ""Ungrateful Bitch"" if they didn't smile back

* Being followed down a subway platform and having an earbud pulled out and being told ""It's rude to ignore someone!"""

The full story is that her dad didn't like her boyfriend so she agreed to a blind date. She then brought the other person with her because she didn't want to go hang out with a stranger (Fair enough, made sense). Said person happened to have a huge crush on her and at every turn he tried to upstage me by paying for things or talking a big game.

I guess he'd been trying for a while and was mad at me for taking her on a date. Obviously I knew none of this until she told me when the date concluded."

"I grew up very poor and yesterday I was at a cocktail party fundraiser in a 9200sqft house for some foundation where people were writing 10k checks.  I'm an accountant and I work for a social service organization so I tend to interact with a lot of ""poor"" participants and ""rich"" donors.

Poor people tend to be *extremely* cynical and apathetic if you are new to the group but very warm, trusting and loyal once you are considered part of their group.  Posturing and emotion is much more overt. Tend to be much more forthright.

Rich people are very gracious, open, and generous if you are considered part of the group, especially if you are new to the group.  Lots of subtlety and nuance in conversation and behavior.  Posturing happens but mostly the rich are fairly confident and have far less to ""prove"" to each other.  People are probably more judgmental but probably won't express their judgement openly.

That's the biggest difference I see, the rich are *much* more socially adept in general.

"The big problem is that statistically, there most certainly is someone who's better for you.  There are over 7,000 000 000 people on this planet so the probablilty of finding the absolute best match for yourself is extremely remote.  Even if you narrow that number down to something more realisitc, like the number of women you'll meet by age 38 or whatever, it's still a huge number and so statistically, it's still a mess.

Rather than dwell on ""what if"" someone is better suited to you, think about the life you want to have.  If you're in your 20s or early 30s, imagine yourself with that person in 5, 10, 20 years.  Are you truly happy?  (thanks u/uknolickface for the whole ""happiness"" theme)  Do you love your partner's company?  I'm not talking about the euphoria we feel when we're in love.  I'm talking about does she make a good friend? Does she have depth of character and feeling?  Does she have ""relationship qualities"" like kindness, patience, generosity? Is she too demanding?  Is she demanding enough?

And then, there's the whole ""life vision"" thing.  Do you have insurmountable differences?  Do you agree on having (or not having) kids together?  Is either of you very religious and if so, will it work out in the long run?  Do you have career goals that would make a lifelong relationship impossible?

Then, there's the whole love thing.  Are you in love?  Is she in love?  Are you on the same wavelength sexually? Do you have honest, meaningful communication?  Do you find eachother gratifying (sexually, emotionally...)? 

And then, there's you:  Are you mature enough?  Are you done ""sowing your oats""? What feelings does the idea of settling down provoke in you?

And there's her: do you want her to change anything?  If there are big things about her you want to change, it's probably going to be a problem.  You don't seriously committ to a person hoping they'll change something major (like addictions, weight / body issues...)

If there are no red flags in any of what I've suggested or in any other domains I haven't thought of, take a step back and realize that what you've got already is incredible.  If you feel happy with her and if you love the idea of spending the rest of your life with her, you can feel confident in her being ""the one"".

That's my take on it anyway.

My opinion: Start assessing if what you have is enough. Then, begin building from there. Water the grass you currently have... if you believe it's worth watering/ if it's enough.

The question I've begun asking myself in any situation is: ""Can I work with this?"" 

If you can, do!

(Small Addition: I think another key is steering away from a belief that someone out there can be so ideal they'd be able to provide a life you can't offer yourself. Not saying it's impossible, but (speaking from experience) it's a miserable existence of constant hoping, searching, disappointment, and victimization. You gotta create your own happy with what you have. Why waste your time dreaming when you can be building?)"

"So I'm going to compare wealthy professionals (not mega rich but net worth over £1m) and chronically unemployed poor British people here. I spend extensive time around both. Poor people are way sicker, even the ones who don't smoke or drink too much. Everyone here gets the same medical care on the NHS (though some who can afford to do go private) and everyone can buy cheap, healthy food anywhere if they choose to. We don't have food deserts here. Though as George Orwell noted in The Road To Wigan Pier - when you are poor, [you're much less likely to look forward to eating or inclined to cook a healthy nutritious meal of fish and green vegetables.] (https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/08/george-orwells-lesson-for-jamie-oliver/)

It seems to me like even when you control things like healthcare and nutrition so that a good level of both are available to everyone, the sheer misery of being poor and low in social stature makes people more prone to illness, and they die much younger.

This isn't just my observation either. The Whitehall Study compared the health outcomes of British civil servants in the strict hierarchy of the civil service, lower ranking people took more sick leave, were fatter and had higher rates of mental illness. This is also seen in primate studies. [Here's an outstanding documentary] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYG0ZuTv5rs) for anyone interested.

TL;DR: Even if you're poor in a rich country where you can get medical care and you won't starve, you're still far more likely to die younger and have more illness in life.

**EDIT:** There are a lot of people making very good observations that this poor health is a result of stress and depression and asking whether poor health causes poverty or poverty causes poor health etc. It is for sure, but it's also because of *social stress* from being low in relative status. Work stress, obesity and addiction all add to the problem, but the negative effect of simply feeling like you are subordinate and at the bottom of the pile causes a chemical stress response in the body that over time damages your cardiovascular health and immune system etc. It even affects people who are not living in poverty, or even poor (no one in the Whitehall Study was poor.) I cannot recommend the documentary I linked enough in explaining all this in very clear ways."
"Your relationship takes a lot less effort - less thinking ahead to pack a bag, or finding out what nights of the week to see one another, or making sure to check in by phone or text regularly. It’s really nice to have a natural cadence in your relationship, rather than one that needs a lot of planning on your part. 

Also, shopping for two can be cheaper than shopping for one, and certainly paying for a shared one bedroom is cheaper than covering the cost by yourself.

Whatever parts of your relationship you were able to kind of buffer or keep to yourself are going to get out on the table, so it’s a good way to get a real sense of how compatible you are. 

Living with someone else - breathing the same air and weathering the same changes - can break a relationship. But if it doesn’t, you end up speaking the same language and developing this funny telepathy, an emotional synchronicity, that’s nowhere else in your adult life, and not like anything since spending all your time with siblings as a kid. When it works is magic."

"My family went through the transition from poor to quite wealthy over the course of my childhood. Because of this I kept friends from when I was younger even as I moved into wealthier social circles. There are lots of differences ranging from the different stresses encountered by each group \(and yeah, as much as I hate to admit it, there are stresses that might seem frivolous to poorer folks that nevertheless are quite real in the minds of the wealthy\), to the physical health and general level of education.

However, three things really stand out to me and they all are sort of related:

1. Poor people look at money as a tool to buy something, rich people look at it as a tool to make more money.
2. Poor people will fill up their car with a specific dollar value of gasoline based on whatever cash they have on hand, rich people just fill until full which leads into the final point.
3. I often hear poor people say they ""don't use credit cards"" or ""we only use money we actually have"". Rich people ALWAYS use credit cards, almost without exception. Why use cash if we can get 2.5&amp;#37; money back in the form of points to use for our next vacation? Credit cards don't charge interest if you don't carry a balance."

"A dear friend of mine was in almost this exact scenario. She waited months to tell her SO, and he was furious when he found out it happened. They didn't speak for quite awhile and there was a period where it was unclear if they'd stay together. 

Maybe I can provide a few insights based on talking to both of them about it. 

My friend didn't share with her SO because she felt ashamed that it happened. Like your wife, she was raped while she was passed out. From all accounts it sounds like she was drugged, but at this point it's impossible to confirm. It took her months to even admit to herself that she was raped, and she felt immense guilt and responsibility for it happening to her. 

Her SO felt angry because she didn't tell him and because he felt powerless to shield her from this horrible thing that happened to her. Since he found out so long after the fact, it was easy to assign blame to her for the assault as well as for not telling him about it. 

They worked through it and are ultimately still together. 

My advice would be to start therapy (which it sounds like you're doing), and know that people respond to trauma in unpredictable ways. Your wife could feel responsibility for what happened, shame, denial, or have post-traumatic stress, all of which could contribute to her response. She went through something horrible. Try to separate the anger at her not telling you about it from the actual rape itself, which she is not responsible for. 

Some victims go their whole lives without telling a soul about their rape. While she should have told you right away, she's telling you now."

"My advice: Talk about it. Talk about it. Talk about it.

You must communicate with how you feel and ask how your parents feel. Gaining more perspective helps overcome the situation and will make it easier on everyone.

"You don't ""get"" a girl. You don't ""win"" her heart, you don't ""score"" a date, and you don't ""have"" her. Rather, you and she get to know each other and maybe both decide that you like each other enough to be intimate.

A girl isn't a prize, isn't an upgrade to your life, and isn't a quest you can conquer if you say the right thing or do enough good deeds. She's a person who gets to decide if she does or doesn't want to be with you, and if she isn't into you like that, that doesn't mean you're not trying hard enough, or that she just hasn't seen how good you are, or that if you keep trying eventually she'll change her mind.

"The mystery of the butt\-smelling hand. 

We were having a nice, relaxing day off together drinking coffee and whatnot, when I got the urge to shit and take a shower. So I go and do my business, scrub up nicely everywhere,  dry off, and then sat back on the couch with just my towel. Well, one thing led to another and we started fooling around which led to some nice mid\-day sex. An hour after goes by and we're just chillin' again, when all of a sudden she goes ""Oh god, smell my hand."" So intriguingly lean forward, and what I smell, was butt. Straight ass. Like, un\-showered 3\-day summer music festival butt smell. 

She thinks it was me because I have a guy butt, but how? I had JUST showered and I always scrub my ass with the fury of a colonial handmaid, plus, she didn't put her hand anywhere near my butt expect maybe during the blowjob? I think it was her, because she hadn't showered for two days, but then again I don't think her butt has ever smelled like THAT.

We've argued about it for a while now, all in good fun of course."

"As a Canadian who has eaten at restaurants in America: I find the portion sizes are generally monstrous compared to what I’m used to. Having a meal out should leave you feeling full, not ill. Finishing a plate isn’t supposed to be a battle.


But higher end restaurants often have smaller portions because the experience is supposed to focus on *the food*, not filling your gullet. The taste and the flavours are what you’re paying for, so smaller bites are preferred over a 2oz size bite every time you cut a piece of steak, for example. 


And to be frank: Because those restaurants *can* give smaller portions. The clientele to eat at higher end restaurants are likely considering presentation/flavour complexity more when choosing a restaurant, instead of simply the size of the portions, so these restaurants don’t need to rely on massive plates to draw customers in. Smaller portions = less waste, better profits."

"I went on a coffee date with a chick who proceeded to ask me more interview-ish type questions 

What job do you have, do you have your own place, do you have any kids, etc. When I asked her something she brought up get baby’s daddy then proceeded to spend the entire time talking about him and his job and goals. I never returned her phone call.

I did speed dating once and met a moderately attractive woman. We made plans to see a movie, she brought her very young son, which wasn’t really a problem, he was maybe 3ish. The problem however was when we went back to her place, the child demanded, not just acted up, literally demanded she give him all her attention. He would yell things like “look at me” “come here now”, “give me ____.” After about 30 minutes of seeing an upper 20ish year old woman bossed around by a 3 year old, I left. She followed me out to my car and tried to seduce me to stay, and it might have worked excepted her son stood at the gate to their yard screaming at her to come back inside."

"I don't have a good answer, if I were to guess, it's a power thing?  It's a way of demanding the woman to acknowledge him under the guise of trying to be nice/polite.

"Sorry, I'm going to change the subject kind of. Lots of people are asking a similar question of ""why didn't she tell you until now"".

Edit: there were too many clothes for it to be rent and return, LuLu, or whatever else. Seriously, this room had shoe boxes stacked to the mid wall, metal shirt racks like you see at Ross with all the clothes hanging on them (like you might see at Ross). It was like they stole the whole damn rack from Ross and put 5 of them in there. Sweatshirts, shoes, shirts, and more that I didn't bother to snoop around for. Felt pretty scammy to me. "

"To this day \(11 years later\), people still tell me that my wedding was the best they have ever been to.

Why? Well, the ceremony started at noon, and the reception was over by 4 PM. It was also a dry wedding. Why was that so great, you ask?

Well, at 4 PM, my bride and I took a limo to our hotel, consummated our marriage, and ordered room service \(an awesome cheeseburger and fries\). At 8 PM, we crossed the street from our hotel to a bar where we had a pre\-paid tab set up. Our friends drank until the money ran out which was around 12 or 1 AM. Only our friends were invited to this event \- family's obligations were over at 4 PM.

Everybody loved the idea. There was no obligation to ""stay until the bride and groom leave."" It was hang out as long as you want and then head out. Everyone got to go back to their hotel and shower/change out of their formal wear. No one had to awkwardly put up with weird, older, drunk family members, and everyone still had a good time."

"Poor people tend to be cynical. Most “want a job” instead of the opportunity to create value. Or they overlook the power of building relationships and networking. Poor people don’t know the difference between price and value.  They also tend to be easily discouraged.  They think an expensive 4 year degree is the only way into the middle class.  They think the only way to learn something is in a classroom. 

Rich people are sometimes entitled. They think they’re completely responsible for their own success. They lack empathy.  They tend to be disconnected from reality if they grew up wealthy but never had a hand in creating their wealth.  Many have a good understanding of economics, economic cycles, compound interest, marketing psychology and so forth. They follow politics and are civically engaged.  "

"The Critic by Theodore Roosevelt

“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat. “"

"She was incredibly nervous, wore a guy's shirt and talked about her aunt who is living with her trangender ex-husband (went from guy to woman WHILE they were in a relationship). She also talked about her super weird dreams (like, really tripy shit). We then made out in the park and spent the next night together. While we were spending the night and went to have sex, she had PTSD flashbacks from when she was raped and would shake violently and have a variety of very scary reactions. I have no issue with that, of course, but she didn't tell me about this beforehand, so I was pretty shocked. She then fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later, saying that she is hungry, she ate my snacks that I had with me and ultimately asked me at 4am whether I could drive her home.

Thankfully she goes through a purge every couple of months where she spends almost an entire day just cleaning up until the place is immaculate. I love it and she does too but she just....doesn’t keep it up and slowly we re right back where we started"

"I took a girl out and she just put me down the whole time.  Called me stupid and told me that I was dumb.  Honestly, for no reason.  I would make conversation, ask questions, and that would be her response.  It was horrible because she would say that and then put her hand on my leg, try to kiss me, etc.  It was horribly confusing and cringe worthy for sure.  
She was pretty, but the constant unnecessary put downs mixed with trying to make a move just made it so bad.  
I took her home and never talked to her again.   "

"Yeah, something similar happened. Met up at her place for dinner, we ended up banging on the sofa and the first thing she asks is ""so, does this mean we're official now?""

NO, IT DOES NOT."
Oh dear god. This made my butthole clinch.

Same. My SO is going canoeing with his friends for a week starting today and I was pretty sassy about the whole thing. I’m used to him always being there and I’m gonna miss him. Also I feel lame cuz I don’t have any cool fun things to do in the meantime :\

"She was HUGE. Seriously. Her arms looked like unbaked loaves of bread. Her ass looked like two midgets brawling in a burlap sack. She had to enter doorways sideways because she was so large. A metric fuck ton of folds and creases on her, most of which went unwashed."
"The thing that always blows my mind is that it starts *so fucking early*. I was getting hit on by grown men walking to frikkin elementary school with my light-up sneakers and Power Rangers backpack. I could not have been mistaken as an adult in the least. As a matter of fact, it happened much, much more often when I was a child, and actually slacked off as I've grown older. 

And I thought for the longest time that it was just me, but Reddit made me realize that it's like that for so many others. "

If you suck then you still shouldn't try to be someone else. That treats the symptom not the cause. What you should actually do is try to genuinely improve yourself so that you don't suck and you can be your new self.
"* Told me about the notarized custody agreement that she and her ex\-boyfriend had for a golden retriever.
* Mentioned the kid that she didn't bring up at any point before.
* \(third date\) Finally decided to tell me that she was divorced.
* Got mad at me when I told her I was dating other women \(keep in mind, this was a first date\) after she asked, ran to her car, then texted me a nude.

These are all different women."

When I was in my late teens I had very long hair. When I was about 21 or 22 I slept with an 18 year old. The next morning she woke up complaining about her hair. I grabbed a hair tie hiding in my desk and she was insulted. Apparently the guys she knew kept them from girls they slept with as trophies. 
"Thanks for the sentiment.

I reacted calmly - out of shock I think. My kids were asleep in the house.  Still it was a train wreck. Not recommended"

You take snacks with you on dates?
"I mean she's a moron for making the judgement, but surely she'd also believe that for women too if she's had over 100 partners? I don't think I've ever met 100 people I'm happy to talk to for more than an hour just me and them"
Her wardrobe doubles but yours does not. You'll go to wear something and find her in it. I lost so much stuff when she was pregnant... now she lives with someone else and I live with my kids 50% of the time and the rest just with my dog.

Wow that's shallow af. You def dodged a bullet. Did she actually ask you how much you make?
"My husband says it was just knowing everyone was there to celebrate us. It’s a great feeling when you’re surrounded by people who you know honestly love and care about your happiness, y’know?

"dude yes, i don’t know why i’m always seeing guys so perplexed as to why we go through so much toilet paper. it makes sense. we’ve got these flappy messy things between our legs that have crevices you have to wipe after every bathroom trip, not to mention you’ve got to wipe during your period and (if you’re a good samaritan) you need enough toilet paper to wrap your tampon so the next person doesn’t have to stare at it.
women can’t just whip it out and shake it off, i need to wipe like 2-3 times sometimes to make sure it’s all clean!"
"""That just goes to show you don't know how life works now""

Cheekier response: ""Why are you bringing your mistakes into this discussion?"" "
"I never lost interest.  I'm just too fucking tired.  After we get the boys (both under age 6) fed, bathed, tucked in, run out of bed, tucked back in, run out of bed, tucked back in read another story, rinse, repeat.  

Yeah, nope for the both of us.  We have sex now and then and it's awesome and still mind blowing, but I don't feel any resentment toward her and I don't feel any coming from her.  "
"&gt; My kids were asleep in the house

This went from bad to worse. Cheating with the kids in the house. What the fucking fuck?"
My toilet paper budget went straight up.  I also didn’t need music to sleep at night anymore
"Trust, but verify."
What the actual fuck
"lol, i have you RES tagged as ""gives good hand jobs"""
"&gt;You're eating for taste, not to be filled up. 

Yes. But, in fairness, it varies, there are fancy places that are like 16 courses, so even if the portion sizes are tiny shot glass sized, you'll still be satiated at the end.

&gt; I wonder how many people that go to those restaurants make a Taco Bell run afterwards

The trick is to know if you're going to get a tiny amount of food, and if so accept it and pre-plan, by either:

- If you're looking at 3 or 4  shot glasses, I'd say eat beforehand, that way you can actually focus on tasting the food as opposed to wolfing everything placed in front of you and being bummed out at the end. --OR--
-  Or alternatively, order everything in sight. I've been with people that just order the whole menu for the table to ensure everyone gets enough. The Chef will love that, as it means someone will actually try out all of his inventions other than himself."
I mean my grandma has had like 6 heart attacks to get me out of dates.  Bless her soul.
The TL;DR is the best part of this comment.
Threesome?
"Senior year of high school I was going to ask a girl to homecoming but she found out and skipped class to avoid me. Tough, but I can deal with it. However, later that day we ran into each other in the hall. We make eye contact and, without a word, she turns and absolutely ***sprints*** away as fast as she can. Felt bad, man."
"""Men lack emotional intelligence."" "
"I realized that the most attractive people have insecurities too, often more than a more ""average"" looking person would. In fact, sometimes that's what drives them to try to look good, anyone who has bodybuilder friends sees this on the dude level as well. 

Second: there is less competition at the top, you actually have more of a chance with that girl you think is a 10 than the one you think is an 8. The model quality women I've been friends with many have never had a serious boyfriend, while their best friends (slightly less attractive) always do.

Third: Everything is bullshit anyway. If you ask for advice on what a girl/guy/someone is looking for, ignore the advice and look at actions (in advertising speak don't believe the market research, believe the clicks on the buy it now button).

Fourth: Everyone has different tastes and desires. No two people want the same thing (this will sound trite, but you know, because they are individuals, you know, people), becoming universally attractive to all is impossible. You can up your odds by being authentic/honest, playful, good at communication, healthy/fit, successful, or interesting. But that girl who's into hiking likely won't be thrilled with your love of video games if you catch my meaning. 

Fifth: People can change, what they want can change over time, paths can diverge. It's ok.

Sixth: trying to persuade someone to for example ""love you"" is the biggest waste of time of your life. Live your own life, find people who are going the same direction. 


These have helped me anyway. "
"I think it all boils down to this. 

If you’re not happy with yourself, you’ll be looking at everything in your life wondering what went wrong. If your truly happy with yourself, you’re not worried. You’re happy with where you’re at and who you’re with. (As long as who you’re with isn’t a POS)"

"And they follow the golden key to personal success: Don't be an asshole. Be assertive and dominant for the things you want, but don't be an asshole. Those tend to get jettisoned relatively quickly. Even people in power tend to try to save face as much as possible because of how they want to be perceived."
"I tend to find motivation when there is something I want; a car, clothing, or an adventure, etc. Do you currently have any goals?

I used to make excuses for why I couldn't work, even when the hours were available. I just hated being at work instead of with friends. Then I got the idea to hike the Appalachian trail.

Everyone talked shit, some of my friends went on about how hiking for months on end was something trust-fund-babies did, and not for ""normal folk"" like us. I moved back in with my parents and saved every penny for a year straight.

I ended up hiking the trail, and it was an amazing experience. When I returned and started working I was getting around 65 hours a week, then took a promotion and was up to around 80 a week. I think by that point I'd realized that I was actually able to make one of my own dreams a reality by putting in hard work. After that, I wanted to make sure I had money set aside in case another idea ever came up.

I don't have any magical tricks to get motivated. I simply had something I wanted bad enough. Even my friends now, who complain about lack of funds and such, they spend so much on weed and other things. I'm like ""Well if you stopped doing A you'd have money for B. Or try working more hours?"" Which is always met with ""Nah, I ain't giving up weed and fuck hours."" Well, ok then.

I think the majority of people lack drive and dedication, including myself. If there was a magic fix for it we'd all be accomplishing anything we thought of. In the end, I've found if I haven't accomplished something, I just didn't want it bad enough. You gotta find something you want bad enough."

"They may be wealthy because of how socially adept they are, not the other way around. It may be unpopular to say this but you can kind of tell the winners from the losers in life from a five minute conversation when they are 18 years old. It really isn’t like the 90’s movies would have you believe. In my experience, the popular and successful kids were kind and warm from a very early age. "

"Towel works. Shirtless in gym shorts post-workout like [deleted] work too. Gotta show off the muscle pump.

EDIT: I just realized how douchey uploading a shirtless photo of yourself in order to show how to take shirtless photos is.

"People express emotions differently and anger is simply a derivative of that. Some express it physically (i.e. throwing stuff around, breaking things, or even assault) while others internalize it (i.e. they sulk, become vindictive, passive aggressive). 

Personally, I consider someone who manages their anger well to not express it physically or internalize it completely. They don't raise their voice too much and know when to step away from a conflict to de-escalate the situation. Conflict management and steps to escalation are good resources if you want to know more about this kind of thing. 

edit: Also I think the better you are at negotiating with a common goal the better you are at conflict management. "
My dad used to call me a worthless piece of shit a lot when i was younger. He use to beat me too but somehow those words did way more damage to me than his fists ever could.
