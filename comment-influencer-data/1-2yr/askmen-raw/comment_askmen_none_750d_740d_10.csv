"I think my girl is a 20 out of 10.  I put her on the pedestal and I honestly got to the point where I started thinking like you did.  I started worrying about other guys, especially guys that were her coworkers, friends, and especially other guys when she's out when I'm not around.  I started to compare myself to them and all that, and I see you're doing the same thing.  

Listen to me when I say this: don't worry about the other guys and don't ever compare yourself to other guys.  Here's the thing that will happen.  You're going to compare yourself and you're always going to think there's a bigger fish for her.  You're going to start to think that she's not happy with you and you're not going to appreciate the fact that she's really happy with you and wants to be with you.  Then you're going to start to feel insecure and constantly worry and get jealous about other guys.  Then you'll start to worry whenever she goes out without you or whenever you guys are out and she glances at another guy you'll worry.  Then you'll start to think that she's talking to other guys behind your back or that she's seeing other guys when you guys aren't together.  Then you'll have a blow up, accusing her of these things or even just telling her all these things you're thinking.  Then next thing you know, she's gone because of your insecurities.  

This is exactly what happened to me.  Everything except the last part.  You know why I think she's a 20 out of 10?  The first 10/10 is because of how beautiful she is.  The next 10/10 is because she's got a big heart.  She helped me to realize I have these insecurities and anxieties and yet, she wants to stick by my side and she wants to see me get better.  I'll be seeing a therapist to try and work through these issues and I really want to work on it because I'd be a damn fool if I ever lost her.  OP, don't ever worry about guys.  If your wife/girlfriend is with you, just be happy and enjoy and appreciate her.  "

I would ask where you get your memes from and then be kicked out of your room. 
"First everything at 27.

I had a pretty fucked childhood, was abandoned by my abusive mother when 12 and I was homeless for a while. When I was 25 I finally got a good, permanent place to stay and once I was stable started working on friends and relationships."

Your boy needs to file a police report ASAP and tell them about the breakup and any relevant details that would suggest she would do something like this.
"There's a theory out there that men are attracted to close female friends because of emotional connections.  Men and women differ in how they treat their friends; most men aren't emotionally open with their male friends while women tend to be more emotionally open.  Men tend to have one or two people that they open up to emotionally, and that leads to a deeper connection usually reserved for romantic partners.

Women however are comfortable with having multiple close emotional contacts, so to them, it's just another friendship.  To men, it's something much, much more."
"Rarely. However, I frequently do the opposite - type up a long post on a controversial subject, realize that I really don't want to deal with the vitriol, and delete it.

Basically, I delete it because people give *too much* of a shit."
"She's incredible goofy at home....like just plain silly. She dances, makes noises, has silly expressions. She also has a very high sex drive.  In public she is very reserved and formal. People have commented to me about her being repressed or a snob lol. Far from it!"
I can't imagine watching Predator for 24 years every day and enjoying it. 
Was really hoping to come here and see absolutely no comments
"You prioritize and sacrifice. I am in grad school and work full time now. Most of my free time is studying and homework. I can't work on my hobbies that much. I exercise on my days off and hang out about once a week. I'll have to sacrifice fun and enjoyment for school for the next three years, it's just how it is."

"My wife is sexually conservative in public.

She would never grind me in a club or anything past a peck during our wedding song.

She's a slut when we're alone."
"Use your mouth and words. You don't need to be a dick about it, but be direct. Understand that that may be who she is, and if she doesn't want to change, she doesn't have to. If that's a dealbreaker, well consider the deal broken."
"Perfect. Less drama, usually her priorities are straighter. I'm the same. All I have is an instagram but it's pretty much for just seeing cool art and pics of my friends and stuff"
"Marriage for me. I work for a divorce firm, so it keeps my lights on."
"If she's physically attractive, shares personality chemistry with me, shares common interests, and is emotionally available, I'm going to be romantically interested in her. It's even easier with friends since generally I've known them long enough and well enough to more accurately assess all of those things."
I just wander around life aimlessly while hoping some woman will take pity on me
"Been with my wife 10 years, married for 2. Always been beautiful to me but about 4 years ago she lost a bunch of weight and got smoking hot. As a consequence she gained a lot of attention that she hadn't received before. 

Long story short she lapped up the attention and eventually cheated. We're divorcing now . "
"I've been there. Dated someone for a year who was clinically depressed and had major anxiety issues. It was very challenging, and honestly it was probably a big part of why we didn't work out (though not the only reason). I think I'd still date someone who had these issues, but I'd need to see that they were adequately treating dealing with them. Left unchecked, these issues are toxic to relationships. But I wouldn't consider them dealbreakers because I know people who have them, deal with them, and are able to function normally."
I like when my wife touches my face with her boobs.
"My lady is pretty hot and Im very trusting, but the truth is I get over protective the moment she feels uncomfortable. She has this certain fake smile and awkward laugh and its like my bat ~~symbol~~ signal.  

Edit: signal "
"&gt;when another opportunity arises.

no no no no no no...don't leave it to 'fate' or some excuse bull. 

**IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN**

Make a date dude. "
"I've dated a lot and have been in many relationships by this point, so I don't experience that kind of head-over-heels puppy love much anymore. It usually takes me a few dates to really get a feel for how attractive I find them as people. Beyond checking off  the usual list of positive traits (are they kind, intelligent, fun, independent, etc.), the big thing for me is realizing that I can be my goofball, nerdy self around them and not feel self-conscious at all about it (and seeing that they are comfortable doing the same with me). Once I feel comfortable, and see that she's also comfortable, my outlook on the relationship changes very quickly."
Mods here are savages
"I love them. For the exact same reasons you mentioned, it all seems fake/show-off-y to me. I love genuine people, not ones that hide behind filters"
"&gt; sexually conservative in public

&gt; a slut when we're alone.

The probability between these two things always seems to be very high."
"I don't think you are giving enough context to get great advice. Is it making you feel uncomfortable because she is fetishizing you and only like you because you are Asian? Is it uncomfortable because she may have stereotyped you and falsely thought you would have shared interests as her? 

Either way, imo just be honest, articulate, and direct about what is it that's bothering you."
"Her asking me **if my shower can fit two people**, and me responding with ""uhh yeah probably. Why don't you shower first and I'll go after you""

WHOOSH--straight over my head

The same girl also caught me looking at a ""send nudes"" meme and said ""if you want them you can just ask"" and I just totally missed it in the moment. Both of these occurred within a 48 hour timeframe


EDIT: another girl i was texting late at night, who I told I was going to sleep, texted me ""I can send you something that will keep you awake"". I responded saying something about how I was going to sleep because i was exhausted. *WHOOSH*"
"I think my gf is super hot.  She took a long time to move to this stage with me, so not really a concern when other guys are into her.  In fact it's kinda hot that she's desired."
"Her vicious temper. Most people never realize that kitten is constantly seething with a dark, hateful rage. It's carefully hidden behind a facade of quiet."
"&gt; I'm guess I'm literally hitler at this point.

Even hitler had a girlfriend"
She was backing upto me in bed while we were watching Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. I ignored the fuck outta her because the only horn that was getting blown was the Horn of Helm Hammerhand and nobody was interrupting that. My facebook group chat name is two towers now since my friends found out.
"Hey thanks, we actualy did this but the police said we don't have evidence so they can't help us. But from their expression, I don't think they were interested in helping us. "
" 12, I called her my girlfriend, and she called me her boyfriend, though I don't know if that counts.

Same girl, but my first ""real"" relationship with her started when I was 17.

I don't really think there is a proper age for having your first one. It really depends on who you were/still are in your teens and early 20s."
"Out in public she's very quiet, reserved even. At home or in a group of friends she's very animated and rambunctious. One of my favorite funny moments is when I'm doing something, cooking, cleaning, whatever she'll grab my face and yell ""Why aren't you paying attention to me!?"" I don't know why but I find it incredibly cute. Or she'll yell from the other room ""Babe! Why aren't your roommates paying attention to me!?""

Edit: To clarify, she's an entirely independent individual and often we are doing our own things and are in our own worlds when we're together. She doesn't constantly need attention or she'll die. It's become more of an inside joke between us and our friend group because she was the shy one when we all met and no one really paid attention to her because of it."
"&gt; [...] how did your SO react when you told them about it?

I haven't even moved past dating yet because of it. No matter how well things seem to be going, every time I tell a woman about my schizophrenia before making things official, they vanish so damn fast I wonder if they were even there in the first place (dark pun intended). It doesn't seem to matter how well I'm doing and how much I've learned to live it, they just never give you a chance."
"Well for starters, don't date people who are off their damn gourd and *certainly* don't move in with them."
"Ohhhh, gotcha. We're just waiting for her visa application to get approved. "
"In her professional life, she's very much a mix of the flawless lady and of a very tough cookie. She's elegant, yes; she radiates that sort of charm that one turns on and off like a lightswitch; she can be very gracious; but she's not warm-hearted or playful or very caring at all.

Around friends, she tends to be more caring, funnier and more cheekily so, and very generous; but several personality traits I consider her most attractive she reserves for the relationship:

Above all, her incredible capacity for gentleness. Her capacity for caring and warmth. Her knack for very unladylike silliness. Her sensual, seductive side. Her fondness for half innocent, half elfish playfulness. Her enjoyment of ""breaking character"" as it were and dropping a very naughty or very rude bombshell out of nowhere.

But I am also the only one who gets to see shades of her character that she considers her greatest flaws, and which she keeps under wraps from everyone else, because she is very prideful: 

I'm the only person past her childhood who has seen her cry. I'm the only person around whom she's cry-yelled. I'm the only one who knows what she's like when she's afraid. And I'm the only person who knows how horrifically lazy and slovenly she can be - her colleagues at work would be shocked to see ""this prim and hard-nosed lady"" wanting to be carried from the couch to the bed because she's too lazy to get on her feet."
"This.  
  
I'm 24 and never had one. I date around but never did the girlfriend thing. Looking at my friends it always seems like more trouble than it's worth. Don't feel pressured to have a girlfriend dude. You do you. "
Does she like OTHER things about you?
"At 13 I got my first girlfriend, we dated until we were 15-16 years old, lost our virginities to one another, we were young and it was so wrong, after the break up we remained close friends, 8 years later we got married and had 2 kids. "
Of course! Who doesn't like that? I like to be touched and kissed everywhere. Feels amazing. I'm not made of just dick.
"It was a few years ago when I was at uni. Me and this girl I was obsessed with were eating at Nando's and we were the only people downstairs.

**Her:** ""Have you noticed, we're the *only ones down here*""

**Me:** ""Yeah, I was just thinking that. I'm surprised it's so quiet""

**Her:** ""They probably thought we were on a date and wanted to give us a bit of... privacy""

**Me:** ""Ha, you're probably right actually""

**Her:** ""It's weird to think that we could get up to all sorts down here. Like, we could start making out and nobody would even know""

**Me:** ""Yeah, I guess that's kind of weird"" ^Really? ^Weird? ^More ^like ^AMAZING, ^she ^has ^no ^idea ^how ^much ^I'd ^love ^that...

**Her:** ""You could literally lean across the table and kiss me and nobody would see""

**Me:** ""Well, yeah, everyone's upstairs"" ^God, ^I ^wish ^I ^could ^but ^probably ^totally ^inappropriate. ^I ^bet ^she ^doesn't ^like ^me ^in ^that ^way

*Chicken eating continues, we chat some more, finish our food and leave.*"
Depends why. Same with men. My friend doesn't have social media because he can't be bothered with it. I've known someone who didn't have it because it was harming society and he was better than everyone for not using it blah blah. 
"he really trusts you.

-shy man"
"Daww this is so cute

There really isn't a wrong answer here buddy, the point of the date is to hang out. So as long as you two are with each other then that's perfect. Myself personally, I like activities and dates where we can chat. So I don't really enjoy going to the movies for a date in that regard. 

If money isn't an issue, activities which have a little bit of competition can be fun (mini golf, bowling, etc). But a more intimate hang out at the mall or at a park is perfectly ok too

Best of luck buddy"
"This is really inspirational. I'm happy everything worked out. 

You deserve all dem blessings "
"19  because she was the first girl to like me. 

Percentage of girls I liked first that liked me back: 0%

Percentage of girls who liked me first that I liked back: 100%"
"Your cops are fucking idiots then. Just try to keep an eye out for craigslist listings or pawn shops and see if they turn up there. Pawn shops will typically inform police if someone comes in with stolen goods. 

EDIT: If you have reciepts with serial numbers, or adoption/purchase papers for the cat with his name and his name only on them take that to the police and inform them exactly of what you can prove is his.  Also, use Find your iPad and show that to the police. Maybe keep trickling this information and informing them every day of a new recipt or bit of info every day to keep it fresh in their mind, but I wouldn't be too sure of this last part to be honest."
"It's more trouble than it's worth until it's worth more than the trouble. And when that happens you'll know, and it will happen. You can't force it, it just kind of happens. And for different people it happens at different times."
Dude. Come on.
"My boyfriend is incredibly shy. Nobody understands how we're together, even my parents. I'm super outgoing, talkative, and can strike up a conversation with everyone. He has trouble contributing to a conversation even if you're trying to pull it out of him. 

However when we're alone he is the most talkative, goofy person I've ever met. He talks my ear off about anything that pops into his head, practically has an opinion about everything. "
"I'm 26 and never had one so I'm guess I'm literally hitler at this point. Honestly, there's no age where you should have one, but if you want one, you should go out and make it happen. It's my understanding that not having had one by my age is a huge black mark against me. If I were you, I would try not to reach that point."
"Also with pacing make sure to order/get some food or a glass of water between drinks.

Staying hydrated helps a ton."
"Nobody knows it, but she's got a secret smile and she uses it only for me. "
"Constant communication, complete honesty, lots of hard fucking.

edit: Also, you have to make your partner a priority. Don't fall into the habit of just ignoring each other in favor of phones or TV or games or whatever the fuck else it is people in failed marriages do. Work on your shit on your own, and together. Apologize early and often. Seek independence where you can so you don't forget to be your own person too.

Above all else, make the decision to love each other. Without that, shit ain't gonna work."
"I do this all the time,  especially when my opinion doesn't fit the Redd it circle jerk."
"My wife too! I was telling her how I was the Goofy and she was the Minnie in our relationship and she goes, in her cute French Moroccan accent, ""If you are Goofy then I am Goofah."" I love and miss her. "
A break means its over.
"If I see them do something productive about it rather than just sit at home and wallow. That can be getting therapy, seeing a doctor, taking medication, etc. I want to see them fight back against it rather than lay down and die. They don't necessarily need to be winning, but they need to be in the fight. That is the bare minimum of what I would need to see to ever date someone like this again."
Dude we thought she's ded.
Ask my gf if we could have a threeway
This guy's got the right of it. Use your mouth words. 
"whoa there, watch your language. The correct term today in America is ""Washington Red Skins"""
"Call her damn parents, she's acting like a child having a temper tantrum. "
The difference between a girl friend that you just want to be platonic with and one you want to hump is what they look like.
"Similar thing happened to me except I messed it up the first time around but have learned my lesson and am in a much better place now (without the resentment and jealousy) with this new girl.

What helps is realizing that she has received that extra attention for a very long time and that she's used to it, she has habituated. While I was not used to the having guys constantly coming up and trying to make a scene to get to her, or bad mouthing me, constantly hitting on my girlfriend. For her it's a nuisance and she has learned to recognize authenticity from people. If she wanted to be with anyone else, she would be. I know I'm not anywhere near the top 10% of guys in terms of looks, but I am one of the most honest, passionate, adventurous people I know who's had amazing opportunities doing what I love. That's why she picks me and she pushes me to keep becoming better. She sees something in me and she is somebody amazing that I will cherish whatever time we have together since she is not just beautiful but intelligent, challenges me, caring, and authentic person i know."
"My wife is a super focused type A career woman.  Extremely organized, manages a large staff, routinely oversees assets in the nine figure range.  She doesn't tolerate incompetence and is well known and well respected in her field as the go-to person to get shit done on time, every time.  

Behind closed doors, she's extremely submissive.  She doesn't want to make any decisions; she wants Daddy to tie her up, use her, hurt her, push her limits, then take care of her.  It took her years to discover and embrace this part of her personality, and I'm the only one who gets to experience it.  "
What if she says reddit?
"I literally wanted to meet her cause I heard she had a great butt. I ended up wanting her cause she had a great personality.

**Edit:** I should probably throw a little more honesty in here while I'm at it. What I said was true, yes; but the woman isn't my SO anymore. 3.5 years and we ended it back in January. Now she's with my ~~best friend~~ used to be friend so oh well. But I figured I'd share this cause it's something that really happened to me."
"""Oh I don't use social media"" is becoming the new ""I don't even own a TV!"""
"Same. If I think she's hot and I like her as a friend, there's usually no reason I wouldn't also want to date her/sleep with her etc."
"&gt; most men aren't emotionally open with their male friends while women tend to be more emotionally open

Never understood this. I can never open up to a platonic female friend but sharing my problems with a close male friend is easy for me. I feel opening up to a girl who isn't emotionally vested in you is a disaster and makes you look weak. "
A perfect analogy for marriage
"It was an ex, but for a good few years I went through this. I didn't mind at all, because I knew she was coming home to me at night.

Until she didn't that one time. Oh well, such is life. At least I can say I nailed a perfect 10 a LOT."
"Yes depending on how she handles it. If she is taking care of herself and is attempting to make changes despite struggling, I will be okay with that. If she is going to use me to ""fix"" herself or her problems, then I want no part of it. 

I struggle myself with depression and anxiety, I know we need to be loved too. But I will not be someone's crutch or let them rely on me because that isn't healthy for a relationship. 

"
"Schizophrenia is probably one of the harder ones to deal with. It can be unpredictable, it's mysterious and scary, and the media certainly doesn't help. I hope the best for you. "
"You don't subtly reject someone if they keep making advances.

You have to directly reject them."
"My wife is smoking hot. She's also registers a bit on the autism scale and absolutely HATES people trying to touch her, being in her personal space, or just looking at her too much...except for me for some reason. I basically laugh my ass off whenever I see someone trying to hit on her in public because she gets so mad. 

I have no idea why I'm the exception. I lucked out. I love her to death."
"As a female I can't agree with this any more strongly. I went through a major physical transformation and the attention I received on the other end was awful. I realized that I wasn't gaining more friends or more access to the world by being beautiful, I was being swamped with people who only wanted to use me for superficial reasons. It made me RESENT everyone, ESPECIALLY the ones who would try to hit on me. And people are terrifyingly good at faking it to get what they want, I felt I couldn't trust anyone. Entering new relationships is terrifying because the entire beginning turns into a russian roulette game of finding out if they were genuine. So when you do finally find that person who sees the real you, who sees the real value in you, who you also see and connect with... there is nothing in the world that can replace that. Bodies are a penny a dozen, and so are creeps who will use you. If she gave you the chance, you're a rare treasure in her eyes.

Also, please don't be self-conscious about your physical appearance.. Let's be honest with ourselves, if we find someone so offensively physically repulsive to our personal preferences, we cannot bring ourselves to pursue them no matter how nice of a person they are. If she gave you a chance she is already happy with how you look. My boyfriend insults himself all the time, and maybe he doesn't have the conventional hot bod, but it makes me sad because I find him so damn incredibly attractive. Irresistable. I know other people may see him differently and I'm not blind to it, but to me he may as well be Zeus, cause the pedestal I see him on can't get any higher. "
I usually just wear something low cut and go to Bed Bath and Beyond
"But that's what makes Predator so good in comparison! Even if you don't like it (which would be hard to believe) it's over in a couple of hours. And then you can do something else, like sleep in peace."
"Huh. That didn't end like I expected
"
"&gt; I'm not made of just dick.

But what if you were though? Imagine if every time someone started like rubbing against you or you got nervous or any of that you would suddenly grow to twice your size. Hiding a boner would be so much harder."
"Years ago... Was sitting on the couch watching a movie with a close friend. She snuggles close and is practically laying on me. I don't notice.
She complains she is warm and takes off her cardigan and then lays on me even more. Still don't notice. 
She starts stroking my thigh. Still oblivious.
Housemate gets home from work and sees what's happening and quickly retires to his room to give us space and gives me thumbs up as he leaves us alone in the lounge. I don't understand what the thumbs up is for and brush it off. 
She spills coke on my lap. I pause movie and excuse myself to change out of wet pants. She offers to help. Still oblivious I decline help and change in my room.
Return to lounge and finish movie and she seems distant. She leaves and housemate comes out of room surprised she is gone.

I tell him what happened and he tells me what a moron I am... I died a little inside that night."
I'm a lazy slob and I hate people. Keeps things simple.
"Currently in the process of falling for a close friend. We're in the same friend circle but lately we've been hanging just the two of us which never happened. Got the courage to ask her to eat dinner with me alone just the two of us. She was testing the water asking if we're inviting others to which I said we're not and I rather spend my time with her alone. I didn't make my intentions clear that it was going to be a date so I treated her like how I would eat dinner alone with a friend. I think she was also confused whether it was a date or hanging out because she seemed more nervous than before when i saw her, and so was I. Kinda regret it that I didn't make my intentions clear but I will definitely do so when another opportunity arises. The question is when that opportunity will come. I'm fairly confident she likes me and we have huge chemistry. The only thing holding me back is the 'what if' and the consequence if things don't go as planned as I don't want to lose her. "
"He was one of my best friends for a while and he was dating a different girl. After they broke up one time he saw me and said ""alphonse1121! My favorite person in the world!!"" In front of all our friends. It was a little awkward at the time and I think he was embarrassed but that was the first time I considered being more than just friends. I am so happy I did. He treats me like a queen and he is still my best friend. We're getting married in 8 months and we are very very happy. 

Edit: sorry didn't realize this was ask men, but hope this helps anyway. "
This is actually painful. 
"I'm a girl but I'm glad to finally hear someone express how I feel about social media! I get asked ""why"" but could never quite put it into words, lol."
"me either, help "
They're almost never *really* one of the boys and are treated differently. They are often offended if treated like other men. They're often interested in being the only woman around and are themselves often the problem it female relationships.
"Someone I briefly dated actually told me what made the 'switch' for her. 

We had a lot of freshmen classes together and became friends. She had just moved from her home country and during the first year of uni broke up with her boyfriend back home, unable to cope with the distance. She was devastated and sad for a long time. We were in a group project together, along with two other friends/classmates and I had invited them to my apartment to finish up. It got late, and she hadn't brought a jacket or sweatshirt. She said she was going to be fine, but I insisted that she borrow one of mine, and that I could just get it back in class the next day. 

Apparently that gesture was what it took. We had had other small moments while she was single, including eating pizza together on Valentine's Day after a late night class, but she told me that lending her a jacket was what it took. 

We dated for a week. She then got back together with her ex, and they are now living together.  "
"Honestly, it wasn't a big deal to me.  She was/is super hot.  So yes, she gets hit on, sometimes even by my ""friends"".  I don't really worry about it.  She is extremely loyal - as am I.  We both know how to turn down someone and have had to do it. 

She has this look she gives someone when they cross a line that just dead stops all conversation.  For lack of a better description it is the look one would give to rotting road kill if that road kill tried to ask you out.  All of my family has seen her give that look to at least one person and they think it is the funniest thing in the world.

Plus, she has what we call in our house a great ""resting bitch face"" that makes her far less approachable than many women.  She knows it and rocks it whenever she doesn't want attention.  

As I said, she can take care of her self.  She doesn't need me worrying about it."
"Hey, NSFW tag buddy!"
"18, in college. I went to an all-boys high school and never felt any kind of pressure to date; I was also busy with sports and other extracurriculars, so it wasn't like I was bored. It probably didn't help that I *hated* parties and hadn't figured out how to deal with them by that point.

(Edited for grammar)"
"As far as possible reasons for missing her go, that's happier than some other possibilities!

Hopefully it gets approved nice and quickly!"
"My girl doesn't react to anything sexual. Jokes, flirtation, nothing, in public. It's like it doesn't even exist. She'll outright give you a blank stare or dead eyes. Even at a comedy venue. It's like it ceases to exist as a stimulus.

She's by far the freakiest in my bedroom I've had in quite a while. Alone she's raunchy as holy fuck, enough that sometimes I feel too PC.

I do find this a great thing and also a really attractive thing. I love it. It's just such an amazing dichotomy though."
Sex is literally a release.
"There's two general types and girls can fall in between and obviously not fit in them. But generalisations are there for a reason. One has been mentioned here.

One is the girl who likes the attention she gets from all the guys, says she hates drama and other girls but may cause a fair bit, can't stand it if another girl comes along especially if they're a girlfriend of one of the guys. 

The others a genuine tomboy who just doesn't fit in with women, who can match you for drinking you under the table, weirdly gets you to open up in ways you wouldn't with your bros, teaches you all about women and how to communicate and feel.

I, uh, may have both of these types of women in my life. "
"A few months after I turned 21 and had started chasing after this girl. She was opposed for a long time, even though we were hanging around each other a ton -- not doing anything but enjoying eachother's company, and kept telling me "" i can't be your girl "". I eventually just was like ""if you're not my girlfriend, and i want a girlfriend, I guess i'll take other girls on dates?"" and all of a sudden she was like ""f that, update your profile"". Thus began ~4 pretty great years."
Most cops act this way. It's not rare

"I had one experience where I was out with a girl and she asked *me* if I wanted to get out of there. I lived closer to the bar, so we went to my apartment where she asked me to make eggs (we bonded over food, and I had talked up my cooking). I made her French style scrambled eggs with toast and roasted tomatoes, which she devoured. When she finished, she thanked me and went home.

So yes, sometimes it does not result in sex."

"I recently split from my SO but I think it's applicable. In public he was charismatic, a people pleaser, always ensuring everyone was comfortable and welcomed. He formed friendships easily and behaved like he was proud to have me by his side, such as bringing me to dates with friends and family. He was so caring, warm, charismatic, loving.

But nobody got to see that when he and I were alone that he became cold and disregarded me as a person worthy to put effort into pleasing. Instead of building me up, he would tear me down, ignore me for days.

The man they saw and still see is the charismatic projection up on the screen. What they didn't see is the true monster when the lights came on."
"Girl came from America to study for a short period in my country. Matched on tinder and unusually for me I actually genuinely loved talking to her. I spoke to her for about a month before I actually even went on a date with her. 

This girl was amazing. Meet her. Instantly sexually attractive to me in a major way. Fucked first date. Well, before the first date technically. Take her out and we have such a surreal and amazing date. I couldn't believe how cool, *smart* and funny she was. She was a match for sure. She was like a female version of me. Went back and she banged my brains out. We constantly fucked. 

I really fell for her. We really got close. We practically lived together later on. Did everything together. Cooked, cleaned, chatted, went out for dinner, got hammered, sometimes I fell asleep with her petting my hair and I would wake up and see her just looking at me smiling. Wasn't weird it was oddly comforting. 

We pretty much ignored the timeline of her having to go back home. We just pretended it wasn't happening. We were really happy and we didn't want to spoil the illusion. She went to my father's wedding, we spent Christmas together and eat not only hot dogs (we just had them in the fridge and I was slightly hungover, sue me) and steak for breakfast. We danced around the apartment and had the weirdest fucking jokes ever that would only make sense to us. I once shouted down like Scrooge around Christmas time and said ""You there, what day is this!"" and I never let myself as loose as I did around her. 

She knew me. Nobody knows me how she does. 

When we were at a party with my friends, on an impromptu bed on the floor, she started sort of sobbing and I initially thought it was the alcohol, we played a heavy drinking game and I was absolutely hammered myself. But then she just told me she loved me. I couldn't believe it. Just. Couldn't. About a week before I wanted to tell her I did but I couldn't. I am always weird about feelings and things but she fucking got me. 

I remember a few days before she was set to leave. I was on the stairs just looking at her and I started tearing up because it was hitting me that she was going to leave and she just put her arms around me and put her forehead on mine and said that I can't cry because she would too. Then we got kick-ass pizza at our local. 

One of our last night's we spent together was in my new place. We fucked and I just held her close and whispered I love you when I came and just held her afterwards. Never been as open as that. 

When it came to her going away we got in the taxi and kept up the pretense. I was cheerful. She was smiling at me and took pictures of me. The moment I broke down was in the airport when she was buying sandwiches and I just thought this is it. She's going. And I started crying and didn't give a damn about anyone looking. 

The time sped up so quickly and we were crying on and off. We walked to her gate and I think we just lost it there and then. She looked at me and her face had a lot of hurt on it. I imagine I looked the same. I hugged her and she dug her chin into my shoulder and I cried so hard. The tears flowed. I was losing a soul mate. We just stood there and I didn't want to let her go. It was tragic. 

When the last moment came she told me she loved me and gave me one last squeeze. I watched her in her line until she was lost from view and I stood there for far longer than I'm willing to admit. Crying. People saw me and just hurried on thankfully. I had a lot of tissues in my pocket from when we ate the sandwiches. 

I have a lot of her stuff with me that I took from her place she left behind. I didn't want to leave a single thing behind because it reminded me of her. I rang my best friend and asked could he pick me up because we live close by and he laughed and said sure if I pay him. When he saw me he didn't ask for any money and he stayed with me in my place for an hour while I had a shower and we didn't talk much. When she texted me she was on the plane and it was taking off I just stared out of the window and actually waved. 

That night I drank an entire bottle of whiskey and got so fucking drunk. I was miserable. I woke up hungover as fuck with a St Brenard on me and I just got a text from her telling me she landed and she missed me already. I didn't give a fuck that I was hungover and got so little sleep I just wanted to hear from her. 

It was the wrong time and the wrong place, with the right people."

She emailed me her number and 2.5hrs later we were in bed. I thought it was a physical thing but it grew into a supportive and honest friendship.

You being Asian can be *a* reason to like you, but it cannot be *the* reason she likes you. If that is the case then she's racially fetishizing you, which is just wrong. 

In order to figure this out, the easiest thing to do is sit down calmly with her and discuss it. Find out if she likes anything else about you. Don't hesitate: be gentle but firm.

"I was sexually abused as a child. Between that, and a religious upbringing, I was pretty reserved and uncomfortable about sex when I went to college.

This didn't end well for me. There were a couple girls  in my extended group of friends who crossed the line all the time- one thought it was hilarious seeing how easily she could make me uncomfortable.

Most horrifying though? Getting drugged. I don't know about you, but beer doesn't normally cause tingling, partial paralysis and an 8-hour long erection. I was so far out of it I needed help standing up, much less walking back to my dorm.
She seems to have thought I was just wound up too tight and needed help overcoming my inhibitions, and this was the way to do it.
It's not blood and shit, but not being in control of my body while she did whatever she wanted with it was also horrifying."
That unfortunately relies more on personality and behavior than it does on attractiveness.  Lots of average dudes get laid constantly and lots of attractive guys are too shy to meet women.

"36 years here.

For us I think the suggestions sound remarkably simple, but from my experience too many couples don't do what we do.

Here's my ""as much as possible list"":

* Got to bed at the same time and get up together
* Sleep naked
* Eat meals together, especially dinner
* Have time together every day, especially at the end of the day
* Go out together weekly
* Check in during the day, even just a quick call or text

And this seemingly contradictory advice:

* Give each other permission to do things on their own

"Let me share something with you kid.

This is good advice for meeting girls, for dating girls, and for just about everything else in the goddamn world.

Kiss. K.I.S.S. Keep It Simple, Stupid.

You want to know how to go introduce yourself to a girl? Don't go for grand gestures that can go wrong, get misinterpreted, or just make you look like either an overacheiver or a creep. Keep it simple. 

Walk over, introduce yourself, say hi, go from there. 

It is really that easy.

Or you could orchestrate some crappy romantic-comedy scenario, with music and flowers and chocolates (really? Chocolates? What if she's on a diet, what if she's allergic to peanuts? What if that reminds her of her ex-boyfriend she just had to leave in whatever godforsaken place she just left? So much to go wrong there) and one of two things will happen.

The least likely....everything goes off without a hitch, and you get the happy ending hollywood bullshit fade to black intro, right? She falls into your arms, magically in love with you because of chocolate or some such shit?

Or far more likely, it's seen as reaching a bit too far, coming on too strong, maybe she just don't like chocolate? 

Gaw. Just go talk to her. 

Like now, because now I'm feeling like you've probably been overthinking this whole thing, and you're in danger of sitting on your couch dreaming up a thousand different ways that this meeting between the two of you ends up with the two of you doing the horizontal tango in your Star-Wars themed twin bed, and the reality is that while you're busy dreaming and not getting up off your couch, she's probably out there making new friends and moving on with her life.

For fucks sake man, she's your neighbor, right? So go be neighborly!

The reality is that she might not be into you, or maybe she has a boyfriend...fuck man, maybe she has a girlfriend....but she don't have a nieghbor yet...because you haven't gone over and introduced yourself!

I'm thinking the most likely scenario here is that you end up with a new friend, even if it's just one of the casual variety, but is that so bad? You got so many friends you don't have time for another? Get out there. Go. Now. 

Come back and let us know how it went.

"My ex wife years ago. I convinced her that guys with beer bellies have lower IQ's than guys without. Because the pressure of all that weight pushing the belly skin out also caused a suction on the cranial cavity, thereby causing the brain not to function properly. She believed me and I pretty much forgot about it.
Until several months later she was in LVN school and came home all angry and pissy one day. Turns out she had told her whole nursing class this information during a discussion and now they all think she is an idiot. She was mad at me for days and I couldn't stop giggling about it.

"I was at the club. Club was quiet.

Chatting to a lass I was acquainted to.  We agreed the club was boring, I suggested we grab a bottle of whisky and grab tunes at my place.

Chatting for hours drank mlst of the bottle, played cards, awesome. 

I took her hand and she said, 'You should know I'm not looking for a relationship. '

Somehow that translated through the whisky as, 'I don't want sex tonight' and she ended up crashing on the couch.

"If I really like a girl on a first date, I won't sleep with her that night.

In the past, my relationships with women I've slept with on the first date never went anywhere, so around my mid 20's, I subconsciously developed this rule that if I really like a girl, I wait until the 2nd or 3rd date to get physical.  If I sleep with a girl on a first date, it means I don't see us being anything more than hook up buddies or a ONS.

So me denying physical advances on the first date is actually a sign that I'm romantically interested.  My current girlfriend was kind of thrown off by it, but hey, we've been dating for over a year and a half, so I can't knock my method."

"Same old, everyday story here in America.  Do you know what the term ""ex parte"" means?  It means that a judge or a magistrate hears only one side of a case and makes a decision based on that.  In this case, the judge literally issued a restraining order based on nothing more than my diagnosis of PTSD.  restraining orders are issued on the flimsiest of evidence, getting a roll of toilet paper requires more effort.

So, with me completely unaware moments before, 4 armed police officers showed up at my door and gave me 10 minutes to leave. 10 minutes to gather the important parts of your entire life up to that point.  There is no way you will get everything that is important, and you will never be allowed to return.  Women use it to gain the tactical edge in divorce, and as a man, you basically never recover.

It's why I always tell men to have a complete backup of all records kept up to date stored in a location away from your home if you have a woman living with you.  Also, have enough to either reboot your life or stuff in storage so that you don't have to completely start over.  Preferably, only live in a home with only your name on the lease or loan, it may take some time to evict her, but at least you can.  If you have firearms, have a good trustworthy friend that you can drop them with, if you need.  Preferably don't marry, and watch her like a hawk, if she starts showing consistent signs of being unhappy, then it really is best if she is unhappy elsewhere.  I know this sounds cold and mistrustful, but you have to protect yourself, the police are not your friends, the court is not your friend.  Don't end up at 36 years old knocked all the way back to nothing."

"I had to scroll pretty far to find this answer. There will always be outliers but it just seems impractical, antisocial, and outdated to not use it.

The people I know that don't use it are ~~all~~ **mostly** pretty bad at maintaining friendships and communicating about their lives. So, of course it makes sense that they don't use it.

On a fundamental level I don't care but the reality is that everyone I know in their 30s that doesn't use it is kind of antisocial. It raises some red flags for me if they are under 40 and don't use it at all (I'm 33). I don't feel like the people I'm thinking of really make up for Facebook's absence through other more traditional social interactions.

There's also a bit of a hive mind on Reddit about being anti-Facebook so I'm not sure this is the best place to ask this question and get the general opinion of guys.

**Edit:** Something I wanted to add in response to OP's post: not all social media activity is vapid selfy bullshit. I have a friend that posts really funny and intelligent questions or observations and there's always a really terrific conversation on FB about that. Another friend has a Game of Thrones thread on FB every Sunday night that gets like 100 comments every week. It's not entirely worthless fluff, it just depends on how you use it and who you choose to connect with.  

There are also a lot of FB groups that have a lot of worth. I was conceived through anonymous sperm donation and have found the Facebook group's dedicated to this really helpful over the past few years as I have found out and connected with others via DNA tests. It's a great support system and resource."

It is the age more than anything, at 12 we didn't comprehend what a relationship really entailed, at 17 of course its different."

Turns out that she was into something alongside the lines of titty-torture/extreme painplay or something of that sort and would regularly get her breasts/vagina caned and whipped. I ended up finishing by just focusing on her face, but the entire thing was just so sudden and extreme for me that her abused breasts are still somewhat burned into my memory."

"I think the point is that a lot of men who haven't lived with many women seem to have this false idea that women are always extremely tidy (maybe we get it from our mothers, I dunno) and they're unpleasantly surprised when they end up living with a woman who's a slob.

"Ah, no.

I've said that numerous times, but only in reference to ""this scene is dead, let's change locations"".

To be fair, half the time it's answered with ""your place?"" Or, ""my place?"", Or ""your place or mine?""

But the other half it's an understanding that, yeah, this place is getting boring, let's do something fun *elsewhere*. A walk in the park, another venue, maybe Chow down, whatever. I never intend for it to mean ""let's call it a night"" because I say that if I intend to call it quits for the night.

Context is huge, I would base it off that more than a simple phrase.

There are obviously exceptions. Netflix and chill is still used frequently, and it's meaning is very well proliferated.

Then again, I am rather exacting in my words. I prefer no more than one level of plausible deniability. If I want to fuck you, you'd know it before then. Because I'd tell you. My entire dating and sexual history, bluntness has been overwhelmingly effective. So I stick to it."
The fact that I can relate hurts just a bit.
This comment is hilarious after that edit.

"&gt;whenever I am in a social setting with females I go out of my way to mind what I say and my manners.

It'll be this. People can tell when you're ""too much persona"" and it makes them uncomfortable. Personally I think women have a better nose for this than men - they know when men are not being themselves in order to ingratiate themselves and they don't like it. 

You should compare how you act around people you're comfortable with to how you act around people you are uncomfortable with. It's fairly likely that if the former group like you when you're being you, then a good number of the latter will too. You won't be likeable to everyone though, you must accept that you won't be everyone's cup of tea and that is the price you have to pay to develop a persona that is neither too unfiltered you-ness or too overly contrived fakeness.

This is not an easy process, however it is mostly achieved by paying attention to people's reactions to you and fine-tuning your persona and adjusting it, then seeing how people respond. It'll take a while, but you'll figure it out eventually. This is basic socialisation, really - I feel really sorry for poorly socialised adults because they're essentially social cripples who can't fully enjoy the best parts of being part of a very social species. This subreddit is bursting at the seems with poorly socialised OP's, who would really benefit from some fine tuning of being and persona."

"Shitty cultures. I dont care how the liberal media, SJWs and feminists try to spin it, a lot of countries with majority muslims have shitty cultures. Between their treatment of women, their treatment of homosexuals, their treatment of non-muslims and apostates and their treatment of anyone they see as less than themselves, like black people or people from the car east, they are generally just shitty. And when they come here to western countries, it is not cultural enrichment, it is cultural  degradation. 

I am not speaking from a position of ignorance either. I have travelled extensively in the middle east and have seen first hand how they treat the people i mentioned. I am absolutely fine with muslims living here, although i think islam is just as much bullshit as every other religion, but they can leave leave their fucked up 3rf world cultures where they came from and integrate like everyone else."

"I've never been to prison (in the US that's where you go after you've been convicted of a serious crime and sentenced to 1 year or more) but I have been arrested and spent a couple of days in jail before I was bailed out. 

Why was I arrested? Some asshole decided to spoof my phone number in order to swat people (make fake 911 calls.) When the cops arrived at my place to ask questions I told them I wouldn't talk to them without a lawyer because I know how easy it is to fuck yourself over by talking to the cops. They decided they'd just charge me with the crime &amp; have me arrested even though they had no proof that I'd done anything. 

I live in Baltimore so jail *sucked.* The place was disgusting and filthy on the inside and everything moved at the speed of molasses. It took me about 30 hours to end up in front of a judge, and another 10 or so hours to actually be released after she said I was to be let out on my own recognizance. 

There were some scary seeming dudes in there, but most of the inmates seemed more like knuckleheads rather than hardcore sociopaths. I never witnessed any violence and no one tried to rape me, extort me for money or anything like that. The worst parts of jail were probably the mind-numbing boredom and not knowing what would happen to me. Even after the judge ordered me released I was scared that incompetent prison staff would lose my file or something like that. 

One of the most cliche pieces of advice you'll see on TV shows about jail is ""mind your own business,"" and that served me very well. I didn't ask anyone about why they were there and I made sure to do nothing that would make me stand out. "

Of course women care about the appearance of their bf, she just cares about a lot of other stuff about you too.

The key point though is that we love each other and we have more in our relationship than how we both look.

"I once read this reddit comment that told the story of a man who had a collection of small value but it was important to him none the less. As it became apparent that divorce was in the cards for the man and his wife, his collection (located in the basement) started to shrink as it was being loaned out to friends of his for safe keeping. When the man presented the wife with divorce papers, sure enough, she grabbed a baseball bat and headed to the basement but there was nothing remaining of the collection for her to destroy. The lesson is pretty easy to follow, if you see the relationship headed south, move your shit.

In the instance of an argument that spirals out of control leading to a break up, if it is a true cohabitation situation with both parties on the lease, keeping your wits about you is the most important thing. Grab as much of your stuff as possible and fill up your car. Yeah, you probably can't grab the TV but you can grab the receipt box (if you have one) and you can take a lot of pics with your phone on your way out the door.

If you are the dumper and it is your place (no tenants rights to worry about), even if you are for sure done with the relationship, you don't have to *say* that you are. In fact save anything mean spirited or down right cruel, any final nails in the coffin for a later date. Chances are, you're just angry in the moment and you might calm down. The time to call your ex a cunt is over drinks with your friends, later, when all your shit is secure. Not when you can trigger some sort of manic episode with all of your worldly possessions within arms reach. So end the relationship as if you either just need space or that you want to just move on as friends. Even if you were bitterly arguing moments before, be calm when it comes to the break up, you'll call him/her in 2 weeks and grab dinner.

If you can't see the new ex realistically surrendering the keys without a fight, don't bring it up. Let the ex vacate the premises and then call a locksmith right then and there. When clearer heads prevail, the ex might innocently enough want one or two items out of your apartment they feel are theirs, maybe not so innocently enough. Doesn't matter because you've got new locks and had a word with your landlord (and anyone else with access to your apartment) so they're not bamboozled with a sob story about being locked out while you're at work."

"This is common among people who are a bit socially anxious. The ""blank mind"" comes from a kind of freeze response if you're a bit nervous around other people. All of a sudden, you can't think of one thing to say.

Don't worry, this is normal for anyone who has a bit of anxiety socialising. I would suggest making sure you keep putting yourself into social situations, try to learn to relax and stay in the moment while you're there, and if you can't think of anything to say don't sweat it. It doesn't even really matter. Ask questions about other people, focus on their answers, after a while, if you relax enough, it's likely you will just spontaneously start thinking of things to say. "

"For a while it was fear of breaking her heart. She loves me more than probably anyone ever will. I mean just pure dedication, she treats me so well. 

I've been hanging around because I think I'm partly working through my own stuff. Someone gave me the advice that love is a choice, and I've adopted that as my mantra. There is an urge for someone new, mostly for the thrill of it. I don't know if that's the healthiest choice. I did the casual sex thing for a while before the relationship and eventually wasn't even really dating but just trying to pick up women. I look back on that time and yea I enjoyed my freedom but is that really who I want to be. Anyway a lot of questions. 

In the meantime I stick with her and there are intermittent periods of absolute joy. I'm starting to think that's what love is all about. You hang around, you make that commitment, for those times. And as a whole my life is healthier not chasing women all the time and just focusing on other stuff.

Anyway some rambling, as you can see I'm not still getting there. But I don't want to let her go, almost did before and massive regret. "
"Size is one for me. I don't often like to say it because of being told I'm body shaming or something, but I just prefer skinny women.

Also she has to be intelligent."
So sit there silently until I have a specific reason to talk to them or wait until they say something to me? Sounds like a solid plan.
"""I'm mad because you asked a friend to go to this event, but not me""

*I show her proof that I did ask, and she even finds the text on her phone*

""I'm still mad because you didn't try again"""
"A ton of time? I mean 24 minus 8ish of sleep minus 8 of work, leaving 8 hours. So now you have traveltime, grocery, all kinds of chores. Now if you have a active sociallife it's even harder to balance. I really think 20 hour work weeks should become the norm in a lot of work places 40 hours decreases productivity. "
"I love when it's a question like ""Would you rather date a girl into Backstreet Boys or NSYNC,"" and the flair is ""holy shit who cares."""
"You kind of gave away the punchline early there, friend."
"If you're not willing to risk losing her then don't bother dating her.  Sorry to be harsh but she deserves better.  If you want to be more than friends then tell her you want to see if you might ""work"" that way and give it a chance. Don't hedge bets on relationships, it's weak."
"Yesterday I think someone asked ""What do you not understand about women?"" (or something like that) and the flair said ""Everything"" and It made me chuckle."
"Got a bunch of toothless diseased peasants with shorn heads to look after it of course. What are you, common?"

"But with marriage you can do something else too, like sleep in peace forever."
"Yes.

On our fifth date, I told her I was a 21 year old virgin which was true.

She started crying because she had sex ""one time before"" she met me.

We fucked two months later and her personality changed before I took off the condom.

It turns out I was #16, and she was fucking #15 our entire relationship.

She told mutual friends I was too possessive because I was furious.

Classic manipulative cunt."
This guy doesn't fuck
This actually seems like something concrete OP can build off of
Sometimes when me and my GF are feelin' wild I like to pretend that I don't have a GF and I spend my Friday night masturbating alone in the dark and then silently weeping for 45 minutes.
