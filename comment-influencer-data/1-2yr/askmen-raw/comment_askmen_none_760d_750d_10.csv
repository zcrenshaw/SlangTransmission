"- Do you always seek to gain the upper hand in relationships/friendships? Must every exchange be advantageous to you?

- Are you conscious of how your words and actions might affect others?

- When people say ""no"" to you, how do you respond? Do you attempt to manipulate it into a ""yes""?

- Are you willing to admit to a fault? Even though you may not see how you might have hurt someone, do you at least try to see things from their perspective?

- Do you respect rules and boundaries? Or are they just made to be broken?

- Do you lie habitually? 

- Do you keep your promises as best you can? And if you are unable to, do you let the person know in advance that you will have to make it up to them?

- Do people who meet you generally respect you? This is not fully in your control but when multiple people have the same issues with you, it might be time to consider their perspective.

- How do you treat people who cannot directly benefit you in any way?

No one is perfect, and these are just some traits that can define a person. No one is always good or always bad, and situations can bring the worst out in people. But I think as long as we're striving to be a better person than we were yesterday, then that is admirable.

How do I become a good guy?

Edit - Thank you for the advice, fellow redditors. Some of you practice tough love, others are more reassuring with their comments, and others yet take a humorous path; I might be a bad guy, but that doesn't mean I am a [*bad* guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh4f8SUp-PU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=38) ( credit to u/begentlewithme for the link) - I will keep trying to improve and be the best me I can be."
"I have a strange comment. I always thought guys were too sensitive about their balls and the overreacted. About 3 weeks ago, after hot sex, I stood up and had this excruciating pain in my abdomen. I was on the bathroom floor, couldn't decide if I had to throw up, pee or shit myself. I had to take three hydrocodone 10s to finally breathe. About an hour later, the pain went away. I live in the Ozarks so going to the hospital is one of those things you second guess. Anyway, next day made an appointment with the doctor. Come to find out, I twisted an ovary. It bounced back into place. That is why the pain went away. According to my doctor, it is exactly what a man feels when getting kicked in the balls. Twisting an ovary is not common so not many women experience it. Let's just say I have a new appreciation for my husband's balls. "

"It's a little weird at first because you've seen it done by actors who may or may not actually like each other so you really have no idea. But you like her and she likes you enough to plant your lips together and sort of sandwich them together. And then you pull apart.  You can't stop smiling. That just happened. Then suddenly notice your breathe is a little funky and your lips are dry. But she's smiling too. A surge of courage takes you over so you grab her waist, pulling her close, and kiss her again. You're definitely doing it right this time. Your knees get weak. Your head is spinning like crazy. The taste of her gin and tonic fills your mouth. You can smell her lavender conditioner. Feel her pulse synchronizing with yours. Then it's over. She says goodnight and even though your body wants nothing more than to be invited up, you're relieved when she closes the door to her place leaving you outside with your own thoughts. It takes a while for your heart to stop racing and when it finally does  the crisp midnight air cools your flushed skin. You want to see her again, want another chance to just be close to her. Just this one time, you say, maybe it'll work out. 
'Maybe she'll be the last girl I ever kiss.' "

"A guy I once knew was responding to a gas leak, tried to squeeze through a traffic lighted junction, but didn't make it to the line in time and had to wait for a full rotation to green. Pulled up at the address, and the building blew up as he exited the vehicle. Had he have made it through the lights, he'd have been literally knocking on the door of a bomb as it went off. I don't believe he changed at all, and shrugged it off to being extremely fucking lucky."
"I'm only alive today because my girlfriend called out sick from work. I contracted viral meningitis in 2015. For those unaware, meningitis causes swelling of the blood-brain membrane, pushing it against the brain and not allowing it to vent heat. 

Essentially you just get a fever that keeps getting hotter and hotter until your brain cooks itself. My girlfriend coincidentally was also sick with some generic cold like symptoms and stayed home, calling paramedics when things got worse. I woke up in the hospital later that weekend post-spinal tap and with an iv in my arm.

I had attempted suicide the week prior. My girlfriend had talked me down, but I felt as though nothing had changed and was planning to try again. Actually nearly dying - seeing my friends and family at my bedside in the hospital and how concerned they were - it changed everything for me. Though the suicidal ideation hasn't gone away, I'm never going to try again.

Hit her in the face with a rolled up newspaper?
"Not me, but one of my neighbors.

Husband and wife were sleeping in their bed when their infant started crying. They both got out of bed to take care of the baby. While they were in the other room, a drunk driver drove through their front yard and crashed his car through the wall of their bedroom, ending up on top of the bed where they had been sleeping.

If the baby hadn't woken them both up, they would have both ended up under the front of his car.

Edit: This was in Florida (surprise). The wall was cinder block and drywall."

"Ugh...two good friends of mine. Separately, they're really cool people that are a blast to be around. Together, they're a nightmare. The girl CONSTANTLY nags the guy, belittles him in front of me and our friends and plays these little games; for example, he can be up doing something in the kitchen or whatever and she'll wait for him to sit back down to ask him to get her something (Seriously, I've caught her peek her head into the hallway to see if he's coming several times, the SECOND he comes back and sits down, ""babe, can you get me some juice?"").

I've been at their place when he's not there (our social circle is VERY close-knit, so it's not weird) and it's like a switch gets flipped when he walks in, she turns into a total bitch. On the guy's part, he's a doormat who keeps things bottled up and occasionally snaps at her for her bullshit and she LOSES it. He also flirts with other women constanly, but I can't really hold it against him, it must be nice to interact with someone pleasant once in a while when you're in his situation.

The rest of my group agrees they need to break up, but they won't. It's fucking bizarre."

"My cousin was suppose to have a job interview at the World Trade Center, but it was postponed that morning."
"Here's how I did it:

We had talked about getting married, and had looked at rings.  I got an idea of what she wanted and her ring size.

I then went - by myself - to order the ring.  She knew I was going to propose.  She didn't know when.  I had time (couple of months) to save up money to buy the ring, and when I proposed it was still a surprise."
"I was ""racist"" in the sense that I was a child that grew up in a white part of town with white friends that were racist.  I moved someplace and socialized more with people from different cultures and realized we're all just people.

For a while I lived the life of someone thinking they had a handle on racism, joined the ranks of people that agree that it's pretty much not a thing anymore, but then I started *actually talking* to my friends about racism and sexism, and I started listening to stories from them about their lives and about things that have happened to them recently.  Every one of my black, brown, and women friends had at least one truly fucked up story, and a million little ones.  This led me to learn about unconscious bias and I realized I'm still doing shit that I didn't realize.  So now I'm working on that, and on being a better ally to people that I care about."

As others have said this was sexual assault. But beyond that, the thread asked what embarrassing thing you've done. Not saying that your response doesn't belong here, I'm just hoping you don't feel like this was anything you did or should be ashamed of. She did this to you.

Hope you're feeling alright, and as someone else said, glad your gf was there for you :)

"I lost my T-ball teams baseball cap at Cedar Point. I refused to leave until we found it because my little kid mind knew that I wouldn't be allowed to play without it. A storm blew thrpugh and we sheltered in an arcade while we waited for my dad to come back.

When we left an hour later we came across the motel we had stayed at the night before but it didn't have a roof anymore.

When we got on the highway all we saw were tractor trailers and cars flung off the road. Evidently a tornado decided to ride our highway home like a slip n slide and we would have been driving on it if I hadn't thrown a fit about my lost baseball cap."

"Had a girl at a local music spot stalk me around the place. Wouldn't stop telling me about how great she is and how people should worship her. About how she's been clean from meth for months now which ""proves she's stronger than anyone else"". Stepped outside for a cigarette and she followed me out, surprised me by pushing me against a wall and trying to make out with me. Told me we should go into an alley nearby and fuck. When I pushed her off, she grabbed my packaged and squeezed. REALLY fucking hard. Only told my girlfriend and one other friend. Girlfriend understood it sucked and was cool about it and supportive. Friend laughed. I legit had bruised balls from this chick and thought about going to the ER from the pain. Haven't told anyone else since."

"You have a right to bodily autonomy. If you've told her you hate when she licks your face and she continues to do it, especially in scenarios you hate even more (like in public,) then you need to realize that you're allowed to get angry. 

Imagine a woman posting here saying ""My boyfriend keeps grabbing my breasts in public. I hate it, it makes me feel so gross. I tell him to stop but he won't! What can I do?"" How do you think people would react?

Perhaps your gf thinks she's being cute and *lol so random* but if this irritates you and makes you feel uncomfortable you need to seriously shut it down by saying ""Laura, please stop. It makes me super uncomfortable when you do that, and I'm not joking around."" 

Just because you're a man doesn't mean you have no right to say no. Boy power! 👊"
"When I was in an army barracks this one guy taught all of us about gold bond powder. One night out of relative silence I hear him yell BOOOND UP, followed by roughly 20 dudes repeating it throughout the hallway. I step into the hall to see every guy already lined up against the wall with their shorts pulled out away from their dicks leaving a perfect pocket for ball soothing powder. He proceeds to go down the line squeezing his bottle to launch a dusty white cloud of powder straight into each man's trouser trough all the while everyone is still screaming BOND UP. When he got to me he didn't show any indication that this was strange or that he was showing many of us something new. No explanations, just trust. Give or take 10 seconds after the plume of smoky powder engulfed my cock n taters, it felt as if a wintergreen mountain goat was gently blowing onto my scrotum from below. Tears of glee streamed down my face for I had discovered the secret to happy, itch-free balls. And with that ladies and gents, I bid you adieu.

Imagine a bowl of spaghetti sitting in front of you. Then imagine yourself smashing your face into the spaghetti while simultaneously slurping and choking on the spaghetti. That's what kissing is like.

"Split pee stream. When you first start peeing sometimes the stream comes out split into two streams and one almost always shoots outside the toilet bowl, usually onto your foot. It's not like you can stop peeing either so it's imperative that you take action quickly. 

Ladies, in case this ever happens while your man is letting you aim his peen from behind while he pees (I hear you like to try this out for fun) here's the emergency checklist. First, frantically adjust your aim and hope the spread isn't so wide that it's impossible to fit both streams in the bowl at the same time. During aim adjustment, increase pee pressure to try to unstick the urethra cheeks. If neither is working, the last resort is to use your fingers to peel the urethra cheeks open a bit. Always anticipate another aim adjustment when the streams reunite. 

Edit: Yes it's possible to stop peeing. I should have said it's difficult or uncomfortable to stop, but not impossible. How many reps/sets of kegels should I do? Do I need to drink a protein shake afterwards? I'm trying to get those suckers swole AF. "
He called the park office lost and found and they shipped my hat back 4 days later. Didn't even miss a game
"A word of caution:

A friend of mine is a Christian like yourself who dated a Christian girl and they both decided to wait until marriage to have sex. He got married at 20 or 21, thereabouts, but he soon discovered that his partner is essentially incompatible with him sexually. She never enjoyed the sex, they rarely had sex even to start with and it only got rarer, and eventually (after six years or so) she just straight out says ""I never want to have sex again, but I still love you and want to stay together.""

Now obviously this is a huge shock. Like most people, he believes sex is an important part of life and a stable relationship. He doesn't want to go the remaining 40+ years of his life without ever having sex, so he tries couples counselling, sex therapy, prayer, trying to make himself more attractive (working out more, etc.) but she's having *none* of it. Not interested, barely tries, complains the whole time that she thinks it's all a waste of time - she's confident that she never wants to have sex again.

So he makes the hard choice and splits up with her. They get into a huge fight, she accuses him of cheating, she mouths off to all their church friends about how he's leaving her because he's a sex fiend, his church *kicks him out* because of it, he moves out of his house and back in with his parents, spirals into depression, loses his job, etc. etc. It's a big shitfest.

I'm not going to question your decisions, or your beliefs, or whatever. But just... please think long and hard about this decision. Sex is a *very* important part of a loving relationship - without it, your marriage will feel hollow and platonic. The church underplays the importance of sex, and they *will* judge you if your marriage doesn't work out because of it. Don't leap into a marriage with the first girl who shows interest because you're young and horny, make sure you're actually marrying the right person. I've watched my friend's life fall apart and it's fucked. He's doing much better now thankfully (nearly a year later), but it was rough for a while."

"One that came up the other day between me and my GF is the expectation to help other people. Reaching things off high shelves, carrying heavy things, opening jars, things like that. 

We were watching a TV show where one of the male characters is chastised for not carrying something for an old man. It's done in a humorous way but it occurred to me that most women have probably never had to deal with the embarrassment of someone getting angry with you for not noticing that someone else was struggling with something heavy. 

Like, I don't mind helping people. But it bugs me when people get upset with you when you genuinely didn't notice that someone was struggling."
"&gt; If he won't call, it might be worth it for you to call for him.

I'm not sure I'd recommend this. For one thing, prosecuting a case where the victim won't show up to testify, won't give a statement, or is otherwise non-cooperative is almost impossible. It simply doesn't accomplish much.

Also, if a victim of abuse isn't ready to leave and the police can't lock up the abuser, interfering could be problematic. The victim is unlikely to leave the relationship, even with police involvement, and the abuser will often take their anger at being ~~abused~~ exposed out on the victim. I'm an articling student in criminal defense. I see this pattern far too often with my DV clients. It's frustrating and depressing, but it's reality. They go home, furious at having spent time in jail, and take it out on the victim once again - they're just often more careful about not getting caught again.

The best thing a friend can do is to not be pushed away, no matter how much the abuser tries to isolate the victim. Be a safe haven and a constant support, someone they can rely on if they find the ability to leave. It won't feel like enough, but often this is what saves victims."
"One time I ate some bad chicken from a restaurant while visiting a town about an hour from home.

About halfway back, on an extremely barren stretch of I-40, I had the worst stomach pains imaginable. I lasted about a mile while looking for anywhere to stop, but the sweats and pain was too much.

I pulled over on the side of the road and tried to jump over the guard rail to get to the high grass a few yards away, but I missed and hit my leg on a pointy part and got a giant gash on my lower leg. Made it to the brush and took my (extremely satisfying and painful) dump, wiped with a plastic shopping bag that somehow was near me, and drove the rest of the way home. I didn't realize that my pant leg and sock were soaked with blood until I got back.

So for a while I had to dodge answering the question of how I got this giant cut on my leg. I still have a scar actually. I just say I tripped while I was hiking and got shanked by a sharp rock."

"I'm 29  and didn't really starting dating in earnest until the past year or so.  When I finally got into a real relationship, I had no idea what I was doing.  I just kinda picked things we both sorta liked to do at a convenient time.

Three or four months in when I confessed that I hadn't had much dating experience, not only did she not care, she also *hadn't even picked up on it.*  That was really eye-opening for me.  No one, not even the girl I had been dating for 4 months (after knowing her for years), knew or cared that I had no experience.

Some things I've learned in that short time:

1. If a date goes poorly, don't worry.  You'll probably never see her again so it's like it never happened.  Like tripping on the stairs when no one is around.

2. Remember that you're not the only one on this date, so it doesn't have to fall on you to decide every aspect of every date.  I find it's good to come up with a few options, present one and see what she thinks.  If she likes it, great.  If not, she can suggest something else or you have backups.

2. There's 3.5 billion other women in the world, and no matter how special any one was, there will be others.  I was depressed for a month after I broke up with her thinking I'd never find anyone close even remotely interested, and I can happily report I was wrong.

3. ""Be yourself"" is the bullshit you'll hear all the time, but here's what it really means- don't pretend to be someone you're not.  You probably won't fool anyone, you won't be happy, and you probably won't wind up with someone you really connect to.  Yes, being yourself means not appealing to as wide an audience so you'll have a harder time finding a date.  It also means though that when you do find a date (and you will), it'll be that much more likely to work because your weird will match theirs.

4. Ask your friends/family for advice.  It's uncomfortable, but they can help figure out what kind of date to plan, what to wear, say, etc.  My sister talked me out of sending a dozen roses to my girlfriend's office a month into the relationship.  Don't do that.  Do ask for help though, there's nothing wrong with it.

5. Think about all the things you'd let slide on a date and still be interested.  Same applies to you- you don't have to be perfect.  You'll be rough around the edges, but you'll get better, and if they're interested, they probably won't notice or care as much as you might think.  I went on a date last month, we started at one place and I suggested we walk over to a nearby bar.  Got turned around on the way there and looked totally foolish. She still wanted a second date.  Water under the bridge.

6. Find common ground and work with it.  Hobbies?  What are you watching on Netflix?  Favorite time of year?  Vacation bucket list?  Book you liked?  That gives you a starting point for the conversation and potential dates to plan.  Remember that just by being in the same area, you probably already have a lot of common ground.  Local landmarks, events, etc.

7. You get out of it what you put into it.  Like most things in life you gotta work for the things you want.  Planning a date, dressing nicer than normal, etc."
"25, same situation but I have a kid. The other day I actually googled how to make friends as an adult. I mean I have friends from work but thats it. I have 2 really good friends which I do hang out with every once in awhile, but I always envisioned Id have my friends come over on a friday or saturday and have a few beers in my man cave or go shoot some pool, but every friday or saturday Im by myself.

"In elementary school, my best friend and I had sleepovers a lot.

We role played fantasy/sci-fi when playing but also occasionally pretended we were a m-f couple at night (sort of outercourse with no kissing or anything...).

Once I was humping his leg and suddenly I jizzed in my pants...

I never told him and that type of play ended shortly thereafter. 

It's been about 18 years and we are still best (platonic) friends in long-term heterosexual relationships.   "

"First week or 2 will suck. It's gonna itch and may come in patchy. But if you can grow a full one, let it grow and then trim it to whatever length you prefer. Keep it clean and especially wash it.

It's not a specific thread but any time a woman on here asks how we get anything done with our balls in the way it's hilarious to me. It's like they're imagining them as this huge inconvenience that makes every physical action really awkward and I just find that very funny.
Short and petite with short hair.  Basically the more she looks like a lesbian the more I fall in love with her. 
You should tie a string around it to measure it. If he's not into that... maybe do it while he's sleeping? Or you could find one of his other cock rings and bring that to the store with you while shopping to compare the size. You could also print out a size chart online and hold it up to his dick for comparison. Just some ideas. 
"You said you tried telling her. So did you actually tell her or did you pussy out and kinda tell her? You can't train her like a dog to stop doing something. You can't put something on your face to make it taste bad like you can with a dog. Just sit her down seriously and tell her. She has a brain, and if she respects you she'll use it. "
"I'm 39, and I think what you describe is extremely common.  It just takes a lot more effort to maintain relationships as you get older.  People get busy with their careers, advanced schooling, starting families, personal issues, etc.  Friendships typically take a back seat to all those things.  My advice would be to focus on the quality of your friendships, rather than the ~~quality~~ quantity.  If you have even just one or two real friends, you can consider yourself pretty lucky.  Getting old sucks.

"I don't know them anymore because they became complete fucking vampires. I knew the girl for a few years, pretty chill, bit of a crappy victim mentality about her life though but we kept her in check as a group of level headed men and a few women. She started dating this guy who started off great, my gf and I got quite close to them as they were fun to hang around at first. However, slowly over time the shine wore off and the bad sides of their personalities started to assert themselves. She started to become a whining ingrate, and his paranoia about his ex wife and custody battle (they had very fair joint custody but he wasn't happy) started to get out of control. Where we had been friends who would hang out, play games and chat about our hopes and dreams together, now we were simply receptacles for her whining about how the man was keeping her down, and his ever escalating character assassination of his ex and the drama he was deliberately starting and using the kid as a weapon.

Eventually she was let go during ""restructuring,"" though I knew many others in that awesome and tight knit company who told me this was merely a way to get rid of some of the unproductive losers who were undermining the morale of entire departments. He eventually escalated his ex situation and provoked her to the point where they were both calling the cops on each other and he was accusing her of the most unbelievably horrid shit that we were starting to think was all lies. The kid was loving this of course, because Mommy took her for walks and made her eat real food while Daddy let her play games all day and eat junk, so of course she was telling people whatever Daddy was coaching her to say.

In the end we literally told them point blank that they had gone insane and they were a terrible drain on us. It did not go down well. We moved across the country soon after and didn't keep up. Good riddance. It showed us that some couples can bring out the best in each other, and for other couples it's the complete opposite."
"I had gone on a small collection of accidates and ill-informed dates, but my first proper date, where we both knew it was a date prior, happened at 24.

That was 10 years ago. I've made some missteps, but taking a good amount of time to really get into helped me observe other people's relationships and decide what qualities I did and didn't want in mine.

Go into dating because you want to. Not because ""It's time"", and not to ""correct"" the fact that you've not had a relationship."

"You don't, I will reiterate that. Personally when someone replies with non-conversational responses like that I just stop, I'm not going to personally keep a one sided conversation going.

Back in pre-emoji days the ""haha lol"" response was common. I always replied ""Wow that's a lot of laughing"" to which they often said ""haha"" again. Oh fuck off. 

But if you wanna keep the conversation going: change the topic completely, ask about a movie or a current event or a class or the weekend. Whatever. You could also just ask her to homecoming straight up, since that's your end goal here.

Maybe she's just a boring dolt who has nothing to say, which if you're into boring dolts... then good for you! However if she's usually talkative then her lack of response *could* be a sign of disinterest; everyone has different texting styles however. 

Just ask her. If she says no then move on. "
Back in 2012 I was on my first deployment with 5th Marines. We were leaving from camp leatherneck to our first village for patrol and me and 2 other field radiomen were attached. I was suppose to take first vic and my buddy Lcpl Lastname decided to hop in since his best friend was the fresh new Lt. So the Captain was okay with it. So I took his seat in the 6th vic and an hour into our patrol they hit an IED. It took me 3 years to finally get over and I've gotten last the point of wanting to take my own life because I realized he would want me to live my life to the fullest. He was my best friend who went through boot camp and MCT with me.
I just hope everyone has a really nice day.
Serious. I realize how ridiculous this may sound...

"Buddy of mine got married before being deployed and had twins on the way. My friend is a nice guy but a complete fucking moron and the woman he married lives up to all of the awful stereotypes you would assosiate with someone in that situation and throw in a splash of manipulative sociopathic tendencies to boot. For the past few years he'd come back to town and we'd *always* end up talking about how he's miserable he is before getting a call 45 minutes later that's just squawking about how he's a deadbeat dad for wanting to go out with friends that he sees once a year (never mind the fact that we would extend the invite to her as well, and she would never take it).

On the bright side they're getting a divorce! Met up with them a few months ago for their twins birthday party, end up bringing a gift and asking how they're doing and I kid you not the first words out of her mouth are ""WELL APPARENTLY I'M THE WORST WIFE IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE AND MY DAD IS DYING AND MY SHITBAG OF A HUSBAND IS CHEATING"" before storming off, while their 3 year old kids are playing 10 feet away."
"I'm weird - I clean when I'm in a bad mood. Just put on music or a movie I've seen a dozen times and go to town on every corner of my apartment. Try to let my mind go blank for a few hours and when I'm done, my place sparkles. Getting high first is even better."

"The abusive relationships are toxic and most adjusted people should be able to see through them.

The couple that scares me the most are wildly successful (VP banker and wedding designer), are utterly superficial, and have arbitrary social rules that dictate how all people should be, or else. It's like walking on egg shells with these people and their extremely fragile egos. 

They often use authority and manipulation to force onto you how they believe you should behave and are dismissive if you want otherwise. For example, I gave up drinking. But at their socials it's not okay to enjoy a nonalcoholic drink. Me turning down drinks ends up with me having 3-4 different glasses of wine in front of me because my ""no thanks"" is ignored, mainly under the disguise of hospitality. They don't let it go, like their entire experience hinders on my one sip. There are literally 50 other people there and they'll spend an hour on me and when I didn't budge it was underhanded comments every moment they got.

I've seen them place cakes (2 slices) in front of a diabetic man saying ""I can't eat cake, I'm diabetic."" The wife's eye twitched like she couldn't process such refusal. Started shaming the guy for his congenital disease. 

During a wedding, the husband was ""watching"" his baby daughter while she was sitting up in a little red wagon. The baby being a baby lost balance and toppled over the wagon before anyone could react. He ended up freaking out (understandable) but then found some way to go on a tirade at his wife and the people who's wedding we were at. Each has a degree of narcissism that reminds me high ego has no ceiling. Super odd people man, I wouldn't doubt if they came across people the polar opposite of them they'd probably chop them up and bury them under their gazebo.

"Good. You shouldn't expect anything. Instead, don't steep yourself in these feelings. While I could give you the normal AM advice of get in the gym, lawyer, or whatever bullshit - instead, make your own fucking rules.

You decide how you react to a break up. YOU DECIDE THAT. Now that you have some experience and you got your dick wet, what do you want to do? Go to the movies? Work out with friends? Get your dick wet again?

You can have it **all**, baby. Be careful with your heart but enjoy this experience."
"Wouldn't say racist but I grew up in a household who weren't fans of Mexicans (we grew up in LA). I joined the military at 19 and traveled all over the country for 4 years. Spent alot of time in different cultures and if there's one thing I've come to realize is that everyone has weird prejudices about certain people. I've met white people who don't like other white people and black people that aren't fond of asians. Etc. Someone else said we are all just people, you have to accept that certain cultures are just the way they are and alot of values won't fall in line with yours. Doesn't mean their culture is inferior. Just means that you have reference points of how/how not to carry those values into your own. My    $0.02."

On our way back home, we were walking our regular route when we heard a loud crash. As we turned the corner we saw a car had taken out the traffic lights and crashed into the wall behind it, right where we would have been standing if my friend hadn't wanted the second bottle.

"My first girlfriend and I became this. She'd throw stuff at me, belittle me in public and private, and had multiple emotional affairs when we dated, but told me she was just being friendly when I called her on it.

I became isolated from family and friends and only reached out to them to complain about her while also doing nothing to escape or improve my situation. 

Luckily, over time we became totally different people, especially after breaking up. And a few years later and a few moves later, nobody in my current circle knows I was ever that shitty "

"As evidenced by the whole ""manspreading"" horse shit, you don't think much about what it's like having balls.  

There's no way you can try it out either.  You could put a couple of ping pong balls in a baggie and staple it to your legs I guess, but you couldn't put all the nerve endings in the ping pong balls that we have, that are sometimes in pain just from a wrong step.  We're talking about delicate equipment here. 

I sit with my legs at no less than a 45 degree angle.  I need to accommodate my balls without pinching them or having them touch my thighs.  It's the natural place my legs fall to.  Roughly a 45 degree angle.  

Complaining about that would be like men complaining that women always have their arms apart, and they should be clasped together.  

And not to wax too political, but it's pretty hypocritical of the same group of women that bitch about men telling them what to do with their bodies, to tell men to put their legs together, whether they know about balls or not."

Kissing can be everything from a simple ""I'm-so-proud-of-you, look-at-you-go"" peck, to a full on ""I've-never-wanted-to-live-off-of-someone-else's-own-breath, how-can-I-get-more/closer"" make out session. 

You'd think that someone else's breath would be a turn off, but when you're with the girl of your dreams it honestly doesn't even matter. Sometimes it tastes like coffee, cigarettes, whatever. You kind of get used to the taste of the other persons saliva.

They used to always come over and *sometimes* bring weed, they always had a cracked bong repaired with duck-tape or something like that because they were constantly spending money on new pieces and breaking them

Everytime i bought my own money to get weed they would stick around expecting me to smoke them out, and they did not often bring weed themselves
 

Dude got the girl pregnant at like 18-19, had a baby 

Both of them smoke weed and drink a fuckton, neither had jobs - At one point they both had a job but they quit and spent their last 400$ on weed and 100$ on a huge meal at Ihop so they needed me to help them carry their baby clothes to this place that pays money for used baby clothes because, of course, neither of them have a car - I helped in exchange for them buying me weed, it was a fine trade.

The last straw was when they had their toddler over at my friends house and they needed a ride home -  I noticed they, of course, didn't have a carseat. I refused to take them home and they got pretty salty about that - But if i get pulled over because that kid isn't in a car seat its my ass on the line and not even counting what could happen if we actually got in an accident.

Short and cute
"&gt;Any tips or conversation starters would be greatly appreciated!!!

Here are some flirting tips.

As a general guideline:

* What's subtle to you is invisible to him.

* What's obvious to you is subtle to him.

* What's obvious to the point of embarrassing to you, is starting to be visible to him.

Not sure if girls plan it out or just do it naturally, but what works best on me is when girls have ""warmed me up"" a little first with casual conversation. So that when they do finally ask me out, it feels natural and it's easy for me to say yes.

The following may seem like a lot, but many women have gone through many of the steps in one conversation, and closed by asking for the date. Some girls are really smooth.

Here is the process:

* Bring up some excuse to talk to him: class, work, etc.  Then transition into talking about interests and your personal lives.

* Express interest.  Put away your phone, maintain eye contact, and be attentive. Lean in closer to him when he talks. Forget about playing hard to get--that just makes it easier for the guy to think you're not interested. Be engaged in the conversation. 

* Flirt. Girls who are flirty with me from the start will stay out of the female friend-zone.  Be careful with teasing though; some girls don't know the difference between light playful teasing and hurtful insults. When in doubt, err toward being *complimentary* rather than critical, e.g. ""Ooh, I think it's hot when a man [does X],"" not, ""You'll have to learn to [do X] if you ever want to get a girlfriend."" Breaking his balls is not sexy. Stroking his ego is.

* Compliment his appearance.  Guys hardly ever get appreciation, so you'll stand out immediately.  Seriously, I and my guy friends will puff out our chests for a week if we get a sincere compliment from a girl who isn't our mom or relative. **However, make sure to compliment *him,* not just his clothes** (this is a common mistake since clothes are how women compliment each other). Otherwise, he'll assume you like his clothes and shrug it off.  Lots of articles advise women to tell men, ""Hey, I like your shirt.""  Only to have the guy completely miss the hint she was into him. Compliment his face, body, skill (guys pride themselves on skill) etc. Women want to be more than a sex object; men want to be a sex object.

* Offer your phone number first before he asks.  That one is a blatant green light for me.  But get his number too, if it was an accidental meeting and you might never see him again.

* ""Direct approach"": Ask him out on a ""date.""  Actually say the word, ""Date.""  Hinting he should ask you out often does not work.  If you use subtlety, you'll complain to your girl friends later how he doesn't notice.  Use your words and you could be on a date with him tomorrow. Edit: this is more effective in person, not over text or e-mail or Facebook. Via technology, the guy might talk himself into thinking you're joking or you meant that for someone else you were chatting online with. 

* ""Self-invite"" date, e.g. when he talks about a cool bar/restaurant/whatever he discovered you say, ""I'd love to go there! Are you hitting it up later this week?""

* ""Reminder"" date, a good follow-up to the ""self-invite"" date: ""Hey, when are we going to that great bar you told me about?

* ""Student"" approach: you see a guy who's good at something, e.g. throwing darts. You introduce yourself and ask him to teach you. Commence flirting.

* Shy Girl's Stealth Strategy. The girl suggests cool upcoming events: new movie, concerts, shows, etc. Naturally weaves them into the conversation. Eventually one would catch my interest and I'd just react and say, ""Yeah, I'd love to go to that."" Then she says, ""Great! Let's go together on Friday. Meet me at seven."" So smooth that I'd only realize *hours* later she had set me up to ask me out.

* If you want him right now, try to get him alone. ""Hey, it's kinda loud in here, want to go outside for a bit?"" If you really want to go further, suggest splitting a taxi or inviting him back to your place. Or if you're going to his place, ask him to see his bedroom, and make a move on him then.

* Physical touching.  Guys are taught to keep their hands to themselves around women, so a guy will definitely notice if a girl breaks the touch barrier.  You don't have to grope him, but touch his arm in conversation when you're emphasizing a point or laughing at something he says.  

Here are some bolder moves, more suitable for a party/nightclub/bar situation.

Bold: put your hand on his thigh.  

Bolder: sit close to him and press your thigh against his thigh. Or if you're sitting across from him, rub your foot against his leg.
 
Boldest: sit on his lap and put his arm around you. Some girls ""trip"" and fall into guy's laps. Like a dumbass, I've helped girls stand up and sent them on their way, when they actually wanted to talk to me. The more persistent ones stuck around and talked to me anyway.

If you're dancing, dance closer. Grind your body against his.

Keep escalating unless he makes it clear your advances are not welcome. 

**Negative tactics**  

Some girls do these things to attract guys, but they actually repel guys. These should go without saying, but I'm including them for the sake of covering all bases.

* Try to make him jealous.  Flirting with other guys in front of him, talking about how you get asked out a lot, etc. Some girls do it thinking it lets her crush know she's ""in demand."" In most cases, the guy treats it as a sign of *disinterest,* e.g. ""Damn, she flirts with all those guys but never flirts with me."" Or he might actually be disgusted by it.  ""Jesus, no way would I want a girlfriend who flirts with every guy around her."" The problem is girls are turned on by competition in relationships, while most guys are turned off.  

* Complain about guys trying to physically escalate with you. Some girls do this to plant the idea he should make a move. Reverse psychology. This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl doesn't want *anyone* to make a move on her. He doesn't want to be labeled a ""creep"" like all those other guys, so he does nothing. Then he gets confused later if he hears from her (or through her friends), complaining how he never made a move. Disclaimer: not all girls do this.  

* Criticize any girl he's dating, e.g. ""Nah, she's no good for you"" (""Because I think *I'm* right for you!"").  Worse, be rude to the girl if he introduces her to you, e.g. ""Oh, so *you're* [name]"" (looks her up and down to size up the competition). 

* Open the conversation by insulting him.  house_robot explained this really well in another thread.  

Quote:
&gt; 
&gt; When a girl says, ""Oh you're a player aren't you?"" its similar to when they say shit like, ""Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?""
&gt; 
&gt; Its the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. Shes letting you know you have desirable qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

The key thing is to make it obvious *you're treating him differently and better* compared to other guys.  Like if he sees you hugging every guy, then he'll second-guess your interest and think you're just being friendly if you hug him.  

I thought this was a good example from a past AskMen thread titled, *""Men who have had women make the first move on them, how did she do it?""*

The user deleted their account, but this story was still up. Might be too aggressive for some, but the girl's confidence was attractive.

&gt; My personal favorite: As I was randomly leaving a bar, a girl I'd never seen before grabbed my hand and said ""You can't leave! you're so cute!"" 

&gt;I told her she was very sweet and very cute herself but that I had to leave and that I had a girlfriend, and she goes ""Noooo! Can I at least give you a hug?"" I said of course and she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek during the hug and said ""Sorry, I had to! Your girlfriend is very lucky!""
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of the girlfriend (still my SO today) she was my good friend a solid year and change before we started dating. One night after some wine she asked why I never was into her, while swearing that she wasn't actually into me.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day when I brought up the conversation to her she said ""yeah well maybe I was lying about not being into you."" I told her that I think she's awesome but that I don't date my friends, and she replied ""We'll see.""
&gt; 
&gt; She spent the next month and a half just being super cute, sweet, thoughtful, and adorable towards me, even after I told her again I wasn't going to change my mind. Eventually, I did.
&gt; 
&gt; I later learned from a mutual friend that she confided that (paraphrasing), ""I know he's not going to change his mind, and I'm okay with that. But I still want to make him happy and be an awesome friend to him, even if it won't make him like me. He deserves it.""

The worst thing that can happen if a girl is too subtle in her flirting: [case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtsNbxgPngA). I'd watch it again without sound to see more of her signals she's interested. Granted, they're entertainers, so who knows if it was all an act.

Hope this helps. Good luck."

"If she feels like you will do this on the trip, I would start faking like your going to then say tie your shoe (DO NOT BRING THE RING OUT AT ANYTIME during the faking out period, save that for the one real time) or start a conversation like your going to get to ask her but change it to something else, do that through out the trip till she's pissed off or thinking your going to fake her out again then just do it for reals. "
"&gt; Body fluids, on the other hand, are a few steps farther that I didn't want to go

You were having unprotected sex with some folks off craigslist, the guy came on you, and you're upset that he got semen on you?!?!?!  Were you not upset that she got vaginal fluids on you, and that he also got pre-come on you?  You guys were rubbing dicks together inside her vagina...does that not qualify as ""getting it on directly with each other?""  

I'm certainly not judging, I'm just curious how you make the distinction."
You don't.  Replies like that are a sign that the conversation has reached an organic conclusion.
"Guy here, also waiting until marriage. I think it's important in my beliefs, although I haven't used it as a criteria for women I date(i.e. I don't date virgins exclusively). I haven't had any complaint from them when disclosing that I'm waiting until marriage, and things usually just progress as normal. They aren't put off by it at all.

Although...I have been cheated on by several women, could be because they wanted sex and weren't getting it from me but didn't want to/couldn't tell me that? I don't know. 

Anyway...[How you doin'](https://media0.giphy.com/media/11SIBu3s72Co8w/200_s.gif)? "
And then sniff.
"I still remember back when my (now wife) and I first got down to business.  She was doing the whole kissing me all over thing and was working her way south.  I was doing the ""OMG OMG OMG this chick is going to give me head!"" guy thing lol.

Anyways she pulls it out and exclaims ""OMG it's so pretty!"".  I actually get a little offended thinking that's an insult, like it is feminine or something.  Never heard a penis called pretty so I was all ""WTF?  It's not 'pretty' "".

She then tells me there are some ugly dicks out there (duh, I've watched porn) and that mine looks perfect, not odd shaped or discolored or anything. 

So then she calls her friend (we were a little drunk too) and sits there with the phone in one hand and my dick in her other hand describing it to her saying how 'pretty' it is LMAO.

At this point I am just cracking the fuck up.  She eventually lets her friend go and we get back to business.  But man, that was really awkward at first, and ego boosting in the end.  But I'll never forget that night.

I also learned that night that women discuss EVERYTHING with their close friends.  Guys just simply ""You hit it?"" and that's the entire conversation.  Women get into all sorts of details."
So it's like a hobby. Nothing wrong with that.

"Although I understand the axiom, allow me to submit an alternative. *People don't have to fake it.* They just need to spend a bit of time in advance understanding what it is that defines a character trait, and then **do that** consistently. 

On an anecdotal level, whenever I used this turn of phrase my ego was repeating that ""I'm a fake."" A woman I respect greatly gave me some really good advice in that regard: ""You know how women tell you to, 'be yourself?' What they **mean** is, *'Be your best self.'* You don't have to do that for other people, and you don't have to fake it. You just do that long enough, and *you become that*.""

Take *the stick* out of the process (""faking"") and just go with *the carrot*, because the mind and your ego is a tricky thing... And a habit of regular negative self-talk jacks shit up.

One time when I was around age 14, I started to really discover my sexuality. I had been super frustrated by it for a long time because I didn't really find anything attractive about either girls or guys. I claimed that I was asexual and shit.

Anyway, right before the following event, I discovered that I really really really liked feet. I got super into it because it was like I finally discovered myself. 

So my best friend had a big sleepover at his step dads house and they were allowed to have GIRLS sleep over. Holy crap that's awesome. My parents let me go because they're cool. 

Anyway, we all slept in the same room and I purposefully stayed awake until like 3am, got up while everyone was asleep and pulled the blankets back on a few of the girls sleeping spots and licked their feet while they were sleeping. No one noticed and I was in heaven.

"Having attraction toward attractive people doesn't magically turn off when you're in a committed relationship. It's how you handle yourself in-spite of those thoughts that matters. 

One man's opinion:
If you turn into a cheating d-bag then that's not very good. 
If you verbalize it to all your peers you're probably going to be perceived as a slimy person. 
If you keep it to yourself and realize that it's a natural biological response that you appreciate beauty then you're fine. 
If you beat yourself up about it then you're in denial."
"Dunno if this counts, but around 15 years ago I was stopped at a red light. My girlfriend was following in the car behind, and we were texting while stopped. I was replying to one of her texts as the light turned green. I had to have been stopped at the green light for 3 seconds or so. As I look up and inch forward, a semi comes barreling through the intersection, running his red and just missing the front end of my car by about a foot to maybe two feet.

Had I gone the second my light turned green, I would not be alive to type this. The next couple months, I was so grateful to be alive, erring on the side of caution whenever possible. But as the years have gone on, I've realized that there are some things I just flat out can't comtrol. I live my life like normal, but I still think about that night I probably should have died."

"Nothing wrong with her knowing and you knowing that she knows IMO. It creates complicity and anticipation, that will make the trip special and a fond memory. The surprise factor is overblown and she still doesn't know which day of the trip it will be.

"Maybe not the *worst* couple, but my parents' marriage definitely leaves a lot to be desired.

It was typical Indian arranged marriage - not *forced* per se, but they still only knew each other 1 month before tying the knot, and never really even were in the same room alone before the wedding. I can't remember a single time they've held hands, displayed any affection whatsoever, or even told each other ""good morning"". I can't remember a time they've ever done anything out-of-the-way nice for each other.

Which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the bickering. During my childhood they'd start screaming matches once every 2 weekends; and if that sounds oddly specific to you, it's because I wrote down every argument and it was once every 2 weeks like clockwork. My dad was usually the instigator over some petty shit. Like once he began bellowing at my mom because she returned a book overdue and it incurred a $0.50 fine. Like all-out spit flying from his lips, calling her a worthless leech, etc.

My mom is no saint either, she constantly pesters my dad about not making enough money and not being ambitious enough. That's her main topic of conversation with him.

They have completely neutered any desire I once had to get married myself. If this is what marriage is like, count me out.

I can't hate them too much though... even though they hated each other they did show me a lot of love, and at least my dad never got physical. So that's a good thing."

2. Suggesting that you are not a strong and mentally capable enough human to not be influenced by ""bad people""

"Personally, about ""never"" to ""not ever"""
"Ok, this is long a fuck, but here's my story.

I met her in college. I was a fifth year senior, and she was a sophomore. The sex was fantastic from the get go. A few years later it died when she started med school. I was prepared for med school to have a major impact on our lives given the insane workload, stress, and sleep deprivation, though I wouldn't have guessed we'd drop to having sex 2-3 times a year from several times a week. But I figured med school and then residency would be temporary.

I love this woman. I love her intelligence, ambition, and drive. We have our whole lives ahead of us, and things will return to normal, right? We got married after the first year of med school. Looking back, I don't know how I survived without walking out the door or cheating. I know I pretty miserable and I brought it up a couple of times. He response was that she was too exhausted, stressed, and barely able to cope with med school, and then residency. Ok, understandable. Then the next part should have been a red flag -- It was unfair of me to expect sex given her situation. Not really knowing any better, I accepted this and felt guilty for ""putting more on her plate.""

The rare occasion we did have sex, she loved it, even said we should do it more often, but summarily rejected further advances until the next time the planets aligned. We had a planned baby during her 4th year, which, much to my chagrin, were able to conceive on the first try. I became a single dad when she started residency and 80-100hour work weeks. Between my own burgeoning career and spending most of my free time taking care of our daughter, I really didn't bother initiating. After residency we moved out of state where she got a job. I was hopeful that this would come with a more reasonable workload which would lead to revitalizing our sex life.

Again I was met with hostility when I brought it up, shortly after moving. It was still another 9 months before we'd have sex again. She decided she'd like to have a second child after all (I'd always wanted at least two-- and she had initially wanted to stop after the first). But while trying to conceive I really struggled with ED. After 8+ years of being roommates, it doesn't feel good to suddenly have your spouse want sex, but only on ovulation weeks. I felt used-- though I didn't fully process all of this for a while-- I was just shocked at the time to have ED after desperately wanting sex with my wife for so long. Eventually we conceived, but as soon as that pee stick said she was pregnant, sex died. It would be close to two years before we had sex again. During that time I discovered /r/deadbedrooms. For the first time, I learned that I wasn't a sex-crazed asshole for wanting to have sex with my wife. I wasn't a bad guy for feeling so desperate, unloved, unattractive, and miserable.

But this pregnancy came with complications. Our son would need major surgery immediately after birth. My wife would need to deliver by C-section. Everything went well, but our son needed a lot of care after spending a month in the ICU. I was really not too concerned about sex during this time period. It was a scary time, and we were both focused on our son.

Around the time he turned 1 was our 10 year wedding anniversary. He was healthy and I made arrangements for my parents to take the kids for a week and the two of us would go on a trip together. Ahead of this trip, I tried talking about it again. I used the language I learned from the many posts, articles, and books I read. For the first time, she was receptive to my concerns. I was elated. On our anniversary trip-- away from the kids, we had sex three times in a week. Still elated. Feeling good about the future. Then we return home, and back to our old normal-- nothing.

One month, two months, three months. Halloween night I offered to take the kids and suggested she go to her friends annual Halloween party. She was grateful. She goes to the party. Has a great time, gets drunk, sends me suggestive texts. When she gets home I initiate. She makes an excuse and declines. And I broke.

I remember laying in bed awake, at the desperately sad intersection of horny and despair. I couldn't even cry myself to sleep. I got up and finally went to sleep in our guest room. When I woke up I decided I couldn't take it any longer. I emotionally detached. If she hugged me, I'd hug back. Same with the routine peck on the lips. But I stopped initiating any affection and found excuses to not be around. I continued sleeping in our guest room. After a month of this she confronted me. I told her why and we had a blowout fight. She was angry that I would ever hurt her so deeply by withholding affection. I said we needed counseling. She declined at first so I said I'd go on my own. After one session she decided she'd go as well.

The counseling helped in that we could talk about emotionally charged topics without it turning into a fight. I'm generally stoic by nature and tend to not get too emotional, but the exception has always been any emotional discussions with my wife. I had a really difficult time communicating without getting so emotional that I'd essentially freeze. In the environment of the therapist's office I felt... safer?

My wife conceded that my needs were valid--- for the first time ever. The agreement was to schedule sex once a month. Hardly ideal, but it would be a 400% improvement over the past 10+ years so I jumped at it. First month went ok. I again struggled with ED-- the feeling that it was duty sex wasn't working for me. Her response was that why should she try if I clearly couldn't even get aroused? Then attacked my porn/masturbation habits. Rather than argue back, I decided the next month I'd go nofap for a full week beforehand to see if that helped. It did. The second month was much better-- no ED. So I had my plan. Third month, she's too stressed with work and asked for a raincheck. Two more months and still no sex. I worked really really hard not to let resentment build up again and did everything I could to ease her burdens. I felt I was in for the usual chore play rabbit hole.

Then out of the blue one day, she initiates and we had pretty good sex. Another night shortly after, we were watching football and I joked how it's every guys dream to get a BJ while watching football, but since she was also a legit football fan, I'd go down on her while she watched football. She thought I was bluffing and I followed through (I mean, I love going downtown) and she got really into it, and we had sex afterward though I was not expecting it. This seemed to light some kind of spark in her. For the next few weeks she wanted sex every two or three days. And it was great. Like when we started dating. I was cautiously optimistic.

Then one day she tripped over the baby gate and took a fall down the stairs. Tore the labrum in her hip. She will need surgery, and is in immense pain in the meantime. Understandably, sex is a no go. She'll have surgery next week and have to take at least 12 weeks off work. Assuming she feels well enough at that point the soonest I can hope to have sex again is November. I'm terrified that she'll get used to not having sex again and stop thinking about it and all the progress will be erased. She hasn't mentioned a single time that she's unhappy that this mean we can't have sex, but repeatedly laments how much it sucks that she can't go running. That doesn't make me feel optimistic.

If I could go back in time with what I know now, I would have asked for an open relationship when she was in med school or ended the relationship. Now there's too much else at stake with intertwined finances, kids, and a shared close knit group of friends that date back nearly 20 years. Plus we get along great outside of the sexual disconnect, and co-parent well. So for now, it's still worth the effort if we can salvage the progress made. My plan is to continue working on improving our sexual relationship. If that doesn't seem to work, I'm going to open that pandora's box of proposing an open relationship. And finally, I'm willing to leave if all else fails, but I won't do that until i'm satisfied that I tried everything else first."

"/u/kitcat88 said this in an AskWomen thread about why breaking up with someone you never actually dated really hurts which I relate to:

&gt;I casually saw a guy for two months, and really fell for him. He broke things off in a text message. We were never in a relationship, and my friends didn't really understand why I felt so heartbroken.

&gt;I think for me, it was because when he broke things off, it was like a door slamming shut. Because we weren't in a relationship, I never got to know the bad parts of him. I never got to know the areas in which we were incompatible. There was nothing I could point to and be like well, it's for the best we broke up, I never liked such-and-such about him. It was just happy butterflies of ""omg I really like this guy,"" and then those butterflies were slaughtered.

&gt;It made it harder for me to get over him. All those ""what-could-have-beens"" and daydreams still existed, with nothing to temper them.

In my case, a girl and I dated, hung out all the time, traveled, and acted like a couple for six months, but she didn't want to get into a relationship because she was going to be across the ocean for the next six months and then be a 12 hour drive away for the next year or longer after that.

In your situation, it seems like it's more that your casual relationship did end for more concrete reasons relating to the two of you, so I would honestly treat it more like an actual relationship ending absolutely. It's gonna hurt and that's fine. Eventually, you'll get past it.

My friends didn't understand why I decided to stop talking to her when we were never exclusive. But that's fine. Just take your time and focus on your own needs. Reflect on what you can improve on for future relationships and act on it. And do things that make you happy. For me, it's playing pick-up sports and setting achievable goals for each week. This week's goal was to replace the flush valve in my toilet, wash and vacuum my car, and to strip the paint off our deck. The weekly objectives help build confidence in my skills and improve my day-to-day life. "

"I once had a layover in the Brussels airport in Belgium two summers ago. I had a few hours so on my way from one plane to the other, I stopped to go to the bathroom.

Cheating. Instant relationship ender
"I've kissed men and women. With women, it can be sort of soft and warm, especially if she has full lips. 

With men, their lips tend to be firmer, and sometimes you can feel a bit of their stubble.

If they're a good kisser, you'll feel tingles all the way down to your knees.

Tip: Don't open your mouth too wide until you can gauge where the other person is. I've kissed guys who've ended up with their lips on my cheeks, not realizing I can't open my mouth any farther. (Plus, if I open it too wide, it hurts.) You're going for passion, but don't swallow her face. :) Just slip your tongue in a bit and see where it goes from there."

That's a valid point. I will admit I'm not well versed on traps. 
"Have you exhausted all your other options?  You just found out you are infertile and are already looking into sperm donors.  That is a huge leap.  How infertile are you, exactly?  There are three factors to a man's fertility.  What is your morphology, count, and motility?  My husband had good morphology, but extremely low count (9,000) and zero motility.  Yet five years after that diagnosis and trying many things including a varicocele surgery, I got pregnant naturally and now we have a four year old boy.   

I didn't really want to do a sperm donor anyway, but when he expressed his insecurities about that,  I thought no way in hell am I going that direction.  I would rather be childless that put him through that if it is going to hurt him.  I hope she realizes how insecure you are already feeling being an infertile man not able to get her pregnant.  She needs to tread lightly.  

What worked for us was him taking Clomid.  If you convince yourself to go along with the sperm donor thing, there are huge implications.  You have to be 100% on board with that or you are going to have festering doubts creep into your mind - feelings of inadequacy that will ruin your marriage and your relationship with the child."
