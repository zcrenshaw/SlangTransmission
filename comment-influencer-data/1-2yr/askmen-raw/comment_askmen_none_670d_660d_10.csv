A Happy relationship is benter than being single but being single is better than bring in a shitty relationship
"I'm in The Netherlands, where prostitution is legal. I've frequented a fair share of hookers; still do, by the way (there's one girl in particular that I love coming back to).   

What's considered 'cheap' here is a hooker who does window prostitution. The most well known example is the red light district in Amsterdam, but it exists in more cities. It typically costs €50 for 20-30 min. with them, for a blowjob and fucking. It differs widely from girl to girl what kind of service you'll get. Some are just out there to make a lot of money while doing as little as possible to satisfy you. These are the one that barely allow any touching, don't allow any kissing or licking of any part of their body and just lie there while you do your thing. That's very mechanical. The better ones try to make you feel more at ease; they make small talk; they do foreplay; they let you explore their body first. If you're really lucky, they will even kiss on the mouth, though this is a rarity among the window girls. I had one regular girl in a window area and visited her for years. She always stood out head and shoulders above the others.   

In general, though, the 'pricey' hookers, meaning the ones working in the brothels are usually much better. For one, most of them are Dutch, which makes communication easier (the window girls are almost all Eastern European and speak English only) and thus makes for better chemistry. They're also more about seduction, playfulness, built-up, etc. Some try very hard to emulate an experience with a girlfriend --and come very close to succeeding! There's a lot more privacy there as well (you're being kept out of sight of other customers) and the rooms are bigger and more luxurious. It's not just walking in, undressing, having sex and going out again. It's much more relaxed and there's room for cuddling and just lying together and talking as well.   

All in all, when you look at it, the 'pricey' hookers aren't even that pricey after all. I pay €140 for an hour with my favorite girl at the brothel, true. But I pay €50 for 20 minutes at the windows; if I wanted to stay there for an hour I would be paying 3 x €50 = €150 and get no kissing, questionable foreplay,  and no 'girlfriend experience'.   

The reason I like to do window prostitution sometimes is that I like walking through such an area and seeing the diversity of the girls and looking at so many girls and being able to 'pick' one. Sometimes going for a bite and a drink afterward, then returning an hour later and picking another one. It's got an atmosphere all of its own that you can only know if you've ever done it.   

Whereas at a brothel, you come in and there are maybe just 5 girls that are being presented to you and you have to hope one of them is to your liking. If there isn't, you've come for nothing and have to head home again. But returning to my regular girl is like coming home, every time."
Play video games and day drink in my underwear. 
"Speaking from experience as a guy, at least some of those guys are probably actually interested in dating you. I doubt there is anything ""wrong"" with you at all. If you have lots of guy friends you are definitely not throwing off mean or unwelcoming vibes, but you may not be putting out ""I'm available"" vibes either.

Contrary to popular opinion, most guys are pretty respectful of boundaries. There was a woman I was very attracted to that I worked with in my early 20s, but I made sure to not come across as ""interested"" because I didn't want to ruin the co-worker situation. Suffice it to say, she never knew I was interested in her. 

Prior to finding my wife, there were lots of women I found attractive at parties that I wouldn't have approached, and lots that I found less attractive that I did approach. Not because I was lacking confidence, I've always been forward and confident, but because some women naturally look more receptive to introductions. If you feel shy around guys, or feel apprehensive when you are attracted to a guy, that might translate into him thinking you aren't interested in anything beyond platonic friendship. 

My advice, if there is a guy that you are interested in. Don't wait for him to come to you, you go to him. Set up a date, flirt with him, touch him on the arm when you're talking. Anything to let him know you are interested. Men are stupid, what you might thinks is an obvious signal of attraction might just be misinterpreted as friendly. Women respond to whispers, men respond to flashing neon signs."
"Basically, when sex is explained to us as teenagers it's about what is going to happen *to us* and how we should best prevent it. It's about how boys will lie to you and tell you they care about you just to have sex with you, and you shouldn't fall for it or you'll end up pregnant and alone. What you should do is find one that actually *does* care and then it's acceptable to love/date/marry/have sex with him.

At no point were we sat down and told ""you're going to be horny as fuck, and that's okay."" So we feel like we have to hem and haw, and act like we're some sort of prize to be won. Except we don't want to be one. We want to fuck someone we're attracted to. So we split the difference: act like this isn't something we normally do or planned on doing, but got caught up in the moment or somehow otherwise convinced to give in."
Who the fuck boils their veggies before dipping them in something? I’ve never heard this in my entire life 
"I want to lick women where they pee so that's kinda disgusting if you think about it

If the sign is big enough. And you hit him hard enough with it."
This date should go well.  
"STARS

S - Sorry.

T - Tell me about it. Tell me where you were, how you feel.

A - Is there anything you'd like to ask me?

R - Reaching out. Is there anybody you'd like me to call for you? Family? Friends?

S - Sorry.

something they teach in medic school for explaining the passing to next of kin. It's a useful framework. A few extra points: Tell her he died or is dead. He didn't ""pass,"" he's not ""gone,"" you need to be clear. Give her whatever time she needs to process that before you continue. I don't expect you know all the details, but answer her questions as best as you can and if possible, get the number for the doctor so she can speak to him directly.

Its going to be the hardest thing you've ever done, and you're going to be emotional, but do your best to stay calm. You'll all get through this."
Raw.  She should leave you.

"As well as the other advice you received here, may I recommend that if you have access to your friends social media, that you temporarily disable it.  When my niece died last year there was a time zone delay and so her family couldn’t be told immediately.  Her friends began to tag her with there condolences before many of her close family knew of her death.  Social media is a nightmare at a time like this, and some people can say very inappropriate things."
Play video games and eat rubbish for 2 days. Then regret not tidying up after myself so on the final day panic tidy the house.
"Read plot spoilers. I find it helps me anticipate jump scares when I'm not expecting that character to live much longer. 

During scary parts (forewarned by the plot spoilers above) you can also stare at the corner of the TV and not the screen. You look like you're still paying attention but you are just using peripherals to see when it's safe to watch again!"

"I want to have fried chicken and waffle for breakfast, beer and burger for lunch, Arby's fries for afternoon snack, and finish the day with a medium rare ribeye steak. That's would be the perfect day for me. "
"That's nothing, some of us like to do that where they allegedly poop."
"Haha just tell her"" I definitely want to go out with you but you're gonna laugh at me the whole time cause I'm terrible with scary movies"".  Just make the point that your looking fwd to spending time with her and show her you're willing to laugh at yourself.  Just don't scream.  You can yell like ""ohh shit "" or say things like that and it's fine.   Like someone else said you can corner of the screen stare or just close your eyes quick.   Really the point of the movie is to freak ya out. No point in trying to be like some big man like it didn't scare ya."

She passed away in 2013. Been feeling pretty empty since.

That is for that tidbit of information. It was an extremely interesting read.
"I felt much happier in a HEALTHY relationship. I associate the best time of my life with when I was with my ex. The holiday times were less lonely, I was more socially active, I felt more fulfilled to be working at a committed relationship. "
"I don't prefer it, but it works better for me. I have much better luck with girls that already know me. Not much of a looker, so I play to my strong suits of being witty and fun, which come through much more with time."
"Guy I worked with constantly bitched about how insecure his wife was about their relationship.  He worked late a LOT to support his wife and their two kids. She thought he was out with other women.

He was later fired when he was caught in the supplies room with the office secretary."
"Can confirm. Met my wife when she was my nurse after a major head injury that I don't remember first-hand.

Actually...now I'm suspicious of the whole ""you were in a a motorcycle accident"" story I was told when I woke up. "
"To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women."
A meaningful relationship with another person that doesn't end with me being replaced and discarded. Apparently.
Depends on the reason. If I'm not attracted physically I'll just say I'm not interested. If it's a personality issue I'd tell her we don't seem compatible.
"&gt; Basically, when sex is explained to us as teenagers it's about what is going to happen to us

Whereas we're basically taught that we're going to have to pursue and make it happen.  No wonder the less moral/empathetic among us end up becoming predators."

"Her unconditional love. 

No matter how much I have messed up or how much she disagrees with my choices she has always been there or on the phone, ready to support me.

"Holy crap -- first off, I'm really sorry for all of you. That's awful.

I guess I'd get her into the car first and then just explain it as naturally as it comes. ""I wanted to wait until we got into the car to say this, but..."" There is absolutely no good way to break that news, and it's beyond terrible that you're the one that gets to do it. Make sure that you're in the relative privacy of your car, be mindful of her feelings, and make it as direct as possible. 

Again, I'm really sorry to hear that."
The only right answer.

"You said that the conversations stay shallow and end by someone walking away. This could be your major problem. I know plenty of pretty girls who for the love of god don't know how to hold a simple conversation and end up alone, so I think that this is your problem as well. Also, smiling and eye contact are NOT initiating. That's far too subtile for us men to make a move just on that. Make yourself available, so put that smartphone away, walk around, appear open. Body language is everything, maybe look up some videos on open body language.

Here's my tip: if you're starting a conversation, don't form questions or answers that can be answered with only ""yes"" or ""no"". Form them in a way, that your partner has to talk a bit or in a way so that he can ask questions. Ask for their motivations, thoughts, opinions, emotions. That way the conversation keeps flowing and people get the idea that you're interested in them.


Example: ""What do you do for a living?"" ""I'm an Engineer."" could end right here right? Ask further questions like ""What motivated you to become an engineer?"" ""What part of being an engineer is most fun to you?"""

"I suppose if you paid them extra, they'd do it. Would depend on the girl. Not all of them are into the same things. They're free agents who decide for themselves what they want to do and what not. The brothel can't make them. At the same brothel, some girls will do anal while others won't. Some are up for threesomes, others aren't. Some will offer blowjobs without a condom on, others won't. So I imagine some would lick your butthole and others wouldn't. I never asked."
"Yes - I'm sure there is some sort of law that states that ""The more embarrassing the medicalcondition/procedure, the probability of encountering an attractive nurse approaches 1""

"Mya female friend of mine was telling me about how horrible her ex was and about how he put his hands on her during their breakup argument.

Only later did she mention that when he tried walking away, she basically cornered him and wouldn’t allow him to exit the situation, all the while screaming because “He wouldn’t listen to me!!!”."
"Friend told everyone a story about how his wife called him out of the blue while he was on a long business trip, and told him she wanted a divorce. He then started dating someone new and the wife accused him in divorce court of cheating on her, since he had a new girlfriend before the divorce was final. Everyone felt sorry for him.

It turned out he wanted a divorce, but wanted to line up his next relationship before telling his wife. She found messages from the girlfriend in a joint email account, and then started the divorce. "
I both had a hernia and then later a circumcision. In both cases I had both men and women seeing or touching my junk. Somehow the fact that it's a hospital and doctors completely removed the awkwardness for me. Also most doctors are very good at de-dramatizing the event making it seem hum drum and ordinary that I'm standing with my exposed penis a few inches from a middle aged womans face while she is touching my groin and asking me to cough.

I recently had one girl explain it to me as her essentially managing my expectations. It's easier for a girl to have sex with a guy you've said you won't have sex with than to not have sex with a guy you've said you will have sex with. So she was free to decide she wanted to have sex with me if that's how she felt without feeling pressured by the expectation of sex. It essentially keeps the ball firmly in her court.

"She doesn't want more than hooking up, that's what I gather from your post.  She only wants to see you when she wants some, nothing more.  I've been in that type of ""relationship"" and understood completely what she wanted me for.  The ONLY time we saw each other was to have sex - that was it.  No movies, no hanging out, nada.  When I heard from her, it was because she wanted to fuck.  I was cool with that. 

Your sentence ""Because while I did want more, I'm fine with keeping it casual until I can't keep it casual anymore"" tells how you might be able to handle this.  You know now your place in her life and right now you're cool with that.  That's fine.  However, when you DO want more, you need to exit the relationship and find a woman that wants what you want.  "

"You're going to get a much more relaxed and intimate experience with higher price. Not rushed, more foreplay-type stuff, etc. Figure out how much they charge and how many they gotta turn to make a decent living in the city. ""Girlfriend experience"" is kinda buzzword-popular, but I think it's become very formulaic and mechanical by now for the most part. Find a girl that you like and makes you feel comfortable, if possible exchange some emails or even a phone call. You're under no obligation to do anything while you're ""shopping"". Also, I think the lower (almost impossibly low) priced ones I suspect are not doing it entirely voluntarily, there's a lot of trafficking and shady stuff going on."

"This may be me nitpicking, but I don't ""buy prostitutes""; I use their services. I know you meant no offense, but that wording is used by christian conservative politicians (yes, we have those in our country as well) to argue against prostitution.   

Overall, it's still looked down upon. There exists this cliché that men who pay for sex are creepy old ugly guys. It couldn't be further from the truth. Men of all ages and walks of life can be seen in the window areas. The girls tell me lots of their clients are married. Nevertheless, that cliché continues to exist.    

My friends know about it. They know this is just a part of my life. They're all accepting of it. I hang out with very openminded, liberal and so-called 'sex positive' people, so they're all cool with it. A lot of them are actually curious about it and will often ask me questions. Some of them have said that, prior to meeting me, they had a very different, often negative view of prostitution and the guys who use it, but that I have changed their view drastically.  

I haven't told anyone else and wouldn't either. I think my mother would be cool with it. She's very sober like that. My sister would probably het very angry with me. She has voiced very negative, judgemental opinions on 'johns' on several occasions. Co-workers really have no business knowing anything about my sexlife. A future girlfriend.... that is a tough one. One the one hand, I would want to be honest with her and have a relationship build on honesty and trust. And I know I would be pissed if I found out that she had kept something from me from her past that would be a dealbreaker to me (like, call me a hypocrite, having been a sexworker). On the other hand, I'm fairly certain most women would not want to date a man over something like that. So would I tell her? I *want* to say I would do the right thing and be honest, but I don't know for sure, if I'm completely honest."

"That example you gave is pretty mild tbh.  Glad you're giving your buddy some crud for it, it'll be good for him to know you guys still care despite his anti-social tendencies. 

Now, here's my story.  It's brief but it was pretty important to both my wife and I as a learning experience...

My wife and I had been dating for about a year - long distance as I was in one state and she was in another for school.  I really wanted to move to be with her so did.  Only to find out that most of her friends hated my fucking guts.

Long distance relationships are hard, and my wife (gf at the time) was voicing her discontent about various aspects of our conversations etc with her close circle of friends. The image her words painted of me were not flattering.

Over time, I won over her friends, but it taught us both to be careful about discussing our personal problems etc with other people.  So I went from being the bad guy, to just being a guy.  And my wife graciously ate some crow and owned up to the fact that she was only dishing out her side of our long-distance struggle."

"Yes, they have monthly checks for STD's. They don't fuck without a condom. Some of them do perform oral without condom though, if you pay extra."
"Listen, be there for her (or not if that's what she needs), and let her work through the disappointment.

&gt;I just want to make her better.

In my experience trying to make her better is not what she needs.  You know her better, but just letting her do her thing, but letting her know you're there for her often is the best thing to do."
"Reminds me of a cute high school friend who would hug me in greeting. She was shorter than me, and would turn her head a little during the hug, basically engulfing me in a cloud of whatever perfume or shampoo she used and rubbing it off on whatever shirt I was wearing. I quickly associated that smell with her and her hugging me. Just getting a hint of that smell later when I was least expecting it would put me in a daze thinking about how cute and nice she is."
"This isn't a joke. *you* can't. The only way to take a decent picture of a dick requires either a lot of set up, or a good friend.

That being said, your best bet is to take a bunch and pick the best ones. 

Make sure the lighting is even, but not too bright. 

Avoid the typical crap you'll see on r/gonewild where the guys basically just choke the hell out of their junk at the base in a vain attempt to make it look bigger.

Framing and background matter. Don't just sit on the toilet and point down. If you can get a decent contrasting background, you'll have a better result. But skin tone is what determines that, so it's difficult to make a recommendation. If your pinkish or peach toned, a light blue will work great though.

And don't just make it a picture of your dick. It's fine to do the occasional close up, but you'll be better off having more of your body in the shot. I like a nice partial side view, where the hip is at the bottom of the frame. If you angle so that the camera is also slightly above the penis, you can get a really nice effect where both the  shape of your cock and the curve of it is enhanced. 

Keep your hands out of the frame entirely unless there's just no other way to get it done (like if you're pudgy enough that the mound is in the way). Even the cocks that lay against the belly when erect look better without a hand in the frame. And too often, when a hand is there, there's the urge to do something with it. A dick pic shouldn't be a still frame from masturbation unless that's what was requested. Having your hand touching at all rarely looks right, so it's better to avoid it.

Shadows are your friend. It works better for Caucasian range skin tones, but being able to see the shadow of the penis against the skin in the background gives a better sense of depth and aliveness that turns it from just another dick pic into a decent erotic picture.

Again, lighting is important. Too much and it looks washed out and more like cheap porn. Not enough and you miss the variations of skin tone. If it's too focused, you end up with shadows in the wrong places, too diffuse and there's no sense of depth. No fluorescent lighting if possible. Even incandescent is better for lighting a dick. You'd need  to get both warm and cool fluorescent bulbs to keep it from looking strange. But natural lighting is much, much better.

While it tends to be desired to have a fully erect, nearly throbbing state, there's a lot to be said for having a few that are half mast as well. The beauty of a cock isn't only found in erections. Even a limp shot can be very erotic to the right eye. "
"Generally speaking, swear words represent taboo concepts in society.  In medieval England when that word was created it was just the normal, completely non offensive word for the body part.  In those days no swear words were about bodily functions because nobody had any privacy, and even sex was something that you regularly saw other people doing because of the way people lived communally.  Back then offensive swear words were all about God and religion and were called oaths.  Chaucer uses the word cunt quite a bit because it wasn’t offensive.

When people started to have bedrooms around 1600 body parts, bodily functions and sex started being taboo and swear words around those concepts began to be used.  Wealthier people wanted to distinguish themselves as less vulgar so started to use Latin words to mention their unmentionables.  Hence cunt became a dirty word and vagina replaced it as inoffensive.  Fuck came into the language then from a Dutch word.  This peaked around the Victorian era but since then, these concepts have started to become less offensive once again.

Society is still changing with modern taboos taking over.  Racial epithets have gone from being considered inoffensive 100 years ago to being our most powerful swear words.   In the US it seems that cunt may have morphed from a word which is offensive  because of obscenity to a word associated with a gender slur.  This appears not to be the case in the UK/Australia because of slight differences in the way it was used.

TLDR Identity now powers the taboos in our society, and also our swear words."

"&gt; If you feel shy around guys, or feel apprehensive when you are attracted to a guy.

To be honest, yes this is true about me. I was made fun of for the way I look for *years*, and guys never even seemed interested in *befriending* me either (they would only talk to me if they had to for school, or to insult me for my appearance). It is only very recently that I have started getting attention for my looks (the type where people just flat-out give me the type of compliments I talked about in my OP), and that guys don't seem totally repelled by me. But I honestly still feel kind of ashamed if I feel attraction towards a guy, because I worry about annoying him or something, or because I assume by default that he won't like me."
Assume she's checking out some guy standing behind you and do nothing.
This exactly. Do not get in a vehicle and expect to keep your composure when she begins talking and asking about her son. This gives her a quiet place to privately grieve until she is ready to take her next steps forward. Sorry for your loss.

Luckily my dad was really supportive, and in the first few months he would take vacation time from his job to accompany her to site visits so that I could be with him while she was on site - essentially keeping me a secret. She would excuse herself, them pump some milk and dash to my dad in the car with me so I could be fed before going back to the clients. It was crazy! She had nerves of steel and grit for days."

"In my experience I think 90% of dudes who are obsessive with forming relationships with women are lacking some sort of passion/hobby. 

Now i don't know you, i dont know anything about you, but in my little circle of 10-12 guys 6 of them all share a handful of traits, namely:

1. They're all decently attractive

2. They really don't do much outside of School/Work/Videogames

What thay boils down to is a bunch of guys who feel like they should be getting girls because of their looks and personality but fail because they dont have any substance. Its that little give that ""I COULD/SHOULD be getting a girl but im not"" that makes people desperate.

I'm not saying if you take a cooking class you're going to be tenderizing her meat but it certainly helps. 

The big thing is finding rewarding hobbies that you like, going back on my previous statement: No, dont take a cooking class to get with women.
The whole point is to do things in spite of girls and other people in general. Video games are common but they aren't really rewarding, there's nothing to show for them and not that many people -really- care about your performance. 

Instruments, woodworking, painting. These are all things people do because you get what you put into them and come out with something to show for it. Not only does it make your life more than finding a partner, eventually when you do find someone you're serious about you have something actually about you that'll make you come off as way more interesting.

Its the mentality that kills guys, they think they NEED a girl and they get desperate after a while of not having one. 

Make your life about something other than women and don't take up a hobby just to make women THINK you care about stuff other than women.

I dont know you, i dont know what you're into. The rest is up to you

"While I'm not a guy (20F, studying software engineering!) I thought I might chip in as a fellow girl having gone through this problem. We seem to have a lot in common.

I'm not ""skinny"", I'm more of a lean muscular. I'm not overweight at all, I guess I'm ""thick"" but not the kind of thick that Instagram shows lol. I have long pretty hair, and I dress pretty feminine. A couple years ago I didn't dress that feminine, I was very basic, so guys didn't approach me as much. Now, I get approached quite a bit, but not that much. However I'd like to note I do have a LDR boyfriend now.....after many years of feeling the loneliness you feel.

Ill try to keep this short as I can.

1) My guy friends never admitted they liked me, but I eventually discovered pretty much every single guy friend was interested in me. I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago, and after that a lot of my guy friends slowly stopped talking to me. Why? Because they were interested, but respected me enough not to pursue super hard. Now I'm taken, and the interest is gone. There's no chase for them. It sounds super egotistical but why else would you stop being my friend if we really were just 'friends' to you? If they're good to you, there is a good chance they are interested. My boyfriend even told me this: ""More often than not, I am friends with a girl I could be potentially interested in dating, because they are the people I like best"". Also, obviously since you're single this is gonna be hard to tell but I thought I'd say it anyways. 

2) You will be surprised how many guys actually like you. You seem relatable, smart, and in the same field. Of course the one guy or two you ask might decline. But that doesn't mean you wont eventually find someone who likes you back.

3) 90% of my engineering friends date other engineers. It only makes sense, there's so much more in common and you understand each other. Your guy friends might screw girls from clubs but that doesn't mean they want a relationship with them, and often, it's not the case (or so I've read and heard). If they want someone easy, they can have them. But treating you like a FWB is not what they want, so you're not gonna get the reaction you're expecting. If they want a relationship with you they're not gonna sabotage your friendship for something like 'hey bb want sum fuk' like they do to random chicks at bars.

4) Btw, even if they pick up girls at bars, it doesn't mean they're bad people. Plenty of people are okay with FWBs and ONS but that doesn't mean they're incapable of being loyal and having a monogamous, loving relationship. They're just waiting for the right girl to show interest.. and it could be you.

Me and my boyfriend are long distance so it sucks ass. But I found someone amazing and I never settled.

Whatever you do, don't settle to feel loved because after a while you won't feel that way. I hope you find someone that truly cares about you. Good luck :). 

I'm sorry if my English sucks I'm super tired, hope this helps! Of course this is only my own experience (and I don't speak for all men). I hope I don't offend anyone!"
"You sound exactly like me 4 years ago. Plenty of male friends, never had a boyfriend or even a fling, no idea what was wrong with me but convinced it was *something* so felt guilty and like I was imposing if I was crushing on someone. It may be unpopular here but honestly online dating was a very positive experience for me. It's socially acceptable to straight up message someone if you find them attractive and most guys are receptive (definitely in part due to the gender imbalance). Once you've gone on a few dates the ""I'm undateable"" feeling starts to wear off."

"I’m vegetarian and my boyfriend is not. He was unsure what to make me as well. We made it a cooking date. I showed him how I cook and it was pretty fun. Helped him learn how to cook for me as well.

If you’re really struggling breakfast for dinner is a go to. Super easy to do homemade waffles/pancakes/French toast, fruit, breakfast potatoes, and eggs (if she eats eggs).

Weve made eggplant parm, vegetarian lasagna, veggie burgers and fries (he had a regular burger), chili (I take my portion out before we add meat), twice baked potatoes (my half without bacon), lots of pasta dishes, spaghetti (mine with just sauce and his with meatballs), we’ve done honey garlic tofu for me and honey garlic shrimp for him, cranberry and feta salad (his with chicken).

"The shy guys have struggled, they're not in a good place now that they're in their 30's, The guys who are introverted but well socialised are doing just as well as everyone else, and a couple of the poorly socialised extroverts are doing badly.

Introversion merely means that socialising is a drain on your energy, whereas extroverts are energised by socialising. Introverts who struggle are not struggling because they're introverted, they're struggling because they are asocial or poorly socialised. 

Reddit does not know the difference. I see this absolutely everywhere."

The last time I was invited to stay at a girls place it went well and we ended up banging. The first

"Real talk. She might think you're being ridiculous, but if she doesn't give you the space for that and is just completely turned off by it, then y'all won't be a good couple.

"I had a girlfriend like this.  One day I just declared ""It's Suzy Has To Pick Day.""  (Not her real name.)  I told her that she had to pick everything, I was making no decisions that day.

She said ""Okay, we're going to eat at the Olive Garden.""  I said ""Great!""  She asked ""Is that okay?""  I said ""You picked it, so it's okay.""

It turned out that she'd spent most of her life just afraid of choosing anything for fear of being wrong.  Making her pick everything for the day and supporting all her choices worked out well for helping her make up her mind.

We split up a while later, over some various incompatibilities, but last I saw her she was still able to make a decision.

"For someone who isn't socialized properly, the gaps are pretty damn small. The way we're taught to look at relationships (both genders) seems rather iffy. Either we need to revert back to the traditional structure of relationships (not gonna happen) or we need to teach that those structures aren't the norm anymore."
This is why I categorically have no opinion on any conflict I didn't hear the other side off.
"Nah, they just hold it in and it comes out as drama."

"36, fat and in a job I don’t really like. Here’s what I did. 

Went to Yellowstone camping for a few days with no internet. It really allows your mind to think. 

Read a lot. I read about minimalism on the trip. I came home and purged 90% of my stuff and made a few grand I pumped into debt. Clear space, clear mind. 

Cut the bullshit. Remove toxic people and start hanging with positive people. I know “it’s so hard to meet new people” guess what? Self improvement is all about taking chances and being uncomfortable. 

Get a hobby and find a community that shares these hobbies. You’ll find positive people that share your interests and you’ll probably make new, positive friends!!

At the end of the day it’s all action and it’s all you. Don’t think about hitting the gym or going on a run. Fucking do it. Make a list of shit you want to do that day and get it done. For example, I get up at 7am everyday and the second my alarm goes off I jump until outta bed, chug water and brush my teeth. I’m up and running. 

No one will do more for you, look out for you or push you more than yourself it’s all in you homie so get off reddit, go run, read some good books, put down the fork and start dreaming. Finally, claw your way to those dreams and don’t let yourself down. Stay determined. Stay hungry. "

"Well I've done this a couple of times and my explanation isn't as interesting as everyone else's, but normally it's because I'm legitimately not in the mood at that moment. If I'm tense, or tired, or just generally 'mnyeh' I prefer to give the guy a heads up so that he doesn't feel like I just teased him for the whole night. However, it often happens that at some point during the evening I'll relax a bit, or maybe the making out and touching will get me a bit more revved up, and I'll just end up changing my mind.

To be perfectly honest, my main motivation when I say this is so I don't end up disappointing the guy. It's dumb but I feel like if I don't ""warn"" him about the lack of sex, he'll leave my place pissed off or something."

In this era of online dating, people are so ready to just swipe left that they don't give anyone a chance to build chemistry.

Second was local. Young, but overweight and not that great looking. All smiles and laughs, no bad feelings, but unfortunately I just couldn't get into her because I wasn't attracted to her. $100 for BJ and doggystyle. "

The guy just posted a detailed, very honest, very nuanced introspective about the thoughts swirling in his head. Of course it is a bit hypocritical. But also a very normal thing to feel. Society conditions us. What is accepted as a norm makes us accept it too. For instance, in an ideal world, all men would understand that we don't have to subscribe to the pursuit of stereotypically manly traits. But, as it exists, the world judges us for it, and so, most men carry these wearisome expectations around. Further, he didn't Same with paying for sex. It's a complicated thing, and our society-imposed prejudices cannot be just wished away.

"He got married.

I used to travel the world with my best friend, go kayaking, ride dirt bikes, hang out on the regular. He met this girl, got married and basically turned into Ned Flanders.. the rare times I do get to see him he doesn't even swear. 

He seems legitimately happy though.. so I can't really fault him for it. :("
"I just skimmed through a few pages of your posts and comments. 

I know the internet (and reddit specifically) is a fantastic place to vent; I do it too. But do you complain as much in real life as you do on here? That's a major turnoff, no matter how good you look or any of the other factors people are presenting here.

You've posted this question (phrased differently) several different times to different types of audiences. I have a feeling you might be coming off as desperate. 

Also, what are these ""girly hobbies"" you keep alluding to?"
"* She's bad at decisions

* She thinks it's more of a date if you decide

* She's afraid of choosing a restaurant you won't like 

Why are you driving two hours to meet a woman you don't know and who you can't even have the simplest conversations with? Or is this some sort of Jerry Seinfeld style humour like ""*whats* the deal with airline food/women never choosing where to eat?"" Because it's a tired old joke and women choose where to eat all the fuckin' time you know. "
"I like the smell of my boyfriend. So I'm constantly smelling him as well. When he leaves to work in the morning, I roll over to his side of the bed and fall back asleep in his scent. It's weird but it relaxes me and makes me happy, idk how to explain it."

"Few years ago I was having a blood in my poo.  So go to doctor and I knew the finger was gonna happen.  Now my doctor is a 100lb 5.5"" tiny little fella BUT on this day he happen to be training a doctor student who was about 25 year old woman, not attractive but not ugly.  So he asks me if I mind if she stays in the room for the exam and I just blurt out ""no that's fine"" before really realizing what I agreed to.  So doc has me bend over the exam table and female doc takes a position in front of me and we made long awkward eye contact while the doc fingers my bhole.  If I ever see this woman in public I'll jump in front of the nearest moving vehicle.

Also last year I got injured at work and had to get a blood clot check done, basically this really cute nurse takes me into a dark room has me pull my short up on my right leg just to the point of my junk then takes this warm lubricated thing and starts rubbing it near my junk.

Hi. 
I go on reddit.  I hide this (well somewhat) from my wife because she’s convinced I’ll be radicalised by MRAs.  She thinks reddit is basically a cesspool but in my experience it greatly depends on the sub.
"Right now, all I really want in life is an apartment, a girl, a job, some good scotch, new books, and a dog in no particular order. That's my short-term goal in roughly five years.

My long-term goal is to define my mission in life based on what I receive during my short term goals, so that's kind of up in the air at the moment."
well the internet is for porn. 
"That's maybe because any woman who says ""I am looking for sex"" on the Internet would suffer a deluge of ""ayy BB u Wan sum fuk"" and ""show bobs and vagene"""
"If it's something she can't control, then no. There was one girl I saw and she was really lovely, a med student, caring, really thoughtful. One of the biggest reasons I wasn't attracted to her was the fact that she had no breasts at all. 

Like they were practically non existent. I was kind of fooled because she wore a deceptive bra and when I actually saw her naked I was pretty disappointed. I felt like such a shallow asshole and I couldn't tell her. "
"The comment is definitely true, but I don't think there is a single right answer. Especially when you're young and trying to figure out who you are and what you like about yourself. 

There are times in my life where I've been immensely thankful for the woman I was with, but also times where being single was the right choice because I needed to build out different parts of my personal/professional self on my own."

"I'm going to be honest with you. You will have better luck with Sikh or Shia Muslim women than you will with ""western"" women. I define ""western"" women as white, black or Spanish women that are either christian, jewish or non-religious. 

This is not because of anything other than the fact that we are naturally more comfortable around things that we are familiar with. If you are just moving over to the US from your native country, then you are naturally not going to have a lot of the same mannerisms and behaviours that are common in North America or Europe. Just like I would stick out in India. I'd not expect to find an Indian woman as easily as a local would, nor should you expect the same coming this direction.

Your best bet is going to be to study up on speech patterns, hobbies and other ""western"" culture to fit in as quickly as possible if you want to date western women with any amount of success. "

"Pretty goddamn well. Every person I've dated (including my wife) has come from my social circle or at least been a friend of a friend.

Of course, this does mean my circle is pretty damn incestuous at this point, with most of us having dated or hooked up with a bunch of people that others in the group have, but it's made for a tightly-knit group that I wouldn't change for the world."

"The name is so fitting.

Gently clenching the cold metal strips of the bed frame, he sat waiting anxiously in the strip-lit doctor's examination room, alone. With only a spotted hospital gown and plastic name bracelet for clothing, he struggled to remember a time when he felt more vulnerable. 

The silence was broken by the crisp metallic clunk of the door handle, and in through the void stepped a figure shrouded in white. Startled by the noise, he darted his eyes towards the newly opened door and was frozen stiff by the confirmation of his worst possible fears.

The nurse, a lithe yet generously proportioned redhead with an everso slightly upturned nose and green, almond-shaped eyes addressed him with the soft-toned casual indifference one might pay a young child who had just turned up for their piano lesson. 

""Right then, if you could just lean to one side and spread your buttocks for me so I can take a look up there.""

He despondently looked at the shiny plastic floor, then his own open palms, before gazing to the heavens as if to address his capricious, teasing creator.

""Ugh, dude... why?"""

"Majority of nursing students normally fail at first exam due to a lot of stress and anxiety of trying to pass. I'm a nurse who also failed at my first exam because I was over thinking a lot of my answers and ended up spending way too much time in each question that I ran out of time. Passed the 2nd exam with flying colors. Like your gf, I was also pretty devastated, cried my eyes out, etc. Just console her as much as you can and let her know there is always the 2nd attempt and she can use the next few months in between exams to study more and focus on what she thought she did wrong. Tell her not to give up hope as there are more chances to turn it around."
"Was me, a long time ago.

Anger issues happen (or at least in my case) because men are taught to not cry, and therefore to not process emotion, and eventually to not feel emotion. There are no other emotions besides anger. Laughter happens, but there's no warmth or softness inside. Relationships are less about enjoying security and trust and more about protecting what's yours. Friendship is just people that know how to not set you off.

Something happens that causes great pain? The only two available responses are dissociation and rage. Someone dies, someone leaves, a job is lost- the only emotional tool available is rage. Fight, or work out, or scream and punch walls to get the pain out. Crying isn't an option. It becomes instinct to choke back tears, even when alone, even when they're desperately needed.

The rest of life sort of fades away into this grey haze of suppressed emotion. Memories are hard to recall because there aren't any strong emotions associated with them, and when there are strong emotions they're mostly negative, like anger or emotions that provoke anger; shame, helplessness, etc. Numbing techniques become paramount to avoid ""all"" emotion because the only ones felt are negative. Alcohol, food, video games, TV, drugs, sex, whatever works to distract from the terrible things that bubble to the surface in silence.

TL;DR it sucks pretty fucking hard. It takes huge effort to get out of that situation."

"This is truth. Everytime my family goes to her mums place an I have a weekend to myself I have these grand plans laid out. Sleep late, Stay naked, day drink, eat shite food, play video games, watch sports, stay up late. Just like the good ol bachelor days, All uninterrupted by kids or wife. I wind up waking up on regular time. Do my chores and laundry. Then I find myself not even opening a beer until my regular after supper time. Play a few hours of video games or watch some sports. Not drink heavily. Go to bed at a sensible hour and repeat. Meanwhile I have been missing me wife and kids this whole time. 

You are right. Life is so much better now. "

Not worth it."

"She talked to me everyday and told me everything. Then she brought in some homemade cupcakes for me. And then she asked me to come over her house.  When I didn’t come over, she told me in a very knowing way, that she had to take things into her own hands.

When I did finally visit her home, she answered the door in lingerie.  Then I finally realized what was going to happen next.  She took me to her dark bedroom and asked for a massage."

"&gt;So does it work both ways for you?

I had one rule with this girl in California: I am your number 1. You are my number 1. If we're out and about and bump into someone else that we've slept with, we will treat them as friends and nothing more. 

I preferred to be honest with ""other"" women about our situation, and made it a point to show them my GF's facebook page so they could message her if they felt the need to verify. I also explained the rule, so if they saw us out together, I would be off limits that night outside of a friendly capacity. 

My GF didn't have the same policy, partly because guys don't really need to be reassured I'm ok with her fucking them or not, and partly because it kept the competition to a minimum. I had a few of her guy friends threaten me over FB (and once in person, lol) claiming I was banging their chick.


Well one night she broke the rule. We were at our FAVORITE dive bar. I mean we knew everyone from the bartender, to the owner, to the door guy on a first name basis. We probably knew 30 odd people by name there that night. So we're getting kind of tipsy, and my GF jumps up off the bench we were sitting on and runs over to an ""other"" guy. 

....and starts making out with him right in front of me. Now I've got about... I'd say close to 8 good friends looking at me in abject horror. Just not really understanding what is going on. I'm sitting there, turning red from embarrassment, and a little bit jealous from having our nice evening interrupted in this fashion. 

I just sat there and waited. And watched. And waited. And watched.  They eventually parted and she led him inside to, I assume, get another drink. They weren't gone for but a minute when I hear a commotion from inside. One of my bar buddies had confronted the guy asking him if he knew this girl was dating me. He had no idea. In fact he thought HE was her only ""guy friend"". Dude comes back outside, locks eyes with me, and demands to know ""Is she your girlfriend?""

I raised my empty glass and with a bitter smile I said, ""As of 3 minutes ago, not anymore. She can come get her clothes tomorrow afternoon."" 

After that it was a blur of whoops and hollers of laughter, my now ex pleading with me, this guy being really confused about who to be angry with, and the bartender calling me a taxi while I smoked outside with the door guy. 

My ex was banned from coming to the bar anymore, since she'd caused more than one ruckus stemming from sleeping with multiple men. 

For better or worse, I've been predominantly single ever since. I don't even attach labels anymore. Just tell the women, ""Do what you do, but be safe about it.""

I think everyone is capable of open relationships, but we get hung up too much on what should be tolerable, and not enough on how we can live that lifestyle without hurting anyones feelings. A lot of folks aren't up front because they don't want to lose their chance at sex. It's much easier to find the people that are down with it, if you're open and honest (and follow the rules). 

tl;dr  it works both ways, as long as everyone agrees on how it works. "

"Stay in shape. Exercise regularly. Hit the gym. Hire a trainer, or look it up online and do it yourself. But schedule your workouts in your calendar (You got one of those too right?) and do them. Get a friend to be your workout buddy, or pay somebody to count your reps just so you're accountable to go. Find some sport or physical activity that'll get your cardio in and commit to it regularly. Make sure it's something you enjoy or you won't do it. Dropping 15 lbs of actual fat is fairly easy at 21 years old than it is at 41 years old, so keep it off if at all possible. 

Learn to cook for yourself. No, pizza rolls and Mac n Cheese doesn't count. Sear a steak on the BBQ, Bake chicken, steam vegetables, learn to make sauces and use spices correctly. Get some tupperware and meal prep some lunches for yourself. 

Get your shit together. Figure out where you want to be in 5/10 years and make a plan on how to get there. Finish school and make a list of things to do with deadlines in order to get moving on your career path. I know too many 29-something year olds that are still working in the same bar they were when they were 21 simply because it's easy to keep doing the same thing. 

Get some style. As dudes, it's easy to continue to wear sloppy jeans and grubby sneakers because we think it doesn't matter, but it does. As much as it's unfair that we're judged by our bookcover, we are. It's how people work. Go to a real hair stylist (Not the Sportclips bullshit) that charges more than $12 and ask them to recommend a style for your hair type and facial features. Figure out if you want a beard or mustache and learn how to groom it properly. Go to an actual clothing store...Not friggin' Walmart, and ask for help. Assume you don't know shit about what looks good on you (because you don't) and let them help you out. You'll spend more, but you'll look and feel better knowing you're wearing the right stuff. And clothes fit better when you're not fat. (See paragraph #1) 

You don't have to have a lot of money to be happy. Figure out what gets you smilin' and do that. You should already be contributing to your retirement, if you're not get on that. $50 a week is chump change, and it'll change your life when you're old. 

Spend time with people that bring you up, not tear you down. Talk to your parents and grandparents, they have lived a whole lot more life than you and listen to what they have to say. They were 20 years old at one time too. You never want to be the best player on the team, you'll never get better. Women are people just like you, so pick one that you're comfortable being yourself around. You don't have to spend every waking moment together, and it's OK if you have different interests. Pretty will come and go, but compatibility is for life. "

"I met my gf on OKCupid. We had and OK first and second date. She then went off on holiday and when she came back I was in the middle of a massive project; 80-90 hours weeks were normal and we wanted to meet up.

She came to my house and cooked me her mother's apple pie and we went for a walk in the park while I took a 3 hour break from work (this was on a Sunday).

Her cooking something special is her way of showing affection and I appreciate it. When she was ready to meet my friends she did it by cooking a 5 course meal for everyone that was from her culture.

If cooking is your thing then I think you should capitalise on it because the right man will understand the meaning behind it"
"I probably should use an alt but oh well. Before I was married with children I used to frequent hookers on Adultwork a website in the UK.

All in all i slept with 12 women?

The price wasn't important. It ranged from £80-200 an hour (exceptionally more if you wanted to have sex with a porn star.)

You could get an £80 hooker who rolled their eyes and winced at your touch. No kissing Just cold dead eyed sex. Or an £80 who talked to you and let you do all sorts.

The important thing was to do your research. 

In general all the bad experiences were with Romanian women. Eye rolling, not the woman in the ad, in big houses with scary looking dudes in the next room.

 Every woman has her preferences listed. You want to anally fist a prostitute or shit on her chest. There's a woman who will do it. If there is a huge list of no nos and a tiny list of things they will do with ""(at discretion)"" next to them. That is going to be a clock watching eye rolling hooker. 

Ultimately the best lady I was with was from Poland and we had a good chat after. But I wouldn't say I really enjoyed it. The thrill/fear was incredible and what kept me coming back. But ultimately I couldn't shake the feeling of being a fat loser paying for sex. One day I came back from a session feeling like a total loser. Drunk the majority of a bottle of whiskey and just cried.

That day started a diet and lifestyle change which lead me to being happiest I have ever been and meeting my wife and having kids. "

Took someone 20 minutes to explain the difference between two recurring emails to her. Painful to watch. Anyway, when she gets drunk she tends to talk frequently about how bad her home life is and how bad her seven year itch is. Like, overt enough where other ladies are putting her on the train before she makes a mistake. If she was single I would be all up ins. But I don't want to get fired, and I don't want some irate husband after me, and I generally think cheating is shitty AF. Still, I bet that dark box is awesome. "

It was a party of all of his friends, this was her first meeting any of them.
