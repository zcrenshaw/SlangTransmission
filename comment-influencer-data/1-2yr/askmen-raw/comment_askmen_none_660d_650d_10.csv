"I can post here because I bought the Social Media Package. Suck it, poors.

I know that caring isn't cool on askmen, but seriously [go here and call your representative, senator, and Ajit Pai](https://www.battleforthenet.com/?subject=net-neutrality-dies-in-one-month-unless-we-stop-it).  I know talking to people is hard and there was a woman's voice on the line which is intimidating to some of you, but they give you a script and everything so you don't even have to think, you can just awkwardly stammer out what they tell you to say and then you can think about how you finally had social interaction. 

If you're European and thinking ""hurr durr I'm European this doesn't apply to me"", just think about how awful it is being alone with yourself right now and imagine that you had to deal with that all the time on Reddit because there were no Americans to make fun of. If you're Asian or Australian or whatever, the same applies."
"Met a guy who put out cigarettes on his hand without flinching. When asked him what the fuck? He said, “if I’m willing to give myself cancer, then I should be man enough to burn myself for it.”"
I got big eyebrows. Some girl walked over to me one night in a club and said I was like a sexy owl.
"Ex-wife (spoiler alert?) was drunk after a staff xmas party, I'm driving home, she's angry that I dragged her sloppy-drunk ass outta there to take her home before things went completely off the rails.

She's raging at me while I'm driving - and I'm doing my best to ignore her - and when she sees that I'm not taking her bait at all, she starts shoving me and punching me in the shoulder, and not in a 'ha ha, you're cute' manner, but in a ""FUCK YOU PAY ATTENTION TO ME!"" way.

I abruptly pulled over to the shoulder and came to a screeching stop.  Grabbed her hand that was still flailing and yelled point-blank in her face ""If you want to have an argument with someone who's going to hit you back, go see your fucking dad!  Otherwise, sit tight and stfu until we get home.""

Shit did NOT go well.  (did I mention she's my ex-wife now?)"

"I know a guy my neighbors simply call “guitar boy”. He wears a black leather jacket and joggers, skateboards down the street while playing his bass guitar (no amp) and also has spiked straight up and down electric green hair. He has a friend that has red hair and does all the same things, basically no way to differentiate them other Han hair."
"I have a ton of moments... I tend to date sweet, yet crazy chicks. The biggest one:

We were watching Pirate Radio, and there's a scene where it's on of the character's birthday, so the whole crew of the pirate radio boat celebrate. As a part of the celebration they sound a horn on the ship. I was trying to be silly, and in a fake mopey voice said, ""I wish someone would sound a horn on MY birthday. Hmph.""

Fast forward a month to my birthday, and she's being SUPER adamant that I need to see her on my birthday. I've never had a gf on my birthday, so, I wasn't sure what to expect. I show up to her dorm (both were college kids, I commuted). She quickly rushes me to the courtyard behind the dorm, and everyone is looking at me as I am being rushed through. As soon as I get out she shouts, ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!"" And pulls out the... I dunno, 'horn in a can'? And sounds it off for me. I just stare at her laughing, thankful, but utterly confused. 

""This is nice, but what the fuck is up with the horn?""
"".... remember? The movie? You said you wanted a horn to sound off your birthday...."" She responded, in the most genuine sincerity and love I've ever felt until that moment. I immediately remembered me saying that, and it struck me that she remembered some stupid thing I said and made a note to ACTUALLY do it... it floored me. (Not to even forget she made me a steak, and cake, and ice cream floats). 

Probably one of the best moments "
It’s not my fault that I have friends and you don’t.
We both have good careers. Our only debt is her car however we're renting the house. We can stay out late or make last minute plans whenever we want. We take a short vacation every 2 or 3 months. It does feel kind of odd now that most of our peers have children. Sometimes I forget that my friends can't always close out the bar anymore. 
"My ""artist"" sister in law. You can't have a conversation with her without being scolded about feminism, gender, socialism, environmentalism, and racism. 

She's almost aggressively candid about her sex life, her involvement in plural relationships, and the kink community. 

Even tho she's very vocal about her disdain for traditional relationships, she recently got engaged to her dom who she describes as gender fluid, bisexual, but also asexual.

If I didn't know her I wouldn't believe she's a real person."
"Her and her mother were estranged cause her mom bailed, she hated her mom for not at least trying to make a relationship work between them and always blasted her mom for saying she loved her but didn't even try to make it work, going through the death throws of the relations ship I told her she should not be so harsh on her mom cause she was just like her.  THAT'S HOW YOU END A RELATIONSHIP BOYS. "

"Our first Christmas together, we had been dating only 3 months. 

I struggle with anxiety and depression, and although I’m a very high-functioning person, I have a lot of bad days and just want to hide after work. At the time she was a student and also worked full time, and I worked more than 60 hours a week, so we didn’t get to see each other as much as we would have liked. She couldn’t afford much for my Christmas gift, so I wasn’t expecting much at all, maybe some candy I liked. 

Nope, she filled a mason jar with hundreds of pieces of colored paper. The green ones had things she loved about me, the blue had things she loved about our relationship, and red were funny inside jokes we had. 

Literally the only gift that has ever made me cry. It felt so good to have someone actually put time and love into a gift. I kept that thing right next to my pillow, and it made me feel so warm on those lonely, cold nights in my empty apartment. 

I still have that jar and I still tear up every time I look at it. These days, I keep the jar on a shelf because she’s always next to me in bed. "
"Sometimes when we’re in bed together, I’ll have to get up to go to the bathroom or the kitchen, and she’ll just hold grip of my hand not letting me go, and she just says “don’t leave meee” in this cute tone.

When I’m driving and I put my hand on her lap, she’ll hug my arm and rest her head on my shoulder. Then when we’re at a red light, she attacks me with kisses on the cheek and lips.

It’s the shit fam."

"Went to petsmart in search of a pet.  
  
There were cats. I like cats. We looked at the cats.  
  
First cat was missing an eye. I wanted to give that cat a home. That cat was a dickhead. I knew it'd take a lot of work to get it not to be a dick. Didn't have that kind of time.  
  
Next cat.  
  
Orange fat cat. Dope cat. Wanted that cat. Tried to pet that cat. Wasn't having it. Fat lazy cat. Not a dope cat.  
  
Next cat.  
  
Rubbing itself against the glass and pawing at it. Cool cat. Stick my finger in the cage. Licks my finger. Wanna hold this cat. Held the cat. Licked my beard and face like a mother fucker. Imma cop this cat.  
  
Petco cat person is surprised. Not a nice cat allegedly. Bull shit. This a nice cat. Apparently that cat had been given a home several times and always was brough back. Had been there for one year. Definitely getting this cat.  
  
Buy a carrying case and a cat bed. Put bed in carrying case and go to get cat. She climbs in and starts making muffins on the bed and purring.  
  
She's a dope fucking cat. "

"We are dinks. We live in the Midwest where cost of living is low and both work as engineers. So combined we're around $225k right now, before bonuses. We can do the things we want to do and have the things we want to have. My husband likes to spend on vacations. I ride horses and own two. We work hard to play hard, we both travel quite a bit for work and often have our laptops open at home in the evenings, but if I want an expensive pair of shoes, I'll buy them. If we want to leave for a weekend trip at the last minute, we do. It also allows us to pay for services that have a time value to them for us like cleaning ladies and lawn maintenance. So when we are home for a weekend we can enjoy each other's company. It's a happy life style I can't see us changing anytime soon, if at all."

"We're in college, one day we're out and decide to buy a tasty treat.  It's a box of chocolates that was on heavily discounted because the box was damaged.  It goes to the section of the fridge where all the odd bits and pieces that can't fit in the other sections go.  There's a jar of Char Siu sauce, half of an onion, some multivitamins, and a bottle of water.  Time quietly trickles by and I keep picking away at the chocolates.  After the birth of our first child I help myself to a couple.  After our youngest graduated from college I discovered a Turkish delight I thought had been eaten decades ago.  The day before my 60th birthday I suffer a near fatal heart attack,  the doctor is able to save my life with a highly experimental new procedure, it's essentially an internal life support system that uses nanobots to identify and repair damage.  To keep this system running I am required to undergo hundreds of operations, adding new bits of machinery to my body, testing the boundaries of medical science.  I am dubbed the world's first android.  I watch as everybody I have ever known is ravaged by time.  The year is 2617, I am visiting my old home for the first time in centuries.  I open the fridge to find the box of chocolates to see if the last one is still there, the Mint Cream has somehow survived, I place it in my mouth and experience an intense flashback to my life as a mortal, all of my experiences, my loved ones, I am overcome by emotion and fall to the floor.  I feel a hand on my shoulder, it's my wife ""Did you eat *all* of the chocolates!? I didn't get any! Why didn't you save me some?"""

Also, it seems there are some girls out there who actually like a shaved head and a salt and pepper beard, so I'm actually noticing an improvement in my luck on that front."

I would rather jerk off than ever have sex with you again!
"Dated for many years, had several long term relationships, never felt right, always had to justify being in the relationship.

I broke it off with my last long term SO,  took about 6 months to myself. Decided to quit dating, quit looking around, start lifting, eat right, and save money.

Then my bank decided to hit me with 3 overdraft fees, even though I had funds to cover it in my second account with them, and refused to help me out or at least just charge me one.

Went into the bank to fix it, the branch manager was a total bitch (come to find out, she gets complaints on the regular.)

Came back on a day she wasn’t working to close my accounts with them, I was done.

I got sat down to this cute blonde girl I had seen before, but never initiated contacted.

We chatted, laughed, and she reversed all my fees! So I left her my business card with my number and asked her to contact me if she wanted to go grab a coffee or something.

The next day she texted, and we haven’t spent a day apart since :)

Intact, we just moved in together last week!

I feel way more comfortable with her than anyone else before, and I truly love this woman, as she does me. Everything just clicks, without having to make it click. It feels natural :)

Never been happier in a relationship! And I wasn’t supposed to even date her! I just had a mighty feeling of need to leave my card.

So glad I did!"

"A morning blowy takes the cake. I'd say it beats sex by a long shot since you don't *need* to hold out. But the best and worst morning I've ever had was when my girl woke me up with a little mouth game and just when I was enjoying it the most, she stops, rests her head in her palm and stared out the window and said ""*sigh, I don't really want to do this"", and just rolled over and started to sleep again.

It was like waking up Christmas morning and running downstairs to see all the presents under the tree but instead find the remains of your parents and in their blood, smeared on the wall, you find ""there is no Santa"""
"I called her a blob. Guy's, NEVER call your girlfriend a blob. "
She woke me up with a phone call and broke up with me. I was already done and was going to break up that day. Best phone call ever. Enjoyed the fuck out of the rest of the day and the rest of my life now. Fuck you Jessika.
"Recently broke up. Why am I reading this.

"Less wasted energy. You spend more time ""doing"" instead of ""thinking about doing.""  You also kind of realize that thinking about doing something is often times more mentally draining that actually following through with something. "
"I spot miscommunications between two other people speaking when both speaker and listener both think they were on the same page but were not, and then can clarify “they were saying this (rephrase more simply to understand, but I think you heard this (explain what they seem to be thinking), I wanted to make sure there was no misunderstanding there.”
I’m spot on 99% or the time. Both people look at me like I’m a magician.


Once my FIL had a stroke, he still cannot speak, but has full cognitive function. Days afterward in the hospital we were visiting and he is trying to communicate a question. Everybody is asking “do you want this?” And holding crap up for him. Nurse or doctor was in the room, and I used the context of the entire situation plus some empathy to figure it out. I had been silent to this point and then said “you want to know were in you’re going home, don’t you?” He emphatically pointed to me, and nodded. The entire room “how did you get that!?” 

It’s my superpower.

That and always being able to fix or solve a problem very quickly. Including making implements mcguyver style for almost anything. "

"Went to the animal shelter nearest to my house with the intent of getting a puppy. When I got there, *all* of the puppies they had, about 7 or 8, were visiting with other potential adopters or were adopted already and just had not been picked up.

Two of my roommates had come with me. They were super down with me getting a dog because then they would get all the cool benefits like snuggling without having to do the unfun stuff, like paying for food. They brought up that there was another shelter about 20 minutes away, so we went there.

This shelter was in the back of a Petsmart, and wasn't very big. They had a few older rescues, but it seemed like they didn't have any puppies. Then I saw her. The only puppy there, a nine week old red heeler. She had just been spayed the day before, so she didn't have a ton of energy. She saw me standing at the end of the cage and did this kind-of sliding move to push herself towards me. Watching her do that did it. I had to have her. One of the people there let me hang out with her for a second, and just holding her for a moment cemented that I needed to get her.

The four year anniversary of getting her passed at the end of October. She's coy when she wants attention. She'll get up on the couch on the opposite end of where I'm sitting, huffing and snorting until I tell her to come over, at which point she'll do the same sliding move that first stole my heart to nestle her head against my hip.

"Bi guy here. I've found that women are harder to make orgasm for sure. Most women do not orgasm from penetration alone, so the clitoris is a big part of achieving a female orgasm. The thing can be very tiny and covered by a hood, so keeping track of it using your hands or mouth can sometimes be a challenge. Then sometimes direct stimulation is too sensitive, so you gotta get a sweet spot that feels perfect for her. Each vagina is a new learning curve because they don't all like the same thing. Obviously giving her an orgasm becomes easier the more you have sex with her and you learn her body."

"$500 a day is about $15,000 a month or $180,000 a year. I don't have expensive enough tastes to spend money that fast.

I would move into a nicer apartment, eat more restaurant meals, buy a kickass gaming PC and a home theater setup for sports viewing, but I'd have everything I ever wanted within two months max.

After that, I'd be perfectly content living on 20 or 30 bucks a day in spending money like I do when I'm treating myself (I otherwise have a daily spend more like 10-15 bucks on average.) That money would pile up fast."
"I called her ""Boo"" once.  Now she calls me ""Kitty"" like it's my name.  I didn't understand it for the longest time until she sat me down and we watched Monster's Inc together.  I'd seen it before, but I never made the connection.

I'm gonna marry this one."

"None of the girls I've dated have ever tried to appreciate or understand my schooling or hobbies. I'm a pretty big textbook nerd; I'm a mech. eng. student so I deal with lots of maths, and I love designing stuff as a hobby, as well as playing games in my free time. 

Fast forward to this magical lady, she encourages me to do my hobbies, like designing, or school work when it involves programming instruction sets because she likes to watch me work. She asks questions and I answer, and it feels like she's really genuinely interested in me as a person on a grander level than anyone else has ever been. 

So yesterday I 3D-printer her an R2D2, as part of an inside joke we have about Star Wars. She was so excited and happy about it she asked if she could print something too, so I walked her through the steps and printer her a pineapple. (her favorite fruit) 

Later that day, she asked if we could do facemasks and watch a movie sometime, and I said absolutely. But then she said ""And you should teach me to play games too, I want to learn to play.""

I've literally never been in a situation where someone wanted to be so involved in my hobbies and interests. It's so refreshing that someone is actually there to talk about all the little things I want to talk about, whether important or not. 

Also good news, her dad doesn't want to kill me yet so I'm hoping to keep her around for a while. 👌"

"I was in a shitty punk band when I was a bit younger and got to know some of the guys other local bands in the scene.

For the uninitiated, the punk scene tends to play up the whole elitist *""if you don't do _____ you can't call yourself a **real** _____""* motif to an extreme sometimes. Anyways I met a guy in one of these bands who had gotten himself addicted to crack cocaine for no other reason than being addicted to crack seemed a real punk rock thing to do. I've also heard stories of people in some of these scenes choosing to live as homeless people, because you're not a **real punk** if you go back to a nice cozy bed at night or something like that.

"Something I said recently, actually.

I went to Denver for a few days to see a friend, hang out, etc. When I got home, first night I was just messing around on my phone in bed. She was talking to me about something and got upset I was listening and looking at my phone. She said something like ""I just wanted to talk to you because I've missed you a lot since you were gone."". In response I just got frustrated and said ""Oh my fucking god, *&lt;wifes_name&gt;*, it was four fucking days.""."

"This guy I went to school with named Paul. He would show up to school wearing a gas mask with his headphones on that were so loud blasting grindcore music that you could hear it across the room. 

He was an overly racist neckbeard who was always wearing shirts with wolves or flaming skulls on it. His MySpace profile picture was him pointing an airsoft gun at the camera with the caption ""THE NEW THREAT"". 

I had a history class next to him and our last names were very alphabetically close together so I ended up sitting next to him. I tried to give him a chance but all he wanted to do was talk about smoking weed and his gun collection. At that point, I just tried to be friendly to him because he was definitely the type of kid who would show up to school with a rifle and just start blasting away. 

A few days after Virginia Tech happened, somebody left a school shooting threat written on a bathroom stall and the school got locked down for the next week. Paul never overly admitted to it, but he asked me if he knew who did it and then kind of chuckled when I said no. I suspect it was him. 

He eventually ended up getting kicked out for something having to do with making racist comments to a group of black girls. I remember my friend and I getting kicked out of my mythology class and having to sit in the hallway and then a few classrooms over, Paul, the teacher whatever class it was, in this group of black girls were all yelling at each other over something racist he allegedly said in the classroom towards them. After that day I never saw Paul again."

"Before I stopped using Online dating sites, I compiled a massive list of things I was fed up of seeing. 

The idea was to make a Bingo card out of it, so the next time my friends and I were together, we'd figure out how to make a drinking game out of the damn thing. Now bear in mind, I'm not saying outright that these things are terrible, just that they're common enough to be generic past a point. 

Here's the list:

1. Loves to Travel
2. ""Adventures""
3. Picture of girl at Machchu Pichchu
4. Atleast one photo of them as a bridesmaid in their friends wedding (23 years and above only) Bonus points if the bridesmaid's dress is so hideous *you* itch just looking at it.
5. The Office Reference - ""I'm not superstitious...I'm a little stitious""
6. The Office Reference #2 - ""Looking for the Dwight/Jim to my Jim/Pam""
7. ""Not looking for hookups"". On a hookup app.

11. ""Tall guys only""/""You must be atleast six feet to ride ;)""
12. ""Netflix""
13. ""Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.""
14. They don't connect their instagram to their Tinder account, but do list it as the only thing in their bio.
15. The montage - Every single picture is with them in a group and you just knowit's going to be the least attractive one in the gaggle.
16. Bot.
17. ""Yes, the ankle-biter in that picture is my darling boy/girl and they come first in my life."" Depending on the area, the number of single mums goes up dramatically.
18. Yoga pants picture
19. Absolutely horrendous taste in Spotify music
20. ""Just ask!""
21. Their height. Bonus points : Mention ""...since people seem to list it on their profiles.""
22. Their MBTI type - i.e. INTP, ENFP, etc.
23. Their Horoscope sign
24. ""Foodie""
25. (If nerdy) Least obscure Star Wars reference.
26. ""Wine and cheese for days""
27. ""I like long walks to the refrigerator :D :D""
28. At least one obligatory picture of her in yoga pants, at the gym posing with gratituous booty. Not a bad thing, just very common.  
29. At least one picture of her doing rock climbing that one time, but still listing it as if it's a regular hobby

I find one, flat on its back taking a nap and ask the guy to see that one. I sit on the floor and the guy puts her down.

Over the years, he became a super far-left anarchist edge lord. About 4 years ago I asked him how he was doing and he pointed me to some conspiracy-style site where he raved about ""becoming enlightened and stealing the power back"". His fb page is filled with pseudo science and fake news from the left. He constantly argues or espouses his views on everyone he knows and gets into pointless debates. 

So I stopped trying to talk to him awhile ago. I sometimes check out what he's up to but it's all the same...

I bring up Two Door Cinema Club and we both love them but she's never listened to Tourist History all the way through. I say, ""Hey want to listen to it in my dorm?!"" We do and its just amazing spending time with this girl. I want to kiss her but don't want to make her nervous or make a wrong move so I don't but I'm almost totally sure she likes me too. I invite her out for a movie that night and finally do it. She seems a little nervous afterwards, turns out she has been trying to leave an abusive relationship but he made her feel afraid to leave.

"I also think the stigma developed due to men giving less than 100% in bed, regarding their partner's pleasure. This is partly due to the gender stereotypes and attitudes ingrained in us generation to generation. That's something that's slowly beginning to change for the better, but change takes time. Some women are anorgasmic, some really struggle to reach climax, and a lot have simply never had a decent partner. The hush hush attitude (slowly changing as well) we have about sex also inhibits communication about sexual likes and dislikes, which creates more bedroom dysfunction."

"It can be tricky

When you say you can't jet off to London, Paris, or Munich or whatnot on a whim because you don't have money, it doesn't come down to having a choice between going travelling and just not going out drinking for a few weeks or skipping a few movies. It's sometimes the choice between flying off on holiday, and then not being able to eat for a week or two once you get back.

I grew up firmly lower-middle/upper working class, while my girlfriend's family is wealthy and she never really had to worry about whether or not the power was going to be cut out or which ramen noodle was on sale this week. She has great financial sense and knows how to invest and deal with money, but never from a perspective where missing a paycheque could mean getting your car repossessed.

Expectations for manners are different. Parents are Sir and Mrs, not first names, you don't wear jeans when going to family events, you are expected to have your house in order (literally) by owning property of some kind. It may wear on you but you generally always hear about how their friends are doing all sorts of things, or the sideways jabs at how the girlfriend's high school classmate's boyfriend is now the senior manager of some company's regional branch while you toil away at your low level systems admin position

"I came home after a long day at work and she walked out in lingerie, never knew she had lingerie.

We were at Taco Bell, eating, I was famished, she insisted on sitting on the inside of the booth next to me. She grabbed my hand, put it under the table and slid it under her skirt, she wasn't wearing panties. I finished my taco in a hurry, and ate her taco in the truck. "
"I will ***never*** forget the morning in question.

She'd been away on a five-day work trip.  For some reason, whenever she left town, she would ask me to ""save myself"" for her if I could wait that long.  I always said I'd try, but never actually did it.

So we're chatting at like 5:00pm before she boards her flight home, and I let her know that I actually did hold out this time.  She didn't get back to my place until around midnight though, so I was already asleep.  Around 5:00am the next day, she got up to go to the gym.  She was hardcore about that, so nothing unusual there.  I rolled over, spread out completely, and went right back to sleep.  Again, nothing unusual, haha.

All of the sudden I wake up to the smell of breakfast and a warm sensation.  There she is, totally naked, gently blowing me and waving a piece of bacon near my face.  She pulls up after a few seconds, swings her legs over mine, and feeds me the bacon while guiding me inside her.  I gave warning immediately -- ""I'm probably not gonna last long this time.""  With a really intense gaze, she pressed my hands downward against her shoulders, kicked into second gear, and said ""as deep as you can is all that I ask.""

"Something Ray Palmer said in Legends of Tomorrow has really fucking stuck in my head sense.  Someone asked him something like ""why are you never worried?""

He said ""I just have faith in myself that I'll find a way to fix it."" or something to that effect.  It was highly relatable to me, because I'm an IT guy, who struggles with a fraud complex.  I have no degree, no certificates, I just innately understand computers and have a ton of experience working with systems and software.  I am in constant fear of losing my job.  I have zero confidence in myself.

But when I looked back over my performance history I realized, I've not only survived, I've often improved most places I've worked in one way or another.  And that yeah, there have been some big problems that came up here or there, but... I have always bested them, I've never been fired, and I've always been given excellent reviews.

This made me come to the realization that I am a talented troubleshooter. I fix things, and I'm fairly good at it.  I need to work on some execution problems like being very thorough, but overall...I should have faith in my own abilities as they've been proven over and over.

I have, since then, and by golly, it has gotten me a lot of positive results, one of the big ones being confidence.  In my work, in the rest of my life, etc.

Sexual coupons taint the act in question with commodification and make it seem like someone she doesn’t want to do - which makes *me* not want it. I don’t want or need a “out of jail free card”, I don’t care for gaming, and if I can’t get the things I care for without a coupon, the only coupon I’d want is a “let’s fix our relationship” coupon.

Therefore, I think any and all enjoyment I would get out of such a coupon book would be the thought she put into it. The coupons speaking to my heart without ever being used really.

And there’s an easy way to accomplish that: I’m a sucker for festive-kitschy romance. She’s a sucker for creative-kitschy romance. So the best coupons she could come up with would be about kitschy romantic things to do together - just little cutesy things - that make hearts steam from my ears when reading them."

3. Have strong beliefs about something besides personal gain and back those up with actions. Whether it's conservation, politics, abortion, whatever. Have some interests and beliefs. 

4. Dress well and hold yourself well. (Posture, grooming, making eye contact) If you look like shit people are going to assume you are shit.

Couple of years ago I grew out the beard (I'm of middle eastern background, so growing hair in other places is a breeze) and shaved the head bald. I've got these dark, tbick, shapely eyebrows and incredibly long eyelashes. All of which to say is that these features or ""flaws"" we're all things I was self conscious about. 

After a couple of weeks of rocking the new look I was waiting tables on a group of husbands and wives, all relatively intoxicated. And when I walked up to the table, one of the husbands said, ""well you're a handsome man."" Awkward, funny, a bit brow-raising, but I never looked back after that lol.

It was bullshit and I told her so, and told her if she didn't go see a professional and start treatment I was gone. It is not the responsibility of an SO to also be a full time therapist on call 24/7"

My first words to him were “You’re a freaking idiot” in our high school parking lot. Still in love 5 years later. 
"""You don't have any fucking friends""

Ex was getting mad that I wanted to stay at my close friends party, it was a good time we were just drinking and playing board games with my boys and their girlfriends. She wanted to leave after 1.5 hours, I didn't. She kept moaning about how hungry she was and how she wanted to watch a movie. I kept telling her no and to order delievery cause we (i thought) were having a good time. In a pissy tone she asked me ""Well how would you feel if you were watching me hang out with MY friends and you wanted to leave"" my response was ""I would love to get to know your friends but you don't have any fucking friends to hang out with!"". 

She looked super hurt, she told me many times in cofidence that she doesn't feel like she has any friends and she doesn't know what to do because she's so lonely. It cut deep, even though the reason she doesn't have friends is because she ignores peoples attempts to hang out with her, it still wasn't cool to say. Still feel bad about it tbh, she was really sad for a while afterwards. "
"Expanding on this, part of setting boundaries is letting people know when they cross them. A minor transgression can usually be handled with ""not cool man."" But don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. "

There's gotta be some truth to that
"I can't speak for all women, and I'm sure we all have different experiences, but I think overall the sexual experience for women is less orgasm-focused than it is for men. Having never been a man I couldn't say for sure, but my impression is that men are experiencing pleasure throughout sex then a significant increase in pleasure during orgasm.

I would say that for me personally, the pleasure I experience from penetration alone can be just as intense/more intense than the experience of orgasm. It's just that it feels 'different'. Orgasm feels like closure/satisfaction/while the pleasure from penetration doesn't have the same 'development' towards a goal. But that doesn't mean the pleasure is less intense than orgasm (for me personally). I would say the most intense feeling I have during sex is actually from penetration, even the times I orgasm (which I can only through clitoral stimulation).

So basically, I'm not massively motivated by orgasm. It doesn't mean sex was 'better'. I have experienced orgasm through sex that *wasn't* the greatest sex I've ever had; and failed to orgasm through really awesome, memorable sex. The clit and g-spot are just 'different' feelings. One is not lesser than the other for me."
"50% chance he's doing awful quarter squats, 50% chance he's just better than us. "
"Judging by her reaction, probably ""You used to be cool.""  "
"Duh, because genderfluid means sometimes you feel like a boy, sometimes you feel like a girl, sometimes you feel like both, and sometimes you feel like neither. And that's DIFFERENT from sexuality because sometimes you want to boink boys and sometimes you want to boink girls and sometimes you dont want to boink anyone.


Basically, these people who hate traditional labels want to give a label to every single possible combination of feelings in the broad range of human emotions.

"If someone is gender fluid, why also label sexuality? Can you be hetero or homosexual and also be gender fluid?"
"I feel like a lot of men don't handle negative feedback very well and have created this atmosphere where constructive criticism in the bedroom is somewhat taboo.

I honestly thought I was awesome at sex in my early 20s because girls always gave me this overwhelming positive feedback. It wasn't until I got in a steady relationship that I realized lots of my ""techniques"" weren't great at all and that years of hearing how a girl just came 3 times was code for ""Are you ever going to finish?"""

"It's beyond great.  Smartest thing we ever did.  We have the ability to travel atleast twice a year.(Even bought one of the place a pin maps) . Have no worries medically or dental. (Quality of life has no sacrifices). Have no real bills and we have no debt.  I mean that in every area. We have plenty of toys  ( vehicles / nice matching furniture / nothing old or busted)  The trick is still being somewhat frugal. Ya dont live every day like a rock star cause one of you might get hurt or sick and ya don't want to be up to your eyeballs in debt.  However,  it is a huge reduced stress thing.  Nothing to disagree over raising and no money or effort or time arguments and nothing to schedule around ( except pets)  also I recommend NOT getting a dog.  They are like children that you can't take everywhere.   Most the time i hear people complain about marriage or anything it's just about always gonna boil down to a stress increased because of the children.  And EVERYONE  once hearing you have no kids will say ....."" I  mean I love my kids but...."" and explain how now that they had the experience if they could do life over they would not.   I'm sure we are missing out on some moments and life experiences and I get that. ...our biggest discussion is based on who is in who's space in the bed.

We just get wine drunk and stand in front of the fireplace and plan our next vacation.

"I've been seeing the girl I'm seeing for two months now. I'm not in love, but in the short time we've known each other I don't want to think of a day without her. I'm 29 and I've experienced love, I've experienced lust, I've experienced like. I've never felt fully comfortable with a partner though, not even in my 2 year relationships. I never felt like I could talk about anything, and completely be myself.

I feel that with her already.

It's not love, but it's getting there. I can't wait to see her tomorrow, play board games with her, and just talk."
If you can't handle me at my worst you don't deserve me at my best 👏👏👏
"He was actually meant to be a depression helper for my grandmother. She wanted a new dog for a long time, but was hesitant because dogs are a huge responsibility. Eventually I convinced her, and it helped that I was living with her at the time while I was still getting on my feet as an adult. She reckoned that having something to love and take care of would relegate her depression and loneliness, since her husband passed away when I was little. Previously we'd tried a cat, thinking a cat would be easier since they're more independent, but the cat turned out to be a huge asshole and we gave him away in a matter of weeks.

We went to the adoption center and she insisted on getting a small dog, of course. So, I handpicked a dog just for her, an eight year old dachshund, kind of big for his breed and probably a mixed breed if you ask me, who was very calm and friendly and had been in multiple homes already. I started calling him ""buddy"" just because we didn't have a name for him yet, and the name kind of stuck. I don't recall his original name or if he had one posted. I've tried to guess it, calling him random names, but nothing has worked so far. 

It didn't help. My grandmother basically drank herself to death from depression, and passed away almost two years later. During this time I had already moved out of her house, long story short, and was now living on my own in my crappy single guy apartment. With no other choice, I took Buddy as my own, and even though he's kind of a sad memento we are best friends. I keep him active and on a healthy diet, and he's been the best pet I've ever had. He's now a happy and healthy senior dog and doesn't seem to be going anywhere any time soon. Sometimes I wonder if he remembers my grandmother, somewhere inside his head, but it's probably best that he doesn't. "

So many of these are from relationships that have since ended. Nice to see one from one that has progressed

They wanted to call the parents, coordinate times, etc. besides just letting me just go and chill. I understand when I was like 9 years old but this happened when I was up to 16-17.

"Honestly just when she held me in bed and we talked, while she ran her hands over my back and through my hair. It's kinda small, but honestly it's just so nice to feel loved and touched by someone while you talk about life, especially when you're so close with them, it really means something"

"Known this girl for a couple months, got pretty close but circumstances didn't allow for a relationship. Cue a couple months later, both single, she flirted with me daily and told me I am attractive. When I jokingly told her that on my next trip to Japan, I'd take her with me, she responded with ""Oh yeah, are we going to one of those sleazy love hotels?"" and I said ""Why, of course.""

A couple days later I decided to make a move, told her how I feel about her and she said that all that flirting was to relieve stress and that while I am great and all, she doesn't feel the same.

I guess that's the most surprising thing a woman has done to me - make it seem like she's into me 99.9% but she wasn't. Amazing."

This continued for a month and before long winter came. I built him a temporary shelter and he ended up using it, only emerging when I came outside to leave him food daily. Then one day he disappeared.

Two weeks later he returned and with a terrible limp. It seemed something punctured one of his paws and it was swollen to twice its size. I decided then to scoop him up and take him to an animal hospital. I got him patched up and took him home and for 3 weeks he did *not* leave my lap. He was officially my little dude now."

Example C) Risking failure and knowing that even if you don't succeed, you'll be fine. Applying for a job you're not sure you're ready for, asking out a girl you'd think is out of your league, trying for a new personal record one rep max, etc."

"&gt; I hate the way they look in photos

A little tip: **everyone** hates the way they look in photos. Our own self-percerception doesn't translate well from primarily seeing ourselves in motion (in the mirror) to still photos. Everything is flattened in a still photo, detail is lost and it doesn't look natural to our brains, and since we're so familiar with our own face we tend to notice these small things way more than anyone else does. Similar to people hating recordings of their voices -- a combination of being used to hearing our voices in our own head, and recordings being inaccurate (most common recording devices lose a good bit of the lower end and make voices sound tinny and grating). 

In summation, don't worry too much about what you look like in photos if you're happy with how you look in real life. There's a reason even quite attractive people take a million selfies in a row before choosing just one to post, because they don't like the way they look in most of them."

We were relatively close, and people said that it seemed like she liked me, but I don't know for sure if she did. The gesture still stuck with me though. I felt kind of down that day, and she brightened it."
Even if it was 2 hours. I find so disrespectful when people look at their phones while talking 
"I was bored once, so i thought it would be funny to create a tinder profile named catfish with a profile picture of a fish.

2 months of swyping i had some great chats with people i obviously trolled. I thought one time. Aah let's just swipe on own interest instead of spamswyping . I swyped and i saw this cute girl. With a book of an Bio, it was full of sarcasm which i like. So i did superlike her.  Didn't expect her to swipe me a fish to the right. But she did. At first i just stayed in my role as an fish. We talked a bit. And i was like, shit. I can't let this go so fast. I showed who i was. Gave her my phone number and hoped she would text me.

She did text me.  I opened up a bit and we were talking. I realised fairly fast i wanted to meet. So not long after she had my phone number i asked her if she wanted to go out.

Which really isnt creepy. Someone who catfished you asks you out. I'm dutch she's from Belgium, I'm 18 she is 16 i have my own car.... Naah that isn't creepy at all.

She said yes when i asked her if she wanted to go out. We went out that Saturday, i was done working drove to Belgium i was constantly thinking ""wtf am i doing"". I arrived and saw her waiting. I got out, told her it was me. And we walked of. At first we both were awkward. I really thought, nah this wil be nothing. Later that day she opened up a bit. Made 2 nazi jokes. Dedicated to my name. And i knew she was different. Day went by. Had some great fun. Since then we have seen eachother at least every Saturday. She really makes me happy and I'm thankful  having her in my life right now

She's my gf now

Never underestimate a fish online"
"They over-complicate things.  Women are not smarter,magical, fragile,more easily offended than any of your guy friends.  They're just as dumb as anyone else, fart, shit, smell, and do all the things that anyone else in the world does.  Just socialize like you would with your guy buddies; talk about the same things you always do.  When you meet someone you click with, you'll know."

"Some women get there easily on Monday, and take half an hour on Tuesday, it depends on everything from mood to how tired somebody is."
"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to graduate at the top of your class in the Navy SEALs. Numerous secret raids on Al-Qaeda are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of gorilla warfare most of the 300 confirmed kills will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the top sniper in the entire US armed forces, which is deftly woven into just another target- his personal philosophy draws heavily from precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth for instance. The secret network of spies understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the storm, to realise that they’re not just maggots- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing called your life truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the seven hundred ways I can kill you which itself is a cryptic reference to my bare hands. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as I use the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps to its full extent to wipe their miserable asses off the face of the continent. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Navy SEAL tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re extensively trained in unarmed combat (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kiddo 😎"
"For those of you like me that didn't know what parvo was here you go:

&gt; The canine parvovirus (CPV) infection is a highly contagious viral illness that affects dogs. The virus manifests itself in two different forms. The more common form is the intestinal form, which is characterized by vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and lack of appetite (anorexia). The less common form is the cardiac form, which attacks the heart muscles of very young puppies, often leading to death. The majority of cases are seen in puppies that are between six weeks and six months old. The incidence of canine parvovirus infections has been reduced radically by early vaccination in young puppies."
"People don’t want to get married in their 20s anymore. There’s no need to. Now that women have financial independence, there’s no pressure for us to get married and pop out 2.5 kids by age 22. And thank god for that. "
"r/news for noticing a guy had details about a crime story that weren't in the article,  and pointing out it was suspicious. "
"It's amazing how much of a hive mind one can create by removing dissenting posts as ""derailing"" or ""invalidation"".  "
"I'm not going to put Zac Efron or Chris Hemsworth out of a job, but I've been told I'm good looking and I stay in very good shape.  I'll also be the first to admit that I completely suck at picking up on the vibe of when girls are flirting with me.  I usually realize it like 5 minutes later and then tell myself ""shit, she was flirting with me!"".

Regardless, the truth of the matter is that even when you're good looking, very few women will ever just run up to you and start heavy-duty flirting with you, especially particularly attractive women.  Likewise, unless you are a famous musician, athlete, or actor, you are rarely going to get ""chased"", and the onus is still generally on you to make the first move.

Likewise, for the longest time I was very shy and introverted and didn't have a ton of confidence in myself, and if you're a guy, even if you're really good-looking, if you don't have good confidence, body posture, poise, etc. women aren't going to find you particularly attractive."
