"Just sit on the train and let it out there like the rest of us. Crying in public and not giving a fuck is one of those ""You know you're a real New Yorker when..."" moments."
NYC is a diverse place in more ways then one. Some people are living gossip girl and others are living taxi driver.
" If you see a suspicious package or activity on the platform or train, do not keep it to yourself. Tell a police officer or an MTA employee. Remain alert and have a safe day."
Fuckoutahere with your Chicago shit.
"The diversity, the acceptance, and the anonymity. I’m speaking from the perspective of a fairly new resident (4 years in the middle of Manhattan now). As you mentioned, there are people from all over the world here, and New Yorkers love all of them without exception. We LOVE having friends from every corner of the globe, and diversity is not simply just welcome here, but celebrated.

The anonymity is my other personal favorite part. I can walk out the front door of my apartment building, turn left, and do anything I want, and nobody will pay any attention to me. I can walk down the sidewalk singing at the top of my lungs and nobody will even give me a second glance, unless they happen to know the song and join in with me. I love that feeling that my life is my own, and I don’t have to concern myself with what other people think about how I’m living it."
"Transit Museum in Brooklyn, Grand Central, riding the 7 Train toward Queens or Q to Coney Island (they go outdoors and kids love that)."

"Skip the crying. Head to a quiet pub during midday, sit next to the old man in the corner, and get an old man's opinion on your issues. They're incredibly helpful.   "
"It's mostly like London, but with less patience for open ended questions."
"At a Nets game. There won't be too many people there,and the people that are there will also be crying. "
"Master of None. The feel is spot-on. It captures the anxious heartbeat of the city, with it's dripping nostalgia and longing. "
AA?
"Hey, it's great that she's ""giving"" you two days, but here's the thing -- that ain't how eviction works, buttercup.  You have certain rights if you've lived there for 30 days or paid rent -- not as many rights as if you were the main tenant, but rights nonetheless.  One of those is that you have to be evicted legally.  That don't happen over the weekend -- it's a fairly substantial process.  Your relationship may have been informal to this point, but in the eyes of the law when she decides to evict then things get far more formal.

I can't give you legal advice, but googling ""eviction of non-leaseholder NYC"" will provide helpful information."
"Can you report the listing to Airbnb? Maybe if you inform them that it is prohibited by your lease, they will flag it and take it down."
It feels like I'm in an episode of black mirror. 
"In theory, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, sauerkraut. In practice you’ll get an annoyed vendor."
.... well... this is a new one.
Asking for a restaurant near Times Square in this subreddit? Bold move. I'll suggest Carmines before all the Olive Garden jokes start rolling in.

I have no idea what sport peppers are.
NYC is great for casual dating. NYC is not the easiest place to find someone to settle down with.
"Pyramid-investing schemes don't target rich people, they target those that are easily influenced. Since you ignored your gut and continued to talk to her (because she was attractive and ""benign""), she knew you were an easy target. She even was able to have you give your number to a complete stranger for no good reason."
"Because it's fucking jersey.

You are basing it on one travel criteria, and you are assuming the PATH train runs the same frequency at all hours as the NYC subway. Or that it is as easy to take a cab there. But really, if you live in jersey it will limit your social life with those that live in NYC. I know it seems really close, but in most cases you aren't factoring in the fact that you will need to take a train to even get to the PATH train back home, as opposed to being able to take one trip home on the subway and be done with it. It is not convenient. And jersey sucks."
Broke people will be slightly less broke. Still probably half of what a living wage would be in NYC. 
4.67 but i am the one with the money so fuck what they think
I was raised on this water and am only partially dysfunctional.  
"All the main characters, yes. However, there's an entire episode that doesn't feature Dev at all called ""New York, I love you"" that specifically centers around different stories from varied socioeconomic backgrounds. It's my favorite episode of both seasons and showcases different parts of the city in a really authentic, honest way. "
"It’s called placard abuse. And no, it will not be stopped because the people put in charge to enforce it are spineless.

"In general, NYCers do not consider a 25 minute walk a particularly long walk. The degree of whining that you’re ready to put up with from your children is a purely personal determination that only you can make. "
"I prefer the bus. You can look out at all the happy people out there, living their lives, while you lean against the glass, conveniently letting the tears roll down that cheek, hidden from view. Plus there's less chance of subway entertainers ruining the moment."
"Fuck that, you shouldn't have to do anything. You're the one paying the fare."
Except all the characters are wealthy
"-I don't need a car to live here
-It's not a suburban strip mall hell hole
-Diversity (Of everything: Races, opinions, food, etc)

But seriously, not needing a car is my #1. I don't need to sit in a seat and focus on a dotted white line for 2 hours and slowly disassociate to do something *ever*."
"It's your call at the end of the day, but you really shouldn't order a hotdog from an nyc street vendor.  Of all the foods ny is famous for, only street hotdogs are famous for their badness.

If you want an authentic nyc hotdog experience, look up the closest restaurant to you with 'papaya' in its name, and it will probably be Gray's Papaya or one of its many imitators.  Or you could travel all the way to Coney Island (don't do this).

The Halal carts are a better representative of everyday street fare. People have very strong opinions on who makes the best lamb and rice near them."
Perhaps we shouldn't be telling depressed people to walk over a bridge...
"OP: This is so unfair because the laws aren't enforced equally
Every Minority in the US: Hold my beer"
High Maintenance
"It never sleeps -- so if you get out of work at 2am, you can get a burger or a beer...  It makes you feel less alone, because even when work is just kicking your ass, when you get out you're not walking down an empty street."
"You need to call a lawyer. If the heat is below statutory minimum, you may not be required to pay rent because your apartment may be legally uninhabitable. But, you should NEVER withhold rent without speaking to a lawyer first.

Cloverfield.
Then why don't you ask her? She's an adult and more capable of answering this than we are.
"You can't smoke cigarettes in NYC parks. Pay the fine. Claiming you were ""not smoking cigarette, but a joint"" will only get you different type of fine. "
"It could be nothing

or it could be Something "
"I grew up here. Never been to a city that was great as this. I can be myself and have friends from everywhere and every walk of life. My mom teases me and says I have the most diverse group of friends she ever seen. 

The entertainment options are endless. I even do a lot of things on my own and no one bats an eye. I mean going to clubs, museums, bars, parks.

New Yorkers are very friendly people. I have no idea where that we are rude stereotype comes from. No one would ever not help a lost tourist

Variety of how to live. I guess I can explain as this. There’s parts of New York where you can live on the beach, live in a fancy condo, live in a McMansion with a three car garage, live in public housing, or with 3 roommates in an apartment. Everyone doesn’t have the same type of housing like in the suburbs. 

Ethnic enclaves and great authentic food in each one. Looking for Italian , Arthur Ave in the Bronx , craving Russian, Brighton Beach is your place.

Insomnia Cookies
Because people don’t treat life like a fucking team building exercise and they won’t help unless you as for it.
"Not unless you go somewhere that specifically has Chicago dogs. Shake Shack's is super good, but why you would come to NYC to get a Chicago dog is a mystery. "
"4.69 here. I feel like if I just do everything right but sit quietly, rating tends to go down. If I engage the driver in spirited conversation, guaranteed the rating goes up. It's like you have to sell yourself for the rating to go up."
