"&gt; I don't want to get back to being fat.

Hint: It's the carbs. Cut out the refined carbs. Eat real food. it really is that simple."
This one
Whats sad is I can calculate that.......
uhmmm...????
The kids did nothing to deserve being deprived of their mother. 
I want to eat healthier but fast food is SOOO much cheaper and easier than buying all the ingredients and cooking your own food.
Evidently as unhappy as Micheal Clark Duncan was with Amorosa
So he should fire the 3 or 4 people he's keeping on so everyone else gets more money ?
"Pick one...

-I cheated on the biggest exam in my profession.

-Had sex with my best friend's ex-wife

-Fucked multiple married chicks in Vegas

-Knew I had an STD and fucked a chick without protection

-Got a $5 handjob from a homeless woman

-Fucked a chick who might have been a man. No fuckin clue

-Was on a yacht with my girlfriend. While they were watching fireworks on the back of the boat I fucked a young blonde chick on the front.

-GF and her friend were at my place drinking. GF goes to the washroom. I got a blowjob from her friend on my patio. 

I'm sure there's way more..."

"She can have a thousand PhDs, as long as she allows her people to be raped and invaded by Muslims and denounces her own country and citizens as racist, she is mentally handicapped. President Donald Trump holds 5 degrees, including one from Wharton, yet you still insult his intelligence. You make false claims to events that never happened. The crimes of ""refugees"", and I despise that term because they are not seeking asylum but handouts and white women to assault, they are not refugees, they are an invading army, and their crimes are severely underreported. Look at the New Years rapes a few years back, barely any news outlets were allowed to report on it. And no, you don't have any white men or firearms allowed in Europe. All you have to worry about are Islamic terrorist factions blowing up concerts or driving trucks into crowds. Truly peaceful refugees just seeking better lives for themselves. Also, your women have to fear rape, and you have to fear your government since you have no means of defending yourselves against it. The European Union is a fucking joke, you're the laughing stock of the world. "
"I think that's each to their own, I know I done fucked up bad when I got a smacked arse as a kid - didn't do it again.

Think it's more the humiliation than the physical pain that does it."

Then she should learn to take her shrieking kid out of the room and deal with whatever needs to be dealt with. You don't get to disrupt 40+ people's enjoyment of a presentation because you can't plan ahead and are too lazy to parent your own kid.

"Will they burn my flattie or do they consistently deliver good coffee?

For reference, over here people who actually like coffee don't go to chain cafes, because the baristas and beans are subpar. As a result, we get just a tad snobby about our coffee. "

"Today I Learned I'm fucking *enchanted* by dolphins covered in butter. 

It's personal, for me. Sure, she has that cute girl-next-door look. But my first love, like, the girl I just KNEW I was going to marry and spends the rest of my life with, looks startlingly similar to Jennifer Lawrence. I think it's the cheekbones and eyes. "
I thought so to until I was swarmed by 911 truthers on the subreddit.  Never again.
"I love the last fight scene. The fact that they had the balls to go all in on the Aries storyline, lots of respect. None of that bullshit like you see from Marble all the time, and their Cinematic Universe, about how it's really science, and it's an Einstein Rosenberg Bridge, not a Rainbow Bridge... Love the fact they went all in with the armor, and the stash could have been replaced with the full beard, but whatever"
Are you sure she hasn't been sleeping with the black neighbor kid?
"What's being white do for or against him in the plot? In his interactions? 

Now, his eye colour? Yeah, that's actually understandable. But aside from ""envisioned like x"" nothing else matters if he's black or white. "
That fugly mug ruins every scene she's on.
"So a totally different but still *completely fucking awesome* story? Because a Harry Potter movie that's only focusing on Neville and doesn't have Ron or Hermione in it would kick ass. Although part of it wouldn't make any sense, that would need a rewrite."

Was she also 18? Cause if thats the case you two were both legally adults and could have stayed in the same room regardless of what they said.
My problem with the climate change crazies is - climate change has ALWAYS happened. Are we doing something that is dramatically altering it in a negative way?
"If you remember your history, Reddit (rightfully so) got rid of that awful subreddit.

So I repeat myself, if you're in favor of judging people's bodies, then maybe Reddit isn't the place for you."
This.
Depends... Does she like anal? 
Don't look for Pony on pornhub unless you like seeing them have an extra appendage.
So when I was a kid I broke both of my arms....
"Tell your wife that you saw him, or that you are gay as well?"

"Lol i've already read that a dozen times. It's the only thing that gets posted when people ask for his evidence or racism. You should actually read the source article of the discrimination where it's says there is no evidence directly related to Trump. Or maybr the part where it was a manager who was accused of discrimination. Or maybe you should just google ""companies sued for discrimination"". People sue for it all the time.

Or maybe you should read the actual article saying he's a white supremacist due to believing in good genetics. Where it's some guy claiming Trump's dad believed in it so he probably taught Trump that so that makes Trump a racist.

I really wish i lived in this delusional world you all do, it must be very simple and nice. Anyone i've know who was racist was obviously racist. Digging that hard and stretching that bad to try and make your boogie man racism accusations be true is a little sad but oh well."
Its not really up 2 u 2 decide how we use are grammer tbh .
"Okay so this happened only like a couple of hours ago

So me and my crush were sitting next to eachother on a bench next to a lake and her friend said ""awww you two should go out"" and then walked away so I said ""well do you want to?"" ""I don't know"". And then we just sat there for a couple of seconds. Normal people would have done something romantic. But she said ""well that was kinda awkward because &lt;her friend&gt; is sitting right behind us"" so I said ""ya okay this is awkward"""

Whenever my girl takes out that pan flute and starts snake charming my member. It's so annoying watching it weave back and worth like it's going to turn itself into some oragami knot. If she doesn't stop I actually have to choke her or squeeze her chest until she has an asthma attack.
So you just assume they did it and give them a zero and a suspension. It's not hard to tell the difference between a kid who is exploiting the system and an honest one. The stakes aren't high enough to apply due process or assume innocence.
