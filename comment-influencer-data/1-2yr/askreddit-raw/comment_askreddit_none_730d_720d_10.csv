Wait what's wrong with that comment?
"Wow, you got dealt a shit hand"
His parents probably paid off a school. Public ones won't allow that shit normally 
no age of consent or lower statute of limitations or whatever. but not for the reasons people think i want them. Will post my reason once this comment gets 3 downvotes
Why does no one ever mention that the Archer intro and theme song is a shot for shot remake of Bebop's?

"Because minecraft has every element of factorio except automation. You mine basic minerals to craft items and construct things, they're both sandbox games. Factorio is basically the next level of minecraft since there's nothing to do after like 2 hours in minecraft other than build pointless things

It's like you're trying to say that call of duty and halo aren't similar because one takes place in the future "
I think you are confusing hpv and herpes
That dude seems alright
That's the plan
"My brothers are 8 and 10 now, but when they were younger (like 4 and 6) they would wrestle each other. The 6 year old would beat the 4 year old as expected but I ended up having to spank him immediately after he kicked his little brother twice in the head. "
I have very little sympathy for someone with a toxic crabs-in-a-bucket attitude like yours. Mad at someone else for working hard? Go fuck yourself.
"Thats not true right?
"
I tried to read the first book and gave up after about three chapters. Not particularly well written imo and very tedious. I may never know the actual story but the TV show does it for me and I'm fine with that.
Glad to see you use other's negativity to bring yourself up to a worthless ego of an existence like yourself. :)

"I must have not been clear about what I was saying. I AM NOT EXCUSING OR CONDONING HIS ACTIONS IN ANY WAY. I just don't see how it is necessary to re-brand an already despicable thing as an even more despicable thing. It weakens your argument against him and cheapens the accusation of the worse thing and is disrespectful to actual victims of both things. Molestation would require the actual touching of a person or thing, yes? Is it not then inaccurate to say he's a molester? Saying what he actually did is more than adequate to see he definitely was not on the level, it isn't necessary to misrepresent the facts. Doing so is revisionist history and it isn't right to do, no matter what your motivation is. Like we don't need to, nor should we have the right to, exaggerate the badness of the baddies any more than we should exaggerate the goodness of the goodies."
"If someone dies because of a fatal condition after they've been prayed for, it's not the fault of the person/people who prayed. In fact, deaths from these fatal conditions are more often than not nobody's fault. 

Prayer for healing is a way we put a person's health into God's hands and trust that He will do what is right for them and for the bigger picture."
You have my upvote fellow Christian.
"I hate that word so much, /r/wholesomememes fell off so much "
Yes. Why is it so awful? Animal abuse is completely normal but when there's a dog everyone's upset. It's hypocricy.
Clots aren't abnormal but large ones are
"Yup. Metaphors, puns, double entendres, saracasm are all forms of irony. A guy who has a fear of flying and never flew and the one time he flies the plane crashes is NOT irony, and fuck Alanis Morisette."

I couldn't agree less. But it's easy to tell who's either making the money charging people union fees for things they can do on their own or who gets saved being a dumbass from the union. 
probably just means you're stupid
I've been working 70-80 hours per week for a few months now. I don't like days off. I end finding some sort of other work to do.

"In my universe, it's still freaking wrong, bad, AND stupid to use a word to mean literally to opposite of what it means.  So sad that Webster drank the freaking kool-aid."
You take you hate for your stepmother out on random people using slang/baby talk. Not sure they're the wrong ones.
Afraid of the truth?
Or maybe everyone was right and you are awkward.
"I'm aware it's irrelevant, just a weird anecdote I had about Amanda Palmer. I do like her music, but her fans seem to have this weirdly idealized view of her as a sort of benevolent matriarch, and I've long suspected shes just not that nice inter-personally in real life."

"Well they do say that men are (naturally) polygamous and women hypergamous.  What that means is, women generally try to find a desirable mate based on social standing, and will swap a previous mate with a better one if it is opportune.  Propagation of the species and what not.  And one of the factors is money.

Not sure how this information ties in with your situation but it is something to think about."

I feel like you and I are the only two on the planet who think it was terrible. Such a let down.

"Yep, 11th grade English. I thought Fitzgerald was a writer too far up his own ass to realize his characters were unlikable douchebags and the story was boring and uninteresting. I didn't feel bad for Gatsby since he couldn't be happy with what he had and was trying to snatch the other guys wife. "
"Uh no.  Not every dude likes being sucked off the same way.  More like it rougher than you think.  More men are pickier than you think, and would not agree on what makes a good BJ.  Heck, this comment section demonstrates that well.  

Thankfully.  Just more technique to add to my repertoire.  

Why assume what someone likes?  Assuming a clit responds just like a dick shows a poor understanding of the wide range of variability of female sexual response and preference.  Hell, of human response and preference.  

Dirty talk is my favorite so I've never had to resort to guessing.  Great way to communicate what works for me too.

"It had to be, otherwise you're not solving the actual problem which causes terrorism in the first place.

Sure, you can kill the members of Al Qaeda with drones and special forces operations. So what? You haven't changed any of the actual underlying social causes of terrorism. New members will join (maybe even more radicalised by the drones and bombing), and new groups will emerge in response to the same conditions you have failed to address."
They had a moral barometer back then?

"Being called rich by the poor folk doesn't make one rich. 360k puts you in the middle class in Manhattan and Silicon Valley. Husband/Wife attorney above seem to be from SoCal from his previous posts. Median home price in LA/OC area is ~1M. You're stupid to think 360k gets you a life of luxury and private jets. Wealth is being a Rockefeller or Vanderbilt. 360k in SoCal won't put you in Newport Beach or Manhattan Beach. It puts you in a cul-de-sac in Culver City next to a guy that bought his house 30 years ago for 100k. 360k doesn't shorten his commute to a job he hates, wealth certainly does. 360k doesn't get you a yacht for the annual Christmas parade in Newport, wealth sho' nuff does. 360k might be rich to you cause you're poor. 360k ain't rich.

"""jump scare"" and ""best"" don't belong in the same sentence. Jump scares are a cheap garbage way to get a reaction. They should actually just be called what they are, ""startles"" you startled me with a sudden loud noise and camera movement. "

That's a bit extreme dogs are great then they die that's life. 12 grand  fuck.
"Have you ever bartended? I'm not trying to sound sarcastic or anything. I genuinely mean it. I make $4/hr plus tips. One night, which was crazy slow because of a huge storm, I had exactly one customer. He didn't tip. I made $16 that night for the four hours on my feet, cleaning, running around getting this dude whatever he was ordering, and having to listen to him literally preach at me about, ""the gays"" and how ""we good christians"" can't judge, but god knows. 

I have another job that supplies me with a stable income, but please understand that you are in fact doing hard manual labor for FAR less than minimum wage, and those tips can mean the difference between making rent and also being able to buy healthy groceries, or eating nothing but rice and beans because those are all you can afford.

"He deserves some backlash but painting him as an actual racist is disingenuous. This isn't Michael Richards screaming ""look there's a nigger!"" at an actual black person, this is a dude reflexively yelling bad words at a video game out of frustration. Like, if you encounter a 12 year old calling someone a niggerfaggot you don't think they actually have a problem with gay black people, they're just being an edgy immature brat, and that's what pewdiepie is pretty much

I realize that this is anecdotal and based off the sample size of one person, but still an interesting observation.  I wonder if there's anything to support the idea that these parties end up disproportionately ""celebrating"" boys."
