"They‚Äôre talking about the Black Museum episode - last one of the most recent series. Tbh I don‚Äôt even want to spoil it! 

Edit - was referring to the ‚Äòmonkey needs a hug‚Äô quotes from higher up but I can see how that was confusing. Sorry guys. "

One guy turned out to be touching all the girl members of my group project inappropriately behind the scenes (forceful groping and such) and we later found out he raped one of them. Hahahah I never got to hear how the nerd that was really serious about everything and angry nobody was paying attention reacted but I'd pay serious money to hear and see his face when he found out ü§£ü§£ ahahahaah

"It does.  You become a drain on the country‚Äôs resources, and it‚Äôs just generally unfair for the people who put in the effort to come here in a legal manner.  My grandparents both came here from Latin America.  Grandpa from Peru, Grandma from Mexico.  They voted for Trump for a reason‚ÄîIf you don‚Äôt come here legally, you should not expect to be treated like a citizen or legal immigrant.  You looking for a better life?  Then come here legally, so that you‚Äôre not going to be deported.  Illegal immigrants tend to commit a LOT of crimes.  Not all of them are career criminals, but every one of them is a criminal to some degree (by coming here illegally).  Kate Steinle‚Äôs killer got off the hook when there was more than enough evidence to convict, because welcome to San Francisco.  You also have the fact that there‚Äôs gangs like the Latin Kings and MS-13 who have tons of illegals in their ranks.  How much you want to bet the Russian mob has all legal immigrants?  The point is, if you come here illegally, you‚Äôre a potential problem.  Mainly because, unlike if you immigrated here legally, you aren‚Äôt going through background checks and getting vetted.  Therefore, we have no clue whether you‚Äôre going to join a gang, subsist off welfare, etc.  Come here legally, none of those problem arise."

"&gt; You can only potentially damage your ear by going in too far.

Going too far with q-tips is very common, so damaging your ability to hear wouldn't be too unlikely if you commonly use them. And damaging your ears will result in a decreased quality of life.

I mean according to that logic you should also ban bikinis at pools and beaches. Or guys only wearing shorts and nothing on top.
Don't do it if it's blonde and beautiful :D
I agree. I'm perfectly comfortable with anti-hate speech laws

"The America-bashing in this thread is outrageous.  I grew up in Texas and can't remember a single racist incident ever.

"I‚Äôve never been in an interracial relationship just because I‚Äôve never found black girls attractive (not racist...just a preference), however I did have a crush on this Asian girl for a while in high school. Never worked out though. Anyway, my mom and grandparents always said when it came to picking someone to be with, ‚Äúkeep the bloodline clean.‚Äù So maybe that had more of a subconscious affect on my relationship choices than I know, but I‚Äôm happily engaged now so there‚Äôs that."

"Not saying you personally but I think there‚Äôs a self-selection going on for that. Hotter guys don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave‚Äù to do it cause the woman wants to fuck them so badly anyway. Average or ugly guys need that extra advantage so they get really good at oral to keep a woman around. 

Same thing happens with a lot with the female/blowjob situation. "

"Costs are not the only important thing in healthcare. Choice is as important if not more important. You can't have free choice and no cost to consumer and low overall costs at the same time. 

Because every choice has a cost component attached to it either positive or negative.

Liberals would downvote all the ones that disagree with their viewpoints. 
inspire them to change themselves
"It's not the same logic, because OP didn't really make that argument at all. If he had said black people commit the most murder so we should ban black people, it'd be a fair argument. But he didn't. The guy who replied twisted his argument to say something he didn't, and declared himself the winner by taking the moral high ground. Literally the definition of a strawman argument. *Ya dingus.*"

Probably rap or any form of metal/hardcore
"For the love of god, I don't know how Hip-Hop/Rap is not talked about. Look, I listened to plenty growing up. I don't think it directly made me a bad person or anything, but the influence is there. And it's so popular! No one fucking talks about the horrible shit they say in the songs, everyone just blind praises them. And the people that talk bad about it are usually just like ""I just don't listen to rap.""

It's like the violence vs video games thing, except music DEFINITELY ties into emotions and the way you think. They're basically mantras for some people.

I still will listen to some here and there, but to say it's not a sort of problem is kind of ignorant.

EDIT: it's usually the ""popular"" shit"
"I think it‚Äôs a little bit more than tasteless...I think calling it straight up offensive and even racist applies here.

Racism doesn‚Äôt have to be negative for something to still be racist. For example, assuming an Asian guy is good at math is racist, even though being good at math is not seen as a negative."
"One of the most rational explanations I've ever heard of this is that : the secret service used to walk around with guns loaded and safeties off. One the them accidentally pulled the trigger and it killed the president. So they basically created a false story so that the public wouldn't think the entire lot of them as incompetent.

Edit : guys saying something is rational doesn't mean I believe it. The simplest solution is Oswald killed him. By saying it's the most rational explanations I've heard I'm just saying it's by far the most reasonable and if anything is being covered up this is probably one of the more likely scenarios and not that the cia murdered a president.

"While delivering pizza I once walked around to the backyard as the instructions asked to find an old Hispanic couple going at it doggy style by the fire. He quickly got his pants on and gave me $20 which left me about a $1 tip. As soon as I turned the corner I'm sure he went back to his wife that was still bent over by the fire. 

I've also had ladies answer the door topless, in a towel and they let it fall while handing me money, one girl answered the door in lingerie, a bachelorette party wanted me to strip for them, and I had sex with a really cute Mexican girl after she invited me in while she looked for money in her bedroom. But there were also tons of drunk naked dudes.."
