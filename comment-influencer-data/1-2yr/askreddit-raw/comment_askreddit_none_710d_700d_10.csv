Nope. Why would Canadians come there for care? That is just a lie. 
Shut the door and lock it. And go back to frying my brain with television. And prescription drugs. And flag waving. And believing everything the television tells me.
"Bullshit.

The US spends more than the next nine countries combined. They're not the world police, and most of their military power is concentrated on fighting stupid wars, bombing poor people, and overthrowing democratically elected governments.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States

The US spends almost half it's discretionary budget on the military. There are 800 US bases in foreign countries.

The US military budget is 27%, or 1/8 of the total US discretionary budget, is for maritime and naval uses. Piracy isn't a major concern anywhere in the world except off the coast of some countries in Africa."
By 45 do you mean 45th President of the United States of America Donald John Trump Senior?
"That article says:
&gt;On July 17 the US professor - based at the Columbia Medical Center - visited him for the first time along with a second unnamed doctor and left after five hours.

Commenter I replied to states ""AND the US Doctor even refused to look at him.""  That commenter is a proven liar. Are you trying to defend them?

"Um, Obama did his best to be divisive, as well. Both he and Trump have done that shit for political gain.


With that said, I think he's genuinely a good person "

"I know. What I mean is that with my current understanding of how both plants and animals react to physical harm, the ethical component of vegetarianism or veganism seems less appealing to me.

I fully understand that we feel more empathy for animals, though, since as animals ourselves we can - well - empathize with them."
They're both shit 
"The story was all over the place and didn't really do much to draw me in. The entire thing felt incredibly forced as well, like they just wanted you to feel sad the entire time and forced it anyway they could. I am not coming fresh off watching the movie, it's been months so a lot of my more precise critiques are lost to time and me mostly trying to forget that movie. Having a more thorough response would require me watching that movie again and for obvious reasons I probably will not do that."
Why don't you stivk to comments about Guildwars2 you fucking idiot.
Oh no! Not the downvotes!
"I concede, you are right in regards to pain and a nervous system. I think we are splitting hairs about terminology, though. 

The fact of the matter is, plants sense harm and react to it. It may not be exactly the same as ""pain"" in animals, since plants are significantly different, but the general principal of ""harm --&gt; reaction"" is conserved."

"back in '92 or so, the Canadian government published a book wrtitten by NOW I think which was a guide for Poiticians to appropriate substitutions for sexist terms including 'policeman', 'chairman', 'old-wive's tale' and so on.

Noticeably absent: 'conman', 'badguy', 'deadbeat dad', 'wifebeater' - those tems were just fine. I recall a spokes*person* justifying the use of 'deadbeat dad' by pointing out that the majority of child-support dodgers are men, but this reasoning doesn't apply for 'mailman', 'chairman' etc, because reason doesn't apply - this is politics.

So what do you call that? Starting shit or a shitty start?"

"Not a villain but a group, I agree with the Templars from the assassin's creed games, a world order controlling everything would help propel humanity forward faster."
"I disagree.  I haven't had the same experience that you have.

There are plenty of black women out there, famous and successful, that don't get compared to men.  For example, I've never heard Oprah be called manly.  Sure she gets called ugly and what not, but she doesn't really have a manly physique or manly features.  If people called black women manly because of racism...she's black, why doesn't she called a man?  Serena and Michelle both have masculine physiques and features, so people jokingly compare them to men, period.

I think you may be projecting.  Maybe you see African American females as masculine so your ascribing your own sentiments to others' actions?"

Just because you have the freedom to say and do things doesn't mean you should be able to walk around and call people the N word. My opinion...

My opinion is also anti NFL protest because I think, and whole heartedly agree with...at the most...respect the anthem and flag. You don't have to like it but at least stand out of respect. It's not that hard. Also...you're protesting the flag and anthem which have nothing to do with what they are protesting so to me. My own opinion, you're disrespecting veterans and fellow Americans to include our ancestors of EVERY race "
