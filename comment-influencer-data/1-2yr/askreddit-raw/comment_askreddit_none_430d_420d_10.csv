"Honestly every single thing about bars sounds horrible.

Maybe I'm just a nerd and none of this shit is even real but these are some of the reasons I would never go to bar based off media/other peoples stories.

Seems you have to work to get a drink. Like the bartenders aren't always attentive. I don't go to the convenient store and ""work"" to get the persons attention they are just ready.

Overpriced / watered down.

"My understanding is that Danish citizens have the option to enroll their child in preschool up to the age of six. However, now one year olds classified as ""ghetto children"" must spend twenty-five hours per week apart from their parents for instruction in Danish values, Christmas and Easter traditions, and the Danish language. Non-compliance would mean welfare benefits could be cut off.

I didn't make the claim that Denmark doesn't want people to be Muslim, but they certainly seem to think that Muslim communities don't integrate their children into Danish culture.

I live in the US, but the beauty of the world today is that I can read a Danish English-language newspaper and comment about something happening thousands of miles away and the Danes can complain about the president of a country thousands of miles away.

Also, my wife's cousin Rigmor lives in Denmark, say hi if you see her."
I mean the early part of the war when I say that. Think Stalingrad where only half the men where armed and charged machine gun nests until they took it or died.

"except it doesnt and the fact you even try and claim it does further highlights what a fucking moron you are who doesn't even understand irony 

seriously you are so stupid its genuinely hilarious, 

""nobody asked you, he said without being asked""---that is how much of a fucking moron you are A PROVEN moron.

your claims are just moronic baseless buzzwords you throw around without understanding them. there are many laughs to have at your expense.

And also for more hilarity you use the term ""cupcake"" and ""dipshit"" after specifically stating ""Every word of yours points to you being the dipshit"" lol its amazing how stupid you are you cant see this.

lol so even by YOUR OWN STANDARDS you are a DIPSHIT.

honestly its embarassing you are this stupid. you are actually undermining yourself with YOUR OWN COMMENTS, only the really stupid are so stupid to do that.

"That’s fair. Maybe I wasn’t taking enough care to consider the context, but I like getting fucked up while also enjoying my drinks. There’s plenty of tasty drinks that will have you falling over after 2 or 3. Most half-decent college bars have a nasty premium + tip, so if I’m spending $50 or so on drinks for a night out I’d expect it to be enjoyable. Otherwise I’d just down 4 or 5 bud lights on an empty stomach after pregaming. "

You're right. You're a genius. There's no such thing as sexism in the workplace. In fact, I don't understand why businesses don't hire more black people if they're paid less than on average than white men. I mean, there couldn't possibly be any underlying causes, right?

"And what are you, 9, or a moral police? Sometimes people fall in love with other people, it's not always happy ever after, life is complicated, people are complicated, feelings are complex. God kids on Reddit are the most judgmental bastards in the world these days. Btw there are practicalities of life you kids know nothing about. Of course in ideal life everything would be Instagram-perfect, but advising someone to leave their partners first and *then* see if the new relationship may be promising is like advising someone to leave their secure job because *maybe* they could become a performance artist. Right Jo, leave John and two kids and move out of the mortgaged house because you have a big crush on Steve from work. On the other hand, maybe Steve *is* a better match, maybe things with John are not good anymore, and maybe everyone could be happier if you do split up? But how would anyone know?

"For real. The list of bills you *didn't* have back then is huge. It's weird to me because it's so obvious. I'm pretty sure if Mr. or Mrs. One Income were to eliminate the following:

* Credit Cards
* Cable
* Internet
* Cell phone w/data
* Amazon Prime
* Netflix (or similar)
* World of Warcraft (or similar)

then they would easily be able to afford a three br house on one income. The list goes on but these are the big ones that I can think of. The first one alone would free up a massive amount of money, and first four is probably half a mortgage payment at the very, very least; That's assuming $70 for a phone, $60 for internet, $50 for cable and $500 for credit cards. 

Throw in Student Loans and holy shitoli, Spicoli. 

If you have kids, this grows dramatically. They need phones and ereaders and computers too, increasing the cost of your phone/data plan as well as your device budget. Also, it feels like their activities are more numerous and costly these days but I'm not sure about that. 

Everything's a subscription now, we have massive student loan debt they didn't have back then, and we simply have to buy more crap and pay associated incremental costs to use them these days. 

""Income vs. home cost hasn't changed!"" okay fine but the chunks being taken out of that income has changed dramatically."

I have a mountain of side work to do and I’d love to ignore you for 30 minutes. 

If you want me to keep your glass filled, recall prices, ingredients, or opinions I’ve memorized from the menu, want complicated drinks, run multiple corses, want a modification to the dish, get extra napkins, condiments, the WiFi password, pre buss your table, chit chat with you and bring you a box, please tip standard. Especially if there are more than 4 people. 

Waiting is usually tipped because of the specificity of the service- I serve each customer individually. I’d liken it to buying something off the rack vs. having a personal shopper specifically construct an outfit for you and tailor it to your body. 

I’m constantly running. I never ran or sweat or had near the level of multitasking or people to please when in retail, and I worked at a busy store.
