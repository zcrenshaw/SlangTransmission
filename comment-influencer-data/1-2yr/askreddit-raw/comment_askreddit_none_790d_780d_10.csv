"Watch out dude, I called out University of Phoenix a week or two ago, and people got PISSED.  I got all sorts of nasty private messages from them.

But I'll say it again!  I think University of Phoenix and other for-profit colleges put out a product that is far inferior to most traditional educational institutions.  My experiences have been as such with graduates that I basically just throw those resumes away."
"Sometimes kids like that just remind you of being a kid at the movies. When I went to see Force Awakens a little girl was so, so excited and would nudge her dad occasionally to whisper.

I'm sorry but it's hilarious to me how 150 years is considered old in some parts of the world (I'm gonna guess you're from North America?). The house I grew up in was built in the 1800's and was considered fairly modern. My friend from school house was built in the 1500's. My school was built on top of a medieval monk monastery. Never encountered anything supernatural either to boot.

"My older brother sexually abused me when I was 7 and 8.  Everyone knows.  But, I'm the one creating tension by choosing not to be a part of any event he attends or have any contact.  I see my parents on off days rather than holidays because he gets those so they can see his children.  Doesn't bother me after so many years. But, every once in a while a family  member randomly asks if we could have a real holiday this year with everyone in attendance.  I want to say ""is he gonna try to sodomize me, because I didn't particularly enjoy it last time.""  I don't.  I just say I have other commitments.  Not getting sodomized is one of them."
That's a poor analogy. Whores actually perform a job for their paycheck.

 I'm 29 years old and a manager. Carla is a part time cashier in her 40s and thinks that her age gives her the right to act like she's my fucking boss.

Fuck you, Carla."
"I was fairly good friends with my neighbor's when I was growing up. There was a single mum who was only 30, a kid who was my age (we were both 15 and best friends) and a 1 year old baby. My parents were out of town for the weekend and left me in the house. I planned to hang out with my friend all weekend but she didn't reply to any of my texts, so about a day after my parents left I knocked on their door. There was no answer. The car was there so I was confused. 

A day later I still hadn't heard from my friend or her mum. I was worried by this point because this is very out of character for them, we were very close and if they were going somewhere they would've told me, and as I said, the car was there. I climbed over the fence so that I was in their backyard, this was so I could look through the kitchen window as the curtain's were shut around the front of the house. The baby was in the high chair (he was sleeping but looked dead) and his mother was slumped over the table with a plastic feeding spoon in her hand. I started screaming for my friend, there was no answer. I hightailed it to my house and called my parents and the police.

The police kicked the door in and raided the house, the baby (who I thought was dead) was actually alive but was in a bad state due to being alone in his highchair for 48 hours. My friend and her mother were both dead. Autopsy revealed they had both overdosed. The baby was taken into foster care straight away. The official theory from the police is that my friend committed suicide using antidepressants and her mum also committed suicide after finding her dead in her bedroom. Something about that theory never made sense to me, considering that the mum was feeding her son in his highchair while knowing that she had overdosed. There was also and investigation that led to an arrest (suspect was released without charge) but I don't want to give any more info because you can find the news article of this online and my name is in it. It doesn't add up and it still haunts me to this day. I always felt like I should've done something.

"I'm not a woman. But I was talking with a friend yesterday and she opened my eyes to something. 

Just how hard it is for women software devs when it comes to pay. I'll try not to say much here - I don't want this to identifiable in anyway. 

We were talking about pay. Now I have a friend who is a man, similar degree - although different dev work, but still within a similar kind of pay scale. 

He makes 70k+ a year, and she hasn't passed 50k yet. What I thought I was doing was boosting her confidence in getting a better job with better pay. What happened was having it explained to me just how much tried and true achievements she needed to her name to get that kind of pay I was talking about. 

This is someone who works double or more the hours of my male friend, and who in the relevant locations, actually has somewhat of a reputation already. 

I was a bit gobsmacked to realize I was ignoring such a obvious plight women deal with.

"My first college roommate was a huge douche. I, on the other hand, was chubby, shy, and used to being bullied. *Sigh... not a good combination.

He and his friends would constantly pick on me. Hide my shit, dump my desk/dresser drawers, insult me, etc. When they got going, that's all they'd do, just insult me until I left the room. I'd try putting on headphones, but they'd just rip them off. Sometimes they wouldn't let me leave.

One day they were squirting me with a water bottle. I snapped and threw a pair of scissors at my roommate. Of course, they stick in his arm, and of course one of his D-bag friends was filming it.

Long story short, parents and lawyers got involved. The roommate, et al stuck to the story that they hadn't done anything. During a meeting with everyone and the Dean of Students, they showed the video... just the 1 minute or so surrounding the event, and smugly sat there as if they had won. My lawyer, thank god, asked about the rest of the video, and if we could watch it all. D-bag's lawyer stopped that idea immediately.  After a quick conversation among just D-bag's people, the whole incident was dropped five minutes later.

A few years later the video showed up on the internet. It's still probably out there."
"Everything sounds like my parents, even the French part which was spoken in (what's probably atrocious) American high school French. 

Classical music was a must, though my dad had a soft spot for ELO because of ""Roll Over Beethoven"". One of the first records I remember listening to was Prokofiev's ""Peter and the Wolf"".

"Naps are only uncool at 7 because you're forced to take naps.  If I said ""Ok u/fredfredbug4, it's 11:45, you're having a nap"" you'd probably be all ""WTF, I'm in a meeting!""."
"Fuck you, I'm Millwall!"
"Let me tell you the story of how my parents met.


My dad was a Canadian visiting Australia. He met my English mother while they were waiting in a queue at a park. She accidentally bumped into him. ""Sorry"" he said. ""Ah, no, it's my fault"" she said. ""I wasn't queuing properly!"" He smiled and said ""Oh, soory aboot that, eh. I was just thinking aboot Maple Syrup, my pet moose.""

Then some Australian cunt cuts through them in line, knocking them both over. My dad laughed and apologized to the Australian for knocking him over, and then my mother started tutting. 

Then a Polish ~~toilet cleaner~~ person comes over, clearly drunk saying ""Jestem taką stereotypową polską osobą. Proszę, nie podzielaj mnie, Niemczech i Związku Radzieckiemu."" And then a drunk irishman and latvian walk by in a deep conversation about potatos.

My dad and mum walked through the streets of Syndey, passing a Russian commie and a Swede having an argument about homosexuality, a chinese person saying Ching Chang Chong whilst eating a dog, a K-Pop Star and a Japanese person talking to his robot girlfriend. 

Then they pass a curry house/tech support centre, and a ~~Middle Eastern terrorist recruit~~ Mosque.

"To tell you the truth, I don't remember, exactly. Going to Olive Garden has always kind of been a weird inside joke to my best friend and I that started the summer after high school. We both love Italian food and also both know that Olive Garden is Italian like Taco Bell is Mexican, but it's where we go to buy overpriced cocktails and flirt with the waiters. She lives in NYC, so while I was up visiting her and other NY/CT friends of ours, we somehow decided that we should go to the Times Square Olive Garden. The concept was to be laughably basic, but before ""basic"" was a thing. We had a good time, didn't have an excessively long wait, paid a stupid amount of money for mediocre food and were okay with it because we were dumb college kids with decent jobs. Ah, memories."

"Yes, definitely. I have worked a lot with mentally handicapped people, who sometimes also suffer mental illness making them psychotic, and one of the greatest lessons has been that it matters more how you say something, than what you say. Like I said, I have been in similar circumstances before (and since), and I have an extremely good ability to project confidence and strength, but what made this particular situation stand out, was their demeanor. They were all very calm, and not outwardly threatening, but at the same time they were the kind of people who at the drop of a hat would rock and roll. That is what made that situation extra scary: the fact that they were in a sense toying with me, letting me know that any control of the situation was no longer mine..


I am reminded of what this one free diver would do when he dove with great white sharks. Sharks, and other apex predators, will generally leave other apex predators alone and focus on their prey. So when a shark would begin to dive beneath him, in order to attack from below, this diver would dive down with it, and when the shark would then see him down there as well, it would no longer see him as potential prey, but a fellow predator, and then leave him alone. A similar philosophy, besides being courteous and respectful, has served me well countless times - simply make the predators believe you are not prey. I use this ability to stop fights, if I can, but nothing should be taken for granted, especially when certain drugs are involved."

It took about 15 years of anger and resentment towards her and my parents before I realized that *they would have listened and believed me*.  Now, as a parent myself, nothing is more important than making sure my kids know I'll have their backs, no matter what.

"I keep a spreadsheet where I track every single expense, from a Redbull at the gas station to rent and everything in between. I use this to create my budget. I find this is effective because it shows me exactly how much I **need** to spend on needs like rent, utilities, groceries, gas, insurance, debt, etc, as well as how much I **can** spend on luxuries or just things I don't need to get by. 

It can be a bit tedious at times to record my expenses both in my spreadsheet as well as on my budget app (Everydollar), but it keeps me paying attention. I also purposely haven't purchased the premium version of Everydollar which allows you to connect your bank accounts and whatnot and have things automatically tracked because then I wouldn't pay as close attention to things.

"James Buchanan (15th president of the US) was likely gay or bisexual.

He was unmarried as president (the first and only president so far to not be married while in office) and had a 'close male friend' that was a bit closer than men got back at that time. He did have a fiance at one point, but she died long before he became president, and he never showed interest in other women after that."

"I know this smell. Worked at a hospital building where biomedical​ waste was burned (my job was unrelated) and this sickly stink would waft up the stairwell. I spoke to a guy in the basement who basically processed the waste for a living and he explained how sarynges poke through the waste bags so it was normal to get covered in every kind of human waste a hospital disposes of when doing his job. Nobody should have to breathe that smell in let alone have it spill on them. 

Edit: This was a large research hospital the size of a university campus, tens of thousands of employees, NOT in the US... but in a place known for providing ""world class"" health care. The only reason I would go into the basement (a massive underground level with tunnels) is to get to another building. The dude getting poked by needles was earning minimum wage and wasn't unionized, so if he complained the hospital would just tell him he could leave and hire someone else. As an ""above grounder"" I felt crappy that this was happening to him but if someone on a higher floor with higher education had had this problem it would be a huge health and safety deal, it would have made the news and been a PR disaster. But out of sight, out of mind. Hope that clarifies :)"

"I can remember this one older dude who'd always be walking around naked in the locker room for the longest time.  He wasn't in shape, had a huge gut and all, but thing is he had THE biggest schlong I've probably ever seen in person.  I think it was just his way of feeling like the manliest man ever, and no one would have to say anything."
"I think this misconception is rooted in the following:

Americans like helping people.  We like talking to people.  We like learning about new places and new things.  We are, overall, a pretty friendly people.

However, we can slo be an incredibly stubborn people, and we *do not* like being told what we should or shouldn't do.   We don't like being told what we should do by other Americans, and we *really* don't like being told what to do by someone who isn't an American.  So, when we see a foreign politician say ""America should do X"", it is a gut reaction to respond, ""ANd you should go fuck yourself.""  

I think a lot of the context foreigners have of Americans is in response to something that foreigner's government or politicians have said/done in regards to America.  There was a thread in AskReddit the other day, the topic of which was ""Conservatives, what do you wish liberals understood about you?"" and there was a guy from Australia who was commenting on American politics and American policy.  My reaction, both in terms of initial and thought-out reaction was, basically, ""Fuck you, you're Australian.  You don't get to have an opinion on American politics, because you don't live here.  FUck off with your bullshit back to Australia and fuck a kangaroo while you're at it.""  It wasn't that what he was saying was wrong or anything like that, but it was a foreigner commenting on American politics, so his opinion was instantly worthless, full of shit, and fuck him (and as an American, I'm ok with all of that.  Fuck off about American politics if you don't live here).

So, to recap, Americans are, on the whole, very friendly and welcoming.  However, we don't like being told what we should or shouldn't do at the best of times, and we absolutely hate it when someone who isn't American, or at least living here, wants to tell us what to do.  We are *fiercely* independent. "

"I've posted this elsewhere. 

Now I'm one of those skeptic types. I don't believe in ghosts, UFOs, or Bigfoot. I need some hard evidence and I'll take the scientific method over a psychic any day. But one night makes me wonder. This was a few years back during the summer before I left for college. It was one of those perfect summers. I was with a group of friends and we were extremely bored. So one friend brought up the idea to go ghost hunting, the top candidate was a place called Beil Hill. Who doesn't love a good ghost story?

So five of us hop in my old Chevy Cavalier and we go off into the Pennsylvania countryside. Along they way we're telling jokes and listening to music. Until we get there and start up the hill. Aside from a few farmhouses it's totally dark so we go up the hill quick turn at the top and slowly go down the dirt road. About halfway down I stop the car and see this creepy collection of wood, it was an old fence. This thing looked like something out of the Blair Witch and I was transfixed on it and the dark around us. That darkness was suffocating. While looking at the fence I hear a ""huh"" or a ""what"" from the backseat. All of a sudden my friends in the back start screaming bloody murder. ""WHAT IS THAT?"" ""GO! NOW!""

Without looking I floored that Cavalier and got out of dodge. As we leave the area I figure this was a prank on me, so I tell the gang to fess up. I look back and see the girl in the back crying her eyes out telling me it wasn't a joke. Well shit, these guys are going for the Oscar. So I ask what they saw. One friend claims they first saw a light moving at the hilltop. The other friend says it was moving towards the car. Then the crying friend screams that something white crawled out from under the car. ""It was moving like a spider, it was so fast"" one friend chimes in. The crying girl screams ""It was a dress!"" ""It was wearing a dress!"" I  hauled ass out there at this point but to this day they swear it was there skittering after us.

So time passes. I go to school. One weekend I'm back in town and run into an old friend who fancies himself a local historian. Ghost stories come up so I bring up that night on the hill. ""Oh spook hill. Your friends saw her."" My curiosity is obviously peaked so I ask to know more. He says in the 1800s a woman was killed in a carriage accident on the hill, right around a fenced area. The wagon wheels took her head off but the others in the carriage including her daughter survived. Legend has it that she searches the hill at night with a lantern trying to find her way home. With a smile he says ""You're lucky she didn't follow you home, young man."" I still remember that part. I checked and the story goes back to at least the 70s, [here's a news clipping for some proof](http://imgur.com/aAV36vq).

All these years later, I live 500 miles away, and thinking of it still scares me. Like I said reddit, I'm a skeptic but I always wonder about that night on Beil Hill and the Lady and the Lantern. "

"Not sure how much this counts, but here we go;

When I was little we lived next to an honest-to-god psychopath serial killer in training.  She was probably about 11 and I was 5 or so.  She killed tons of animals, used to make me watch, did random shit to torture me, etc.  I told my mother some of the shit she did, but she was convinced I was making it up.  Apparently, it's difficult to believe some 11 year old is shoving wires down kids' throats and drowning puppies.  Especially since she was female.

Once, she was pulling me along in a little red wagon and just kind of stopped behind a car that was parked on the curb.  I was totally oblivious at the time, but she made sure no one could see us and then waited for a car to shove me out in front of.  Luckily the car wasn't going too fast and stopped before hitting me.

My mother finally believed me when she caught little miss murderer beating the ever living hell out of a toddler one day.  She had him pinned against the wall on the side of the garage where no one would see and was just choking and punching him.  My mother was sure she would have killed him if she hadn't caught her.  Kid apparently ran off while my mom was chewing the serial killer's ass but nothing else ever came of it.

I'm absolutely certain that she's either dead or has killed someone(s).  Those are the only two possible outcomes."

"I had an organic chemistry professor in college.  If you have never taken organic chemistry, well, it is a brutal subject.  I have noticed there seem to be two groups, people who just absolutely get it 100% and people who have no idea what is going on and really just hate it without much in between.  I fell into the later group.

Fortunately for me, this professor was wonderful.  It was a small, relatively young, slightly nerdy British man who liked to demonstrate why certain molecules would only move certain ways by using his body as a model.  There is nothing quite like a tiny British man contorting himself into weird positions or leaping onto his podium and clamping down on it and asking a student to pull him off (a demonstration of how certain bonds are stronger than others).  He was just wonderfully weird and made the subject more understandable.

Unfortunately he got very sick in the 3rd to the last week of the semester.  We came in and he wasn't there that day or the next class.  He didn't show up for the rest of the semester.  He didn't show up the next semester either.  I heard from other people who took class with him after he finally returned that he mostly just sat in a rolling chair in class, pushing himself back and forth in front of the board to teach because he didn't have enough energy to stand for the entire class.  All his bounce and ridiculousness was gone.  That was several years ago, so I hope he has recovered now because he really was an excellent teacher for a very hard subject.

**Ezekiel 23:19-20** Yet she increased her whoring, remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt  and lusted after her clients there, whose penises were like those of donkeys, and whose semen was like that of horses.

**Song of Solomon 5:1-5**   I came to my garden, my sister, my bride, I gathered my myrrh with my spice, I ate my honeycomb with my honey, I drank my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink, and be drunk with love!  2 I slept, but my heart was awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking. *""Open to me, my sister, my love,* my dove, my perfect one, *for my head is wet with dew, my locks with the drops of the night."" 3 I had put off my garment;* how could I put it on? I had bathed my feet; how could I soil them?  *4 My beloved put his hand to the latch,* and my heart was thrilled within me.  *5 I arose to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the bolt.* 

**Song of Solomon 2:3** As an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. With great delight I sat in his shadow, and *his fruit was sweet to my taste,*

"I told him we were fighting after school whether he wanted to or not, as per my dad's advice.

He denied it up and down and I told him that's good, then you're down to go, don't worry, we'll make it happen, etc.


I told my dad about it and the next day he picked me up from school, drove me over to the bully's house and let me wait for him as he got off the bus.

"Never spending actual time with me. We are all first generation immigrants, and my parents worked long hours to lift us up from poverty. The result is that I only spent any real time with my parents on the weekends, and sometimes not even then. From age 5-16 or so, I was raised by my uncles, one of which abused me. I still carry the scars of that today.

I'd rather have grown up poorer but with my parents around. I lost my Vietnamese language skills, and I don't feel any real connection to the Vietnamese community at large. I'm not as close to my parents as I wish I could be."
"Parents not apologizing. Kids are smarter than parents give them credit for. And they pick know that people make mistakes, and no parent is undermining themselves when they admit to it and apologize for a mistake, or losing their temper, etc.

My dad was/is very quick to losing his temper, and that's not what makes me dislike him. It's the fact that he would never apologize for the things he said during his fits. 

It's important to recognize your mistakes. And your kids will not vilify you for them as long as you recognize them. "

"Man called in said he needed an ambulance because his daughter was having a baby. Asked him how far along she was and he said he could see it coming out. Dispatched the ambulance out and remained on the line with him, and ended up walking him through the whole delivery. 

Ambulance calls off and says they're on location. Paramedic radios in and asks to confirm address - they're at the right one. Paramedics were absolutely dumbfounded when they walked in the apartment and all they found was a male in his 60's laying in bed. He clearly wasn't all there and went in for an evaluation.

This guy was describing everything in such vivid detail and nothing seemed out of place. In hindsight the only thing missing was the screaming from the daughter/baby, but that was overlooked I with every thing going on."

""Growing up, my mom and her siblings would make banana bread every week.

Literally every week since the first one of them learned how to make it, they started making banana bread- lo and behold though, they liked it with walnuts and they all knew their dad hated walnuts.

So they made a special loaf of banana bread just for him every week, just for him to eat. Nobody else was allowed to eat it because that was his banana bread, baked especially for him.

So anyways, they did this once a week from middle school up until every last one of them moved out of the house (and considering there was at least 10 years difference from the oldest to the youngest, this was quite some time). So that’s like… 16 years of weekly banana bread. And he always finished it. He, without fail, ate the whole loaf of bread by himself.

That’s approximately 835 loaves of banana bread.

Now

Skip ahead a few years…

and they’re all visiting and baking banana bread and they start making a dad’s bread and their mom comes in, “I don’t think he can handle eating one more slice of banana bread!”

“What are you talking about? He loves banana bread! He had it all the time!”

This is when my grandma, their mom, broke the news that my grandfather loathed banana bread with every fiber of his being. He just adored that his kids loved him enough to make him a special loaf of banana bread every week (and he didn’t have the heart to tell them that he couldn’t stand banana bread) and he was incredibly, utterly upset that my grandma told the kids his big secret.

My grandfather was a loving, patient, gentle man who absolutely hated banana bread but loved his kids so much more and I just wanted to share that with you guys. I think this story is just about the perfect example of the kind of person he was."""

Now, I'm a believer in the pre-game. I was staying in Caesers, and myself, 2 girl homies and 2 boy homies were doing just that. I went a little hard in the paint, and I was FUCKING HAMMERED before we even went out.

As we walked down the strip, sometime past midnight, I noticed that my phone was missing. Surely, I must have left it in the hotel room. I tapped somebody on the shoulder, muttered something about forgetting my phone, and turned around, heading back to the hotel.

Halfway back, my legs started getting tired. I saw, to my left, one of those bus things that transport you for money, so I hopped on. I threw what I think was a $20 at the driver, sat in the least comfortable seat I could imagine, and instantly passed out.

I was awoken, sometime later, at the end of the line. Bus driver shouting at me to get off. I acquiesced, and was left in the dust, well away from the strip, and Caesers. I pulled out my phone (I know), and found well over 30 texts and missed calls from my friends, who were probably worried about me. However, it was like 3 a.m (I think?) and nobody was picking up, which meant they had an early night. I would later find out I didn't even tell them I was going back to the hotel; I tapped some random lady on the shoulder.

Thank God for Uber.

TL;DR: Pre-gamed til shithoused, lost my phone in my pocket, hopped on bus, passed out, got kicked off bus several hours later, had to Uber back."

"A lot of that is because of disagreement over even what the facts are. Conservatives have three main proposals to ""fix"" Social Security.

1. Change the yearly cost of living adjustments (COLAs) to chained CPI. This is the idea that although prices of goods may increase at X% each year, people will switch to a cheaper product when pushed, this protecting themselves against inflation. The problem here is that the poorest of the poor have already done that.

2. Raise the retirement age - They're proposals usually say 2 years. This is like a 20% benefit cut right here. 69 is too high to have regular retirement, and it virtually gets rid of any delayed retirement advantage currently in the system. Basically, it fucks over millennials (AGAIN) because the baby boomers didn't want to deal with the problem.

3. Privatize a certain portion of Social Security - We currently take 6.2% of income up to something like $120k. This is what pays for it. THey want to reduce the amount of incoming tax and force people to instead buy into the market (via stocks or bonds) to build a nest egg.

Now, while I disagree with all these proposals for certain poverty-based reasons, they're all based on the premise that social security is going broke. The worst case scenario is that social security pays out 77% of benefits promised. That's the worst. It'll likely be better, and with smaller, less dramatic changes, it can be fixed much easier, but without even agreeing on what the facts are, how can we compromise?"
I thought this was normal.
"You can take the Amish as example. 

They're one of the most conservative cultures out there, yet they are open for change. The Amish's main objective is to keep their value system preserved. They feel like electricity is harming them in this regard, so they ban it. 

If you look into their culture a little deeper, you notice that they are open to change. 97% of them use a motorized washing machine, 70% a running bath tub. This was unimaginable some years in the past. 100 years down the road, they might use cell phones. 

What people forget about the Amish. Unlike North Korea, they are not a sheltered community. During Rumspringa, they can experience the technology out there. In the end, they can decide what their life looks like 50 years down the road. They can decide what technology is useful for implementation. This behaviour prevents resentment from growing. "
My thoughts exactly. It's fucked up when parents lose sight of a child being an actual person rather than just a tool you can use to harm someone else. I'm well into my adult years and I'll never forgive my parents for it.
"I had a baby doll in the mid-90s named Little Splash n' Shivers. The gimmick was that she could go in the bathtub or pool with you. She had a cute hot pink one-piece swimsuit with a built in pool floaty ring in the same color. After about a minute or so of being in the water she would ""shiver""-- which meant the doll *vibrated*.

I cringe thinking about it. I'd ask my mother if she remembers it and thought it was strange in any sort of way, but she passed away. I doubt my father would remember."

"Well here goes nothing...

I wasn't raised in a very emotionally affectionate family. We didn't do a lot of hugging, not many times did I hear ""I love you"". Which made learning to be a person comfortable with emotional intimacy, a nightmare. 

But that's my challenge and something I've spent the better part of my life working on improving.

I have a 6 month old daughter. I want to be better for her, I don't want her to carry my baggage. So when I'm not in the best of moods, I start by giving my wife a hug. And I wait for her to start to pull out of the hug, and then I pull her back to me and hug her for a bit longer. That always makes her do this thing where she closes her eyes and exhales, and smiles. That makes me feel good.

Then I grab my daughter and we go out to the front. I sit in this stupid wooden chair we have that looks out over the front yard. And I hold my daughter facing me, and I bring her head very close to mine, so our foreheads are touching and we just look at each other in the eyes. And every 2 or 3 seconds, I will kiss each of her cheeks and then sit her back a bit. She will then reach her arms toward my shoulders and pull herself back into my forehead and I repeat that process 5-10 times. And every time, that fixes my mood. I have no idea what she sees in my eyes, but I only see love in that moment.

Because there are times, when you just need to remember that whatever put you in that bad mood, doesn't mean shit when you take a moment to consider, the things that really matter to you."

"Not someone I knew closely, but someone I deeply admired and respected.

I had a professor that I thought *completely* had their act together. This person had a career and I life that I wanted for myself.

Years later, I heard the terrible news that my professor had died in a murder-suicide. She and her husband were going through an ugly divorce, and she shot him on the front lawn before turning the gun on herself. It made me realize that I likely had a completely shallow and incomplete view of her life, and how wrong we can be when we make assumptions about other people."

"I doubt that guy wants his daughter to be a strong, independant human being. He wants her to be submissive and know her place like all other women. As she grows up he will continue to make comments and implications like that until she subtly learns what being a woman means around men like her father. He's not conscious of the fact that he wants this, but he and all other sexist men do. It's intentional to ensure that no woman will ever challenge him. It's a tactic so he never has to strive to improve himself; he can just automatically be better than all women.

I feel really terrible for his daughter. Growing up with sexist parents while trying to learn to be a whole person is an exercise in frustration. A lot of self-denial and pain, an expectation to achieve to make your parents proud, with an accompanying expectation to make sure you don't achieve _too much_ or do anything incorrectly.

"I'm Indonesian but I've been mistaken for being half white half Asian, filipino, thai, or even hispanic. Most people don't even know Indonesia exists let alone how most Indonesians look like. 

So I was at the mall in California shopping at an outlet when I heard a mom and her daughter talking about the items I had in my hand in Indonesian. They seemed to be really interested and was waiting for me to no longer be interested and put it down so they could take it. Too bad I decided to buy it because I'm petty. 

Most of the time though my own people can recognize me as Indonesian (though not all can). I work at a university bookstore and there was a group of older professors from Indonesia visiting. They talked amongst themselves trying to figure out whether or not I was Indonesian (and even what part of Indonesia I was from). I made a point to walk over to them and ask ""ada yang bisa dibantu?"" (is there anything I can help?). They were so relieved and I made a lot of sales that day haha. "

"Milan, Italy.  
  It was a missed connection with a train so we arrived really late at night. We were going to chill at the station for a few hours until the next train at 5am. Multiple police and other people we asked suggested we find a hotel as it wasn't safe for a group of girls to stay there at night. A few women seemed really worried and really tried to convince us not to stay. As we were walking out to find a hotel the people in and around the station gave off a very sketchy vibe. We over heard some man's conversation, got so freaked out we booked the first available room. Maybe it's nice during the day but at night it left a bad impression. "
"When I was about 12, I went to the American Girl Doll store in New York City with my twin sister. We were just browsing around when I saw my sister reach into her pants and scratch her butt.

Honestly I think she was probably more embarrassed than I was. "
"Teachers tend to be like that. One of my teacher, a french teacher (I'm french canadian), marked some words wrong on some student, including that fricking asian that had a 98% average in all class... In french, ""Cheval"" (horse) was one of the way too many exception when you make it plurial. The rule is to add 's', but not for cheval, it's ""chevaux"", until a few years before my class, where they officially removed the exception, so it is now ""chevals"" and the old ""chevaux"" is also accepted. That student wrote it ""chevals"". She marked it wrong, including some other words. First dictionary: chevals, second one: chevals  and third one? chevals!   Even with the 3 dictionary showing that it is right she still marked it as a fault and claimed it to be a mistake in the 3 brands of dictionary! The student went to the director, which went to the teacher, which still refused to mark it. The director ordered her to fix her store, she refused. She got a notice in writting and the score got corrected.

Next week, another thing again... I don't know what it was, all I know is: refusal, director, refusal, written, fixed.

2 months after the ""chevals"" incident, she lost her job. Rumor said she never worked again as a teacher as she couln't find another job.

edit: This is embarassing, it look like ""chevaux"" is actually the proper term and ""chevals"" never was. I wish I still had my dictionary because I'm 100% sure that it was in it... Maybe it was a mistake that slipped in..."

In the novel, there is a scene where Gary Oldman's character comes face to face with the soviet spy who would become his nemesis throughout the trilogy of books. He tries and fails to get this spy to defect, his arguments falling on deaf ears and even giving away his own insecurities about his personal life.

The soviet never said a word the whole time. When they adapted this scene into the movie, they just had Oldman tell the story to his colleague, then leaning across the table and speaking to the empty chair on the other side. Even if he's only re-enacting a one-sided conversation, you really feel the quiet gravity of the scene.

TL;dr - Gary Oldman talks to an empty chair and it's damn near oscar-worthy."

Instead, it was derisively redefined by the right as ""Obamacare"" (a name Obama obviously never wanted it to have -- even though I've seen people assuming it was an arrogant self-naming, for some reason) to turn people against it, and characterized as an evil far-left socialist plan.

As far as I'm aware, Leonardo was often described as being particularly beautiful, and a few inventories of his clothing that have survived do list a lot of pinks and purples in particular. 

However, the stories of strength--notably the horseshoe-bending--and the tale of him freeing a bird at the market come from Giorgio Vasari's *Lives of the Artists*. Though Vasari is often the closest and best source for a lot of biographical info on a number of Renaissance artists, he has repeatedly proven himself unreliable, and also seems to have been a big fan of over-embellishing and spinning mythological tales rather than focusing on historical fact. [His biography of Leonardo](http://web.mnstate.edu/gracyk/courses/web%20publishing/Vasari_daVinci.htm) is particularly deifying. Basically, I'd take those stories in particular with a grain of salt.

(An actual X-Rated historical fact related to Leonardo, since I'm here: [This drawing](https://milanoartexpo.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/leonardo-da-vinci-angelo-incarnato-recto.gif), called the *angelo incarnato* or angel incarnate, was rediscovered semi-recently and is generally attributed to Leonardo. It depicts an angelic figure with soft lips, a feminine chest, and a decisively drawn erection (that a later viewer apparently tried and failed to erase at one point, causing visible damage to the paper around it). Some historians believe it's a preparatory sketch for a painting of an angel that Leonardo never finished, the pose of which was recycled to Leonardo's *[Saint John the Baptist](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_C2RMF_retouched.jpg/1200px-Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Saint_John_the_Baptist_C2RMF_retouched.jpg)*.) (Bonus fact: The figure roughly matches the description of one of Leonardo's closest students/assistants/inheritors, Gian Giacomo Caprotti da Oreno, better known as Salaì, who is often speculated to have been an object of Leonardo's desire, or to have been his lover.)"

After a moment of silence, I just looked at her point blank and said ""I'm doing badly."" And she asked why, and I unloaded a lot of the problems I had been shouldering alone. She reacted with kindness, empathy, and shared some of her recent struggles with me in return. That lunch lasted for four hours. Literally, from that day on, she has been my best and most trusted friend, just because I decided to be honest and vulnerable for a moment. "

"The most bone chilling moment I've ever had was when I was pretty young. I was with a youth group on a mission trip. Each day we would do different tasks around the city we were in. This year's trip was to San Antonio. 

We were cleaning up a street and bridge area when we found some very disturbing things. It started with a bad full of used needles. That seemed relativity normal fire the location. It stepped up when we found a dead dog with a pentagram carved into its side. Under the bridge tucked at the top we found some burned sandals. That's when the cops came by. 

Turns out the night before, a homeless man had been shot and then burned to death underneath that bridge."

Lily steps out of Taxi 001 and Marshall tells her the good news but then the camera shows her face and she's all upset. she starts to cry

"Calling myself a lesbian. Not because being a lesbian is shameful at all, I'm just not; I'm bisexual.

I was in a 2-year relationship with another girl when I was a teenager, and she was uncomfortable with me calling myself bisexual because she was worried it would make guys hit on me. I go through phases where I'm more or less attracted to different genders and at the time I was more attracted to women, so I just caved and called myself a lesbian because I figured maybe I was. Maybe I'd just *thought* I was attracted to men because I was supposed to be.

It took me a long time to realize that in reality it was almost gaslighting. I'd never been a lesbian and it was ridiculous for me to call myself one just because my girlfriend wanted me to. I've been in fulfilling relationships with all sorts of people since then, and I'm actually still friends with that ex, but I still feel this slight twinge of embarrassment every time I think about it.

Edit: I'm bad at words."

There was so much more you could learn that the game was a constant journey of discovery, and that's always fun.

"About 11-12 years ago I was working at a trucking company doing general office stuff, data entry, and recruiting..

Apparently they hooked up on their lunch breaks a lot. I looked up their facebook profiles a year or so ago and they never got divorced, so I assume they were never discovered.

Edit: The guy was a major dick (think cartoonish alpha male), but the girl was usually sweet. They were little more than acquaintances at the time, so they're basically strangers now. I'd have to look through friends of friends on facebook to even remember their names. Whatever happened, whether they weathered it or never got found out, that's their business.

"I've attended the Penny Arcade Exposition - PAX, as folks call it - on a few different occasions. In fact, I was lucky enough to be present at the first-ever PAX South, which took place in San Antonio, Texas. It was a damned entertaining experience for the most part, although not without its downsides... and one of those less-than-stellar moments came about as the result of the compliment that I received.

Now, I should tell you right away that the utterance in question almost certainly wasn't *meant* as a compliment. It was offered to me by a short, moderately overweight young woman after she had apparently taken offense to my having approached her friend, who was dressed as Susan Sto Helit from the ""Discworld"" novels. Given that Terry Pratchett's work is some of my favorite, I'd been hoping to snap a picture of the costume, and the process of asking for permission had resulted in a lighthearted conversation about literature in general.

About a minute and a half into the exchange, though, Susan's friend interjected herself.

""She isn't interested, you know!"" the girl snarled.

I looked over at her, doing my best to pretend that I didn't understand the veiled accusation. ""I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean. We're just discussing...""

""Oh, bullshit!"" snapped the young woman. ""You don't know what you're talking about!""

""Do you want to quiz me or something?"" I asked.

I'd said it with as much friendly charm as I could muster, hoping to defuse the girl's rapidly rising temper. Unfortunately, it had the opposite effect: She exploded at me, stepping forward and shouting up into my face.

""Shut up! Just shut up! You don't belong here! You're just here to pick up women! You're too hot to be a geek!""

Without another word, the young woman grabbed her friend by the hand and stormed away. The taller of the two - Susan - looked over her shoulder and mouthed what might have been ""Sorry,"" then disappeared into the crowd. I never did get my picture... and my girlfriend - who had been watching the entire exchange - made fun of me for being a ""fake geek"" for the rest of the day.

**TL;DR: Apparently I'm too attractive to enjoy my favorite author.**"

"In middle school, there was this morbidly obese girl that liked me and was aggressive about it. I tried to be polite about my disinterest. It wasn't just her size but her personality as well. She was crass and rude and talked about idiotic and disgusting things and just not someone I wanted to associate with. We had the same group of friends and she constantly wrote me notes and hung around my locker and tried to be everywhere I was while pawing at me and putting her arms around me and telling everyone how much she wanted to be my girlfriend. The whole time I never lost it and I just tried to be nice and keep distance between us and let my disinterest be known. It sorta became a joke amongst my friends with them always ribbing me about it.

Flash forward and I move to where I go to a different local high school than most of the kids in my middle school and lost touch with many of them when this girl drives by my new place one weekend and sees me hanging out front and stops and tells me that there is a party at her house and most of my old friends are there and she was just driving to pick up a friend who ended up not being able to come. I think about it and decide I really want to see my old friends (including a couple of girls I *did* have crushes on) so I jump in her truck and go with her as I didn't have a car yet.
When we get there no one else was there and she keeps telling me they were coming as the party is supposed to start later and I am just very early. It was mid afternoon so it was kinda believable. Her parents were gone and she kept trying to give me more and more alcohol while becoming more and more aggressive. She would sit next to me and start touching me inappropriately and I would politely move and she would then try to sit on me (dear god). No matter where I moved she was on top of me and she was a little drunk making her that much braver and inappropriate to where I finally asked where the restroom was and went in and locked the door and climbed out the window and walked home. As I climbed out the window she was knocking on the door asking me to hurry because she had a surprise for me. To this day I shudder to think what it was. I sprinted the first several blocks and then winded my way through odd streets afraid she would show up in her truck.  I felt bad about it. For dissing someone so hard for just liking me but realized it was more than that. 

I didn't see her for years after that until one night I was in a club and the waitress kept bringing me drinks from someone but would not say who. Drinks with names like Sloe Comfortable Screw and Orgasm and Sex On The Beach with the waitress making a note of the name of the drink when she dropped it off. The hint was very clear albeit very forward. I scoured the place hoping to get a clue who was flirting with me to no avail. Finally after no one revealed themselves I figured it was just some shy girl being bold with her flirtations or a joke of some kind so I got ready to leave and she showed up looking and acting the same and said it was her (I have no idea where she was that I didn't see her but this was a two story club) and wanted me to go home with her to which I made excuses and left. I have never seen or heard from her since.

"I'm so sorry that this happened and also that you had to know about it. I was born to fix my parents' marriage. Instead, there were serious complications with the pregnancy and birth, so I drained all of their resources, caused them to dig a financial hole they'd never get out of, and permanently destroyed my mom's health.

They divorced when I was 20, after years of screaming, stress, and mental illness. It was...unpleasant. Took a good bit of therapy to stop blaming myself for just existing, even though I didn't ask to be born to begin with."

"At university, I found some ducklings that had fallen into a drain. I had to get them out with a pan, and I videoed the whole thing.

I was even asked to do an interview on BBC radio about it. Guess they thought it was a good 'human interest' story.

It was posted all over local Facebook pages and everyone in my city seemed to have seen it."

"I live in an old city, so there's other way juicier urban legends and ghost stories, but this one's my favorite because of how mundane it is. There's this story that if you drive through the park at night, a police officer will pull you over for speeding. He writes you a ticket and tells you to be more careful when driving.  When you go to pay the ticket there's no record of one being issued, and the officer who supposedly gave you the ticket has been dead for years. 

The ghost cop doesn't kill you or curse you after giving you the speeding ticket. He doesn't even look scary like a ghost, apparently. He just leaves. The ghost of Officer Mild Inconvenience haunts my local park.

"I've got a super similar story about talking to my dead grandfather as an ""imaginary friend.""

As a young child, I had an imaginary friend who would frequently step through the window next to where I sat and watch movies with me on an old TV/VCR. I have rather clear memories of this part at least and of two key features of my imaginary friend: the first being that I called him Sonny and the second that Sonny was an extremely tall guy. While I don't have specific memories of what Sonny looked like now, I do remember that Sonny had to bend down as he stepped through the window and into my playroom.

To preface this next part, this is where my mother's side of the story comes in. I have no true recollection of these events. It is a situation where I feel like I have a memory of the event, but realistically I think this is where my mind is filling in the blanks of the memory with my mother's story. 

Her story goes that while going through a box of my father's stuff, my mother found a boatload of pictures of my dad's family and kept them out for him to look at after he returned from work. I, being the nosy and bored child I was, spent my time with her while she was sorting things out and going through the pictures mostly quietly until we came across a certain picture of my grandfather, dad's side. This man had passed many, many years ago tragically in a car accident with a drunk driver and my father next to him, but that would be a story for a different time. Regardless, this is the man I identified as Sonny, who came through the window to watch movies with me. My mother told me no, this was my grandfather who was no longer with us - after all, his name was written on the back of the photo clear as day and could be interpreted in no way as ""Sonny."" 

The day went on and my father eventually returned from work and my mom showed him all the pictures she had found, of which I believe at least one is still hanging around the house somewhere. As they went across the picture I had pointed out, my mom told him how earlier I said this was my imaginary friend Sonny. This, apparently, was rather shocking to my dad as while his father's name was not Sonny, this was the nickname his coworkers had given him. A name that I had no way of really knowing, combined with a tall, slender physique and picture recognition seemed to seal the deal for them; my grandfather would come in through the window to watch tapes with me.

While the memories I do have of these events are mostly limited to the area he visited me in, the name, and the tall man climbing through the window, I have no real recollection of a sense of time around those events and when they stopped/started, but I'm sure my mother remembers as it spooked the hell out of her.

So yeah, apparently my dead grandpa and I were pals. Like you said though, not particularly scary for me, but my parents sure freaked the fuck out when I knew a name and a face of someone who died years ago."

"Oh man. I have so many....
Best one I guess is the time I went and rented a condo at a ski resort. I rented it in the summer for cheap deals. Anyways invited several people up to said condo, including a guy a was kinda seeing. Anyways he wasn't able to make it for some reason. All good. Whatever I'll see him another time. I've already got 8 other friends here to hang and make memories with. So we do. Later he calls and says oh hey I'm going to come by anyways and my buddies are on their way as well if that's cool. I say sure that's great more the merrier. Some time later we're all in the hot tub or playing cards inside having fun. The buddies of guy I'm seeing show up. But not the guy. I call and he says change of plans he wouldn't make it. Kinda peeved I'm stuck with 4 hulking guys I don't even know in a rental condo. They were part of a wrestling show tour thing. So yea. Hulking was no joke. Anyways. I kinda let it go cause my girlfriends seem pretty pleased with the eye candy. But nearing the time where we all gotta go to bed. One of the buddies that shows up tells me that the guy I'm dating said to take care of me. I was like yea we're fine all having fun it's safe here. He's like no, take care of your needs.... I quickly shut him down. He ended up fucking my best friend on the pull out couch. Whatever that's fine. Here's the actual nice guy part. One of those guys stole all the booze from the fridge and took a shit in my friends make up bag. I really to this day wonder if it was the one that had sex with her. 

Same guy still randomly messages me on fb and tries to make me feel bad for cutting ties with him shortly after that. He was not a nice guy. "

"John Locke's death hit me the worst on that show. He had such a shitty, awful life and he found his redemption on the island. Suddenly he was a leader, suddenly he could walk again. He was 100% right about everything that was going on on that island when nobody else could figure out any of it.

He pulls the trigger, Kate dies, then Ari grimaces and mutters ""sorry Katelyn"" and...doesn't shoot Gibbs? He's a trained Israeli Mossad sniper and he just takes a minute for some mumbling while the much more valuable and dangerous targets are in shock on the roof? This makes no sense to me.

"Sorry to hijack the top comment, but I similarly fell flat on my back from a tall heigh (2 stories, and each story was quite tall).

I was in university at an epic kegger with around 300 people, and me and some other random guy decided in our drunken wisdom that it would be a good idea to jump of the roof of this house and swing from a high branch on a tree. The other guys jumped first and barely held on to the branch, falling two stories onto his feet relatively unscathed.

I firmly decided at that point that I would NOT let go of the branch. I would hold on, swinging mightily and proudly to the applause of the crowd, forever being remembered as hero who had the balls to get er done. Of course, it didn't quite work out that way.

After jumping off the roof and grabbing onto the branch, I swung for a brief moment, then the branch snapped, putting me in a completely horizontal position. I don't really remember the fall, except for thinking ""I AM ROYALLY FUCKED!!!"" When I hit the grass lying flat with the heavy branch across my chest, I could see stars and couldn't breathe at all. After very long minute though, I was able to breathe again and all was well. When I got up, I noticed that my head had fallen just inches from a concrete walkway that ringed the house. I don't imagine my head would have survived that.

I went on to party for another few hours, even engaging in a boxing match, until the cops came and shut us down. Moral of the story, don't do stupid things when you're drunk. I still see stars whenever I do a handstand or move my head to briskly.

Equally bad was my 9th or 10th birthday and we were going to the movies as a family, which was a big deal for a few reasons - as a family who didn't have any money, with 4 kids, movies were a luxury we couldn't afford. Plus we lived in the middle of nowhere so it was over an hour drive to get to the movie theater. Nevertheless, we were going. This would've been my first time at the movies in my life. I'd gotten stung by a wasp just before we left for the movies and I guess I was upset about how much it hurt and my complaining made my dad angry so when we got to the movie theater he said ""nevermind, we're not going"" and turned the car around and drove home.

"Met my bf while his dad was in prison, when he got out, our parents ended up getting married. We shared a bedroom and when we wanted to ""get away"" we'd sleep in an old trailer in the backyard behind the barn. 

-Once, for fun, we set up a kiddie pool (2 ft deep at most,) and jumped off the roof into the pool. 

-Once, we caught a fox that was trying to eat the baby animals out of our barn, we made a makeshift ""habitat"" and kept him as a pet. He was a mean bastard.

-We also had a cow named Rambo that we would ride around.

-We had a miniature pony named Zeus who tried to fight with a bull next door and got impaled, we ended up selling him to some weird guy who owns a petting zoo for retired animals.

-One of our cows had a hard time delivering her calf, so we lasso'd its feet and pulled it out of the mom. Named him Clifford cause he was big and red.

I'd also like to add that our parents split (thank god) so now it's less weird for us to be together, even though we were first, so technically they're the weird ones."

"This is my favorite account of this phenomenon by Rebecca Solnit  (author of ""Men Explain Things to Me""):

""He sat us down at his authentically grainy wood table and said to me, ""So? I hear you've written a couple of books.""

I replied, ""Several, actually.""

He said, in the way you encourage your friend's seven-year-old to describe flute practice, ""And what are they about?""

They were actually about quite a few different things, the six or seven out by then, but I began to speak only of the most recent on that summer day in 2003, River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West, my book on the annihilation of time and space and the industrialization of everyday life.

He cut me off soon after I mentioned Muybridge. ""And have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?""

So caught up was I in my assigned role as ingénue that I was perfectly willing to entertain the possibility that another book on the same subject had come out simultaneously and I'd somehow missed it. He was already telling me about the very important book -- with that smug look I know so well in a man holding forth, eyes fixed on the fuzzy far horizon of his own authority.

...So, Mr. Very Important was going on smugly about this book I should have known when Sallie interrupted him to say, ""That's her book."" Or tried to interrupt him anyway.

But he just continued on his way. She had to say, ""That's her book"" three or four times before he finally took it in. And then, as if in a nineteenth-century novel, he went ashen. That I was indeed the author of the very important book it turned out he hadn't read, just read about in the New York Times Book Review a few months earlier, so confused the neat categories into which his world was sorted that he was stunned speechless -- for a moment, before he began holding forth again. Being women, we were politely out of earshot before we started laughing, and we've never really stopped."""

Why are there so many songs about rainbows?

That's part of what rainbows do.

Rainbows are memories, sweet dream reminders --

What is it you'd like to do?

I know you're watching it, too.

Someday you'll find it, the rainbow connection,

The lovers, the dreamers, and you!

"Because we simply don't know what it is. Dark matter is proposed to exist on basis of observations that gravitational effects on large scales can not be explained by the normal visible matter. 
Dark matter is very hard to detect because of a few reasons.
First of all, it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force. It does interact with gravity, which is a very weak force, so this interaction is very hard to detect directly.
Moreover, dark matter doesn't stick together in the way that normal matter does. As far as we know there are no 'stars' and 'planets' made up of dark matter. Also, dark matter occupies a larger volume in and around a galaxy than the visible matter. The visible part of the galaxy sits inside a bigger halo of dark matter.
Finally, the density is still very small in spite of being about 5 times more abundant then normal matter. To understand this, think of the vast amount of empty space between two stars in a normal galaxy. The density of normal matter is already incredibly low (compared to earthly standards) in a galaxy, so a factor of 5 doesn't make the density of dark matter much higher (also keep in mind here that dark matter is probably more uniformly distributed). So even if dark matter is 'near' us right now, its gravitational effect on our solar system would be undetectable.

I think dark matter is not created as the galaxy gets older, but regions where the dark matter was a bit denser made it possible for galaxies to form earlier, which would explain the trend that older galaxies have more dark matter than younger ones.

Most scientists agree that there probably is something like dark matter, but there is still a possibility that it is not the correct explanation for the phenomena it should explain. Other theories, like entropic gravity, may explain the same phenomena whithout using dark matter, but are still researched."

Now I can just hop in my art desktops, tweak what I want, save it, switch to the game engine desktop with a keystroke and reload the model to see the updates. It's fast and fluid. "

"I apologize that this is kind of off-topic, but your comment reminded me of this:

I had an acquaintance from HS (I graduated in 2010) who was friends with some of my friends. He was a pretty normal dude back when I kind of knew him. He was shy and kind of dorky, but always super nice to everyone. I saw him by chance a year ago and he was like a totally different person. He had dropped out of college, had lost most of his friends due to personal issues, and was working at the local grocery store while still living at home.

He went into how he was training to be a reiki healer and was really into crystals and stuff. I remember thinking it was really odd, but I didn't laugh or anything. He wanted to get together sometime and show me some of the healing techniques he had apparently been learning, but I never took him up on it. At the time I was just super busy with my own life.

Fast forward a few months and news is going around that he committed suicide. :( Sometimes I think when people have obviously incorrect or really off world-views, its because they literally can't deal with reality anymore so they choose an alternative that they find more appealing. It's a way of hiding from how things really are."

"There are more issues here. Full disclosure: I am a legal immigrant who has obtained citizenship. I see a few problems with how my friends on the left view immigration.

For one, the influx of illegal aliens -- or undocumented workers, whichever you prefer -- does impact the ability of legal workers at the bottom of the economic scale to negotiate their incomes. They compete with a large contingent of workers who, due to their status, cannot realistically challenge working conditions or salaries. This creates, in effect, false competition and also produces working conditions that would not be accepted by those who work jobs legally. That is to say that the presence of these workers negatively affects the earning potential and working conditions of those at the bottom. In my mind, you cannot simultaneously complain about minimum wages and working conditions and advocate for the right of people to immigrate unfettered and unburdened by legal requirements.

In effect, when I hear farmers say that Americans are not willing to work some of these agricultural jobs like picking tomatoes, I think to myself: ""no, they're not willing to do it under the conditions and for the pay you provide."" So long as illegal aliens remain willing to do the work under precisely those conditions and for that pay, conditions and pay cannot and will not improve.

Secondly, dozens of hopefuls die every year near our borders. They die of thirst and hunger, and this intolerable. They take near inhuman risks in hopes of reaching the United States because they believe that if they can make it, they will be able to provide for their families. I do not begrudge them their dream, but I do believe that encouraging this is encouraging people to undertake incredibly risky endeavors that result in the deaths of dozens, if not hundreds, of people every year. I believe that anyone who advocates on behalf of illegal immigrants is complicit in these deaths. 

That said, I also believe very strongly that serious reform is in order. We have a need for labor and a system that does not allow us to meet that need through legal channels. That must change. "

You schedule and appointment, they show you around and my fiancee almost always falls in love with the place. She is sold. Then we look at the contract and whatnot. You have to use their approved caterers that charge $30+ a plate for food and there is a 20% service fee. Then you have to rent tables and chairs. You have to have a licensed bar tender and they offer drink packages. Decorations can be rented from the venue. Linens have to be brought in. You need a DJ and depending on the space you may also have to rent a dance floor. Grand total comes to somewhere between $25,000-$30,000. Fuck that.

"His name was John.

Back when I was a kid - which was before this sort of thing was considered normal or acceptable - there was a gay couple who lived up the road from my house. Their names were John and Gary, and they were some of my very favorite people in the world. John in particular was like a beloved uncle to me, always offering hilarious stories and exciting gifts, and taking me on fantastic adventures. My father taught me to think critically, and my mother encouraged my creative side, but it was John who first showed me how to bend the world's rules so that the most fun could be had.

I can remember John taking me to a circus once, and helping me sneak backstage to see the preparations being made. On another occasion, he talked the owner of a toy store into giving me free reign of the place for an hour. Every year on Halloween, the man would bring me an absolutely perfect pumpkin to be carved into a jack-o'-lantern, and for my fifth birthday, he pulled out all the stops in throwing me a Superman-themed party, going as far as to [make the decorations himself](http://i.imgur.com/8FeFTrw.jpg). Even after my family moved to another state, John stayed in touch, coming to visit on rare occasions and taking me out to get in the harmless sort of trouble for which our excursions were known.

Time went by and I lost contact with John. A few years ago, though, fond memories prompted me to try reconnecting with him. I doubt if I'll ever forget the day when I asked my mother for the man's telephone number, leading her to look him up... at which point, she discovered his obituary.

I found out later - though I never got confirmation - that he had likely taken his own life.

The truth is that I hadn't really gotten to know John. He had been a larger-than-life figure during my childhood, but I never interacted with him as an adult. I know that he collected wind-up toys, and I know that he worked as a realtor, but who he was beneath that boisterous smile and well-manicured mustache remained a mystery to me. For a brief period, I blamed myself for his death, thinking that if I'd reached out sooner, I might have somehow kept him alive. It's ridiculous, I know... but even so, his death affected me a lot more than I would have expected.

**TL;DR: I lost my favorite ""uncle,"" who taught me how to live life to the fullest.**"

My mother passed 10 years ago. My father has ~6 months to live. I didn't have the ""ideal"" childhood. But they were pretty committed to maintaining a traditional ""parent - child"" relationship. Even well into my early adulthood. I just didn't have the heart to tell them that at 11, while being used as a weapon/prize in their divorce, I stopped seeing them as my parents and started seeing the same behavior I recognized from other kids at school. These people were just school kids in grown-up outfits that were my parents. 

That's when I realized, you will always be a kid. But can you choose the appropriate time to act like an adult? I wish they had but they're not perfect. And neither am I."

My dad didn't find it until later but me and a friend of mine were running around in the woods nearby with slingshots and when we came back the first words out of my dad's mouth were: ""ALRIGHT, which one of you boys took a shit in the garage?"""

"When a man wrongs you in some way and apologizes by saying ""I'm sorry that you are upset"". 1. That's not an actual apology. 2. It implies that if a woman disagrees it's because she is too emotional not because she was wronged in some way.

"Last I heard, my hometown has 27 Red Hat groups.  I worked at a restaurant and we courted them to boost our lunch sales.  They only wear red hats, dress in purple, eat lunch, gossip, and spend the meal planning the next lunch.  The planning takes up more than half the meal and it was amazing to watch.  Imagine a group of cats trying to herd themselves.  

They were all fixed income, so they always gravitated towards a 10$ after tip total.  I was able to swing it and get them a special menu with items down to 8.50$ so I could get actually get a tip.  The main issue was that they all wanted separate bills.  We put a line on the menu that said something along the lines of ""each bill takes one minute to print"".  A group of 30 that wants separate checks?  That will be a half an hour.

My grandmother is a hell of a woman and very well respected in my town.  She is the one that told me the 27 group number.  Apparently each one has sent a group to her house to try and get her to join.  She asked them all the same question, ""Do you do anything other than eat?  Charity, scholarships, outreach, anything?"".  When they say ""no"" my grandmother would say ""how selfish"" and close the door in their face.  I need to bring my grandmother some flowers."

"I never thought I would share this story with total strangers but here goes. So my mother sister and I lived in a small apartment. An important thing to note is that my mother was a psychiatrist (she lost her license for attempting to kill a patient) so she had a very large collection of pain killers, psychedelics and more. So it was my sister's 13th birthday party and my mother decided to down an entire bottle of cough syrup, enough vodka to kill most people, and probably something else. It gets to be about 11 at night and my sister started making plans for her and her friends to sleep in the living room. At this point my mother starts trying to hit on some of her friends and demands to sleep right next to them. My sister says no and gets slapped across the face so hard I could hear it clear through my bedroom door. Next thing I know my sister has grabbed the phone telling me to call the cops and my father while she starts barricading my door with her body. ""I will burn this whole house down if I have to"" gets screamed at us as my mother breaks my door with a large knife in her hand. All I had time to do was tell the cops we needed police at our address before she points the knife at me all tells me to give her the phone. My sister then grabs the phone screaming for help as my mother grabs her by the throat and picks her up and presses her against my window. Lucky for us the police station was about a 5 min walk from our home so the cops were there after about 10 min of our little bedroom standoff, as soon as we saw the cops lights out the window my mom dropped my sister and sealed herself off in her room. I have never been able to forget the look in her eyes as she pointed the knife at me, it still gives me nightmares years later. 

I would say we got a happy ending but my dad was about the same as my mom so my sister and I got split up and we both ended up homeless. I found some very good friends I now call family to take me in, but my sister was not so lucky. I have not seen her in about a year now because her husband is abusing her even though she says he is perfect.

"The worst thing is that this kind of behaviour often works in middle/high school, but as your education gets higher so does the need for effort.

The seats are fairly space, so you're basically 4 feet above the next row in front of you. It's an actual rule in there, that if you get on your phone or talk, you'll be asked to leave. You can also order beer there. I fucking love Texas. "

"I hate this so much. One my good friends is renting the second bedroom in my condo. He had been going through some money issues, so I was lenient about rent for a while. Now he's back up to speed on expenses, but still is falling further behind on rent (he about 4 months behind at this point). 

I'm obviously justified in asking him about it on a fairly regular basis, but everytime I do, it just feels weird. He always acts offended that I ask, but then a day later he'll apologize for being so far behind, etc. etc. Then fails to pay me, and we start the cycle again. It's quite frustrating to deal with :(

"It's a misconception that you cannot give food to the homeless because they can sue you for food poisoning if they get sick from eating it, but you're covered under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act.  It protects the donor and the recipient agency against liability, excepting only gross negligence and/or intentional misconduct. In addition, each state has passed Good Samaritan Laws that provide liability protection to good faith donors.

The real reason most places refuse to donate food is that the cost of transport would exceed any tax deductions you'd get from the food in the first place and that it's a logistical nightmare that involves additional time in addition to cost.  And those places that pour bleach or some other noxious/toxic chemicals on their disposed otherwise good to eat food products is to avoid groups of scavengers near their establishments, or simply cheap individuals who would wait around for free merchandise rather than buying it in store."

"Leslie Burke from Bridge to Terebithia.

I remember when I first read that in third grade. Required reading for the whole class. Traumatized the hell out of me. It was such a feel-good book that seemed to be walking the road of espousing religious tenets contrasted with humanist pleasures of life, but then throws a wrench in the whole thing by having Leslie Burke suddenly die. There's foreshadowing of it, yes, but it's not explicit. The foreshadowing could mean anything along the theme of a rite of passage or coping with loss. But killing off Leslie, a child, the protagonist's best friend? While he was out and away at a museum with their teacher? It seemed like such a jarring tonal jolt from the implied direction of the story.

The book then shows its true purpose. It's supposed to traumatize you. It's supposed to make the reader appreciate the real life they have now, but also find ways of coping through sharing an outlet of escapism with others.

That being said though, Bridge to Terebithia never was my kind of reading material. The whole book felt preachy and saccharine, even after Leslie's death. I barely remember any details about it outside of her death. I just didn't like that book very much. Yet people may say ""well, re-read it, knowing what you know, see if it's any different? Any better?""

Here's the thing.  I did.

When I was a kid, I moved schools a lot. In fifth grade, I moved to a new campus. Bridge to Terebithia was classroom reading again. I was already prepared and knew how the book went. I got to enjoy from the outside as the class went through the same trauma I went through two years previous, and what was particularly cruel was it was subjected to us while we were on the emotional cusp of puberty. I remember a couple girls starting to cry, one of them so badly she had to leave the room.

Didn't make the book any better though. I think I ended up loathing the book even more.

I switched schools again. Sixth grade.

What was this? Some international conspiracy to demoralize the American populace at the elementary school level? Because apparently I was riding the wave of pubescent tears like some depressing child-murdering Groundhog Day. At least I enjoyed the uncharacteristically good grades I got on the quizzes and feedback. I already knew the material well enough, and knew all the cookie-cutter responses to discussion questions out of the compulsory academia cheat sheet.

Probably concerned the hell out of that teacher, seeing a D student acing and expressing strong attentiveness to a story where a child smashes her face on a river bank and drowns. If this was post-Columbine I probably would've been institutionalized.

Freshman year. Now in a private Catholic high school.

""Okay class, next week we will begin reading Bridge to Terebi-""

I've had enough.

""LESLIE BURKE *DIES*!"" I exhale in tremendous relief, breaking the cycle. ""There! Elaborate allegory for loss, acceptance, escapism, ET-FRIGGIN-CETERA! Leslie DIES IN A RIVER FOR NO REASON! You're *WELCOME!*""

And lo, when the act 2 climax of Leslie's rocky watery demise is revealed, the whole class responded in a way that finally brought me peace and sanity. Their unanimous, unimpressed, underwhelming ""meh"" was worth the one week lunch detention I got for my outburst."

"When I was younger, me and the neighborhood boys were on a tree climbing kick. Big or small, we would get together and climb trees around the area. Well, when my mom found out about it, she forbade it and told me I was going to hurt myself doing it. Being a kid I naturally ignored her thinking if I was careful I could never hurt myself. I remember one day me and the boys got together and started climbing my friends huge oak in his backyard. I had climbed it many times before and it was my favorite because it overlooked his two-story house. What made this day different was that it had rained only hours before so the branches were wet. I had made it all the way to the top before turning to climb back down to my friends at the bottom when I lost my footing and fell. It all happened so fast, there was literally no time for me to be scared. I fell from the top of the tree, head first, and missed almost every branch on the way down until the very last branch, 6 feet away from the ground. My legs had buckled as I was falling and I caught myself on the very last branch. Hanging there, upside down, staring at the ground below, I just thought to myself ""holy shit"" as all the adrenaline hit me. I am still convinced I would have died or broke my neck that day (which I did break three years later but that's another story). "

Funny thing, I actually used to be severely allergic to cats pre transplant but afterwards am not! Maybe because my aunt isn't allergic to cats? Doctors can't understand it. They thought it was the immunosuppressants I'm on but I gained new allergies and still have the standard pollen/dust ones. 

 I'm healthy now for the most part and in September will be my 8th liverversary! I'm an aunt to two adorable kids, a boy and a girl. Now I'm going to go lie in my hammock outside because it's a beautiful day!

"I'm hard of hearing. I read lips really well and its only to low* tones but you can tell on my especially bad days because I get louder. I constantly got grounded by my step mom for being ""too loud"" whether it was talking in general or moving around the house . I laugh loudly, and talk loudly. My beau has been pretty sweet and understanding of this because I make up for it by getting my hands dirty when he works on his cars. It's frustrating though because unless you really know me, you just think I'm this catty loud person on purpose when in reality, I have super discreet hearing aids. I'm 21 as well, so it was worse in high school and most college classes."

Sometimes I'll invite someone and get ""I'll let you know when I'm free"", which goes nowhere since they don't reply. The worst part is when I see this person go out with other people on social media even though they're ""super busy"".  "

And as a guy who is trying to be a good father to a toddler and a good husband to a great woman, let me tell you, taking care of a house and a kid is fucking exhausting. My work is where I rest. Those 1950s guys had it fucking *easy.* And those 1950s women, unless they were jagoffs, were doing plenty of work in raising kids, making three meals a day for everyone, and keeping a household up and running. That's more demanding than a full-time job. "

"The basic things to look at are copays for your general areas of doctor visits: Primary Care (physicals, colds, etc.), ER, Urgent Care, and RX. 

A good plan typically has low co-pays, but not necessarily. What makes a good plan good is how covered you really are in the event you needed serious medical coverage, like open heart surgery or brain surgery. For that, you look at your 'out of pocket max'. This means that this is the most you would spend of your own hard earned dollars before the insurance kicks fully in and takes over the rest.

Most insurers have a list of physicians and hospitals that they cover. Before seeing a doc, call that office or hospital and give them your specific insurance info to ensure they're covered, as an extra layer of assurance.

Another thing to be aware of are deductibles. If you're single, employee/spouse, family, etc. those will change. This also contributes to your out of pocket max, as described above.

The problem is that with these high-deductible plans, people flock to them because it lowers the monthly premium. Now, if you're a really healthy, young person, who rarely sees the doctor and doesn't take regular medication, they're great. Especially if your employer is not covering a majority (or any) of that monthly premium, and you're paying for it. 

It sucks when you are on a regular prescription and require frequent doctor visits. Sure, your monthly premium is only $300/mo, but you have a $3,500 deductible to meet before your insurance pays a dime - that's why they're willing to drop the monthly cost - they're not as liable up front to cover you. So as long as you have $3,500 to burn (per year, on top of your premium costs) then you're good. 

And this is why people (in the US, at least) put off getting care so often. /endrant"

A lot of them were about people like [Amanda Todd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Amanda_Todd) who killed themselves after lots of bullying. I also remember bullying being talked about so much on the news and even when Obama talked about it once. 

I just went along with it then because I was (edit: still am) against bullying just like the next person and was heartbroken and angered by tragedies like the one above.

"I posted this in another thread. It seems to fit here, sort of. 

I was introduced to her at a bar, by friends who thought I should meet her. She was gorgeous. We talked for about 10 minutes, seemed to have a decent rapport, and she indicated she needed to get back to her group of friends. I asked her for, and was given, her phone number.

The next morning I was going to go out on my 18 foot catamaran with my good buddy. I decided to call this dream girl to ask if she would like to join us. When she answered the phone I said ""Hello, this is Lobido."" There was no response from her, just silence. I added, ""Lobido Lastname, from the bar last night.""

She then said, ""How the fuck did you get my number!""

I must confess, I was a bit taken aback. But I continued. ""Well,"" I said, ""You gave it to me. Guess you had a bit too much to drink last night."" I was trying sound light hearted, to make her remark less awkward, at least for me.

She said, ""No.""

Despite what seemed to be her total dismissal of me as anything but someone she had put wholly out of her mind, I plowed ahead.

""Anyway,"" I said, ""The reason I called was to ask if you would like to go sailing with me and my friend this morning.""

She said, ""I have to go in to the office today. I'll take a rain check."" It was a Saturday.

My friend had witnessed my side of the conversational debacle and enjoyed my failure immensely. I had a good track record with women, so seeing me cut down to size filled him with glee, as buddies often enjoy seeing one another make asses of themselves.

I interrupted his laughter to hold out the slip of paper with her number on it, and asked him if he wanted it. He said no, so I threw the number in the trash.

A week later I decided to hold a party at my place. I had fairly recently broken up with a woman that I had lived with for two years, and I was on my own. I mention this fact because, as a bachelor, I was ill prepared to plan a party. I had, for most of my adult life, been involved with women who had kindly, and with great skill, arranged social events for us.

Nevertheless, I made my preparations. I purchased booze along with a large mass of cheddar cheese, in multiple blocks. I felt there was never enough cheddar cheese at parties, and I made certain I had a bounty of it. I neglected to buy much else, but I thought I had matters covered.

I called a number of my friends, as well as some newer friends. Among those I called was a woman I had met recently at another party and I asked her if she and her husband could attend. She said they would, and she asked if she could bring a friend. I said, ""Sure,"" and asked who she would be bringing.

She named the how-the-fuck-did-you-get-my-number girl, who had so thoroughly rejected me. I said I had met her, and looked forward to seeing her again. I figured, even if she wasn't attracted to me, we could still be friends.

On the evening of the party, as I prepared for folks to arrive, I realized I had a ridiculous surfeit of cheddar cheese. to encourage consumption I sculpted houses and other objects out of the cheese. After my guests arrived and saw my cheddar cheese extravaganza it became a joke, and I peddled the cheese throughout the evening.

The girl showed up, and we ended up talking together most of the night. It was made easy because she had made it so clear to me she wasn't attracted to me. But as the evening wore on I learned that, yes, she had been drinking the night before my call, and she had not remembered giving me her number. She was shocked I had called because she was not giving out her number. She had just ended her marriage, and was not giving people her number. She went into her office on Saturday because she had an interest in a fellow there who was working that day.

Despite her interest in her coworker, we continued to talk until all my other guests departed. We enjoyed each other's company. She agreed she would go out on my catamaran with me the following morning.

The next day we had a great time together on my boat, she was fearless in the harness out on the wire.

On Monday I sent her a half dozen roses. I figured her coworker should be put on notice, I was in the game.

On Wednesday I carved roses out of cheddar cheese, and attached real rose stems to them. I placed them in a box with a card I made that read on the outside, ""A rose is a rose is a rose... Gertrude Stein"" and when opened it read, ""....is cheese. Lobido Lastname."" I had my office's runner hand deliver it. He watched her open it, and she laughed.

A year and change later we married. On our invitations was a caricature of the two of us on our first phone call with one another, with me introducing myself and her asking me, ""How the @#%$ did you get my number!"" The card opened to a drawing of wedding bells, and beneath them was the phrase, ""Persistence pays off.""

We have been married for 27 years.

TLDR: She gave me her number, but when I called she asked me how the fuck I got it. I had a party with too much cheese that she attended, it gave me another chance, then I wooed her with cheese roses. Still married 27 years later.

We had brainstorming sessions on how we could do more to help poor people in the area, and all of the ideas were for things like teaching people how to budget and be financially responsible and shit like that.  Meanwhile, I'm sure a lot of these struggling people we were discussing (maybe even most) aren't just financial morons.

"I was at Wrigley Field for a Cubs game during the 2015 season. A new menu item that season was the Joe Maddon Italian Hoagie, as this was his first year as Cubs' manager. So I'm standing downstairs in the concourse looking over the menu to figure out what I wanted to eat, when I saw a big camera crew all wearing ESPN lanyards. They had the giant camera, boom mic, guy in a suit, interns, etc. I went to to them and asked what they were filming and they said they needed a promo for the Joe Maddon Italian Hoagie. The man in the said, ""Did you already get something to eat?"" I replied, ""Nope. I was just about to go order."" He then asked me if I wanted to go order the Italian Hoagie while they filmed it from various angles. The guy handed me a $20 bill and told me to go order it. Thy stationed a camera next to me and a camera on the opposite side of the counter. Take 1. Action. I ordered the Hoagie and a Coke. The cashier girl then asked if I wanted a Diet Coke or a regular Coke. Then the guy in the suit said we had to start over because that interrupted the flow of the scene. Take 2. Action. I ordered the Hoagie and a Coke. The cashier then asked if I wanted a little bit of ice, a lotta bit of ice, or no ice. Then the guy in the suit said we had to start over and do it again. The girl behind the register wasn't comprehending that they just needed the 15 seconds of film it takes to order and pay for the new sandwich. Finally on take 3 we got a usable clip. It aired on Sunday night baseball for the Cubs vs. Cardinals game. Literally my 15 seconds of fame. "

Pretty much all the front lines employees are 100% behind net neutrality. Not only is the alternative unjust and un-American, it likely means way more work and nuances for pretty much everyone. 

The security dudes in particular get really heated on the subject.

Senior leadership officially had no position on the subject.

Offline (meaning, talking over multiple beers in a shitty bar near the office after working hours), I got the impression that a lot of senior leadership is interested in the alternative. There's a lot of billable work in blocking access to some sites or throttling others. 

Anecdotally, we implemented micro versions of blocking/throttling for certain clients but this was to block access to social media and porn while ensuring certain SAAS web apps ran faster for employees. So the beta implementations were successful, and lucrative but not very wide reaching. Even supporting that though was a giant pain in the ass for operations and reporting teams. "

"One of my former employer's reasons against raising the pay for lower-level positions (definitely above entry level) was that other employees would want a raise as well. She couldn't grasp the fact that we didn't care if the new employees got an extra $1-to-2/hr over the old wage, we just needed someone that could do the job so we weren't understaffed and overworked. 

Edit: For those responding, the position (receptionist/bookkeeper) was definitely being underpaid for the skill level and workload which is why we had no issue if the wage was raised. The position wasn't attracting the people we wanted/needed and the employer would get final decision on new hires which usually resulted in her choosing relatives/friends over other applicants (which was partially why the pay was so low)."

"I fell for one of those criminal dent-removal in the driveway scams. Older car, worth nothing, had a big dent in the fender and the guy only wanted fifty bucks or so. Figured, what do I have to lose, if the results aren't good I won't pay. When I went outside to look at the handiwork the dent was pulled and fender was covered with a waxy substance. They said they used heat to remove the dent and the coating was to protect the paint job and I should rub it off later. At this point I suspected something was fishy and that these guys were criminals. But we were in my driveway and my family was inside. If I refused to pay, or called the cops, what retribution was I opening myself up to? Considering it a tuition payment in the school of life, I paid the guys and later rubbed off the wax and saw the drill holes where they had punched through the metal to pull out the dent. Bastards! But I learned a lesson. "

"hokay, I'm gonna go for an ""explain it like I'm five"" and give you the same explanation I gave my parents (not to talk down to you, just to keep it simple). 

Net neutrality is the practice that all data is treated equally.

Data is is the information carried through the ""tubes"" but tubes is not really an accurate metaphor. We often hear the metaphor of water going through a pipe, but this simply isn't how data works. Data is not water/gas/oil, it is a signal that is carried electronically. I'm sure you already know this, but I wanted to make this part clear before muddying it with further metaphors. 

In net neutrality any message being transferred is allotted equal prioritization. This means, to an ISP, my reddit comment is just as valuable a package as somebody streaming a youtube video or somebody streaming on netflix. Under net neutrality this is the rule of law. The regulation in question is whether or not ISP's should be allowed to influence this value of data. Depending on how you look at it, (and it really can be spun both ways) net neutrality is both government regulation as well as the absence of regulation, ie: it could be argued that net neutrality is the government regulating ISPs unfairly while it is just as viable an argument that net neutrality is actually a bureaucratic hurdle to *prevent* regulation from either the government or an ISP (the latter being my subjective outlook). 

One of the arguments against net neutrality is that all data is *not* equal. Now, I do not personally ascribe to this viewpoint and can explain why if you like, but the ethics of net neutrality are a separate beast from what you're asking. We often hear arguments for ""fast lanes"" but this is misleading. Under net neutrality you can't have a ""fast lane"" because all data has to move at the same speed (that speed being whatever the bandwidth of your network is) if an ISP has a 70mph cable, all data is traveling at that freeway at 70mph. The problem with the ""fast lane"" argument is, you can't actually make a 70mph cable faster, you can only slow down the other data going through it. On top of this, you could now limit how far somebody could ""drive on the freeway"" by now requiring people who already have access to your 70mph road now pay an additional sum to actually use the road they're already paying to be on. 

As you can see, the highway and tube metaphor falls apart really fast. The internet is a separate thing from any utility or resource that has come before it and I really don't blame people for not getting it, but for that same reason people who don't understand it have no business changing the current operation. Even if the relation between users and ISPs can be improved with new laws (and I have no doubt it can), the abolition of net neutrality doesn't do this. Ending net neutrality doesn't fix a problem with the internet, it creates systems of power that were not there before. 

One last thing you touched on. There is a finite amount of bandwidth. This is not an easy thing to address and goes into some of the other issues with the internet that could be fixed. As it stands, the current handling of ISPs, the relative monopoly telecom companies have over regions and the disingenuous marketing on what services ISPs can (and actually do) provide are all much more prudent issues facing the internet and communications technology today, however abolishing net neutrality wouldn't begin to fix these problems, they would exacerbate them.

"My family would always go camping with my mom's best friend and her family. They had two boys around the same age as my brothers and I (but closer to my brothers...I was the oldest), so we always had a blast together. One time, when I was about 13 my mom's friend brought her sister and nieces with her to the campout. The youngest niece was 15, and she was fucking beautiful. I immediately clammed up and refused to play with the rest if the boys for fear of looking immature around her. Later that night, as everyone is sitting around the campfire, I began to worry about having B.O. around her, so I decided I would go to the showerhouse down the road, and take a shower.  When I told my dad this, he loudly (and for some reason angrily) said, ""No! You only want to take a shower because *she's* here!"" while pointing directly at her. I had never felt more embarrassed and I just ran down to the lake to get away from everyone who was staring at me.

I guess I could say it all worked out in the end, because after I had been sitting down by the lake for a while, the girl came to talk to me. She told me she was sorry and gave me my first kiss....out of pity. "

She had four grandsons up until last year, until #5 happened accidentally.  Ok, we all thought, a weird coincidence.  Two years ago, my aunt and her sister were in Key West and were sitting at a bar.  They noticed an older lady in her 70's kept smiling at them.  Every time they looked over, she was just smiling at my aunt.  Finally, the woman gets up and walks over to her and says ""hello, do you remember me?""

"I'm narcoleptic. I'm fascinated by sleep research on and follow recent studies about sleep to better understand my neurological condition.    
Basically we don't know why we sleep or dream for certain. There are a lot of hypotheses, but no proven reason.      
When scientists study narcoleptic patients they found that we skip sleep stages and most of us go directly in REM which is dream mode. Our bodies never rest which is why we are always tired and despite excessive sleeping. The stages of sleep are so complex and if your brain messes that up it really fucks with you.  
Also, when you see someone with narcolepsy fall over suddenly they are not sleeping, they are having a cataplexy episode and lost all their muscle tone. They completely awake and aware but momentarily paralyzed and can't respond.     
I hope we find out why we sleep. It might mean a cure for narcolepsy instead of just treatment with stimulants.

"Spider-Women. It all began with a dream I had. 

I was walking down this long road in a city I didn't recognize. I always entered this city through a train tunnel. I would walk on the tracks, running my hands along this mountain to the left of me. To the right of me, there was this abandoned town. I never wanted to enter it, but I always did. In this town, there were a few stores, none of which were full of anyone. And IIRC there was a brothel too, but I could be wrong; it's been a long time since I took those drugs. Anyway, I would always walk through this town aimlessly until I reached more train tracks running perpendicular to the Main Street (parallel from the first set of tracks). I'd always walk on the tracks and I'd always eventually reach this big house. To put it in perspective, it sort of looked like the house of the grammar nazi in A series of unfortunate events. So in my dream, which always followed the same story, I'd enter the house. Inside, there was a kitchen in front of me and directly to the right of me a rope ladder. But it wasn't just any rope ladder, it was really wide, and sort of looked like a waffle. And this ladder would lead you up to the next floor, only the threshold in between floors was very narrow. So, as you were climbing the ladder, you'd sort of get stuck in between floors and had to squeeze your way out. It was at this part of my dream, as I'm climbing from the first floor to the second, that I yell out ""is anybody home?"" Nobody responds. The second floor was another kitchen. I kept on climbing. The third, fourth and fifth floors are once again all kitchens, but when I finally reach the top, the sixth floor, it's nothing but a big bed. There's nobody occupying it, so I cozy up and take a nap. For some reason, I have a dream within a dream at that point. The second dream is of me entering another town, only this one is in black and white and full of people. I look around, see people partying and a whole lot of sex. Out of the corner of my eye I spot a big house, and I fight the urge to have sex so I can go explore the house. When I enter the house, I see a bed and a rope ladder off to the side. I climb, getting all the way to the sixth floor where I see an array of weapons on the ground. Not wanting to find the owner of said weapons, I scurry down to the first floor and take a nap. Within that dream, it's a rainy night, and this time, I'm in the same town from the second dream (the one full of people) but I'm only observing it, not interacting. I see the same house, and as soon as I gaze towards it, the door opens. Out walks this extremely old woman with the body of a spider, holding an axe. Somehow, I instantly know what's going on. I try yelling for the lady to stop, but watch mortified as she goes into the town and murders all the party-goers. I instantly wake up from this nightmare, and I'm in a bed on the sixth floor of a building on the outskirts of an abandoned town. It's pouring rain outside. Suddenly, I hear the door open, and hear the pitter-patter of a giant spider walking on the floors beneath me. I'm petrified and realize I have to escape, and fast. But I don't move. I'm frozen in fear. The woman-spider climbs the rope, which I now recognize to be a web, and before I can move, gets to the top story. She sees me, but doesn't appear mad. For some reason, she's not as ugly or old as she looked in my third dream. She's gorgeous, with flowing black hair, stunning red lips, and shadowy eyes. ""Come with me"" she hisses, and I follow. We go to the fifth floor, and take a seat at the table. She starts to ask me strange questions, like what I thought about neckbeards, my stance on jumper cable-beat downs, and more. The more we talk, the more attracted I am to her. She's a perfect woman, I think. I wonder what compelled her to do the awful things she did, if she did indeed do those things. So, since it's a dream and I'm fearless, I ask her straight-up ""did you kill the people in that town?"" She instantly glares at me. Her face grows hideous, her teeth turn into fangs. She hisses ""they deserved it! They killed my son!"" For some reason, I'm not scared. We both calm down, her face turns back into the face of a model, her fangs turn back to teeth. I feel a pang of guilt, and instantly feel pity towards her. Again, this was a dream, so there were lots of plot holes, but for some reason, I instantly have an epiphany that this woman's son was killed by the townspeople. I automatically deduce that one of the townspeople had AIDS, and the son died from that. I also suddenly realize that the lady wanted to live a secluded life after the death of her son, but the townspeople were too loud, and she couldn't enjoy herself. That's why she had five beds, I think to myself. To ensure she could sleep. But when the townspeople were too obnoxious, she killed them, and turned her beds into kitchens! It all made sense (not really, but hey, it was a dream). Then, out of the blue, the spider-woman asks me if I like partying. ""Yes!"" I shouted. ""Do you wanna fuck meeee?""she asks, licking her lips and letting out a sensual moan. ""Of course!"" I instantly reply. Then I realize my mistake. ""You gave my son AIDS!"" She screeches. ""You and all those other horny teens! I must've missed the zebra when it clawed!"" I know I have to run. The spider-woman flips the table and I dash for the ladder. She lunges in front of me, blocking the path. I stick out my hand, and now I'm holding an orange. I throw the orange at her and she tumbles over on her back. Now's my chance, I think, and start to climb down the web. As I'm making the transition from the second floor to the ground level, I get stuck. And to my horror, I look up to see the spider-woman branding an axe and climbing down. I try to move but I can't. I'm stuck. The lady is now only feet above me. She pulls back her arm and drives the axe into my skull. Luckily, I now realize that I'd been wearing a helmet the whole time. And, as luck would have it, the impact from the axe untangled me. The lady roars in agony as I dash down the last bit of the web and rush to the door. ""After him!"" She shouts. All of a sudden, I'm running through the town, with the spider-lady on my heels. Only this time, she's in a giant tank, and the skeletons of everybody she ever murdered is chasing me too. I realize I have to get out of this crazy town as fast as I can. I run to the tracks that I initially came from and sprint into the tunnel; the tank right behind me. ""Help!"" I shout out. ""Open up the portal!"" But when I reach the end of the tunnel, expected to get back through to the real world, I crash into the end of the tunnel. ""No! This can't be!"" I start to run my hands along the concrete, desperately looking for a door handle. But I find none. As I turn around, the onslaught is upon me.

It's at that point that I wake up, to discover it was all just a dream.

Out of all the things I could've taken out of that dream, all I can think about is how much fun it'd be to fuck a spider-lady.

"I used to be terrible at small talk. Then through grad school and business school with a ton of networking events (with boring people), I learned how to do it. Now, throw me in any social setting and I will small talk my way to the wee hours of the night. 

The first thing, is forget this notion of ""small"" talk. It pressures you to find insignificant points to chat about, such as the proverbial weather and health. Instead, realize that you are talking to someone you have never met, someone who has a vastly different life and has incomparable experiences to yours - and there is so much for you to learn from them. 

People will share an astonishing amount of information with a stranger, especially if you come across as casual and honest. So all you have to do is ask - ask a few tame questions and then probe, all while keeping it casual (so you don't come across as a creep, snoop, or worse) and you'll do fantastically.

Even the way to describe, ""sometimes the pretense .... "" tell me everything about your small talk. There is no need for pretense. Be yourself, and help the person your speaking with to be themselves. 

One trick is to find something about your current situation that you can bounce off someone. For example, are you thinking about a vacation? Ask them about theirs. You will naturally be a better listener, because it relates to you. Of course, you need to read what they might be into and not go completely random (""So, I'm really into 17th century swords, what is your opinion on this topic?)"

"Went out for a date with this chap who actually did seem very decent, nice &amp; VERY boring but I needed human company. He gifted me a little souvenir, we ate lunch &amp; kissed a little. He flirted with me *constantly* for a month &amp; he would talk long with me. He insisted on paying for my meal even though I kept offering to go Dutch but he wouldn't have any of it. That's nice then, I thought. He then proceeded to tell our common friend how, a.) I kept ""boasting"" about all the ""expensive makeup stuff I use, and that she is too high-maintenance."" This after he kept asking me random questions on what sort of beauty products I use, which baffled me a little &amp; then kept asking me ""how I can afford this"". It was quite baffling &amp; a very rude Q to ask! And after flirting with me constantly &amp; sending me kiss emoticons, he then told her that b.) I am ""fast."" because I initiated. Kissing. 😒"

"Actually, the worst was probably just last week after bringing home our first puppy.  Don't get me wrong I absolutely love her to pieces.  But even though we both grew up with dogs, we didn't truly know what goes into raising a puppy.  I mean we ""knew"", but we didn't really know, if that makes sense.

After 3 days of crying for hours at night (kennel training), the sharkies (Vizsla breed special apparently), chewing on wood/cords/couches, I started regretting bringing her home.  My parents had always been the ones to take care of our family pets, so it never really hit me how much work goes into it.  She is like a toddler; we need constant supervision of her if she is not in her kennel, and obviously we don't put her in there except for sleeping and if we leave the house.  I can't get ready for work, make dinner, or do chores without having to stop every 30 seconds to stop her from being naughty.

However it's only been 1.5 weeks with her and already she is learning commands, slept through the night last night, and has few accidents.  She is totally worth it, and will bring us years of companionship and fun.  But those first few days....whew."

"Can't find an article, but found an unattributed quote:

&gt;The real Ezekiel 25:17 doesn't go like that. This is the one Tarantino made up (or, rather, lifted from a Sonny Chiba movie), meaning that it could only have come from the universe of Pulp Fiction (or, again, Sonny Chiba, which in all fairness wouldn't be any worse of an outcome). Ergo, Nick Fury, the super spymaster with a mysterious past, is actually Jules, Sam Jackson's hitman character that finishes the movie heading toward an uncertain future, away from a life of crime.

&gt;The nice thing about this theory is how neatly it would fold Tarantino's famously interconnected movies and the MCU together. They're both already cartoonish, violent universes where heroes and over-dramatic villains reign supreme. Even their ""origin stories"" fit: In the first Captain America movie, Cap goes in the ice in 1943, taking Red Skull out of the game in the process. Supernatural elements now removed from the war, Lt. Aldo Raine and his Inglourious Basterds cohorts are able to gun down Hitler in 1944, an event we once pinned as the starting point of the Tarantinoverse. If we accept this, the first MCU superhero-villain confrontation might actually have happened in Pulp Fiction. Remember Ringo, the diner robber who displays strange interest in Marsellus Wallace's mystery briefcase that Jules lugs around at the time? Jules knows full well what's in the case. He shows the guy.

&gt;What if the briefcase never actually contains the diamonds from Reservoir Dogs, or Marsellus Wallace's soul, or whatever the top theory is these days? What if it contains one of the infinity stones MCU so loves to throw around? Maybe that is Jules' real reason for getting out of the hitman game: ""Dang, I probably should do something about the fact that we live in a world where people like John Travolta can haul around planet-destroying alien weapons in a Samsonite."" So he goes off to become a universe-protecting hero while our friend Ringo ends up becoming a second-string Hulk as Emil Blonsky's Abomination in The Incredible Hulk. And we have Tarantino to thank for the whole thing.

Re-watching the scene in the diner when Jules explains his ""moment of clarity"" with this in mind is awesome. "

I ran in college, and after a big college party, a lot of people wanted to go into town for food...Risky in a lot of ways because we were all drunk as hell. I volunteered to cook, and a handful of (mostly girls) stayed behind, probably more from laziness than any sort of faith in my cooking ability.

I took the random crap from a dorm fridge, and made a massive chocolate souffle, which we all ate straight out of the pan with two shared forks. That was the pivotal moment in my college sex life: I went from zero action, to more than I could handle...I was just another schmuck, until it turned out that I could cook, then I was *interesting*."

I'm tempted to tell my side of things to the stepmom but she doesn't really like me and I worry I'd just be stirring more shit up for my friend. At the same time though, I feel like maybe it would be worth it just to plant a little seed of doubt in the stepmom. I really don't know.

EDIT: I feel like I should add that we're 23 and 24 now so the cops would have a pretty cold trail to work with. At the moment it happened I was too in shock to really go to the authorities and we were both too manipulated by him, especially my friend. She actually did tell a teacher about a part of what he did and it completely backfired on her, unfortunately. They had her talk to our principal, a former cop who didn't realize the interview tactics he used on criminals were completely inappropriate for a young traumatized teenager. Then because she was already so spooked from that, her dad was able to get her to recant and lose a lot of credibility. I don't think she wants to go through another round with the criminal justice system since it's very unlikely it would lead to a conviction, given the scant evidence available."

A few more people in the theater followed suit and starting clapping and cheering along with him.

There is this guy who is into me, that even if I was single I wouldn't have any desire to be with because he has a daughter who he hasn't seen in well over 4 years. Not because he can't, but because he ""hasn't had time or money"". Neither he nor the kid's mother has custody or even talks to her. He tells me that he ""plans on being able to take care of her when [he] has money"" but I really just think that's his way of justifying not being there.

I flat out told him that if he didn't start a relationship with her soon, she's going to be too old and not want to.
__________________
Back when I was single, I went on a couple dates with this guy. First date went okay... It was a little boring and chemistry wasn't great, but I've never been one to really let that stop me, because I know nervousness can definitely affect that. So, I went on a second date with him. We were driving and decided to tell me then he used to be so addicted to heroin that he joined a skinhead gang because they supplied him with drugs. He was my ride, so I waited until my friend could pick me up, then ditched him, telling him it was an emergency. When he called the next day, I told him I was not comfortable with that part of his past and could no longer see him. He acted like it was okay, until he started calling me over and over, harassing me for breaking it off, when he had been talking to a black girl and she was okay with it, and if she was, so should I. Even if *that* was enough to convince me to go back out with him (it wasn't), the fact that he harassed me so much and got so angry about it was enough to tell me I had made the right choice.
__________________

Went on a date with a guy who was very much not my type. I hadn't been having very good experiences with the guys that I normally end up with, so I thought that maybe if I stopped being superficial I could find the right person for me. For future reference, I had a chip in my front tooth, and I was extremely self conscious about it. 

We met when at a diner. I had just gotten off work and he was getting out of the bars. I saw him reading Game of Thrones and asked him about it. We started talking and soon he asked me out, so I gave him my number. From that point it got real weird... We were saying our good byes and he kept trying to kiss me and wouldn't stop hugging me, after I asked him repeatedly to stop, that we had just met and I didn't even know him. He then asked for a ride home, because he was afraid he was going to miss his bus, and I refused, stating that again, I didn't know him and didn't feel comfortable letting him into my car. 

After I left, I was confident I was not going to go out with him. But, he texted the next day saying he was sorry about how he was acting. He said that he had been drinking and he was nervous and didn't know what to do around me because I was so pretty and seemed so cool. I let that convince me to go on a date with him. He asked to meet at this burger place and I told him that it was fine. We meet up, he's late, but I don't mention it. I make my way to go inside and he said ""oh, we're eating here?"". I looked at him, thinking he was joking... He wasn't. I said, ""Why would you want to meet here if you didn't want to eat here?"" he said that ""this is okay, I guess.""

We go inside, when I open the door, I tripped over my foot and stumbled, letting go of the handle and banging my hip into the side of the door. He guffawed at me and said ""there's a door there."" I can usually laugh at my clumsiness, but there was just something in the way he said it that pissed me off. But, I didn't say anything.

We sit down. He spent most of the time complaining about the food and the waitress. He was super rude to her and she was very nice. He then asked me what I was most self conscious about. Stupid me for answering honestly. He said, ""Yeah, you do have a bit of a snaggletooth, don't you?""

At this point, I started getting a migraine and told him that the date was over. I never wanted to see this guy again, yet somehow, I ended up giving him a ride home. 

Oh, and also... He didn't even offer to pay, so I did and gave the waitress a huge tip and wrote ""sorry"" on the receipt.

My last story:

Two of my girlfriends tried setting me up with their boyfriends' friend. He was like this one dimensional character from some country bumpkin comedy movie. No personality at all. No ambition. Nothing. He had no goals for the future. The farthest he could think about was his plans for that weekend, which was getting drunk and watching NASCAR. He was just one big cliche. And my friends pushed us together HARD. They wanted triple dates and ""how cool would it be if we all dated best friends, then we could always hang out"". He had no sense of humor. He didn't get my movie references. He didn't like to read. We didn't like each other's musical taste. We had nothing in common, and it was a struggle for me to be nice. The poor guy was trying so hard to impress me, so he bought me a phone and a DVD player and bought me a bunch of groceries. I tried refusing it all, but he blackmailed me saying that he wasn't going to take me home until I agreed. 

Everything combined was just a complete no-no for me. Overbearing, nothing in common, no sense of humor, no personality. The only thing interesting about him to me was his eyes. They were this amazingly clear blue. The prettiest eyes I have ever seen, to this day. Then I found out they were colored contacts. 😒

I used to have a stalker. For one year, I'd only see this old guy around town that would follow me or yell at me, but I chalked it up to dementia and tried to ignore him (as the police insisted I do). After that year, he moved in to the apartment above mine. For few months he'd wait outside of my apartment for me as I left for work or came home. Eventually I got so fed up (scared) that every time I saw him, I'd just start screaming back at him to leave me alone.

One night I was coming home from work very late. I put in the gate code, cautiously looked around for him, then began tiptoeing to my apartment door, relieved to not see him.

That's when I began hearing whispering. It was very soft, and I might not have noticed if I wasn't already on edge. I looked around, didn't see him, and finally looked up.

He was crouching at his window, hands pressed against the glass, staring down at me and mumbling to himself. That became his new routine (until the landlord told him I was moving out because of him, but that's another story entirely). Anyhow I've moved out and haven't seen him since."

"I live in a house owned by my alcoholic father. For the first year my fiance and I were there(at Dad's request) my dad lived in the upstairs apartment and we took the downstairs. He has been in a bad spiral for the last few years, drinking more and more heavily. I'd long since given up being distressed by it and as I got to know him better it became clear he was fully aware of his addiction and feeling hopeless/unwilling to stop. We had many talks about his drinking. He drives truck for a living, has for about 40 years. We discussed on several occasions that a DUI was inevitable and that it would end his career. He'd probably have to sell the house to live as he'd not saved for retirement. He has two properties and the other is a duplex rental, so he'd be okay. 

This is where his mother comes in. I was her favorite grandchild growing up, until my brother was born. Deeply entrenched in gender roles with a twist of unhealthy attachment to son figures, she had always behaved as if my Dad and brother were golden children. My Dad has been a black sheep his whole life, but she never finds fault and criticizes her very successful, angelic daughter to no end. My brother is a racist, sexist bigot who can do no wrong in her eyes, particularly after he served in the Middle East. Since I turned 18, her opinion of me has steadily soured. Sure, I didn't go to college. When I finally went in my thirties, Grandma acted like it was the stupidest thing on earth. I had trouble having kids, then got divorced. When I finally got pregnant with my new fiance last year, she said she didn't think I wanted to have kids and wasn't the ""mothering type"". Everyone that knows me knows that's far from the truth and my infertility issues have been a major source of pain. 

Wrap this all up and last November I come home from a hard day at work and Dad invites us upstairs, which was common, to have a drink and a smoke with him and his girlfriend. That night he felt like celebrating, and drank to near blackout. He asked if we could go pick up his truck at the shop down the street. No problem, we'd done it recently, so we headed out. But we couldn't find his truck in the lot. We went back home and told him it wasn't there, and I convinced him to go get it first thing in the morning. We headed back downstairs. 

About an hour later, he comes down stumbling with girlfriend in tow. They say they're going out. I murmur to my husband that surely, she's driving. A few minutes later I get a call from her- your dad got a DUI, come get me and the truck. Turns out in his drunken state he didn't tell us that the truck was in a competely different place in town. 

We didn't hear a thing out of Dad for weeks. They took his license away, and he moved in with his girlfriend who isn't much of a drinker. Then we didn't hear from him for months. I was 8 months pregnant, it was the middle of winter and the heat was out. We didn't have the money to fix it. No returned calls. 

Things eventually evened out with Dad and I though I was still hurting and confused. I went from bonding almost daily with a Dad who'd always favored my brother, we had gotten close and had many heart to heart conversations. Suddenly he was back to ignoring me. 

I'd always asked Dad if we could pay rent and he didn't want that, but we knew we would eventually if he got a renter upstairs. So after the DUI we took over the utilities and made an agreement for rent. My husband got laid off that very month and is still unemployed, so we've paid rent as we could and often in chunks making up for last month's rent,  etc.

Grandma started sending us nasty, insulting, condescending letters about how we need to pay rent on time because Dad doesn't have a job anymore. Nevermind that he's making twice my income on his rentals. Dad got pissed and apologized, but she won't be told. The letters kept coming. 

My sister is staying with her this week and reported in that Grandma blames me for Dad's DUI because we didn't find his truck in the place he never told us it was. She's telling the whole family that I've REFUSED to pay rent, in spite of anything my Dad's told her. We almost didn't invite her to our wedding this weekend, but decided not to start shit on a happy day. Now she's saying she doesn't know if she'll come. I hope she doesn't.

"I read a comment sometime on YouTube (so you KNOW it's gonna be good) about how male students who sleep with female teachers are not REALLY victims, and it's not REALLY pedophilia, because teenage boys think about sex non-stop anyway, right? If a 13 year old boy WANTS to bang his hot teacher, how was he raped? And I'm just like... Dude. Teenage girls think about sex all the time too, and more often than not with older guys (be it their teachers or pop/movie stars). Teenagers don't know what is best for them! Whether it's the brain (which is still developing) or the lack of experience, the overwhelming majority of teens want REALLY stupid stuff. That's why it's the adults who should guide them, not take advantage of them!"

"The scene takes on additional meaning if you buy into the movie theory that Ferris Bueller doesn't exist, and is just a figment of Cameron's psyche that is lashing out against his father. After all, they are two people who have nothing in common, and Cameron gets genuine anxiety everytime ""Ferris"" comes up with an idea to do something. In many ways, Ferris is the person that Cameron wishes he could be. 

Ferris spends the entire movie pushing Cameron to break down his mental barriers and experience life to the fullest, and this soliloquy is the the culmination of that. It adds to why he speaks like there is no one else around him, and though I haven't rewatched it, I'm pretty sure no one else says a word to him during the entire speech.

"It's really amazing how this filter plays out on a global scale.

For example, I work in tech and all the Indian people I've ever worked with were pretty intelligent people. I unknowingly sort of thought that as a culture and nation they were just sort of studious and diligent. 

I then moved abroad and was living in Singapore for a while, and saw that many of the construction crews had normal mid-20s Indian men working and kind of thought it was a waste. 

THEN I realized that all my interactions were the ones that had risen to the top of their classes and made it over to America and landed good jobs, so I was seeing just a very filtered top. And that like all cultures there was the whole spectrum, just that the ones who were going to work in manual labor didn't make it over to America. 

I felt sort of dumb for not seeing it sooner. "
"My brother and I, when we were like 6 and 10, were goofing around the apartment where we were living at the time in Anchorage.  For some reason I looked under a dumpster at the apartment complex and saw something, so I grabbed it.  It was a grenade.  Like a real life grenade, except the handle had been taped to the body of the grenade and the pin holding the detnoator handle in was missing.  Live grenade.  We were idiots, so we took it to our apartmet to our dad, who had been in the military, and showed him what we found.  

His eyes were immediately like the size of dinner plates and he got real quiet.  ""Hand it to me.....slowly son......""  I was like, sure, here it is.  He went downstairs to the parking lot, placed it gingerly in the dumpster, and called the police.  Bomb squad came later and took it away."

"""Blink"" From Season 3 of the 2009 revamp of Doctor Who. 

It was the first episode I've ever seen, and got me hooked. The only thing you need to know is that The Doctor is a time traveling alien with a Blue Phone box time machine. The episode is a standalone and only features the main characters of the show (The Doctor and his companion) in a ""flashback"" of sorts. Time travel is confusing, wibilly wobbily timey wimey you'll understand it when you watch.

"I also find it annoying when folks belittle the French. When Germany invaded France, America had 170k poorly equipped troops. Nazi Germany could've easily annihilated the American army at that point. The French also resisted as much as possible. If it weren't for the French rearguard action, the British soldiers may not have made it from Dunkirk back to Britain and losing those troops would've doomed Britain. The French rearguard was completely destroyed, I believe near 100% casualties. 

It wasn't the French being weak and quick to surrender as much as  Nazi Germany was an unstoppable force. Panzer divisions were no joke, and calling the French cowards is ridiculous. Belgium and Poland also fought very valiantly, considering they really didn't have any chance of victory. "

"I once taught a 17 year old girl who was bright but had no self confidence. Any tiny mistake was the end of the world and was proof of how awful she was at everything. She came with her mum to parents' evening and I told them how well she was doing, how easily she'd transitioned to studying A Levels, how well her coursework was coming along, blah, blah, blah, then at the end, said it was just a shame she didn't realise it herself. She could do even better with a bit more confidence. 

Straight away, her mum, who'd been smiling throughout, looked devastated and exhaled deeply while shaking her head sadly. She then looked at me and said ""Oh no, do you think there's anything we could possibly do about it?""

"A building way out on the north side of our base was abandon. 

Water leaked in and caused mold or what not to grow. The kind that would get in your lungs and make you very sick. 

So no one had been working in this building for decades. All the office furniture was removed. Phones and everything. Building was just empty. 

It was also partially underground. I had walked into the building before while on post with some other co-workers. It was really spooky. Never went downstairs. 

Building number was 472. 

So fast forward a few years later I'm working as a desk sergeant ""dispatch"" for patrol at about 3 in the morning. 

911 line goes off, screen says ""BLDG 472"". 

I'm like freaked the fuck out, my alpha she freaks the fuck out. 

I pick up the phone ""911 what is the nature of your emergency"". *click* 

We send a patrol out immediately. He's like ""f-that!"" When we tell him where the call came from. He gets out there,  pitch black, nothing. No lights no nothing. He snoops around, doors or locked all secured. 

Don't know to this day how it happened, but 911 calls came out of that building about the same time every few months. 

The building was demolished and filled in several years back and no calls from the bldg since. :D"

"My parents are from Maine, but I grew up in NYC.  We had a summer house in Maine so I had spent a lot of time there until my father died 20 years ago.

Last summer, friends invited me up to spend a week on the Maine coast.  Driving up I decided to take a detour to have lunch at an old restaurant my family had frequented.  All through my childhood it had been a restaurant with normal customers served a generous, but normal amount of food.  I was shocked when I walked in the door last summer.  The dining room was filled with massively obese people.  The aisles were cluttered with canes and walkers - - for old and young alike.  As the hostess seated me we were almost knocked over by a young woman the size of a small elephant who couldn't get out of the booth and kept falling backwards with her legs sticking straight out in the aisle like giant hams with shoes.  People were looking at me through eyes that could barely see, they were so encased in fatty faces.  There was the sound of labored breathing all around.  I realized several of the men (and a number of the women) were not even wearing pants -  they had to wear giant tee shirts, I wasn't sure if it was because they don't make pants that huge or if they couldn't bend over far enough to put pants on.  I felt really uncomfortable because I was easily 1/4 the size of the smallest person in the room.

When the food came, I was shocked again.  I'd ordered a small lobster platter and the waitress brought a platter of french fries you could park a thanksgiving turkey on along with the lobster.  And when that waitress left another brought a bowl of coleslaw that must have held 5 pounds of the stuff; behind this waitress came one with an aircraft carrier sized loaf of garlic bread,  another server arrived with an industrial vat of diet coke, and just when I thought my table would collapse, someone came by with what I can only describe as a washtub of pudding (I don't know why pudding was part of the meal anyway) topped with a veritable mountain of whipped cream.

I don't think I have eaten that much food in any given month, never mind at one meal.  I was choking trying to get it down just to see if I could.  Yet I noticed tables of people with emptied plates all around me.

It honestly felt like I was in some dystopian reality, a Twilght Zone episode of some sort.  I mean, we have some heavy people in NYC, but I have never seen anyone so immense as even the smallest person in this restaurant. "

"The main reason for this is that the sales tax differs by not only state, but also locality, so it makes it really hard to advertise prices including tax.

Everything went really well, until my coworker messed up with one of our freezers, left the door open and every ice cream got ruined. She told my boss it must have been, the rookie. My boss came at me fuming, never saw him that mad and asked me yelling if it was my fault. I told him honestly I didn't handle freezers yesterday, because it was my turn to unpack new products.

"PETA is legitimately trash, but the one thing I give them a pass on is their animal put down number that people like to attack them for. No-kill shelters rely on donations and sometimes animals can't be saved - but when an animal dies at those shelters it makes their donators less likely to donate to them and looks terrible on paper. What these shelters do is send the animals to PETA shelters where they put them down and take the flak essentially. 

Again, PETA is still garbage but people have misconceptions. "

One of my parents thinks it's whatever and doesn't care if someone does it, but they don't want their money going toward something they see as murder. You can pay for your own abortion and that's fine. I don't agree with this opinion at all, but some of the rhetoric surrounding abortion can be rather toxic."

A week later I got an angry voicemail from the health inspector in charge of that area politely telling me to go f*ck myself and that he was doing his job. It was so depressing, but I was already dealing with other staff abuse issues in my own department. Wound up leaving not long after because of how many rules were being broken, making it a generally unsafe work environment. Tried to report it to the law and got shut down by my former boss (when the law followed up with them, they flat our denied anything was happening). Its such a relief to get this out!

"My mom didn't get any child support from my dad after I turned 5. He refused to pay and they couldn't garnish his wages because he never had a job that wasn't paid under the table. He finally got a decent job when I was in my early 20's, thinking he would be off the hook for the child support now that my younger sister and I were adults. Wrong. He stopped paying when I was 5 and my sister was 3 so he had 13 and 15 years of unpaid child support that he still owes my mom. For the past 5 or so years my mom has been getting monthly child support checks from the state garnishing his wages. It would have been better to have the money for raising us, but I'm glad my mom is finally getting what's owed to her by him. She had to make a lot of sacrifices to raise us by herself so I'm glad the money basically goes towards making her more comfortable now."

She had no malice towards her mother, she simply didn't love her, and it was just a matter of fact. 

What she said always stuck with me. Over the years that followed, what she said allowed me the freedom to let go of abusive relationships within my family. For so long I was afraid I'd be in never-ending cycles with horrible family members and always sucked in with guilt that they're family. She forever changed how I love and who I love. And it was totally for the better."

"I'm a big fan of the group burrito, where you get all your friends to come over and they each buy an ingredient for around $.80 to $3.
The more friends the more parts you can get for a pretty low cost per person.

the best version I've found so far:
in one pan get cubed potatoes going for a bit, after a while (they start to get softer) add bell peppers and onions, cook until soft, you can add some water at some point with some taco seasoning for some flavor.

potatoes: 5lbs for $1 (you'll have a lot extra)
green bell: $1
Red bell: $1
onion $1
additional bell peppers: ~$1
taco seasoning: ~$.60 (but you won't use all of it, probably)

In another pan add black beans, kidney beans, and corn (I used canned), each are less than a dollar
black beans: $.70
Kidney beans: $.70
Corn: $1

You can add meat in one pan if you like, but that gets expensive.
You can also do refried beans, which is about a dollar, and makes a nice glue, as these burritos are fucking massive.

Cut up a sweet potato into big chunks, put into some baking sheet, and bake for about an hour depending on size and temperature, you'll mash this up and it really adds to the burrito.
Sweet potato: $2-3

Rice: $3-10 depending on size of bag, but you'll get a lot of mileage out of this as well

And the tortillas are probably the most expensive bit at $6, but if you don't want to buy this, burrito bowls are delicious too.

Other add-ins include Sriracha, Avocado, cheese, meat.
But the more add-ins, the more expensive the burrito can get.


Overall takes about an hour to make, costs stay low, and you get to see some friends."

"Not a ""she was a pedo stalker murderer all along!"" story but...

A long time ago I worked as a supervisor in a theme park. We were interviewing people to work as facepainters- people who would be working with children and guests and would be expected to be a little more personable than your typical gift shop clerk.

Part of the interview process was that the interviewee would need to bring in a art portfolio to prove they could infact draw. [Facepainting would cost you an average of 20 bucks a pop so you had to have some level of talent]

This girl brought in a HUGE binder, just bulging with art. Good art too! Oils, chalk, charcoal, pen, prisma, watercolor.... she had it all and in spades.

Issue? They were all of her. Every single one. I get it, self portraits aren't unusal for an artist. But this was something of a obsessive caliber. No trees, skulls, flowers, swirly dos or doctor who fanart. It was just her face, 1000 times over.

Her spoken interview was fairly narssisstic too. Told us proudly she worked better alone and hated to socialize.... Maybe she forgot what job she was trying to apply for?

I decided if i saw ONE piece of art that was not of her, I'll hire her. She really was talented. And at the bottom of the stack? 

Bingo! A drawing of a whole group of people! Differently colored, faceless silhouettes of what must of been her friends.

Or so I thought till she corrected me. They were all just representations of her diffrent personalities.........

Much to my bosses dismay I didn't hire her."

"Frankenstein's monster never wanted to be created. His own creater decides he's a fuck up and wants to destroy him, calling him an abomination. So the monster runs away and is all alone. He befriends a kid and accidentally kills him, the one person he might've had on his side in the world. Then the entire town hunts him down and he is burned to death. The prime example of a tragic monster movie tale. "
"There is something inherently satisfying though when you get to throw shit like that in their face. 

I had a group of people come into the restaurant I work at and one of them said I'd probably get better tips if my smile was more genuine. I got to explain to them that the day before I attended the wake of one of my best friends and a man I loved as he had killed himself Canada Day, 2017. I walked by his house as he lay dying or working hinself up to killing himself, if he wasn't already dead by then. They tipped me %50, couldn't look me in the eye (even when they apologized) and I think one of them started crying. 

I mean it sucks but it felt pretty damn satisfying essentially telling someone to smarten the fuck up. Maybe even changed their behaviour for the better. "

"I'm lucky because I had a really enlightening conversation with my high school/college girlfriend about this early on in my adult life. Basic information about the two of us: I'm about 6'1"" and 190lbs she was 5'9"" and 145lbs, we're both fairly strong/athletic (both played college sports) with her being further up the bell curve based on gender.


We were goofing around and wrestling one day when she said something teasingly inflammatory so I sort of rolled her off me and held her arms down to the ground. We were both laughing at first but then she stopped so I let go. When I asked her what was up she gave me a big hug and said:


""I've always been tall and athletic so I thought that if worse came to worst I could defend myself. When we were wrestling I was playing at first but then I decided to really try to win and I couldn’t. Not only could I not over power you, you weren’t even trying, like you were literally laughing while holding me down. I know you would never ever hurt me, but I just realized that if a man wanted to they could and I’d be completely helpless”


The thing is I hadn’t thought too much about it before then. I knew I was stronger than pretty much every female I knew, but I never thought about how that fact could be scary to them, and I’m really glad I learned that from someone who trusted me. I’m not the most imposing guy and I smile often (probably too much) so the idea that I could seem menacing to someone else had never crossed my mind, but now I try to be conscious of it because of this interaction.

"Dude. I work in corrections too. 

This happened to a buddy of mine, and (obvi) another one of our coworkers. 

Only certain areas of our facility have 24/7 recorded vid/aud. Our SHU is one of those areas. My buddy worked midnights in the SHU, with another female officer. Our SHU has 2 sides to our SHU side (and then another wing for PC cons). The long side, and the short side. You do rounds by going around the back of the cells, and peering into the windows, usually. At the end of the long side is a holding room, where the higher ups usually hold hearings for these inmates. This room...I can tell you, you feel like some one is watching you from this room, so when I was told this story, I 100% went, ok, it's not just me. 

The female was out doing her 1/2 hour rounds. My bud was watching her on the camera, so he could see if anything happened and to time the sallyport opening for her. He could see a black figure materialize from the room, and it followed her up the long side's hallway. My buddy hits the gate open, and ushers the female back in and yanks her back in the control room. Now she's freaked out, but because she kept feeling a cold breeze on her neck, and felt like some one was following her. 

The next round, my buddy goes out and tells her to watch the room. Nothing. 2 rounds later, she goes on another round after nothing happened. She sprinted through the round, and guess who saw the figure again? 

They both gave up their bids shortly thereafter. 

Sorry if this story is kind of a mess...I have to get to work, but I had to to jump in. Rare to see other COs on here. Walk safe brother/sister! "

My grandma immigrated to Canada from Lebanon in the 50s. She is of the mind that all Canadian (Read: white) women are liars, cheaters, and gold diggers. I also happened to be dating a white woman at the time.

As is the case in multi-ethnic friendships/relationships, I taught my girlfriend non-English curse words, and some non-curses. Among the non-curses was how to say, ""excuse me?""

When grandma first met the gf, she politely said hello before immediately ranting in Arabic about greedy white girls taking all the good Lebanese men.

Although my gf did not understand what she said, she quickly replied in Arabic with, ""excuse me?""

My grandma froze, thinking she was caught, and quickly changed the subject. I was terribly proud of gf that day."

The first one is about how well you can research a topic and fine-tune it to perfection. You should be spending a lot of time on it, because you're trying to make it the best it can possibly be. It's not just the information, but on how well you can form your argument and polish it up. This process should involve multiple revisions.

The second example is meant to show how well you can form a coherent argument under a time limitation. On those kinds of tests, you're not graded on spelling, punctuation, or any of the other 'fine-tuning' aspects of writing. You're graded simply on how well you can take the information presented and form a piece of writing about it. You're supposed to do it quickly, because it's meant to judge how quick your mind is."

"God damn. She also once managed to have an affair with a nun by stealing a dead old nun, placing it in her lover's bed, and burning down the convent so it looked like her lover died. When her lover got bored and went home to her parents, Julie was sentenced to be burned alive. Fortunately, she was later pardoned, and went on to duel numerous people (including the duel-loving son of a duke who later became her lifelong friend and fuckbuddy), and frequently become a fugitive for various creative crimes.

Also worth noting: as an American, I naturally assumed she dueled with pistols. This is wrong; she was actually an excellent swordswoman, which in my opinion is far more impressive."

"My mom seriously (but wrongly) believes that I owe her an obscene amount of money - like 5 figures. She brings it up *every single time* money is even implied in a conversation. Like when I got a new job: ""oh good, now you can finally start paying me back"" or when I offered to buy lunch at a fast food joint: ""if you can afford that, why haven't you been paying your debt?"" It's so bad that I've gotten really good at having long talks with her that completely avoid any mention of money. 

So this year, things lined up just right that I was able to buy a Corvette - a car I've wanted since I was a kid. AFAIK, she had no idea, and I'm never telling her. I can almost guarantee she'd have a thermonuclear reaction, and I don't care to deal with it."

What I like to do is give my application as soon as I'm satisfied with the overall quality of the apartment. Then before signing the lease I ask the landlord if I will be able to do another walkthrough to confirm some measurements. Then it's pretty much just me and them and I can quiz them on everything, measure a few walls for couch and bed placement, and check for anything I missed last time before signing the lease."

"Hating people who believe in any sort of god.

Like... fuck, guys, come on. You can believe in every ounce of science and still believe in a god. The two aren't mutually exclusive despite what you might want to believe. 

EDIT: I'm going to put this here for anyone who might think I am ""atheist shaming.""

My comment isn't atheist shaming though. My grandfather, who died when I was a child and I have no memory of, was a minister and my dad (his son) doesn't give two shits about whether there's a god or not. I was not raised in a religious household by any stretch of the imagination. My comment was made because I see all the time how people blindly hate any sort of religion or believe that anyone who believes in a god is inherently irrational and hates science.

It's not atheist shaming to call out people who trash others for believing in god just like it isn't religion shaming to call out people who shove their religion down your throat. Be an atheist, be a theist, whatever you want to be, just don't be an ass to people who are in the other camp.

Edit: To clarify, the Sabines were one of the groups who had the women taken, and they were the only group to invade Rome to get them back. Hence, the event is known as the Rape of the Sabine Women even though several other Italian and Latin tribes were also involved. "

"I work on ships, and on the bridge there are big friendly red buttons to crash stop ventilation in the event of a fire.

I brought a new ship out of build, and within the first few days we had a fire drill to check all the systems work. Usually in these drills we'd not hit the buttons (it takes a while to reset crash stopped ventilation), but this time I got to make the pipe and actually hit the buttons.

So, the time came. The fire alarm activated on the bridge, and I excitedly ran over to the pipe system and announced to the ship the location of the fire, and brought the ship to muster.

Then, the highlight of the day. I hit the big friendly red buttons.

Nothing happened. The ventilation fans carried on happily pumping air and hypothetical smoke around the ship.

I reset the buttons and hit them all again. 

Still nothing.

I shrug and carry on with the drill, making a note of it.

Afterwards I get chewed out for not hitting the buttons, so in order to defend myself I point out that I hit them twice, and left them clicked on on the bridge. Senior offs don't believe me, so I take them up there to show them. Sure enough the buttons are all clicked in, and the fans are working. We call down to the engine room, and they try one of their crash stops. It works.

Further investigation revealed that I had all the crash stops buttons on the bridge, but no actual wires connecting the buttons to the actual ship..."

"  I lived in Maryland along the C&amp;O canal and had to drive by it everyday going home. One day we were leaving church and at one point in our drive there's a sharp bend where the road goes from a 55mph to a 25mph in less that a hundred feet.

 As we pass the turn my brothers eyes are affixed to the turn like something is wrong. We pass it and he stands up in the van and turns around just glaring at the canal. He yells at my parents to stop the car and says there's a car upside down in the water.

My parents continue home and drop everyone off. My dad, brother and I go back to see what was going on and sure enough there's a car, upside down in the watery canal.  My dad goes down to it tries to look in and says he sees two people. We call the cops and they come take care of it.

  That night I get a call from my best friend at the time, he says his dad didn't make it home last night and he was found drowned in a car in the canal.

It was a very sad day."

"I definitely feel like this is something more often perpetuated between daughters-in-law and the husband's family. I don't know what it is. 

I've seen the idea floated that since daughters are often expected to handle the ""emotional labor,"" they have more practice drawing boundaries with their own parents and family, which reduces in-law conflict when the daughters marry (also, their husbands just aren't expected to ingratiate themselves with her family like daughters-in-law are expected to with his family).

I have to say that I haven't gotten treatment like this to the extent that I'm excluded from events, but I have definitely gotten the ""oh her"" vibe when with the in-laws. They treat their daughter and her husband far better than they treat me, and even their son. 

I imagine the only reason my oldest son isn't similarly shunned is because he has several of their family's traits, including red hair. Otherwise, I'd expect them to have floated the rumor I had an affair or something."

"The three oldest kids in our family all went to college far away from where my parents lived. So, we would always be flying home at Christmas and summer vacation.

They showed up in formal wear, God awful clothes from the seventies, biker leather and chains, and would even go so far as to do wigs. My dad has always had a crew cut (and now it's very sparse)but he would always wear an afro wig. It was embarrassing, but also pretty hilarious. One time my sister complained about old men with hair sticking out of their ears.

"It's a mobile game called Tindr, the aim of the game is to find an avatar of another player, who you find attractive. Then the game automatically rolls a D20 for luck for your choice. If you get a high number, it enables a quest in which you have to meet with the other player's avatar at a decided upon location, some real world stuff like Pokemon GO, kind of a rip off for a mobile game idea imo but whatever.

For the quest you will need to be on the same page as your new ally if you want it to be successful, so you have to ask them questions to know about their stats and what quests they want to follow in future playthroughs, you may also attempt to seduce them in order to create a closer bond with the avatar, raising trust, etc. That may come in handy later. After you learn about their stats and quest selection you can decide if you think the ally will be beneficial to your quests and arrange a future get together, or you can thank them for the meet up and part ways, gaining the original quest again of finding an ally."

As soon as you can't produce a produce permit for your plants, they'll weigh the produce and the produce plants, ticket you, and take your produce to be used as plants for produce. 

What you need to do if you are ticketed is show up in court and try to produce evidence your produce was planted, and that the produce plants weren't there originally.  This will plant a seed of doubt that might produce a lighter fine.  The essential thing is to hope the cop already divided the produce, as being unable to produce produce and planted produce might result in your fine thrown out.  Try arguing that the cop planted the produce and plants at home, or on other people.  "

She wouldn't even allow him to see me during the weekends, which he already drove 200km (to our previous home) just to come and get me for the weekend cause she wouldn't bring me there herself. On top of that she constantly talked shit about him telling me what a terrible human being he was, she would systematically destroy every gift he gave me and talked shit how he was training me to hate her (spoiler: he never said one bad thing about my mother).

It never occurred to her she was the source of all the problems. Ran away from home at 13y old and thanks to a good friend managed to be reunited with my dad who won full custody. Haven't seen her for 10y now, best decision of my life."

"A **strangelet** is a hypothetical particle that is composed of up, down, and strange quarks. (For comparison, a proton is composed of two up quarks and a down quark, and a neutron is composed of an up quark and two down quarks.) The good news is that strangelets are thought to decay very, very quickly... but if one were to touch some part of the planet, we'd be utterly annihilated.

See, due to the way that subatomic particles interact, large collections of ""strange matter"" are thought to be more stable than smaller ones. The bigger a given strange mass is, the hardier it is, so to speak. As such, all it would take to completely doom the Earth is a strangelet the size of a helium atom... because when baryonic matter - atoms made up of protons and neutrons - comes into contact with strange matter, it gets converted into strange matter. The chain reaction would reduce the planet (and everything on it) to a huge, hot, homogeneous ""strange star,"" and there would be absolutely nothing we could do about it.

In other words, it might only be a matter of time before a single particle wipes us out.

Wouldn't that be strange?

**TL;DR: A particle the size of a helium atom could end life as we know it** ***at any second*****.**"

"I was [camping northern Arkansas during late fall with my wife and my dog, Jake](http://i.imgur.com/wBWs8P4.jpg), many years ago and woke up to the sound of Jake growling very low. I put my hand on his back in hopes of calming him, thinking he was just restlessly dog dreaming, but it did nothing for his nerves. It was near complete darkness but I could make out his silhouette inside the tent. He was wide awake with his nose inches from the wall of the tent and he was completely motionless other than the vibration of his growl through his fully flexed muscles.

This continued for a minute or two until I too could hear the sound of leaves rustling in the distance, slowly growing louder and louder. This put me on high alert as well and sat up to focus my ears in the direction of the noise. It wasn't foot steps, but a constant rustle as if something was pushing through the dense fallen broadleaf groundcover of the forest. The two of us were intensely focused on the approaching being, me not knowing what else to do at this point.

Then suddenly it bumped into the side of the tent, Jake and I flinched back, the sound stopped, his growling stopped, the air went completely silent, my eyes were as wide open as they've ever been as I sat there not breathing waiting for something to happen. A moment later the rustling began again, and slowly made its way along the edge of the tent, turned the corner, followed the next edge of the tent, and then continued away on approximately the same course it was on before.

It took Jake and I several minutes to calm down, and my wife never even woke up through it.

I assume it was just an armadillo or hedgehog or such on its nightly walkabout and we happened to put our tent down right in its typical path. But in the moment it was very in tents.

Fortune-telling
"A family friend of ours owns a movie theater, so I feel like I have to defend them/explain what they go through.

1. The theater is responsible for it's own equipment.  That might seem like an obvious thing, but whenever the tech changes, they have to buy all new equipment.  Those 3D movies?  They require special silver infused screens to work.  Those screens are $10,000 each.  The theater can either pay up, or just not get 3D movies.  So when a movie theater has a broken air conditioner, they have to pay out of pocket to fix it, and most don't have that money in pocket (hence why that one theater is ALWAYS hot).

2. Publishing houses take most of the ticket sales.  Not only do the theaters have to pay for the movies they show (as in they pay thousands of dollars per reel/hard drive just to get copies of the films), the publishers take a majority of the ticket price for themselves.  The first week a movie is out?  The publisher can take up to 100% of the box office (thought 80% is the norm for opening weekend).  Then every week after that the publisher gets less and the theater gets to keep more.  Thats why the cheap dollar theaters always have movies that are 4-6 weeks old, those movies are officially in the ""theater keeps 100% of the box office"" time frame.

3. Theaters have to play ball, or they're blacklisted.  When the Star Wars prequels came out, it was 100% of the box office going back to Fox and Lucasfilms for the first TWO WEEKS the movies were out.  The theaters had to accept it, even though it wasn't industry standard, because if they didn't then their theater would be blacklisted and they would never be allowed to obtain another film those companies put out ever again, which would mean they would go out of business very quickly.  And as you might have noticed, the vast majority of people who see any given film see it the first or second week, when the theater gets the least profit.

---

So yeah, popcorn and cokes at the movie theater are crazy overpriced because that is what keeps the theater running.  Ticket price barely covers what the theater has to pay to carry the movie in the first place.  The employee salary, the water, the electricity, the insurance, the rent, literally all of the cost of doing business has to get covered by concessions."

"Krokets.  It's a dutch dish, made from a thick beef ragu, rolled in to a rough cylindrical shape, coated in bread crumbs, deep fried and served with fresh bread and mustard.    Whenever I went home on leave, I'd ask Mum to make krokets for me, and she always would.  They were the best! 

Mum passed away 14 years ago.   A few years back, a dutch cafe opened up near my house, and my kids took me there for Fathers Day.   (I'm in New Zealand!)  They had krokets on the menu, and I ordered one.

I took one bite, and I started crying, because it was EXACTLY the same taste as the krokets my mother used to make.   It was sooooo good!   Might just have to pop in on the way home tonight! "

I often think about what I would do in a given situation, knowing the one I want to do is most likely not what I'm capable of (like talking back to someone, I take a lot of shit) I've been able to accept myself after so many years of hating on myself, and it's like I'm living in this peace.

"He said he needed some company after a ""bad breakup."" I invited him over, packed a massive bowl for some bong rips, and set out some snacks (chips, veggies, &amp; dips). When he showed up, he hugged my wife a little too tight (creeped her out, but she was willing to let it slide). I handed him the bong, and he torched the entire bowl (no cornering at all, and trust me, NO ONE ON THIS PLANET can inhale that entire bowl on one pull). I called him out on it, and he mumbled a half assed apology. He then double dipped the chips and scoffed at the presence of veggies. I sent him home after an hour.

I was still in contact with his ex, her being my original friend, and she said he was inconsiderate, never cleaned up after himself, and expected her to be basically his mom.

A month later he texted, telling me about meeting up with a chick he had a crush on in HS. They went to lunch, and she was talking about finally getting away from a possessive ex boyfriend. The only thing he was focused on was his anxiety about whether he should kiss her when the ""date"" was over. When the lunch was finished, she offered for a hug, and he did kiss her. He was wondering why he hadn't heard from her in a week. I asked why he thought a kiss was an appropriate response and got back an ""I didn't think about it like that.""

He showed up uninvited to my place two weeks later, I told him we weren't cool any more and to leave.

He was 35. "

"We had a hard fought relationship with her family trying to separate us. Her family was the source of all of the strife and pain in her life. My family and I were a safe, warm place to be for her.

Just over five years in I had finished my degree and I was able to get a good enough job to do something about this. We decided to move a few hours away to get away from her family.

However, after another year and a half or so she started to change. We had a peaceful life but she was growing noticeably bored and distant. I found out that she started to cheat on me with an ex-coworker in this new city. This guy had no job, no formal or professional education, was 10 years older than me, and was a heavy smoker to where his teeth were dark brown. And he was married. They were cheating on their partners, together.

In the end I came to piece together a horrible truth. She never wanted me. She wanted what I represented. She wanted an escape. After she got that escape she couldn't run from the fact that she did wanted me as a person. She didn't want me for me. Seven years, lost.

That was my only ""relationship"". That was the only women who ever showed interest in me and it was for the wrong reasons. It's been seven and a half years since then. No one else has ever shown interest in me since then, either. I'm in my 30s now and in my whole life no one has ever wanted me. I have no friends and I haven't had a date in years, let alone ever having a second date. As it turns out I'm just not a worthwhile person."

"Maybe not the craziest, but I was thoroughly satisfied when my near-genius-grade-skipping-know-it-all brother blurted out a very obvious misconception when we were teenagers. 

My mother is a narcissist and thrived on keeping my brother (her 'Golden Child"") up on a pedestal none of us could dream of reaching. 

One day when I was about 16, so he was 15, and we were getting ready for our senior year of high school which was starting soon. I mentioned it would be nice to get off campus and maybe have a free period during the day. My brother chimed in ""Not to mention all the seniors discounts""... for a moment I assumed he was referring to me being elderly as I am the older sibling, but it became evident quickly that he literally thought that signs at stores and restaurants referring to ""seniors price"" was about being a high school senior... not an over 65 person....

Nearly fell off my chair laughing. Here was this supposed demi-god I was expected to worship the ground he walked on, had no idea what retirement was. 

I was reprimanded for ""correcting"" him, but the look on his face when the concept sank in was priceless. He was legit angry he would not be getting ""seniors discounts"" for being in the final year of high school. "

It can apply in millions of scenarios to ANY race. 

That said, statistically it's just not as likely to happen to people like me (a little white lady). That much is true. I don't pretend to know what it's like to be discriminated against because of the color of my skin.

"Its more about necessity than flavor.  The fondant is not meant to be the actual icing/frosting and it's not meant to be the main flavor profile... it's meant to protect the cake and keep it moist while providing a smooth background for decorating.  For very large cakes (like for a wedding, etc)  its a multi-day process and the fondant keeps the cake moist and protected while you work on it. For larger tiered cakes it also helps with stability.  

I use a marshmallow fondant and flavor it (typically almond - but depends on the cake and icing flavors already in play). I roll it as thin as I can get it (less than 1/4"").  When you take a bite, you taste cake and frosting with a hint of chewy almond sweetness.  Actually, you could easily peel away the fondant and still have a piece of cake with frosting.  In this one for example, the white is the fondant and necessary for the decorating they wanted to do, but if you peel off the fondant you still have a lovely piece of cake complete with frosting.

"I agree with a lot of what you say, minus it being a comedy, though it is a tragedy filled with many comedic tropes (look at how deeply it parallels Midsummer Night's Dream, for example).  Romeo is the epitome of melodramatic teenager and Juliet isn't much better. Just look at how it takes Romeo literally a half of one act of the play to go from heartbroken over what's her name to absolutely smitten with Juliet. While that teenage relationship is romanticized at its beginning, it clearly is the reason that they both end up dead in the end. Add in the numerous pointless acts of violence perpetrated by the youths in the play and you get, imo, a piece that largely works as a huge criticism of brash adolescent behavior  "

"After the awful 50 Shades books/film came out a few acquaintances of mine posted to Facebook about how terrible and inaccurate the books were regarding S&amp;M. The thing was, these people are normally attention-seeking persons who were also not living the lifestyle, but wanted to make it appear they were. 

The few people I've known who are truly into S&amp;M, are really on-the-low about it. These people usually make an offhand comment or joke about it with someone in which they feel comfortable. I've also noticed the comment/joke method is very similar to the way people let you know they're into drugs."

When I finally met him I found out why. He'd clearly gained a lot of weight since his picture was taken which couldve been forgiven if it wasn't for the following. 

I wasn't interested in a relationship. I'd made that clear before once I'd said it again in person he turned into this complete twat. 

The final straw was when we got into the subject of homosexual relationships (can't remember why) and he told me I must be a lesbian because I saw no problem with it and that explained why I didn't fancy him. I shit you not. 

I told him he was deluded and not to contact me again. 

A month later he messaged me on msn, which was bad enough as id forgot to block him, to tell me he'd had a threesome and how I'd missed out. I've never laughed so hard in my life and told him ""using both hands does not constitute a threesome"" and blocked him."

"Any normal person who receives child support gets far less than it actually takes to support the child.  The child support is the non custodial parents portion of cost, not just ""money being given to the custodial parent.""

Part of the money they get goes directly to buying the child food/clothes, etc, but supporting a child also means putting a roof over their head, utilities, gas to get them to and from, paying for school supplies, or a field trip, or replacing a lamp they broke, or paying for a family trip to the movies...

There are both direct and indirect expenses to having a kid, and hardly any non-custodial parent covers the entire cost via child support.

Therefore, the custodial parent rolls the child support into their general fund and then takes care of the child.

If the custodial parent has remarried and has more kids, they will pay for everything together, and so it would be impossible to separate out the one being paid support from everything else.

Child support is based on what the non custodial parent can afford and what they should be providing for their child if they had custody.  "

"The worst student I ever encountered was just generally an asshole to everyone: me, other students, other teachers, etc. He threw screaming fits in my classroom regularly, smeared deodorant all over a wall one day, threatened others, threw a desk, it was fucking ridiculous. What the fuck was this kid's problem?

Then I met his mom. She was a huge bitch. She was angry at everyone and everything, angry at her son, angry at me, angry at the school in general, and totally in denial that her son needed some serious counseling and therapy. She also has like 10 kids with 5 different guys, and was angry at all of them.

Fun bonus story: this past year I had a kid who gave that one a run for his money. He had some pretty serious anger problems and finally got himself expelled. I never did meet his mom because she wouldn't show up to conferences or disciplinary meetings. It wasn't until after he was expelled that I found out it was the same fucking mom - both she and this kid had a different last name so I didn't realize it. That lady has the dubious honor of raising not one, but two of the biggest assholes that have ever stepped foot in my classroom. "

Y'know, since they went to school from our house.  "

"At my school we have a student with severe anger issues that explodes at the drop of a hat. He will go from 'sitting in class doing his work' to 'throwing chairs and flipping desks' with almost no warning. Like, his 1-on-1 had to be specially trained to recognize what his triggers are, because the outbursts come on so suddenly. For this reason, his time in the classroom is severely limited (he gets a lot of social services at the school when he is not in class) and he has a hard time making friends. Which is heartbreaking to see, because he really does want friends, but it's hard for him to make friends when he explodes so suddenly like that.

Still, there is a group of 5-ish kids around his age who always volunteer to play with him at recess (he is closely monitored by adults and can't play certain games because they always set off his outbursts) and who will go with him during his break time so he doesn't have to take his breaks alone. Even though it's pretty scary when he has his outbursts (even adults get spooked by them sometimes) these kids take it in stride and still play with him later when he is calm.

All of these kids are 8-9 years old too. That just seems really brave to me, for them to realize that the outbursts aren't really his fault and to still try and be friends with him."

"Joe Rogan has had a few, not all super serious topics. But they all impacted me with the same severity.

1- He said something to the effect of, ""Don't treat others how you wish to be treated. Treat them as if they *are* you. Because if you lived their life, and were brought up the way they were, and reacted to things the way they did, you would literally *be* them."" Just him saying that gave me the biggest desire to always give people the benefit of the doubt. And then when I see real life examples of people deserving the benefit of the doubt, I feel that much more affirmed.

2- He said that taking baths are disgusting. He was like, ""You're literally sitting in a bowl of asshole and pussy soup. You're not taking a bath, you're making tea."" I laughed so hard, but now, when I bathe, I always follow it with a shower."

"When I was a senior in high school I dreamed of a massive terrorist attack three nights in a row. It was the same attack each night, but from three different perspectives and every one of them felt as real as if I were actually there, they almost feel like memories of stuff that has actually happened. I woke up crying from each one and was seriously going to try to get help from someone if it happened again. It still brings tears to my eyes just to talk about them. 

I can never shake the feeling that it's real, even now, a few years later. Some buildings inexplicably remind me of that dream and I refuse to go near them."

"Read. Your. Lease. Agreement. 

It's becoming extremely common that even death will not release the tenant from the contract or they don't offer lease breaks altogether. Always ask how you can get out of your lease if something comes up. 


Also know that even if you're not occupying the space, you are still required to pay the rental installments until you fulfill your lease agreement. 

Ask if pro-rating is an option. If you're moving in the middle or later in the month, ask if proration is an option that way you don't have to pay the full month. 

Any communication you have between the landlord or the accounts manager about your lease agreement or account statements, have everything in writing. This protects your rights as a tenant just in case they're playing games with your account or lease agreement. "

"Was snowboarding, and hit what I thought would be a small kicker, but with way too much speed.  As soon as I was airborne, I realized my mistake.  The ground kept dropping away, and I felt like I just kept going up, then the falling started.  I panicked, and pinwheeled my arms, which didn't help anything either.  Luckily, the landing was fairly steep, so when I hit, it didn't seriously injure me.  I came down feet first, and it hurt from my feet all the way up my back.  My knees just quit right away, and I ended up basically sitting down really hard, followed by a tumble down the hill.  I don't know if it was ""kill"" height, but my nearly 40 year old knees still remember what my 18 year old knees did.  Long story short, take care of your body kids.

In Afghanistan during the summer, its very bright out and you could see anything coming miles away. I remember it being still light out and there was an unidentified shot that came our direction and hit our jeep. We took our positions and I looked where I thought the shot come from, Im not a trianed counter sniper but when I looked, it was just bare desert, not even thick grass or bushes. We held out for another 4 hours, we got the call too move out by command and we did. I still wonder where that shot came from, from time too time."

I was hiking deep in woods by myself (I know, dumb, but my buddy canceled last moment and I went anyway) with my dog way off the popular trails on some small side trails when I noticed this weird guy following me about 300-400 yards back. I got a bad feeling from him right away so I went down a different side trail that no one would normally go down as it's barely marked and doesn't go anywhere then jogged for a couple hundred yards. I stopped by a bend in the trail then ducked behind a tree and took off my pack to get my hatchet out. Well a few moments later this same guy comes around the corner looking around as if he's looking for me, we're about 8 miles from a road at this point and the guy is wearing a stained jersey, a filthy hoodie, some ratty jeans and dirty old tennis shoes. Not dressed like a backpacker. I step out from behind the tree, hatchet casually at my side in one hand, dog leash in the other. My dog is usually really sweet and loves attention from people but clearly understood this guy was up to no good and started growling at him and getting into an aggressive stance. At this point the guy notices me and we lock eyes, he looks really agitated and a bit crazy, and he starts moving toward me. I think he was so messed up on whatever drugs he was on that he hadn't noticed the dog or the hatchet yet so I let out my dogs leash, move the hatchet around a bit to draw his eye and say in as loud and commanding a voice as I can muster ""Hey man, you lost or something?"" I guess his meth soaked brain finally started working again to a degree because that's when he seemed to notice there was a very angry dog standing at his feet giving him a ""I fucking dare you"" look. He muttered something about trying to find the parking lot so I gestured with my hatchet and told him ""it's about 8 miles in behind you."" I could tell he was sizing us up for a few moments and trying to decide if it was worth it. After a really long pause he just turned around and started slowly walking the other direction. I found out from a ranger later that he got caught breaking into cars in the parking lot and had been threatening other hikers with a knife. On a different hike in the same park about a year later I ran into some Juggalos who offered me free LSD. Shawnee National Forest is a beautiful but really strange place."

"I stay at the same airbnb every time I go to Seoul, and I'm kinda buddies with the host, Sarah. Sarah gets nervous enforcing her own rules because people will leave her bad reviews and Seoul's airbnb scene is very competitive. So even though we aren't supposed to have food in our rooms, and have access to a fully stocked, camera-watched kitchen, people completely disregard her rules and bring food in the rooms.

These two Chinese girls were staying there at the same time as me for their plastic surgery recovery and spilled milk all over the mattress. Instead of drying it with towels like normal people, they decided to take the community hairdryer and use that. The heat melted the plastic mattress cover, and somehow they managed to let the hairdryer get stuck in the melted plastic, and dry there. They then proceeded to not tell anyone what happened, and never finished cleaning up the milk, which soaked in through a hole in the now ruined mattress cover, and *spoiled* inside the mattress. It stank so bad. And Sarah didn't charge them for damages.

Another Chinese plastic surgery patient (seriously what is it with these girls) plugged up the sink with a towel and then left the water running. It flooded the entire second floor and the whole stairwell, going all the way down into the basement level. And no damage charges.

Another couple of Chinese surgery patients (the house is in Gangnam right by ID hospital, so most of her clientbase is made up of wealthy Chinese girls getting surgery), all at different times, kept walking around naked in their room with the windows open, windows that face a child's bedroom. The neighbors understandably asked if the girls could close their blinds when naked, and that became a rule you had to agree to to stay in that room. And also a rule that was completely disregarded over and over for months. The neighbors were at this point threatening to get police involved, so Sarah torn down the walls of that room and made it into a balcony.

Lastly, during one of my stays, a Chinese girl ripped a sink out of a wall, and another one barfed on the couch and left it there.

Seriously, wealthy Chinese girls seem to be very disrespectful with other peoples houses. They were all super nice people except when it came to treating Sarah's house with any respect. I hope she starts charging these girls... I wanna give them the benefit of the doubt and think maybe the rules were poorly translated but some of these things are just common sense.

All that said the house is amazing and these stories just make it more fun lol. (but not to Sarah)"

"This is true. As a American born Chinese teen who has been back to China a lot I can testify it's real bad sometimes. However I feel like things are getting better. Those people who spit on the street and let children poop on the ground are just the growing pains of a third world country trying to be a first world country in a incredibly short period of time. 

Those people are more and more seen as the hicks of China. Most educated and young Chinese today are a lot more American than you think."

"I'll tell you one thing from my personal experience, but it luckily wasn't at gunpoint.  I was almost raped on a date when I was in college, but I fought as hard as I could with everything I had.  I bit, slapped, scratched, kicked, pulled his hair, and punched.  Ultimately, he figured I wasn't worth the trouble and let me go.

I also read an article about 15 years ago about a string of murders in a remote part of Mexico.  The victims were all young women who were found raped and murdered along the side of the road at various points in the area, and that there was a gang of men snatching them off of the street (*generally in an isolated location, and very early in the morning when the women in question would be walking to a bus stop to go to work*).  I forget how many bodies they found in total - possibly 15 or more - but there was only one survivor.  The girl who survived and was able to go to the police had fought as hard as she could.  She said they eventually threw her out of the car, complaining that she wasn't worth all the trouble.  So she was mildly injured when they tossed her out, but she avoided being raped and killed because she fought back."

"Hot blonde drinking with her bf in a bar I was in. She looked like Kayla Collins. 

Her bf was a muscly sort of guy in a tapout T-shirt. He went inside to get drinks, there was a big queue at the bar so he was gone a while. 

Handsome but sleazy looking guy starts chatting to the blonde. He's going well, making her giggle etc. I could see the bf in the queue, looking out the window, seeing what was going on. He looked angry but evidently didn't want to lose his place in the queue. 

Handsome sleazeball is cracking more jokes, blondies giggles go from coquettish to plain loud. 

I thought, this isn't gonna end well, this guy better get lost. 

Sure enough meathead bf comes out, just as slezaball cracks another joke, blonde throws her head back giggling. Bf walks over, angrily says something to slezeball. Sleazeball replies something with a smirk. 

Bf pushes him into a table. Blonde gasps and yells her bfs name angrily. Sleazeball finds his balls and runs at the bf....the men start grappling and punching. 

The bf starts to get the upper hand, both men fall to the ground and the muscly bf gets on top. He starts pummelling the sleazeball. 

The blonde is screaming, and I mean screaming ""STOP!!!"" ""STOP!!!""... She does this ridiculous, exaggerated, theatrical, OMG facial expression, with her hands on her face. Like she's acting in a commercial or a B-movie. She lets out a shriek of faux fear.

 Guy is struggling wildly, grabbing at the bfs t-shirt, putting his hands all over the guys face desperately the way murder victims do. His face is covered in blood. The sleazeball actually starts yelling for help. 

At that point two bouncers come over and break it up.

"Coming from the US, when I went to Argentina and Greece as well:

Dogs.

Dogs everywhere. 

No leashes, just out there. 

In Argentina, in the a small town in the west called Tunuyan, a dog lust laying right in the center of a plaza in town, not a care in the world, no tags, no collar and not one shit was given, by the dog or the people around. 

And in Greece, Athens mainly, just dogs roaming around, very similar to Argentina. And cats there as well. When I was in the ruins in Delphi there was a small cat just sitting there and had a bit of an infection and up north near Petralona just a cat hanging out near the cave, skinny but in better shape. 

Having volunteered at a humane society here in the US previously, and watching 20+ years of the Price is Right and Bob Barkers plea, it was kinda shocking to see all the semi-feral animals out there. "

"I'm not sure on the details, so anyone feel free to correct or add to this comment, but I remember reading that this was a bit of a tough question in whale ecology circles some time ago (could be years, could be decades - like i said, not sharp on the details). They're one of very few animals that live substantially beyond menopause without human aid.

We know why we (and captive animals) live that long - medicine and artificially good living conditions - but no-one was sure why wild whales would live for so long after reproductive usefulness.

Then we observed this grand-parenting behaviour in them and realised they served the species in other ways after reproduction. The older whales offered protection, teaching, and generally just had more experience in surviving the ocean.

While this is true for any animal, it is normally only beneficial to the self, and therefore does not help with future generations, and is not naturally selected for. However, because whales live in pods of multiple generations, their experience does directly benefit future generations, and so whales with shorter post-menopausal lives were weeded out, leaving the creatures we know today with decades of grand-parenting potential.

Similar behaviour is much more famous in elephant herds, which I believe are quite closely related to whales, so they may have developed this habit before splitting off from each other."

"It's actually not.  Elemental mercury is not readily absorbed by the body.  You could swallow elemental mercury and just poop it out the other end none the worse for wear.  Less than 0.01% of an injected mercury volume will be absorbed in the time it takes to travel through the gastrointestinal tract.

Elemental mercury *vapors* are bad shite and will muck your brain up but good.  So do not aerosolize mercury by making a mercury fountain.  Don't splash about in a mercury-filled pool.  Don't heat it up and let it off gas.  And don't fling it around with wild abandon.  But if you played with some metallic mercury as a kid long ago you have nothing to worry about.

When it comes to the types of mercury to be worried about:

*Organic mercuries* that build up in predatory fish that cause problems for mostly pregnant women. 

*Inorganic mercury salts* are bad news bears are are to be stringently avoided.

"I think the reason there are so many ""nice guys"" is that the ""nice guy"" philosophy is really close to the truth. Being responsive to someone's expressed needs *is* a good way to get closer to them either inside or outside of a romantic relationship.

The main problem is that people are reluctant to admit the ways in which human behavior diverges from that. Not very many people are willing to say ""if you want someone to be physically attracted to you, you need to be physically attractive"" or ""she's only excited to spend time with confident guys, and you aren't confident"", even though it's the truth.

Another problem is that a person's semantic knowledge doesn't always line up with their procedural knowledge and desires. I was the variety of nice guy that expected girls to give me step by step instructions to winning them over and felt angry with them when they didn't. I said things like ""she can have whatever she wants from me if she'd just tell me what it is."" Buts an adult, I've come to realize that not knowing exactly what you want and not being able to explain it to other people is kind of the default setting for most human beings.

So, I can't be too hard on nice guys now. But at the same time, I can't lie to them and tell them their world view is correct when it's clearly not working out for them.

"An idiotic misunderstanding of basic physics led me - then age fifteen or so - to passionately argue that things like magic and ghosts were completely within the realm of realistic possibility.

""Our understanding of the world has *drastically* changed over the years!"" I'd argue. ""What about dark matter and dark energy? Who's to say there isn't *even more* that we can't detect yet? There's no evidence *against* the existence of ghosts or magic!""

Fortunately, I eventually realized that I didn't have a clue what I was saying... and to be honest, it was a pretty liberating experience. As I started actually studying physics, I came to see how the tapestry of the universe is woven in such a way that while ghosts and magic *can't* exist - seriously, electromagnetism (and by extension, your computer) wouldn't work if they could - there are so, so many more interesting (and real) things out there.

The saddening part is that I still see people offering the same ""arguments"" that I did when I was a teenager.

"I hate going shopping. I just always seem to have really awkward and uncomfortable interactions with people at the grocery store.

I had my cart pulled off to the side of the isle when I was shopping one time and this lady was walking towards me alongside her cart while her daughter was pushing it.

On the other side of the isle across from me was another lady who had pulled her cart to the side while she was grabbing something. There was enough room for one cart to go between us.

But I guess that wasn't good enough for the lady because she stopped in front of my cart and just stood there.

Her daughter attempted to continue pushing the cart, but the mom grabbed her arm and stopped her.

Then the lady just stared at me like ""get out of my way"".

I mean, there was space to get the cart through, but I guess she was pissed that there wasn't enough space for her to walk through at the same time? I just pushed my cart even closer to the shelves and then ignored her as she just stood there staring at me.

Then another guy pushing his cart came up behind her, was pissed she wasn't moving, and squeezed in between both of us with his cart.

Then the lady grumbled and told her daughter ""Come on"" and pulled the cart through.

Then as she walked past me she said ""Don't worry honey,"" (at this point she gave me a glare) ""*some* people are just *so* rude.""

I'm still not sure if she was talking about me or the guy but I've been festering on it for like four months."

An example: customer has the Gaming package for $5/month on top of his regular internet cost. Traffic for online gaming would get priority over regular internet traffic, reducing lag or what not. Could do the same for streaming video.

Looking back, I can see that they might have thought that they were ""cutting me a break,"" or didn't want the hassle of it, but instead I learned that I could manipulate people to my advantage. That really fucked me up for a long time and ended up doing more damage in the long run. It would have been better if I'd just flunked those classes."

"Exbusiness partner and I needed someone to help out the back in an IT repair business. They would need some inter personal skills as well (I know, IT and Interpersonal..). So the application form was simple and 5 multiple choice questions. Each question had 2 choices, there was no right or wrong answer it was to prove us with talking topics to see how they went.

nvidia or radeon, intel or AMD, Eagles vs Dockers (local football), Ford vs Holden and something like Seagate vs Western Digital. We wanted to see how they reasoned and how they would handle customers with a differing view. Could they act like humans. It even said at the top ""there is no right or wrong answer, these are discussion topics so come prepared"".

This was obviously too hard for most. Any application with a ""3rd option"" written in and selected was immediately binned. One person even wrote a page essay about she felt these questions where stupid and did not feel it necessary to complete. Yeh, we got her in for a laugh ;)

She presented well, and spoke well about initial interview things, experience, why did you want the job etc. But man oh man, did she go on a rant about the questions. When she finished I just asked ""Those where discussion points, just to see how you went interacting with others. How do you think you went?""...she just stood up and left.

Man, we got some doozies.

My favourite was this guy who came in with sunglasses (this was at night), leather jacket and I shit you not did the whole Fonzy ""aaaeeeee"". Needless to say I wanted to hire this guy. That was until he said the first thing he said was ""I want to play games for a living, can I play games here during work hours?"". This was before Esports was taking off or anything.

The lady who got the job had no experience in the industry. However she rocked up with research on the 5 questions. Each one was ""I did not know but..."". For the Ford vs Holden she had printed off pages of jokes and the Eagles vs Dockers was a classic...the Eagles had a big player called Cox at the time...her response.

""I don't know much about footy but I found out the Eagles had a great big Cox, so went for them. But he just got injured so now they have a big limp cox, not sure how I feel about that"".....yeh she got the job on the spot after that. Best Employee I ever knew."

We decided to give him a chance because the real pitfall was his obviois social anxiety. Having both been there we decided to class it as an investment. Kid stayed for his 6mo contract before moving overseas with his gf, who he married at 17, who had just had his kid. He was so anxious because his mother was threatening to file for custody.

"It's not a popular position, to defend the writers for that moment - but I really feel like that moment was the result of bad directing. On paper, I think that whole thing with Arya could have looked like it made a lot more sense. Arya finds out that the faceless men want to kill her so she hides away in one episode. The next episode we see her trying to secure voyage off of Braavos and away from the danger, but they catch up to her and stab her. The next episode she is saved by a friend she had made earlier in the season, but is still chased down by the Waif and only manages to survive by luring her into a dark area and using her blind-fighting skills. That all tracks. 

It was the *directing* that resulted in Arya jarringly waltzing around town like she owned the place when she had been hiding and fearing for her life the previous episode. The directing that made that stabbing scene so violent looking - the *directing* that made ""the Waif stalks Arya through the city"" a fucking parkour scene despite the character having just been stabbed. I feel like a lot of people aren't really being fair on this point - it really wasn't the writing that was bad here, it was how that writing was presented.

My son is now 13. We struggled. And got zero help. 
Let's say we were granted that money through the courts and he paid it. But! A law of itemizing support money's is in place....would I be allowed to repair my car? Buy a new washer and dryer? Buy myself new workboots, as I do renovations for a living? Take my son on the vacation he always wanted, but I could not provide? Pay our cell phones, which is lifelines for friends, family, work/income? How do you decide what is OK? And when it goes back to that $71 a month....how is that divided? 

I agree with you 100%."
"That's when you start trying to get custody, instead of going to court to enforce this law.




Edit: All these people replying saying the same thing: yes, I completely agree, custody battles often end up with nothing resolved, especially when a male is asking for custody. But are the odds going to court to complain to the judge about how your ex spends child support money and actually having a good outcome any better? You may as well do what's better for the child in that case and actually try for custody imo. "

"Definitely not genetics. I could have been one of those kids you might just signed off with that outlook. 

As someone pointed out; Not genetics, you are the product of your own upbringing. 

&amp;nbsp;

My story for those who might care to know: 

I didn't have the best start at school as a kid with learning difficulties and speech therapy till I was 10. Not being able to describe what is happening in the room or communicate with fellow class mates at school sucked. It was so isolating - not to forget the impending 'retard' bullying that came to be. Safe to say; things weren't looking great for me. My educational and social development was seriously disadvantaged at the start.  

&amp;nbsp;
 
I could write pages about this, but ill fast forward: It wasn't till it started to 'click' for me when I was around 14. I started to retain information better. Pushing into community college, learning the importance of study, citing references, reading case studies. More reading vastly improved my english language. I was one of those whose vocabulary was stupidly limited and couldn't tell the difference with your, you're, were, we're etc. Didn't know how to use a comma etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

Going into uni with my thrust for knowledge. Pushed me into reading about the world issues, geopolitics, and philosophy. This completely eradicated my small village mentality. Gave me a fresh and outward perspectives. It wasn't till I was around 23, I started to read novels for pleasure. This further deepened my development as well as socially.

&amp;nbsp;

The irony of it all is, most of those at school who had the best start in my class. Who didn't have limiting mental struggles with the process of learning. Pissed it up the wall. Totally wasted the potential. Those as a kid, I thought; you're probably going to be a doctor, you a lawyer, you running a business, and me, probably cleaning somewhere. Couldn't be far form the truth.

&amp;nbsp; 

I now have a 1:1 with distinction BA degree in a career of my choosing. It was a fucking struggle as a kid. I remember the person I used to be; My world outlook, how I used to write, talk, think. I does make me cringe, but in a way, I'm kinda grateful for it as I can see how far I've came.

&amp;nbsp;

What I will say though is; the small number of therapists, the teachers and helpers, my mentors, grandfather, and my mother. Who believed I was an intelligent boy (their words) from the beginning who just needed 'fuel' for his engine. I wouldn't be where I'm at today. They fought tooth and nail to keep me on the path against great opposition. Because believe me, if the system had it's way, I would have been throw away in a special ed school to be forgotten about. I'm forever in debt to these people. 

What I can't stand is wasted potential. Give each kid a fair shake.

"I always have a nervous laugh for any situations to the point I tell ppl about this quirk as a precaution.  A friend of mine I havent seen in a while, was recently diagnosed with cancer and was prepping for chemo.   I had no idea that she was diagnosed since I was out traveling when she decided to tell ppl about her illness. 
She drasticly cut her hair so when I saw her again I complimented her on the bold fashion change when she realized I had no idea was going on and told me.
My friend is a joker so I thought she was joking and laughed it off, she kept insisting she was serious and I told her  ""Having Cancer is not funny, please tell me its a lie.""

Good thing she was a good sport about it, I was laughing then nervously chuckling as she was telling me her situation. Had to tell her sorry if I laughed, my stupid personality has no idea how to handle sad news.   She just told me to give her a good hug.

I knew I was the only person in the building so I pretended to chat on the phone and that I was going to let someone waiting at the front in. Promptly left the building till the following week.

"Well, your comment is interesting, because to some scholars, this *was* surprising. There was a hypothesis that there are certain facial expressions that are innate and not cultural, and there were studies done to demonstrate this with peoples who were removed from any other culture. Not only do blind people make the same expressions of disgust, anger, sadness, fear, and happiness that people with sight do, but tribes of people from Papua New Guinea who would never have met a westerner who could explain what a ""smile"" is do too.  [Here](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/12/081229080859.htm) is a link to a report on a study about this. Note that the site claims this to be a ""new"" study, but I think this could only have been a confirmation of the common theory anyway, because I learned in my Anthropology textbooks that this has been demonstrated a long time ago. 

TL;DR: At one time people *did* wonder if facial expressions were culturally learned. Turns out that's true for some (think duckface) but not the basic ones like smiling. "

So she did it and as anyone could assume when you stick an egg up your ass there's going to be some pressure on that egg. So after she got it in the egg broke and yolk started leaking out of my ass. 

Immediately she started calling me ""yolk assed bitch."" I was confused at first by the fact that she was mocking me for something I agreed to do just to make her happy. But then as she kept mocking, ""yolk assed bitch,"" I became mortified. Now she calls me ""yolk assed bitch"" in front of all my friends and family. "

Not true at all.

The various general staffs were populated by *very* bright men, who were quite capable of performing logical analysis and otherwise comprehending the problem in front of them. They understood the stalemate of the trenches and what that meant for how to conduct the war.

And they - correctly - understood that with the constraints placed on them by trenches, barbed wire, machine guns, and mass artillery, that the only way to win was going to be either some sort of technological development or plain old fashioned attrition.

So they did both. Development went forward on the tank, and on tactics that did not rely on centralized control - developments that later paid off for the Allies. But they also did the cold hard math, and knew that as long as they killed 1.3 Germans for every one of theirs killed, they would win. And when losing meant national extermination, what choice do you have.

The evolution of the scam is that you can technically make money by selling a real product for which there is a real demand. Just, you know, not _much_ money. And the minimum orders and such are designed to push money up the chain and push the risk to the people on the bottom.

"You don't know about the horse female stereotype?

She's been riding horses since she was a little girl.  Now that she's grown up, of course she has her own horse - which she raised from a foal.  Rather than keeping it in a pasture, she keeps it in a proper stable, which is really expensive.  So she spends all day at the stables, taking care of her horse and working there to work off some of the cost of keeping her horse there.  The rest of the day she spends at her actual job, so that she can pay for everything her horse 'needs'.  Like all the trappings she needs to show her horse, because it's not enough to simply have a horse, and showing the horse is really expensive."

"After reading this thread, there is one thing that has always intrigued me. I am for a 3rd world country. I now live in a 1st world, peaceful one. I notice most of the people I meet in developed countries tend to wish going to poor places, for some reason. I don't know what is this weird fascination with poverty. I understand it is different from what you are used to, I understand there is a part of seeing something out of your reality, and cultural standards. However, my take to travel is always this one: who am I financing, if I bring my money to this place right now. Is it a corrupt government that does not give a fuck to their people? Not going there. Is it to an awful dictatorship who does not give a fuck to their people? Not going there. Is it to extremists who murder anyone who disagree with them? Nope. Not going there either. Most of these places only sustain themselves on tourism. Usually the worst type of tourism (sexual exploration, drugs, and all the weird things that go along with it). If no one goes there ""just to experience the culture, or for the beautiful scenery"", eventually they will have to change. What I mean is, do not go somewhere where there is little to no regard for human life, apart from those of the wealthy tourists bringing their wallets there. "

"To be fair, the airport's gotten much better.  It's still shit, but it's less shit now.  

Metro Manila's also kinda shit, but the food's decent, at least.  You're right though, get out of the capital ASAP.  I've got a friend who moved here several months ago for work, who only got out of Manila last month.  I thought she was crazy.  

Edit: Reposting something I typed out for a reply to this because it feels like my first bit was too harsh: 

Okay, I'm a Manileno, born and raised.  Lived in Metro Manila most of my life, and the place, flawed as it is, is home.  I've traveled all around the world and the local food scene is fantastic.  The shopping's also very good, and cost of living is generally pretty cheap.  

All that said, there really isn't much in Manila that is too interesting from a tourist's point of view.  Like, food and shopping are fine, but unless you're a professional food critic you're not getting on a plane to go halfway around the world just to eat.  

I will say that [Intramuros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intramuros), the historic part of the city, is very nice, and it probably worth visiting, but it is also pretty much the only surviving part of pre-WW2 Manila, because the rest of the city was blown the fuck up.  Because the rest of the city was blown up, the rest of the metro is kind of a disorganized mess.  So at least we kind of have an excuse there?  

Basically, for all it's positives, I would not recommend that foreign tourists come to the Philippines just to visit Manila.  You travel to see 'amazing', not 'alright'.  It's pretty much the same case as other SE Asian capitals, w/ the exceptions of Bangkok (because temples) &amp; Singapore (because SG is a different case in general): the capitals are big chaotic cities that you generally pass through to see the more interesting stuff.  

The rest of the country though?  The nature is just fucking fantastic.  Been all around the world and I'd put our beaches up against anyone's.  Our islands are top notch, and places like the [Banaue Rice Terraces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banaue_Rice_Terraces), [the Palawan Underground River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Princesa_Subterranean_River_National_Park) and [the Chocolate Hills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_Hills) are breathtaking.  You travel to the Philippines for *those*.  

That might've been a bit too long.  I've thought a lot about this issue."

"Oh man, I actually have found two dead bodies before. Allow me to finally have something to contribute to Askreddit! 

Four years ago, West Michigan, dead of winter.im staying the night at my friend's house because the weather got so bad that I couldn't even hoof it to the bus stop nearby to be on my way. No big deal, I'll just go to the stop tomorrow. Well, the next day, my friend and I are walking to the bus stop, when we see what looks like a pile of garbage on the sidewalk. It was still snowing that morning, so it was hard to see, but when we got closer, we noticed it was a body of a larger man face-first in the snow. I can't explain how eerie it was to experience; I had no idea he was dead, I even tried shaking him a little. But I looked down and saw a spilled open bad of mini KitKats on the ground next to a blotch of discoloration on the snow near his head. The poor guy was drunk walking home from getting candy before he passed out, and the snow banks on the sidewalk were so high nobody saw him and he froze to death. We called the police and waited there just staring at the body until they came. The guy's family found out addresses and sent us cards for finding him.

The second time was shortly after I got married (same girl I was going to visit in the last story, yay me.) wife and I stopped at a gas station near our apartment to grab a bite from the subway that was inside it, and I noticed a red car was parked and running the whole twenty minutes I spent inside getting my order. I take a quick peek and see a poor little dog freaking out in the back seat, front seat occupied by a man in his 30's. He had his seat leaning back, eyes closed peacefully, one hand lightly touching the left side of his chest. Maybe he had been driving all night? 
Had my wife call the police. Sure enough, after the police came and we went home, the next day we read on the news that the guy had died of a heart attack. Must have pulled in just thinking his chest hurt. 
Anyways, I really hope I don't find any more dead bodies. "

Then you get there and he expected sex. And the cycle continues..."

I met my husband at a show he played on New Year's Eve a couple years ago. How did it go? 
It was great, we had all kinds of crazy sex. 
Did it change how I look at him? 
Well yeah, we're married. Instead of getting wet every time he gets on stage, I sit in the back, trying not to look bored and sell t shirts. I don't quiver when he looks my way, I ask him to bring me food and rub my back. And he gets back scritches too. I don't bring him food, though, I'm not good at cooking. We're expecting our first baby, so instead of seeing the super hot goth guy screaming out lyrics on stage (who is way out of my league, who I thought I'd never be good enough for), I see the father of my child and the person that provides for me. Also sex is way better now that we've been together for 2 years and know what we like.

1. Keep a modest volume. If you wanna test an amp's power, cool, but you don't need 3 minutes of cranking the amp to confirm that it can get loud.

2. Don't jerk off your guitar. If you can shred, and you wanna shred, then shred. If you have a desire to hit random notes fast, save it for your bedroom. You're not impressing anyone, you're just making an unpleasant environment for everyone else.

3. If someone is playing and they aren't as good as you or they're an obvious beginner, don't give them weird looks or any judgmental body language. We all started somewhere. To quote Arin Hanson, ""You think I came out the pussy drawin' Motzart?!""

"Not OP but I'll throw some links your way. In terms of ""great men"" history, one stands out in Afghan history: Genghis Khan. 

Genghis Khan, as you may have heard, was probably the most murderous man in history. [His invasion of Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_conquest_of_Khwarezmia) was spectacularly brutal, with him accepting surrender terms only to renege on them and execute the prisoners. He would march entire city populations outside, behead them all to build huge pyramids of skulls to mark his victory. More than 25% of the population of Afghanistan was wiped out. Afghanistan has never recovered. It wasn't just the slaughter, great cities were left in ruins, irrigation systems destroyed. The Mongols turned the place to desert. 

Afghanistan, though difficult to imagine now, was the jewel of many great civilisations, until Genghis reduced it to the stone age. The ruins of thousands of years of Persian, Greek and Arab civilisations [litter the country](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Afghanistan+ruins&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;prmd=minv&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiFxMer2I3VAhViBMAKHenCAUgQ_AUICigC&amp;biw=360&amp;bih=560#safe=off&amp;tbm=isch&amp;q=Afghanistan+ancient+ruins). Now the people of Afghanistan scratch in the dirt, Taliban machinegun and dynamite the great statues and columns of civilisations they could only dream of for sport. 

Afghanistan was largely ignored by the wider world for centuries, until my people (the British) [invaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasions_of_Afghanistan#British_invasions) as part of a power play to counter Russian expansion. They needn't have bothered, Afghanistan is hell. The harrowing story of [the 1842 retreat from Kabul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1842_retreat_from_Kabul), in which a single survivor with a sword wound to his skull out of 17,000 people should've warned the Soviets and NATO after them what happens in Afghanistan. 90 miles of retreat under continual attack from an enemy that promised them safe passage, and British troops stationed at Jalalabad fucking saw this survivor *still* being chased by Afghans as he approached them, they had to race troops out to rescue him. 

The British tried several times but never really mastered Afghanistan. They could usually hold the cities, but they were usually under siege to varying degrees. Sound familiar? 

The Soviets had the same experience. They resorted to [staggering cruelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet–Afghan_War#Destruction_in_Afghanistan) and scorched Earth to try and pacify the country, killing millions and producing an astonishing 10 million refugees. Their war, and the CIA's work goading and arming extremists to ensure it was bloody and endless, is responsible for the Taliban and al Qaeda. The Taliban took over and [continued where the Mongols left off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban), destroying everything of value. Massacres and brutality were routine. Infrastructure, ancient monuments, irrigation systems just destroyed for the sake of it. 

None of this begins to touch the subject of centuries of violent society, that has lived without security or effective law. Their entire culture has PTSD. They're drawn to batshit religious beliefs because anything is better than anarchy. "

"Just out of curiosity, did you ask the candidate what his future plans were before recommending him to the client?

Not wanting to jump to the wrong conclusion but I've had way too many recruiters send me candidates that it's immediately obvious are totally inappropriate for the business, because the recruiter didn't do the proper research beforehand and just told me what I wanted to hear.

My favourite example was when I was told a candidate had a clean criminal record. He didn't, and in fact had spent several years in prison for a serious assault. He came straight out and told us this and it was blatantly obvious that the recruiter had guessed the facts about him just so we would interview him."
"From what I've read, men basically can't post anything. Can't say you're just looking to hook up. Can't say you're looking for something more. When you boil down all the things men can't post. It's basically just a picture of their face, their career, and a list of their hobbies.

If I posted all the wacky stuff I see women post on dating sites, I'd be down voted into oblivion. So let's get real for a second. Put whatever you want on dating sites. Most of these sites are specifically for hooking up anyway. 

Many women are treated like sex objects, so they hold out hope for that 1 Prince Charming to come along and sweep them off their feet. All the while completely ignoring the 10 decent men that worked up the nerve to approach them, but weren't attractive, confident, smart, wealthy enough to make the cut. 

So when it comes to ""dating"" sites, do whatever you think paints your in the best light. Whatever gives people the best impression of yourself. If the opposite sex doesn't like it, fuck em. It's their loss. 

if you're desperate for a shag. Get your butt in the gym, and dress your best for website pics. Let's be honest. Nobody wants to bang someone who is out of shape. 

EDIT: since, exclusively women are blowing up my inbox, I will spell this out for everyone. Take advice online from strangers with a grain of salt. if you notice, you are all talking about sites that are used almost exclusively for hooking up. If you post lies about yourself on those sites, dont you think others will too? Be yourself. If you want to try to impress strangers online, you are going to end up dating superficial people. 

I was trying to point this out. the top comments are contradictory and leave almost nothing for men to post on those ""dating sites"" Except pictures to help each other swipe left, job description to determine if men are wealthy enough for women to date, and hobbies to see if you have anything else in common. dating sites are the worst fucking place to find love. thats why people use them to hook up

"Marrakech. This is a good (bad) one so get comfortable.

I'd been twice with male friends, but the third one went with a mixed crowd. We stayed together as a group through all of the holiday until the final day when the girls went out shopping in the markets on their own.

We found them an hour later crying and shaking. One of the market sellers had been really aggressive with them, pulling them into his shop and physically holding them there until they bought something. Then him pinned one girl against the wall trying to kiss her. He insisted it was part of his Berber tradition to kiss her, but eventually just settled to kiss her on the cheek while she repulsed.

It gets worse.

We reported this to the tourist police and they went absolutely mad. They made us wait in the station while they found the market seller and dragged him out in front of us. The guy was crying buckets and collapsed on the floor in front of us. He begged us to forgive him but the police wood behind us, grabbed our arms and said ""this is a very bad man, we need you to tell us you want to prosecute him. Don't waste our time"". We were really intimidated by this, particularly as we don't speak French or Arabic and the police we gripping on to us. We were genuinely scared they would hold our passports and stop us going home.

So then the police tell us this man is going to go to prison for SEVEN YEARS for the crime. But we need to give a written statement. So we tell the full story to a man in an office and we writes it out in Arabic. We can't read this but he tells us his translation'. It's completely wrong. According to the report it was a serious sexual assault and he pinned the girl down on the floor. We go back and forth trying to fix the statement for hours but settling on the best we can do. Hey keep saying ""the details aren't important"" there details were things like ""he forced me on the floor and put his hands all over my body"" - which did not happen. They also take our passport details.

More.

But we now need to go to the main police station to report the crime. So they bundle us in to a taxi. Six people on the back seat. And we go to the main police station. It's an absolute shit hole. It looks like a massive derelict factory that was converted into a crack house. We get lead to a room where the market seller is stood in a lineup with other men. He's still crying his eyes out and can barely stand so the lineup is pretty pointless. There isn't any glass separating us, he's literally stood in front of us in the same room, which is really distressing for the girl that reported this. He's begging us to make this stop but we're too scared to say something to the police. We have no idea where we are. The building is huge, trashed, empty (like 5 policeman), the toilets were flooded, and we don't know where we are - way out from the city centre and it's getting late.

We eventually tell the police we fly home tomorrow and they gets really annoyed. They say we need to be at the courts tomorrow to stand in front of this man and accuse him of a crime in front of a public audience. But we can't cause we'll be on a flight at that time.

It now looks like things will work out. They say the man cannot be prosecuted without the victim coming forward, which is a relief to us as we no longer want this. Remember, we're stuck in a strict foreign country, not speaking the language, and being pushed around by the police whom are notoriously heavy handed. They seem fed up at the point and drive us back to our hostel in a riot van.

We fly home an think its all over.

A month later the doorbell rings. There's a Moroccan man stood there. He tells us Hassan is still in prison and he needs our help. The man has travelled miles across the country (he's here on a work visa) to ask us for help. Apparently the market sellers lawyer gave the family our home address from the passport details so they could begin us to go back to Marrakech and tell the courts Hassan is innocent. We don't know if this is a scam or if he man is armed or anything so we tell him to write us a letter and we'll respond to only that.

A month passes and nothing happens. Then the doorbell rings again and this time there's a French woman stood there. She tells us she's flown over from southern France as a friend of the family to beg us for help. Apparently she used to live in our city and so is staying with friends nearby. We arrange to meet in a cafe the next day.

Turns out this is all true. Really a very elaborate con. She shows us newspaper articles, the police report, and websites. We see a clipping from a whole page of the 'Marrakech Times' which describes the event as a ""assault sexual"". The lady tells us that other market sellers paid the police to put Hassan away because he was taking their business. We don't know if this is true. We refuse to go back to Marrakech and go in front of the courts because we still don't know for certain if this is a con or what might happen to us. We write a statement and get it signed by a local policeman as a witness. In our statement we say he did grab at the girl but tat nothing else happened and that the man is innocent. The French woman says that she knows Hassan and he would never grab at a woman, but obvious that isn't true.

So the French woman leaves with our note and says she'll stay in contact to let us know he gets out ok. She never wrote back to us and we still don't know what happened and how much was true. We certainly won't be going back to Marrakech and are left with bad memories."

"The wording makes it seem much more likely that she was a lesbian. A 'terrible desire' to kiss the girl and the sight of a nude female causing her to 'go into ecstasy' indicates very strongly that she was sexually attracted to women. Not every girl goes through that 'stage', I didn't, but I am aware of some girls who were curious and turned out to be bi or gay, though crushes have come and gone with a few. Most straight girls I see fooling around together are doing it so guys think they are sexy. 

Edit: since it is apparently so upsetting that I didn't word it more clearly, I intended to imply she could have been bisexual, which seems likely based on another redditors comment. The entire point of my comment was that her wording indicated that her attraction to women was not a passing phase but part of her sexual identity. "

"The term ""**Pipe Hitter**"" actually comes from the original **Green Berets**. 

During the late 30s when Special Forces ODAs were conducting FID (training locals to fight) in southeast-Asian countries to fight back the **Nazis**, they didn't have the funding or equipment to supply the indigenous population with rifles, so they actually gave them galvanized steel pipes and hit them together to simulate gunfire during raids to give the impression of being raided by a force larger than what there was in reality. It was astonishingly successful, more often than not they surrendered almost immediately. And that's why we still use the term ""pipe hitter"" to this day.

There is no youtube channel or book that is going to make you look polished and organic in social situations, you have to put your pride away, realize people aren't paying near as much attention to your flaws as you think, and put yourself out there every day.

"My dad is retired and has a pretty low stress, simple life.

 In the spring and summer he spends a LOT of time sitting by his pond shooting bullfrogs with a BB gun.(Because he is adamantly opposed to real guns) It has never made an ounce of a difference in the overall bullfrog population of that pond, but he keeps trying.

I'd say the bullfrog pond invasion is his biggest conflict in life. He keeps researching and introducing big fish to the pond to try to eat the frogs and tad-polls.  He has even built a wood and foam raft and stand-up paddles out into the middle of the pond and sits for hours out there, shooting at the bullfrogs. When he actually hits and kills one he will drag it up to the dock and take a picture and send to the whole family.

3) He was a massive, glory-seeking asshole. There are people who explored for the sake of exploring in all realms of science and history; he explored for the sake of himself. Is that really someone we want to celebrate?"

edit: yes, you expect them to die but some people think that the mice will eat the poison and die right there on the spot, making removal simpler. With warfarin (active ingredient in mouse poison) the mice will still feel okay immediately after feeding and will nest down before dying. They are not capable of vomiting so when they feel ill, their natural instinct is to hide. And since they nest at secure, hidden places, their bodies will most likely not be seen. Only smelled. "

"Hating tumblr and SJWs who lose their shit over everything.

Number one, Tumblr is self-curated. You can follow any blogs you want. I follow mostly blogs about cartoons and shit. SJW propaganda rarely comes up, and even then it's obviously written by a child who's probably heavily medicated or in need of help. This isn't an adult with influence.

Number two, I think the presence of these SJWs losing their shit over everything is seriously overstated. My boyfriend watches ""public freakout"" type videos all the time and then becomes outraged that extreme radical feminists exist, but I've never seen one in real life and I think the existence of videos of them online reinforces the idea that they're somehow not an extreme minority.

We went to the House of Blues the next morning more hungover than I'd ever been, listened to some of the best music by a man I can't find the name of, and ate the best omelette of my life.

"Late but...

Younger girl, 18ish, interviewing for a dog boarding and daycare center. I was desperate to hire and wasn't getting many applications in- she was an artist and seemed relatively normal, so despite the lack of any real work experience or volunteering I invited her for a brief working interview.

First issue: she stood like a scared rabbit. Genuinely terrified of everything and trying to take up the least amount of space possible. I could over look this since I hire a lot of first-time job kids who are shy and interviewing for the first time, but she spoke barely above a whisper.
So I bring her into my office to interview. I'm a pretty laid back interviewer, just a few questions, joke a little to try to put her at ease. She is still just TERRIFIED.

Second issue: when I asked her greatest strengths and weaknesses she stared at me blankly before saying in a nervous tone ""like...punching and kicking...?"". I stared in disbelief for a brief few seconds before clarifying that I meant personality wise. She STILL didn't get it and said ""uh...I can lift boxes...?""

Drag my way through the rest of the interview before going to give her a tour of the rest of the kennel and connecting animal hospital. She is visibly recoiling from all the dogs I show her, which of course is almost an automatic failure in this setting.
 In possibly the worst of coincidences, after going to the hospital side they were doing a necropsy on a dog that had died young under mysterious circumstances earlier that morning. I didn't want to bring any attention to it but she pointed it out and asked ""oh, are they doing surgery on that doggie?"" (She sincerely said 'doggie', not dog.)

Mind you this dog's guts are half strewn out and techs are going through it searching for whatever had taken its life. Not hooked up to anything, the whole room smells like death. I politely inform her the dog was being studied to figure out what had killed it. She froze and asked in a quivering voice: ""The...doggie's dead...?""

She could not recover after that. Completely horrified the rest of the tour. I told her we went with someone with more experience in the follow up and never heard from the poor kid again."

"""1,100dB"" from u/hazar815:

&gt;First of a sound of that magnitude would require 1098 watts/meter2 . That is an absolutely insane amount of power, far in excess of what we can produce, and is many of orders of magnitude greater than what a supernova creates. So we don’t have to worry about it actually happening. But, now, how would that create a black hole. By E=mc2. Put enough energy into a small enough area and it would be the equivalent of putting mass in that area, causing immense gravity. With energy as great as 1100 dB, it would create enough gravity to cause a black hole to form, and an incredibly large one at that.

&gt;Decibels are a logarithmic unit. That means 20 decibels isn’t 2 times more powerful than 10 decibels, it’s 10 times more powerful. 30 decibels is 10 times more powerful than 20 decibels. 40 decibels is 10 times more powerful than 30 decibels. Each time the decibel number goes up by 10, the power of the sound is multiplied by 10. The number 1100 is like starting with 10 decibels, and adding 10 on 109 times. That means 1100 is 10109 times more powerful than 10 decibels. That is 1 with 109 zeros after. 10 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 times more powerful. I expect a sound wave that strong would have to compress air so dense that the rest mass plus the kinetic energy would mean that the mass of say a metre cubed of air would fall inside it’s own Schwarzschild radius. When a mass of an object is compressed within it’s Schwarzschild radius, the escape velocity required to escape the sphere of matter the compression creates would exceed the speed of light, thus a black hole is formed.

&gt;Decibels are not a linear scale. For comparison, if you think going 50 mph is fast, going 100 mph is twice as fast; that’s a linear scale. With Decibels, if you think 80 dB is loud, 83 is twice as loud, and 86 is twice as loud as that! So when you go from a nice normal sound like, say, 50 dB, to 1100 dB you have a difference of 1050 dB. That’s 350 increases of 3 dB, so you’re looking at a difference in energy on the order of 2350 times the energy. That’s about 200,000 googol (i.e. 200,000 * 10100; a 2 with 105 zeroes after it). This number is bonkers huge. No physical quantity in the universe is this large using meaningful units. The other thing to note is that mass and energy are intimately related and in many ways interchangeable (see: E = mc2), so if you have enough energy in one place then you effectively have a lot of mass in that location, which can cause a black hole to form. Inside of a black hole, as far as we can tell, there is no difference between mass and energy. So while a sound this loud would cause an unimaginably huge black hole, it would take a nuclear reactor consuming all of the matter of the universe several times over to produce the sound in the first place, so that’s kind of moot. (note: I might have screwed up my math on the energy of a 1100 dB sound; the dB scale scales amplitude, energy content, and perceived loudness at different rates. The general idea is still correct, though)."

"Yeah I'm not sure i understand these complaints. When is dual citizenship ever relevant at the TSA? I travel abroad about five times a year and I fly several times per month. I always have both passports with me. I only ever show one.

European union passport to get in/through/out of the European Union.

And that's exactly what both areas tell you to do, just ask a passport control person. Unless you're trying to show off or be difficult, there's no need to show both, especially since the U.S. does not technically recognize dual citizenship."

"As a kid of divorced parents, I think it's not a good idea. When my parents got divorced, my Dad was a successful attorney and my Mom was a stay-at-home Mom with a little work experience in retail. My Dad didn't want custody of my sister and I, and my Mom really couldn't support us. She was able to use Child support money to get herself a degree and start a career that benefited us greatly in the long run as it set my Mom up with a decent career. My Dad and his second wife were always angry when they saw we had shoes that were getting old or jeans that were getting a little short, and my sister and I would hear about how he was giving my mom ""all this money for nothing."" As soon as we turned 18, he summarily quit paying anything and didn't offer to help with college at all.

If he had been able to use the legal system to compel my Mom to spend Child Support in a specific way, I might never have gone to college and my Mom might still be working a register at Department Stores with no hope of retirement and probably on some kind of welfare. As it is, she was able to help us with school and she'll be retiring next year because she's been a Medical Technologist working in a lab at a local hospital for the last 25 years."

"By that rationale, how would a parent feed and clothe their child if there was no child support? He or she would still need to find the extra money to do that. If the parent with full custody didn't have a child to care for, then he or she could rent a studio or a one-bedroom instead of a two-bedroom apartment. Utility bills wouldn't be as high if they were living alone. Those are all expenses directly related to childcare and frankly I can't see a reason why child support shouldn't be allocate for those expenses."

"My stepdaughters are pretty metal.

Youngest was riding her bike at the age of about six down a steep hill, when the chain came off, and she obeyed Newton's Law of Inertia right into a garage door at the bottom of the hill.  Knocked out 4 of her front teeth, and had to go to the ER to make sure she wasn't hurt worse - there was blood everywhere.  I got there after she'd been there about fifteen minutes already - I wasn't at home at the time and had to come across town.  I walk in, and this conversation occurred:

Me:  Hey, kiddo.  How you feeling?

Her:  Not so great, slice_of_pi......you know how when you lose teeth, the tooth fairy comes and gives you money?

Me:  ....yeah (wondering where this is going)

Her:  Am I getting paid for this?

Middle stepdaughter was the only conscious one in a car accident with her mom and both sisters.  She thought her mom and her older sister were both dead, and stood there at the road side, flagged down the rescuers and gave them all the needed info on who they were, where they were going, where they were meeting her dad for his visitation, and how to reach him.  She only came apart when she was told that her mom was still alive.

"The ""Requests"" section of ExtraLunchMoney is always a great place to poke around if you're amused by this sort of thing. There's a lot of steady regulars looking for very specific things there- satin fetishists, LOTS of 'pee your pants' dudes, shaving (but strictly with a LADIES razor), crying/noseblowing, shoe masturbation fetishists (they want you to wear the shoes, then take them off and insert them into various places), giantess fetish (pretending you're huge and going to crush or eat the tiny fetishist), popped collars of polo shirts (yes really), etc.

Personally I've had a lot of fun with balloon fetishists. They're all a little different in what they're into, but tend to fall in categories- blow-to-pop, giant sized balloons, cigarette popping, and heel popping. B2P is the most common, but sometimes gets mixed with giant sized balloons, and by giant I mean special ordered amazon 3 to 10 footers. A normal party balloon is 9 or 12"". Sadly I can't do balloon popping stuff in my current living situation, so I've got all my looners on hold until I move in a couple months.

Over the last couple years I've also started attracting long toenail fetishists. It started with one odd little dutch dude that paid me $150/month to give him toenail updates and grow them uncomfortably long then supply a custom video every 3 months or so of clipping them with clear clipping audio. He's bought my clipped toenails before (another $150 + shipping to Europe), and recently we've arranged for him to clip them himself on camera while he wears a mask next time i'm in his area for vacation. He sent me a photo, and he's actually a cute, normal dude, he's just into this one really weird thing, and again thinks I do it better than anyone else. I've found him harmless so far, and all his custom ordered content resells really well, plus I never travel alone, so it'll just be a fun new facet to his obsession with my toenails. I've learned to keep a variety of shoes available for these periods of time though, because three months of toenail growth will definitely alter your shoe size. He's currently all up in a tizzy because I managed FOUR months of toenail growth, but there's almost no difference between that and three, tbh.

My coworkers of my size all do feeder fetish stuff- uncomfortably and usually rudely stuffing yourself with food. The fetishists buy the food, but they're all focused on you gaining weight. If they don't see steady weight gain, they won't stick around. Because I'm not willing to sell my health (just get stoned and munch aggressively on cam occasionally), they don't like me. They were pretty entertaining when I was pregnant though- paid for expensive Las Vegas buffets and such, I just sent them phone snapshots of whatever junk food I was eating at the time and they'd ramble about how fat I must be getting.

There's a few controversial ones I'm hesitant to mention, because they always cause fights (I've even been blocked by other coworkers simply for mentioning I'd done them before). I'll be honest- I'm an equal opportunity dominatrix. I believe that anyone has the right to be made fun of for anything they wish, and evidently very few in the industry feel that way. I have a small cache of religious fetishists of various kinds. I always verify that there's an excellent chance that they're of that religion or raised that way, ask a million questions, do some research, then wing it. They send crazy offensive props that are always hard to explain to guests that run across them though."

"When I was 14, we lived in a 2-story apartment. I lived on the top floor, and the stairs to get up are really loud, One time I heard banging coming up the stairs so I assumed it was my dad. At the time we had no other neighbors on this floor. Just to be sure I checked through the peep hole to see if I could get the door for him. Looking through I saw a man in a ski-mask, looking down at the door knob. It was summer and this happened in Texas, so this man was up to nothing good. I stumbled back from the door and grabbed my phone. I heard the door being forced open. I ran into the bathroom and locked the door, with my phone and quickly dialed 911. I heard a lot of banging in the next room, and glass shattering. After maybe 5 minutes a officer came. The man was long gone, However he broke a flat screen TV, 2 glass tables, family portraits, and our sliding door. Outside on the patio, the police found a crowbar. The man hasn't surfaced since."

"Cowboy Bebop has arguably one of the best thematic outlines of any show in its opening episode (not sure if it is the pilot but the first episode is the best opening episode I've seen).

The [opening credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6zDfxZ4NcE) were fucking amazing, pause the opening anywhere and you have a good background picture. I love jazz, so that helped. The story itself is enticing and the audience gets a great display of the relationship between Spike and Jet.

While we were beginning the search for a project manager, one of my developers told me, confidentially, that he'd be leaving to go to grad school in a few months. He hadn't yet told anyone else but wanted to give me a heads up as early as possible (which I greatly appreciated).

I immediately started putting my efforts toward finding a replacement developer, which made everyone on the staff think I was totally wrongheaded in my priorities (because they all knew we needed another PM). But that was only because they didn't know this guy was leaving, and I wasn't in a position to explain why I was hiring another developer (without betraying his trust in me)."

The claim of hypocrisy when used against someone taking a idealist stand only serves to grind down action into worried handwringing.

"When I used to move furniture, I went to a two story house that had been in a fire. The fire didn't do too much damage to the house but the owner did not stay there. The owner was a old man and must of had a lot of pets because there were leases and little bells that are on cat collars everywhere in the house. During my breaks my co worker(he's hispanic and we will call him Bob) and I would mess around since there was no one around beside us. There was a piano that was in the middle of the living room that we would mess around with and every time we played around with it, the piano would consistently play two notes. At first I thought it was rats or something cause there was a shit ton of their droppings everywhere but it was always the two same notes. Then other weird stuff started to happen, like loud noises in the house but the house would be completely empty besides Bob and me. I had doors slam infront of my face and no it was not windy or was a window open. I also had those bells that was littered everywhere get thrown at me while I was the only person in the room. There was a wooden board that was propping up the garage door motor at an angle and that board went the opposite way and almost hit Bob in the head while we were moving boxes in the garage.

"The French seem to have been very concerned about the pent up sexual urges of their citizens in far off lands. Between 1663 and 1673, the king of France/French government sent over 800 'filles du Roi' ('daughters' of the king) to Quebec to marry workers and soldiers who had previously been sent to the colony. The files du Roi weren't prostitutes though - they were usually young widows or orphans."

"Important to note here that neither the ancient Greeks nor the Romans had the concept of homosexuality as we know it today. Sex was just sex,  they saw 'gay sex' as being no different than hetero sex. Older men in power in each of these cultures would take young men under their wings and offer guidance in...all sorts of areas. But someone back then wouldn't think of this as homosexual, just a cultural norm.

Also, president and congressmen? I think you mean emperor and senators, and that's a dubious blanket statement to make anyway. Much of what we know about the sexual proclivities of Roman emperors was written by fierce critics, and thus are not to be completely trusted as objective sources.

And there weren't any kings in Rome until long after the fall of the Empire."

Driving at night for hours through woods, over mountains, i didn't see a single gas station, house, other drivers or any signs of civilisation - for hours. Radio didn't work, no music.

"When I was about 6 or 7 years old, my legs just stopped working. 

I remember waking up one day at my dad's apartment and not being able to get out of bed, because my legs wouldn't move. My dad thought I was fucking around so he pulled me off the bed and I just toppled. Couldn't get my legs to hold my weight or move at all. I don't remember if I could feel them, but I think I said they hurt? Don't remember.

Anyway, once I fell my dad took the situation way more seriously and got in touch with my mom. My memories are admittedly blurry, but we all wound up at the local urgent care. I was in a wheelchair and was learning how to maneuver it. Eventually I got X rays. My dad snapped at the person doing the X rays because she said ""keep your legs still"" and he thought she was being a smartass. Keep them still! Can't move them if I wanted to!

I don't remember what all happened after that, but they had me stay with my grandma. I had to shuffle around on my hands and butt since the wheelchair they had couldn't get through the carpet at her place. It sucked because she had stairs and I had to pull myself up one by one. For whatever reason, they didn't think to make me a bed on the couch downstairs or anything.

Anyway, after a couple weeks, my legs just started working again. It was slow going, but I found that I could flop them over the side of the bed. Then from there, I could support some of my weight. Eventually I was walking again. 

I have no idea what made my legs stop working or what had them working again. When I asked my parents about it, they just say the hospital had no idea. They just sent me home with a rented wheelchair and ""left it in god's hands."" It makes me worried, like I'm gonna wake up and have my legs not work anymore. What made it start, what made it end? No clue."

"I was a kid, so I didn't notice wider social issues. For me the two big things were the crowdedness and the consumerism.

I moved from an underdeveloped Third World country to a major European city, and fuck me it was *jammed*. You couldn't walk down the street without dodging people every few seconds. You couldn't see the sky without tall buildings in the way. You couldn't hear yourself think for music and people talking and cars and motorbikes zooming past. It was complete sensory overload.

And everyone cared what you were wearing and how your hair was cut and what backpack you were carrying to school. This stuff *mattered*. There were actual *brands of backpack* that were somehow 'better' than other brands. There were cuts of jeans that were somehow 'better' than other cuts. I was coming from a childhood where you wore whatever your parents came up with and carried whatever backpack was available in the barely-stocked local shop, and it never even occurred to anyone that there could be some arbitrary standard you were supposed to meet, beyond 'clean and doesn't have holes in it'.

It was completely bewildering.

ETA: I don't want to romanticise, it's not that the Third World country was some kind of paradise. It also took me a while to get used to that fact that, after I moved, we were allowed to talk about the government; grownups would even *say bad things* about the government, which was gobsmacking to me because in my childhood country that was an excellent way to get imprisoned/beaten up/thrown out of the country/killed. Also in the First World country people didn't routinely die of illnesses that can be cured with a few doses of medicine, or that can be prevented by clean water and vaccinations. Like I say, though, I was a kid, so that wasn't the stuff I noticed most."

"I once went to a regional burn (a Burning Man affiliated event, but much smaller). I had never done much camping before. I bought a tent, sleeping bag, bug spray, etc... and packed into my carpool for the several-hour drive up to Vermont.

What I _didn't_ pack was any sort of cushioning between me and the ground. I thought my sleeping bag would be enough. So I slept basically directly on the rocky, hard, rugged ground. I also learned that, despite the summer heat, the ground was very cold. While the burn itself was fun, sleeping was a miserable couple of nights :)

I learned, though! I later took a solo camping trip to some nearby islands, just to prove I could - this time, with an air mattress included in my camping gear. That went smoothly :)

First one, long distance relationship. His roommate kept telling me he was cheating with his ex but I knew his roommate had a massive crush on me. I figured he was just trying to break us up to have a chance. Nope. He sent me a video one day of my boyfriend's door, slowly cracking it open, he is furiously banging his ex. I dumped him. They got married less than a month later. I'm aware I was the side chick.


Second time, I was engaged to this dude for half a decade. My sister falls on hard times, I let her stay in my spare bedroom. Her and my SO get along super well.... too well. I fell asleep on the couch one night, I wake up and the two are cuddling in our bed... My sister left her phone unlocked and plugged in in the living room. It's full of texts between them about the nasty shit they did while I was working and at my college classes. I was also the only one of the three with a job. That was super.

Last time, dating a dude for like six months. Out of the blue one day, he tells me he's moving across the country soon and he will return in a year. He expects me to wait for him. I start probing to figure out why. Turns out he met a girl online willing to buy him a ticket out, let him live with her, and bang a bunch. Yeah. We did not continue dating.

As you walk into the bank you meet the cashier. A blonde haired, quirky young women in her early 20's. You ask ""Where do you think the most romantic diner is?"" she gives you her answer. It's a date. You swoon her with your intricate knowledge of Bucatini all'Amatriciana with Parmigiano. 

This is where things get interesting.

Midway through her sentence, cut her off. And show her the item of content. The Plug. This will intrigue her. 6 months later you have a child, and you gain her father's permission to marry. Through the years you will gain extensive knowledge of the bank. Using this new found knowledge you may break in at any time, but only after you use your current money to acquire a passport to go to Africa. This will come into play later. Create a bomb by using the WD40 and gunpowder laying on the shelf of your uncle's garage. On the day of your flight to Africa, go to the bank. Rob them of everything they have, as by now your wife has told you the codes and you use the spare key to the vault that was in the manager's room. When you return home to pack for your flight, but don't get on the plane. Instead, slip the bomb onto a passenger's luggage, wait for them to board the plane, activate the bomb which will blow the plane up while it is midair. Within the span of a month you will be confirmed dead. With your newfound money and freedom, buy a yacht and sail to the tropical islands near Hawaii. You can live your life from then on."

"I met a woman on OKcupid. She had three boys. 

We started dating, I moved in, we were together five years. It ended in January.

In the end, the kids were one of the biggest reasons for us going separate ways. It's very, very difficult being in that situation because you will inevitably end up a ""father figure"" to the kids, except you have no real ""father privileges"". The final call on any disciplinary issues is up to mom, because when it's all said and done, they weren't my kids. Lots of work and very frustrating. Also, living with three young boys is like living with a sentient tornado. There is no point cleaning anything, ever. You just have to wait for 18 years for the dust to settle.

Now that I'm single again, one of my criteria for a partner is no kids, or adult kids.

"Communism. 

I'm not being facetious, the extent to which I see people romanticizing an ideology that has murdered the most people in human history (particularly in the modern era), is fucking disturbing. 

Ask anyone who has lived through a communist regime. All those clever reddit-style quips of dissension? Forget it. At best you'll be interrogated, beaten &amp; jailed with no trial. Worst? Lined up against a wall and shot.

The confiscation of that private property during the revolution? Can you imagine soldiers showing up at your door, confiscating everything you worked hard to pay for, then just laughing as they leave? Kicked off your own land and told to go work in a factory or something?

Sometime during college he got into a fight with his gf and ended up killing her. It hit the news a few times that he was on the run and i always said there was no way that was the same guy i knew.

"I'm in the marine corps, not spooky in a supernatural way but in a I can't believe they're just going to let this slide way. One of the guys in my old unit was a quiet, keep to himself kind of guy, nice person but of course he got fucked with. After a while he had enough of it and explained to one of my friends that he had a "" stabbing list "", and you're the first one on it. He reports the incident, they file paperwork to process him out of the marine corps, after 6 months they just let it go. So there's a guy still on active duty with a clear mental issue, and I'm just kinda waiting to see him snap.

Edit:  I've never personally fucked with any of my marines from the time I joined until now, as I said, this was a friend doing this. I remember what it was like having some asshole mess with me when I was a boot just for that reason. I pride myself on treating everyone I came in contact with with respect. I've seen how people think by picking up rank they're no longer required to work and automatically think they're special. I've made it a point to work side by side my marines instead of kicking back and supervising. I've stood up for myself and others numerous times when our worthless chain of command try to push everyone, assuming they'll just take it and never speak for themselves knowing damn well their actions aren't justified. As I've said, many military members will always fuck with the new guy.  I don't necessarily agree with it because the only thing accomplished by that is having co workers who have no respect for you. I can't control what others do, but I guarantee any of the marines that worked with me will tell you good things because I worked right by their side and had them call me by name and not rank since I don't think most military norms actually work."

"I wondered this for the longest time as well! You know it's decentralized but then who manages who owns how many coins? The answer is (basically) that the people 'mining' are the ones who maintain that system.

The calculations aren't really part of the maintanance but instead a way of deciding which 'miner' actually does which part of maintaining the system. 

And for that process people who 'mine' get bitcoins for offering their hardware to help with the system. 

Also before you ask: if you try to mine on your normal computer you'd likely not gain more money that way than you spend on electricity. You'd need a more specialized set up for it to be efficient (but I haven't looked more into it than that) 

Now this is all so shallowly explained that it is almost wrong.... If you really wanna know type into Google (or Youtube) 'what is a blockchain' first and then ""how does bitcoin work"".

"Precisely,  it's not the custodial parents choice to deny child support to keep the noncustodial parent out of the child's life. The support is for the child, and the two - support v parenting time are independent except as far as calculating nights for the worksheet. At least in Indiana nights is a variable. 

What I don't know for certain is if a custodial parent denies parenting time that includes overnights does that effect the non custodial parent's child support. I mean I know in general this behavior results in a spanking from the judge to the custodial parent so I assume it wouldn't negatively affect the non custodial parent.

And yes, I know writing out custodial and non custodial parent is tedious and that the system does tend to be skewed to the mothers, but times are changing (and this is an entirely different can of worms). 

I just wish both parents in most of these situations would grow up and realize that they aren't really hurting each other with these type of antics (including demanding itemization of how the money is spent) but it's their kid or kids who suffer.

Then you just keep chugging away until the rest of your work reaches the level of that one brilliant nose, and you have another breakthrough where you feel you did a fantastic job shading a little part... and so on.

I have failed more at drawing than anything else in my life.  The more you fail, though, the more you learn how not to fail in that particular way again and over time you actually learn to succeed at things.  Keep going and don't get discouraged!  It's so worth it in the end."

" So we had gone to the rave that night in a big group, it was Jon's first time and so we made sure to pull out all of the stops (and all of the right ""party supplies"")

I had drove up to the rave in my own truck to meet up with everyone, so it wasn't that big of a deal when my other buddy said ""hey, it's taking a while to round up all the girls, could you just take Jon back in your truck?""  Which I only later realized was code for *Jon is weirding the fuck out of everyone and I don't want to deal with him anymore*

So anyways, Jon and I drive back to the house for the after party, we talk about this and that for the whole hour it takes before finally getting to the apparentment.

The first level of awkwardness: no one is back yet so we are locked out.

The second level of awkwardness: we go back to my truck and (between chewing on his binky) Jon decides to tell me that the *real* reason he joined the military was because he had raped his sister.

What the fuck dude?  What am I supposed to do with that?  Luckily a couple of squad cars (EDIT: yes cops, *that* is how awkward this was, cops rolling up on us while we were rolling balls was actually preferable to sitting with this dude) rolled up on us, interrupting the awkward-as fuck silence, but damn was that one awkward minute alone with him.  Our mutual friend pulled up shortly after the cops left

It's racist because it entirely dismisses my point for another issue that is focused to make my heritage be seen in a negative light, as if I'm of an inferior people and at fault for an injustice. You would never see the same people listen to people speak about doing something about domestic abuse against men interrupt stating men need to focus on the ""real problem"" of man-on-man crime.

I opened my eyes to a naked middle aged man basically straddling my face looking down at me, I jump up and he continues ""do you know that man??"" And I say my boyfriend?

I have a lot of friends with different opinions and I love them for who they are. A couple I can have those discussions with but often it drives people to not want to hang out with you. I like others points of views now and I like to try to understand why they have those beliefs. "

* Wear comfy shoes  
* Wear something with pockets  
* Bring some cash
* If you're female, wear a crossbody, small bag if you have to wear one at all.  
* Take a pic of the part of the lot you're in, which will be indicated on the signposts. 
* If it's general admission and you're not a big dancer/mosher, stand near the soundboard where the best sound is.  
* If there are mics set up near the soundboard, don't bump those mics or scream
* Dress for the weather.  If it's rainy, bring extra shoes/socks and leave them in the car.
* Buy merch even though it's overpriced, it will always remind you of the show!
* If it's a festival, bring toothpaste.  DO NOT ASSUME SOMEONE ELSE WILL BRING TOOTHPASTE.
* Don't listen to the band you're seeing on the ride up, it's bad luck.
* Always look for ground scores.
* Meet people!  Roam a little.
* Pee before the show starts.  There's nothing more terrible than having to wait in a bathroom line while the band is playing.
* If possible, sit up front on the car ride there.  That way, you will arrive there first, and first is best.
* Be on 100% phone charge when you leave the house.
* Keep snacks and water in the car for after the show!"

"There were two bloody gloves left at the murder scene, which are identical to limited-edition XL gloves OJ owned and had been pictured wearing on several occasions before the incident. During the trial, he was asked to put them on but they didn't fit, causing his defense attorney to famously say ""if the gloves don't fit, you must acquit."" There's many reasons why the gloves may not fit though, two main theories being that gloves shrink when they absorb liquid/blood, and the fact that OJ may have stopped taking his arthritis medicine to make his fingers swell up. Anyways, it became one of the key points of the trial that arguably led OJ to getting away with it. "
"Season 1 of ATLA is by far the weakest. Especially the first half of the season. You can definitely tell the creators are still trying to feel the show out and find the exact pacing. Not to mention that since the show is all about growth, all of the characters are at their least-likable at this point.

By the time you get to the Northern Water Tribe, it starts to feel a lot more fleshed out. And season 2 hits the ground running with *The Avatar State*. Season 2 still occasionally has some awkward and cringy moments, but is still very enjoyable. Then season 3 is borderline perfect, it contains almost all of my favorite episodes. ATLA definitely gets stronger with time. *The Great Divide* is simply the weakest episode of the weakest season."

The way I see it the cream is still going to rise to the top.  The best of the best aren't going to settle for being mediocre and getting a participation trophy - they are going to put in time and effort to be the best at what they do.  Participation trophies effectively give people that may not succeed at first some motivation to continue to pursue hobbies.

I get the impression a lot of people (moreso in older generations but still younger people too) think that the world is getting softer and that participation trophies water down competition.  Is there any field that has gotten particularly more watered down?  Sports are just as competitive as ever, art is just as good as ever, talented musicians are just as prevalent as ever."

"This may sound like a condescending suggestion, but I promise I'm not trying to be a jerk. I had the exact same problem  and this actually helped me get out of it a bit: Go down a reading level. If you usually read high-brow 'classics', go back to some old teenage pulpy fiction you used to like before you moved up. If you were more into stuff aimed at teenagers, pick up something you liked as a pre-teen or older kid. I was having that problem for years, thought I was just over reading for fun. Then one day I was cleaning my room and picked up an ancient copy of Matilda on my shelf from when I was like 12, thumbed through a couple pages out of boredom... and ended up reading the whole book by the end of the night.

"For a long time the hardest thing was not being pretty anymore. I mean, I was still pretty, but I was no longer the youngest and prettiest in the room. I was no longer able to make a real entrance. People no longer said, ""Who is that thin girl with the blue eyes and the short hair?"" In my thirties I became just one of the moms.

Then, groups of men stopped noticing me. First the ones in their twenties, then thirties, then forties, and as I bear down hard on sixty the group of men most liable to notice me are wearing WWII vet hats. I am dead serious about this.

It's hard to watch your body change shape. Hands, arms, legs, all different than they were--never, never to return. That beautiful young girl has vanished from the face of the earth.

Then my babies began to vanish. My boys, who longed for me to hold them, who snuggled next to me on the couch each night, went away. I felt relief. They were out with their friends, playing in a band, away at college, married. They have wrinkles, gray hair and 401K's. When I see them, they no longer sit next to me. I can no longer rub their hair, over and over; it just wouldn't feel right.

But next, a miracle. I had a grandson and loved him with a passion I never even felt with my own children. People had told me to expect this, but I didn't understand until I saw him....then I understood. But now he is out in the world, at the park, with his friends, and he no longer snuggles with me, because he's ten.

My joints hurt, my thumbs are quite arthritic, and I had an old lady fall this summer, shattering my arm. My mother is growing older and I know that she will grow truly old and ill and die someday. I know that for sure now. My career is stalled, but I do a very good job at what I do, and I find joy in my work and in my competence.

You know how they say you lose brain cells as you age? What a myth. I grow more and more wise, I learn new things every day, and one of my biggest fears is that I will die before I've read all of the books I want to read. But as I grow more wise, people want to hear what I say less and less. So I'm sitting back, taking it all in, letting the great world spin."

I didn't have as close an encounter. But I remember being on the back of my dad's motorcycle as we stopped in the middle of the road like thirty yards away and watched a big black bear pass in front of us to go down the mountain to the river. A very vulnerable position. Another time is was the entire family in the car and he stopped and stared at us lazily for a minute and then bumbled down to the river. Same area.

"Not me, my boyfriend. We were recently driving to town after a rain storm and the roads were still quit wet. Thankfully I was coming up on a turn and driving very slowly because a dog come bounding out of the bushes and straight into the road. I slammed my brakes on but slid because of the wet road. The dog was okay, nothing broken but had a bit of road rash and needed veterinary attention. We found the home of the owners and the shitty renters that had let the dog loose in the first place. I was freaking out and crying, we have two dogs of our own at home and all I could think about is what if it we my dog? 

Anyway, the renters that we watching the dog spoke in English to us but Portuguese on the phone to the owner of the dog telling two entirely different stories. Blaming us entirely and planning on extorting money from us for the vet bill. 

According to Massachusetts state law pets must be leashed and are the responsibility of the owner. There was nothing I could do to avoiding hitting the poor thing.

My boyfriend communicated this in Portuguese to the renter loud enough the landlord could hear on the other end. They didn't have much to say after that and last we saw they were loading the dog into the car to go to the vet.

tl:dr He hablas. "

"My wife and I have a few things:

1. She really likes it when I wink at her. She says it's like her way of knowing that I'm still attracted/infatuated with her. Which is crazy because of course I still am! It never ceases to make her smile. Doesn't matter what's going on, she instantly perks up like a little adorable child after I wink at her. So naturally, I wink at her at inappropriate times, just to get a rise out of her. Like when she's in the middle of a presentation for some organization we're volunteering with, or when she's in the middle of a conversation with someone else. I do it, and she just stops talking and starts grinning like a weirdo kid after their crush shared their lunch with them. It's adorable. 

2. Ironically, my wife cannot wink. Or rather...she can, but it takes all of the muscles in her face to wink. So it comes off as a super exaggerated cartoonish wink. It's hilarious. Also, yes this means that #1 doesn't work on me lol. 

3. The Pinky-Promise. Sure, most people know the pinky-promise. But we take it super serious. As in, if you break it, you sleep on the couch. Trust me, I've been there. 

4. I desperately want a dog, but our apartment doesn't allow them. So one day, my wife just randomly licked the side of my face (mimicking a dog's lick). She did it as a joke because I was complaining about not being able to adopt a pup. So now it's turned in to a game and we lick each other's faces at inappropriate times. It's weird, and our friends think we're crazy people. But whatev's, it works for us!

My initial thought was that maybe someone had killed a pregnant doe, and got these when cleaning the animal, but the box was on the roadside,  and they had been placed in a box and not just left or buried where they would have been found, and no sign of a dead deer around. Also, quadruplets would be very very rare in white tails.

"There's an old (like pre-internet old) cliché that ""real men don't eat quiche"". This always baffled me because quiche is ham and eggs in a pie crust. Literally ham and eggs pie. There should be nothing manlier.

Seriously though... the idea that men should only be eating Man Food like burgers and bloody steaks and never going near ""girly"" things like salad and vegetables is probably super-destructive, given that men are a lot more likely to die young from heart disease.

"I went through a brief period during which I convinced myself that everyone on the planet spoke English. 

The explanation of how I came to that conclusion is probably more confusing than the idea itself was, but the basic gist went as follows: A four-legged creature that goes ""Meow!"" is called a cat. ""El gato"" means ""the cat"" in Spanish. As such, a Spanish-speaking person would first need to learn the word ""cat,"" then learn ""el gato"" before they could converse about felines in their native tongue. English-speakers, on the other hand, only needed to learn the word ""cat,"" because in English, ""we actually say the words.""

That's a direct quote from my four-year-old self, incidentally.

In short, I had decided that every non-English language was just a needlessly complex set of code-words, and I couldn't understand why people would complicate their lives by learning them. I was finally shown the error in my logic after my mother found me standing on our deck, blowing raspberries at imaginary foreigners and shouting ""Everyone speaks our language!"" at the top of my lungs. Rather than scolding me for my apparent racism, she asked me *why* the animal in question was called a cat, and why ""cat"" was the ""actual word"" for it.

Just like that, I understood... but it would be years before I comprehended how I'd deluded myself in the first place.

"Sounds tough. Have you tried giving him feedback on this? I used to teach kids on the spectrum, and I noticed that I have to be pretty blunt with them about some of these social behaviors. I'd find myself saying things like ""You changed the topic. I'm confused because I thought we were still talking about x"" or ""I'm tired of talking about x, I want to talk about something else."" It felt really rude at first, but I found that most of my students really appreciated the feedback because they honestly had no idea how much they were talking.

I know it's completely different with a friend vs. a student, but maybe he never got this feedback as a kid. The way I see it, you wouldn't expect a child to ""just know"" how to read or do math. You teach them through concrete steps. With people on the spectrum, we often expect them to ""just know"" social skills when that's not how their brains work. The same instruction we give for math and reading is what many people on the spectrum need for social skills. The feedback still needs to be given in a kind, sensitive manner, but sometimes it really helps. "

"Hi team, I own a small ISP in New Zealand. Whilst we don't have the same number of intelligence agencies breathing down our necks we do have the GCSB. At a certain size of more than 4000 customers we are required to register and be able to provide provide port mirroring should a warrant be produced. In terms of interception capabilities that is the only requirement. We have to be able to turn around a mirroring request within a short time frame.

In regards to traffic management we try to keep everything as un filtered and un interrupted as possible.  We setup hand overs and cross connects to as many peers as possible to manage cost. I.e. we purchase a dedicated link to Netflix via megaport, dedicated links to caches and local data to relieve our usage on international.

In terms of filtering, I'm about to implement a firewall policy to get rid of  some nasty bugs such as Mirai bug that recently infected a bunch of routers and drowned our outbound with 600Mbps of telnet sessions.  This will simply block too many new connection states and filter that IP into a blacklist.

I firmly believe in net neutrality, but some traffic must be managed because there is alot of risk out there.  Also we work on the 10% rule, 10% of users are taking piss and their actions are affecting other customers to which they don't give a damn. Whether that is through inaction ( not protecting their own computers) or just general nefarious intent.

Obviously we a small ISP in NZ with only 10k clients and 17 staff, were owner operator and the owner is technical. But there is my .02c if comments were charged.

"But in the UK we have strong competition. If ISP1 decides to throttle speeds, all ISP2 has to do is not do that, and they win a load of business. Even if it's still going over the same BT-owned cables as a Layer 2 service to the ISP (though LLU could be done in the exchange), they're not allowed to interfere with that because they're contractually obliged to deliver the service the ISP are paying for. They don't do that, they get sued and lose instantly.

The amount of regulation regarding anti-competitive behaviour and consumer protection is why we don't have a set of networks in the UK on a par with the US. It why we don't have data caps, why we have faster speeds on average, and why we have cheaper prices.

Now there is a lot that can still be done; native FTTP coverage is shockingly low, and we need stronger competition with Openreach so they actually have to try to provide a half decent service. But the fact that I can vote with my feet and go elsewhere means ISPs have to step their game up."

EDIT: Evidently I lied a little, it would be more like 12.5 cm due to the frequency of the appliance being about 2.45GHz. I must have either misremembered what I was told or didn't fact check correctly. Likely both. 

Also it will start to melt at these intervals but given enough time the whole thing will melt as the heat transfers along the bar between those points."

"Posted this last time I saw one of these threads, people might like to hear it again. I am a biologist, and one of the perks of the job is being able to see some remote and spectacular places that people don't see very often. Part of my work involves collecting insects from remote waterholes out in the middle of Australia, a few hundred km north of Uluru. One of the ladies I work with, Alice, lives out there full time, spends a lot of time out bush and has spent a lot of time with the local aboriginal people, so she has a trove of stories and weird experiences. But I'll just tell you about the one I had. 

So, as I said, I visit a lot of waterholes out there. Being a very arid region, these waterholes hold great spiritual and cultural significance to the indigenous people. Most, if not all of them are sacred in some way, and they all have traditional stories attached to them. So, one day four of us headed out to this particular site, a full day of heavy four-wheel driving through the Finke Gorge. We get there not long before sun down, and as we pull up, there is a black dingo standing in the spot we are going to camp. He stares at us for a bit, then disappears off into the bush, as they do. This in itself isn't weird. Plenty of dingos out there and they come in a range of colours. Not that common to see a black one but they are around. So that's fine. We set up camp, have a nice night of looking for pythons and drinking wine (yep, biologists). We slept in swags - kind of like a skinny, short tent that just fits a sleeping bag, and sometimes has a little fold up netting bit so you can sit up in there. It was really windy that night, so that drowned out the potential for quiet spooky noises, and I went to sleep pretty quickly. That night I had a really vivid dream about the black dingo coming in to camp, sniffing around my swag and scratching at the netting trying to get in. It bothered me, and I woke up, but went back to sleep pretty soon after. Still, not so weird. We woke up in the morning, did our sampling, packed up camp and started off on the long drive back to town. After we have been driving for a bit, Alice starts talking about how seeing the black dingo at the campsite when we got there really freaked her out. She didn't say anything earlier because she didn't want us to be spooked. Turns out that in the traditional folklore, that waterhole is protected by a black dingo spirit. The last time Alice camped there with other people, one of them had a dream that a black dingo came up to their swag, and started attacking her. This lady woke up with long, deep scratches all over her face, and no reasonable explanation for them. I had no idea of this story before I had the dream, and didn't mention it to anyone that morning... There is definitely a special feeling to a lot of these places. Very hard to describe. When you are out in this country, these kinds of weird semi-spiritual coincidences are common place. I have some more stories, but I'm typing on my phone and my thumbs are sore!"

"I could post stories about living in an alleged haunted house, but one thing that really sticks out were these recurring nightmares that I had as a kid. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about them 20+ years later.

One was of this dog/wolf with fiery red eyes. I could tell when it was about to show up in my dreams. It usually happened when I'd enter a room and everyone disappeared. Then it would stare me down -- once it was sitting on a bed, another time it was at the back of our old barn, and another time it was at the bottom of a staircase. I would turn to run and make about three steps before it pinned me to the floor. It would threaten me with this dry voice that sounded like burning leaves. The last time I dreamed about it -- I was probably 5 at the time -- I remembered that it said, ""You think you can get rid of me that easily?! You can't! I'll always find you."" (We had just moved from our allegedly haunted house in the country to one in town.) It got to the point where I'd beg and plea my parents to let me stay up. I remember that I cried when my dad wished me ""sweet dreams"" before going to bed.

Another recurring one was of a lady in white that would stare up to my second-floor bedroom window. I always had this dream when it was storming and around the same age as when I'd get the nightmares about the dog. This one was more like a camera's perspective. I knew that I was in bed sleeping, but it was like watching a camera pan over our farmhouse during a torrential rain. Lightning flashes. Thunder claps. And there she is standing in our gravel driveway. She's wearing a lacy white dress, but it's stained with mud from the raindrops hitting the gravel. Her skin is paper white. I can't see her face though. But she's staring up at my window. Right before I wake up, there would be a voice drumming the same line over and over about her being a witch. It seemed like a warning, but it was just like ""Look out for the witch. She's a witch. A witch. Witch. Witch. Witch. Witch. WITCH. WITCH. WITCH!."" 

Like I know it's a stupid dream, but there are sometimes where I wonder if my 1 1/2-year-old daughter has similar dreams. She sometimes wakes up screaming, and I need to go talk to her to calm her down. I just hope that when she's older that she can talk to me if she has those kind of dreams instead of internalizing them like I did.

"Highly qualified candidate referred by an existing director.  He's kind of a shoe in, so we - several senior technical folks and managers -
 decide to just panel interview him figuring it was mostly a done deal.  We all get to the interview room and look at his resume.  On his hobbies he has ""Boy Scout Troop Leader, something, something, pillowing, something.""

We all were confused about what pillowing was.  He gets in the interview and the first question asked was ""So, we're all wondering what 'pillowing' is?""  Him: ""Oh.  Having sex!""

"I'm guessing if net neutrality is rolled back, Google will win their legal battles and get to put down fiber optic lines. And I think then AT&amp;T and Comcast and 
the likes will be done for. 

The whole argument for repealing net neutrality is to make the internet a more competitive business friendly market. Which would unclassify the infrastructure as a public utility, and then there would be no legal recourse to stop google from laying new lines, or protecting regional monopolies. Lines that would be faster and quite possibly unthrottled would become a profitable enterprise for companies like Google. And it would incentivize research into cheaper and better alternative internet infrastructures, like better Wi-Fi and satalites. 

I'd be willing to bet that if Net neutrality is rolled back some States would probably build their own fiber optic network too, and sell access to it to ISPs. Or just write their own state laws that regulate how ISPs are allowed to function within their State. I don't think either of those options would violate the DCC(Dormant Commerce Clause) . 

These ISPs need to get with the times, or they're going to die either way. No one is going back to cable TV. No one wants internet service where they can't watch as much HD Netflix as they want.

"Whenever I have to deal with this, because DEAR GOD I DON'T GIVE A FLYING FUCK ABOUT YOUR ""MOTHERS AGAINST VACCINES CAMPAIGN"", YOU'RE MOST DEFINITELY THE AUTISTIC ONES, I do one of two things:


1.

If it has a mailbox, I shove them in there too. If there is no physical place to go to, but instead an email address or phone number, I make fliers like [this](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/08b4XaR) (though I attempt to make them look more legit) and distribute them to as many people as possible across the internet, my surrounding neighborhoods, etc., and then let them suffer their own bullshit. Also, I spam their email.


2. I wipe the flier off in view of a police car down the road or take it to them at the station myself. One time I got into a big argument with a cop for it, but I reminded him that our town, as well as several surrounding ones, have laws in place declaring the disposal of papers on another person's personal property (be it land or a vehicle) is considered littering and trespassing, thus being subject to both fines and it's his job to enforce that when he sees an entire street lined with cars with shitty bright blue fliers on them, not mine.

Or you get a job in an unrelated field, then you are out of aerospace for a little while and prospects tank even more. "

As a logical Christian, I can appreciate a lot of the Bible for it's stories and underlying ""be good to others"" elements, but I can also recognize that, not only was it written in a different time, we don't actually know what was originally written and need to take it with a grain of salt just as much as we would anything else.

It's easy to get short-lived hate.  Sure, the people who actually know the victim of whatever horrific thing you do will hate you for a long time, but everyone else?  They'll forget about it until there's a TIL a few years later.

No, if you want real hate, *enduring* hate, you have to do more.  It won't be easy, it won't be fast, but you can do it.  First you need to be charismatic.  You need to come up with a political ideology that had widespread appeal.  You need power.  And with that power, you need to abuse the hell out of your citizens, preferably behind closed doors and in hidden facilities.  It can only get out after years, *decades* of wholesale abuse and slaughter.  We're talking millions of deaths at your hands and millions more traumatized for life.  At that point you'll know true hate.  The kind of hate that people talk about for *generations.*"

"Copypastaing my response to a similar comment:

There are two different types of glass used in cars: annealed glass, and tempered glass. Annealed glass is what people are more familiar with; when it breaks, it breaks into a few big pieces. This is used in the windshield, along with plastic. Annealed glass is used in windshields so that a crack or break in one place won't ruin the entire windshield and block your vision. The side windows, on the other hand, are tempered glass. Tempered glass is specially treated to be incredibly hard to crack, but if it does crack, the whole thing explodes. In fact, you can take a hammer to the middle of a car window, and the hammer will just bounce off the glass. But if you hot the edge of the glass with the hammer, the entire window would shatter into thousands of tiny pieces with relatively dull edges. So **TL;DR** if you need to break your way out of a car, hit the edge of a side window, and the entire window should shatter

"When in the RAF I was based at Scampton, this was the base where the Dambusters raid was launched from and a Bomber Command airfield during the war. I was on Guard Duty one night and had a phone call around 2am about noises coming from one of the hangars. Sent a guard to investigate, he radios back and says he can hear voices mumbling and what sounds like machinery operating and tools clanging etc etc. I got out the keys to the Hangar and on driving up sure enough there were such noises going on and the occasional flickering light. We called in the RAF Police Dogs but the landshark refused to go in, this highly trained attack dog lay down, whimpered and refused to listen to its handler. I went in with the guard and the RAF Policeman and can only describe the feeling on entering the hangar floor as being surrounded in a cold fog that you couldn't see and a real feeling of dread, there was a real feeling of unhappiness in the place. I have never felt like that since, nor do I ever want to. We hightailed it out as it was secure and there was clearly no one there. Found out about a year or so later, when speaking to some visiting Bomber Command veterans, that it was a hangar used in the war for battle repairs on the damaged aircraft and sometimes where aircraft which had crew members killed in them, and sometimes it took some time to either extract their bodies or gather up the bits, would be taken to be cleaned. 

I have been back to Scampton since but I give that hangar a very wide berth."

"If he is doing this it means he has done it to others before. Likely a lot of others. Not many people getting up from the dead anymore. This means he is good at a lot of games. Like a lot a lot of games. All these clever ideas? If you can think of it in all likelihood someone better than you tried it already and they are still dead. Even the games that seem like they would be chance he probably has some sort of edge on you (depending on your view of death he might know your entire life story and can basically predict anything you would guess).

With all that in mind I would go for tic tac toe. It is a solved game that I would be able to remember the solution to it. You never have to lose and will likely always draw as Death will play perfectly as well. As long as Death doesn't have some rule on drawing you could go forever or until he lets you go (though don't expect the offer of a game next time).

TLDR: Tic Tac Toe - Never have to lose it even if you never win it"

"The problem isn't what he was attracted to.  The problem is that increasing demand for those kinds of videos victimizes children.

Child porn is almost *never* two similarly-aged kids.  It's most frequently an underage kid and an adult exploiting them.

Your argument also hinges on the fact that the kids in the video are able to give adequate consent.  Can a 15-year-old have a consensual sexual relationship?  Maybe.  How about a 14-year-old?  13?  10?  Where do you say ""nah, man, that shit's wrong""?  What happens as the owner of those videos ages?

Is it OK for an 11-year-old kid who just discovered masturbation to watch a skin flick starring a 9-year-old kid?

If we're going to say that child porn is okay to own for people who are ""close"" in age, you would also have to be okay with companies *producing content* for that market, and the production of this content is the key to the judgment here.

Add to that that everyone *knows* child porn is illegal and you have someone who willingly risked his freedoms by pursuing those videos.

That said, the kid did have more than videos with 14/15 year old kids.  That was just the majority of what I found.  And I have *no* idea what was on his computer when he was later arrested."
"In my experience of heavy truck drivers in NZ there is a high turnaround due to overwork, exhaustion, and being treated like cattle (70 hour weeks enforced whenever or you're in contract breach or no hours). Some sectors are very competitive within themselves - to get on site first, to deliver to most loads, to get the ""best"" payload. This is a real issue in logging and drivers often bounce between companies because they get so mad at one that they leave, but they don't have anything else to fall back on. Trucker rage is not pretty - I've seen fights, logs all over roads, trucks down ravines, air rescue...

Truck driving is stressful, doesn't pay that well (unless you own the truck), means early starts, sometimes being away from family, and all this to be treated like a non person.

My dad liked to go all out for it. Giant whole front yard spiderweb, smoke, strobe lights, the works. 

Well one year I wanted to stay on the porch with him instead of trick or treating. He said I had to be scary, so my mom made me a velociraptor from Jurassic park. I scared the crap out of kids that night and I barely had to move a muscle and growl a few times.

About an hour into it this big group of tweens rounded the corner and stopped dead in their tracks when they saw me chained to the porch. They all started arguing about going up or not and then one of the boys shoved his younger brother up the path.

Little power ranger didn't want to do it but he tried his best to try and sneak up the sidewalk. Past the bloody cauldron with the skull bobbing in the water. Past the piles of ribs on the steps. He stopped short a few feet of me and stood on his tiptoes to look for the candy bowl by the front door behind me. Then back to me straining against my chain, my mask's fluorescent painted eyes glowing in the blacklight. Back to his brother and all his friends.

I got ready to growl when the little guy lashed out with his power ranger sword and made a mad dash for the candy bowl and ran back down the path with the giant handful of goodies back to his cheering brother. 

That 7 year old kid was terrified but he learned to be brave and that's why I love halloween."

"I didn't get bullied, luckily, but for a year my brother did. My brother is three years younger than me, so for someone even older than me to be picking on him, is unacceptable. One day this asshole steals his bike, at a time when he knew I wasn't around (he was a coward, it's not that I'm some tough guy), and throws it off a bridge. We didn't have much money. My brother loved that bike. It wasn't going to get replaced (don't worry I replaced it). 

So I decided that enough was a enough, I hadn't turned 18 yet so short of killing him very little was off the table in regards to retribution. My friends and I are blazing in the back yard, trying to decide what we want to do about it as well as which party to go to that night (end of senior year), when I notice a giant can of pink house paint that's just been sitting under our deck for years. 

It all clicks.

Douchebag LOVES his shitty honda, he parks it in his moms driveway, allllll the way in the back, hidden from street view, near the back of her yard. Which is a block away and you can creep into his backyard from the back alley (we knew this because another friend lives next door) and this secret exit/entrance is right next to his car. 

So we wait until said friend reports back with the intel that doucherat and his mom have gone out for the night. 

I go up there with the paint, a cinder block, and two friends, creep in, stand on the roof of his car, dump the paint down his windshield (taking proper care to make sure it realllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyy got all up in there under the hood and into the ac and shit), and then drop a cinderblock on the back windshield, and kick in his sunroof. The cinder block set off the car alarm, and so we got the fuck out of there real fast and then watched with glee from our friends room as he came home and had a fucking breakdown. 

Anyway, few years go by, I'm back from college and run into him at a bar. No big deal, basically ignore one another until one of my female friends comes back from the bar like ""douchebag grabbed my ass"" I'm like lol, guess he's still a huge piece of shit. A few minutes later I'm at the bar, and he starts trying to be all buddy buddy and like ""hey good to see someone from the hood, hey bartender get this guy a drink on me, we grew up together"" that kind of shit. So he buys me the drink, we go to take the shot and I don't know why, but right afterwards I ask him if he remembers my stealing my brothers bike. He says no. I'm like ""that's pretty funny because I'm *sure* you remember your car getting destroyed."" He's like ya...that sucked. And I tell him. And then I bought him a shot and like a total badass said ""don't ever fuck with my family again"" and walked away. Never saw him again.

just kidding he tried to fight me in the parking lot and the cops came. "
"In high school, I was a staff member at the local Y. During the school year I was assigned to the after-school program,  so basically a babysitter. Now I have a very small frame,  but I was a runner and had very strong legs. 

We had a kid named Josh that was the bully. He was always yelling at someone and threatening kids. The parents had been talked to numerous times but the kid clearly was never punished. 

One day, the kid was yelling at a set of 3 brothers. I had had a bad day and I was done with this kids bullshit.  I told Josh to sit down in a specific chair as it was timeout time. My boss watched this and looked rather amused. Josh was a big boy easily weighing almost twice what I did. Josh looked at me and said, 'Make me. ' My boss just watches wondering what will happen. So I ask Josh if he is sure if that is what he wants and tell him he would be better off just sitting down. Josh insists that I make him. OK. I walk up and quickly bend at my waist,  hitting Josh at his waist with my shoulder. I easily pick him up, walking with him over my shoulder, and nicely place him in the chair. I tell him he needs to sit quietly for 10 minutes and then he can play again. 

The mother of the 3 brothers had been just coming down the hall and had seen me pick up Josh so she was quite concerned. My boss first talked to her and then took me in his office. 

I sat down and told me with the best straight face he could muster to just nod occasionally and look serious. The mother was watching so we had to make this look good. He said that as long as I never hurt Josh, I was free to put Josh in timeout. He was just flabbergasted that my waifish frame was capable of such an action. He continued to ramble for a bit until he felt like it had been enough time, then told me to look as if I had just been admonished, and go back to the kids. 

Josh started laughing as soon as I came out of the office. The mother had left the room at this point and that was all my boss cared about. Bossman told Josh to shut up or he would have me pick him up again. 

From then on, I was always assigned to the activities that Josh picked. He only needed a timeout once more in the time I worked there. He went willingly and without complaint. Turns out bullies don't like being manhandled by waifs. Go figure. "

"Amway.

Or any MLM, really, but most MLMs are pretty obviously scams -- Amway seems above-board. Their CEO owns the Orlando Magic, Orlando's arena is called the Amway Center, they advertise during NFL games. They sell a crapton of products, so it doesn't seem as MLMy as businesses based exclusively around selling makeup or knives or whatever else your empty-nest aunt or that guy that majored in 'General Studies' is peddling on Facebook now.

Setting aside how good their products may or may not be (the sellers make grandiose claims, but I also haven't heard anything about them being particularly awful, so let's assume they're average products), the company is a cult. It might not be a cult from the very top down, but it's a cult at the level of the actual person-to-person interactions.

When you're recruited into Amway with promises of wealth and financial freedom, you're immediately pressured into trying to recruit your friends and family members too: after all, shouldn't you want them to be as wealthy as you're going to be? And then those that don't join you... well, you wouldn't want them standing in your way, would you? You should distance yourself from them -- but don't worry, we're here to be your friends instead! Amway is your family! We take vacations together and write them off as business expenses! Just don't ever doubt Amway, or else your upline will have to stage an intervention and give you a serious talk. Also, know that if you leave Amway, these ""friendships"" die, too.

Sorry, I got off track. None of that really has to do with it being a scam -- a legitimate business could be a cult, and scams exist without that cult-like following. Amway just hides the extent to which they're a scam by fostering a cult-like religious devotion that prevents people from listening to any doubts either internally or externally.

It's a scam because the average distributor makes only $183 per month, [according to Amway's own disclosures](https://www.amway.com/en/ResourceCenterDocuments/Visitor/ops-amw-gde-v-en--BusinessReferenceGuide.pdf). Something like 1% of people who join Amway ever make enough to even have a lower-middle class lifestyle. That's a tiny amount for a business that promises to make you wealthy, but it also ignores that distributors likely spend *far* more than that each month on Amway's own products. My aunt and uncle each would drink 3 cans of Amway's energy drink per day: that's a 12-pack every two days, and a 12-pack costs $24 or something. That's $360 a month on those drinks alone, and they also buy the vitamins, the laundry detergent, the make-up -- I bet they were easily spending $1000/month on Amway products while living on welfare. But because they had Amway and were convinced it was going to make them rich, they didn't pursue real employment -- it would just get in the way of ""building the business"".

And that only scratches the surface of what I saw. I also saw people that would have entire garages filled with Amway inventory they planned to eventually sell because buying it got them ""points"" toward the next Amway bonus or pin level -- ignoring the fact that the bonus was worth far less than what they spent on the products they'd never be able to sell. I've seen people that could barely afford to eat or pay their mortgage pay hundreds of dollars for books and tape sets written by the tiny number of Amway millionaires that found their way to the top to teach them how they could be millionaries, too. And I've seen those very same millionaires get on stage, talk to these poor people who how much they love them and want them to be wealthy as well to inspire them, all while accepting millions of dollars from those same people.

It's a disgusting scam that preys on the hopeful and monetizes the relationships they've spent their lives building.

"I had to help my gf at the time finish making some things for my birthday party (lol?), wicked hungover from the night before. She asks me if I'd rather do the party another day, and I'm like fuck yes that sounds great, I feel like I'm dying. She goes super cold, and I can tell that she is righteously angry. I wanted to escape the wrath that I felt impending, so I suggested that we go anyway. We load the car up; about 80 bucks of booze as well as 20 bucks of snacks. She's drives, and right as we pull out (heh) she lets her inner road rage demon out. I'm talking 50 in a 25 then a 90 in a 55. This is about 1hr drive at 55mph, so I'm in it to win it if I commit to **going to my own party**.

So, she stops the car and asks me if I thought she was being crazy and making a big deal out of it. I am stupefied by this question and say nothing. She promptly gets out of the car and lays down in the middle of the highway in the path of oncoming traffic. Clearly, this is not a position you should leave your loved ones to experiment with, so I got out of the car and convinced her to drive us home. Her road rage demon had not yet been tamed so once again we drove home at the speed of sound.

When we get home, she locks herself in the bathroom and begins cutting herself. This is not good for anybody. After half an hour, I manage to talk her out of there, and then she is bawling in my arms that she ruined my birthday. I tell her it's fine, and that my birthday was good as long as she was there to spend it with me. We go to bed and the next morning, we awaken to discover that her car had been broken into, and everything was missing.

Arrest didn't necessarily mean death but being send to a Gulag. But there are also reports that he strangled those who resisted the rape and buried them in his rose garden.

"I worked at an Ace Hardware for 8 miserable, soul sucking years. When I first started, there was a manager there. This manager claimed that when he was younger, he was the, ""highest ranking civilian in the United States military."" (WTF? That makes no sense... I know...)

His story went like this:

When he was 18-ish, he lived next to a military base in Georgia. Him and his genius friends got the bright idea to sneak onto the base. Shortly after, his friends turned back. Of course he got caught, but they were shocked how far into the base he was able to infiltrate. From then on, they sent him all over the world as a covert agent to exploit the weak points in base security to fix them.

Years later, he was working at Walmart (before it was huge) and some guys in suits come into the store. His name came up in some files and they came to find out what his involvement was. He told his story and they didn't believe him. He then took them to the office inside the store and hacked into the pentagons computer system to prove his identity. (YEAH RIGHT BRO!!! 😂)

About 2 hours after he told me that story, he paged me up to the office because he had too many windows open on the computer and didn't know how to close them. Hacked into the pentagon? MY ASS!!!

In conclusion, Retail has some DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS!!!

As far as I know, the school allowed choice for a few years but the amount choosing French was too low to have a class every year so they just took away the choice. Nobody ever complained or raised an issue about it the random assignment, though, at least as far as I know. 

Edit: This was also a very rural area where a significant amount of the students didn't go to college. People got married and had families very young (several mostly female students dropped out of school when I was there to get married). Most people either pursued a trade, joined the military or worked on their family farm or business. I would guess that the reason they didn't object to being put in a French class when they would have chosen Spanish if they could was because they knew they weren't ever going to use it to get into college anyway.

"Dude, if you haven't yet, read the books. If you can stomach it, also the Silmarillion.

They add such a great depth to the movies that they did reasonably well to stay true to. Like - why the fuck would this old wizard be friends with the *king of the damn eagles*?

It's because the eagles (esp Thorondor, who preceded the eagle in LOTR) were specifically sent by the Valar to guard over the elves in middle earth. Gandalf was a Maiar (think a guiding angel) who was also sent to middle earth to help and guide everyone.

Or shit! Why does that little phial that Frodo gets from Galadriel in the forest do *anything*? It's because it's light from the star Eärendil - so named for a Man (as in, *not* an elf) who got a goddamned Silmaril and went to Valinor to plead the case for the suffering of elves due to Morgoth's influence. After he did that he wasn't allowed to go back, so he sailed in to the frickin sky and became a star. The star that you see is literally the light of the Silmaril. So when Frodo receives 'the light of Aerindel', he has literally been given the light of the great trees, which the Silmarils were crafted out of. He has a superweapon that had controlled the fate of the elves for 3000 goddamned years - or more.

"This actually reminded me of a wholesome dream I had last year. I think we all deserve a wholesome story. My aunt and grandfather both died last spring. It was the first deaths I had ever faced and they hurt bad. But one night I had a dream. I was sitting in a living room and my aunt was there, she didn't say anything, but she was there. So was my grandfather. He looked at me and said ""Hey there daddy-o"". Now, I had never heard him say that in his life, but seeing as he was In his mid to late 80s when he died, I figured it was something he would have said when he was younger. And perhaps I'm reading too much into that, but it just makes me think that he's happy and healthy now."

"Most TV shows depict the children and their friends from school as their main group and the siblings as tertiary side characters that are usually antagonistic, either because they're younger and bratty or older and condescending. In many families I've known (as well as my own), siblings were more a part of each others' lives than community peers, so they should be the ""secondary characters"" not the ""tertiary characters.""  
Siblings don't even have to ""get along"" in a TV show to portray the fact that they're a big part of each others' lives. I think The Simpsons does an okay job in showing that Bart and Lisa's relationship has more of an effect on their lives than, say, Bart and Milhouse's.  
But I do agree with you that I love the fact that the Belcher kids *do* get along. They rely on each other. They take part in each others' schemes and goals. They go trick-or-treating together. While other shows might feature a plot line of ""me and my two friends from school vs. my mean older sister,"" Bob's Burgers features plotlines like ""me and my brother and sister vs. other neighborhood kids.""

Loved almost every other museum around.  Hell I thought the Eiffel Tower was cheesy before ever going and even that blew me away.  It looks much cooler in person than any photo or video.  Montmartre was awesome, the smaller districts are amazing, the local hangout spots and fantastic and the cobble stone streets I could get lost on forever.  Most of France is spectacular but Paris is definitely a destination.

I don't know or remember what the cop said, but apparently he found it hilarious. "

"My boyfriend constantly gets to the door of either the house, or his car, and *then* digs his keys out of his pocket.   Even at night.

As a woman, I will *never* be fumbling for my keys, in the dark, in a parking lot or at the door of my house.  I will *always* have them in hand, ready to open the door immediately.

It's just too risky to be standing around a locked door at night fumbling for keys."

"The things Joel Osteen preaches, aka the Prosperity Gospel, goes against the core message of Christianity which is that God is full of grace and mercy to be willing to sacrifice himself/his son for the sake of mankind. 

Instead, Osteen focuses on how a person can use God to make their life better. Which isn't a problem preaching your own thing, but the problem is that he isn't preaching what the Bible teaches. His ""Christianity"" is not the same ideology written in the Bible. He, like a lot of Christians, take out random verses from the Bible out of context and twist them into motivational messages. The idea of believing in God for the sake of going to heaven and having a life full of prosperity and wealth. He is abusing the guise of Christianity and taking advantage of people who want to hear that God = money, rather than understand that the Bible addresses that though there is suffering in the life of a Christian, that hope in Jesus is sufficient to endure. 

So it falls into two camps. Christians don't like him because he's essentially misleading people from the true message of the gospel, which is the hope and faith in Jesus. Many non-Christians don't like him because he's essentially perpetuating the self righteous idea of ""I believe in God therefore I'm better than you and bound for more success""

"Honestly, the whole ""did you just assume my gender???"" and ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" jokes being more popular than the actual issues they mock is pretty demoralizing. Transgender people already have an uphill battle in being taken seriously and not just as a mental disorder or attention seeker. And while I can't speak for the Transgender community, I'm sure most women in a male-dominated community or hobby (reddit, video games, STEM fields, etc) hate walking that line of not wanting to draw attention but also wanting to call out things that affect them. So seeing those jokes commonly on here already makes you feel like the odds are against you if you ever do want to say some thing meaningful. 

I mean, I get they're jokes, I laugh at variants of them, but usually when it's within the community. I just wish people would ask themselves more if it's ""punching up"" or down humor before they hit Send instead of just thinking of the karma."

"Lots of stuff in Guyanese folklore!

Bacoo: A small creature that is released upon the opening of old bottles, similar to a genie. When awakened, he hunts you down and... throws stones at your windows. In the middle of the night. That's it. He lives off bananas and milk, and legend has it that if he is satisfied, he will answer any question you ask. Fun fact, in many rivers near Guyanese villages there have a large number of bottles found discarded at the bottom; it turns out lots of the villagers threw out the bottles out of fear of these things.

Moongazer: an extremely tall humanoid that only comes out at night. When he comes out, he goes into the middle of the forest and... stares at the moon. Until dawn, when he disappears. That's it. He may also kill small children. These guys are especially creepy in Guyana, considering there are many tall trees around, and children often see a moongazer hiding among them.

Old higue: This is monster that, by day, disguises herself as an old lady and lives in your village. By night, she turns into a *FREAKING BALL OF FIRE* and devours newborn babies. According to legend, she was defeated by a group of children who set a trap under newborn baby. The pour a gigantic handful of rice under the baby. When the old higue flies in, she is forced to count the grains of rice for some unknown reason. If she loses count, she has to start over. She loses count frequently and soon, the dawn arrives and all the children run in and beat her to death with broomsticks. 

Guyanese people are weird. Coming from one, btw. "

"Women are healthier, safer (esp. work and crime related), better educated, and effectively control more money (women spend men's earnings more than the reverse). In most Western countries, their quality of life is higher.

Additionally, women benefit from legal biases in sentencing (gender bias is greater even than the notorious race bias), alimony, and custody. Women have reproductive rights; men have none. Domestic violence laws often exclude or even punish male victims.

Cultural prejudices include finding unsuccessful men worthless. (For example, caring more about women in poverty than men). Men have to earn value.

Since the whole show and speech really captivated me, I stood at the edge of my seat awaiting the reveal. Then the next slide was projected on the wall, and...

There it was. The funniest picture my 12yo self ever saw. Thinking it was a joke, I bursted out in laughter. Then I realized that nobody else did.

I think she made the right choice. I've thought about looking him up to see if he ever got over it, but I suspect that what I find will ruin my day."

The one without oxygen was more maroon than red. Not totally purple or anything, obviously, but noticeably darker. Some kids still didn't believe it.

"In no particular order:
- Stretch and exercise now. Not to ""save"" your body for later. Just so you'll get used to doing it in your mid 30s. When you actually have to do it. Ever wonder why every TV and movie character exercises? Because they have to. When you get older, you HAVE to exercise or your body just...stops. It doesn't have to be big. 35-50 pushups or situps a day, and some mild walking will get you through just fine. Personally I prefer the Kettlebell. 

- There's going to be a point where you're listening to something loud, and you hear this odd static noise in one of your ears. Congratulations! You have hearing damage from years of listening to loud things. From this point forward, you really should listen to things at a reasonable volume. Because sooner rather than later, you'll be back to listening at max volume just to hear anything. 

- I love smoking. And the craving absolutely never goes away. Even years after you quit. Don't smoke. 

- Eventually, drinking beer will make you feel gassy and bloated instead of free and happy. If you're in your late 20's, learn to enjoy sipping a good scotch. If you're in your 30's, learn to enjoy wine. If you're just done with alcohol, find a good MDMA dealer and do it no more than 4 times a year. 

- The screen is not a lower resolution than it was yesterday. You've gotten ever so slightly more blind. Almost overnight! Enjoy your new glasses! They cost $400, and scratch when you look at them funny. 

- If you eat a whole pizza, you're going to have a bad time. 

- That's not dandruff. It's gray hair. It's brought on by age, genetics, and stress! Like the stress you're feeling right now about having gray hair! Try not to think about how everytime you think about it you get more. 

- Xantac, not Prilosec. Vicodin, not Percoset. Oxfords, not Brogues. Seriously. Never brogues. 

- Don't cheap out on shit tickets. Your booty button will thank you. 

- People suck. Friends, family, coworkers, lovers, wives, husbands, children, and especially other people's children. Nothing you can do about it. Suck it up. 

- Your dentist is lying to you. Fake teeth feel no different than real ones in your mouth. At worst, they sit different. You'll get over it. But on the flip side...getting your teeth ripped out and replaced is one of the most emotional and physically challenging things you will most likely ever do. It's also really fucking expensive, and not worth it. So brush your fucking teeth. 

- You really are what you eat. I know you won't believe me. Because I didn't believe it either. Why would you? McD's is cheap. Tastes good enough. Not dying yet. Sure. And who wants to spend 3 hours prepping a mango-chutney, blah blah blah anyway. That sounds terrible. But here's the thing...I can't eat ""good"" food without getting sick. Because my body doesn't know how to digest good food. It only knows how to digest sugar lard on a bun. Apparently, and this was the missing puzzle piece, you need to TRAIN your body to eat good food...or you wont be able to. You want a Ruth Chris steak that tastes like somebody filleted an angel? Sure. It'll be heaven while you're eating it. Before it rips your innards to shreds because your gut doesn't have the bacteria and enzymes necessary to break it down properly. Because you eat like shit. 

Oh you're poor? That's why you eat fast food? Fuck you, you're lazy. A cheap ass steak at the grocery store will feed you three times over. Same with the chicken breasts. Meal prep it. And eat some fucking vegetables. Kale, Broccoli, Carrots. Get some damn vitamins in you. 

- Also...you can't really be lazy when you get older. You just can't. You will die. Slowly. Painfully. Under the weight of your own mind, and quite possibly physically fucked up frame. So get over it now. If you can do it now. Do it now. 

I can go on for a long time with this. 

I'm old, after all. "

"I was once dating a guy who was weirdly intimidated by just one of my guy friends. Well my roommate and I at the time loved anything bacon so her mother bought us bacon flavored vodka, this was probably the worst thing I had ever drank in my entire life. So naturally we kept it in our cupboard just in case. Well my friend had heard us talking about it and wanted to try it, he takes a shot of it and promptly yelled about how gross it was. Obviously. So my boyfriend had to one up him and take three HUGE gulps of it. I've never seen regret so fast. Dude runs to the bathroom and throws up for about half an hour. Comes back out to all of us still laughing at his dumbass. He still thought he was the more alpha guy there because of how many gulps he had.

She started a new job at a place she really enjoyed, and almost a year after the miscarriage, she was pregnant again. There were no complications during pregnancy, until my wife's water broke at 34 weeks. We were scared of losing another baby and didn't know what would happen.

"FINALLY A THREAD I CAN RANT IN. 

My house was robbed back in October or November and they stole my TV, my Xbox One, and my roommate's AR-15 that was hidden in his closet *above* the closet door inside. Ransacked my room and nearly killed my snake. 

When I got home I must've scared them off. They didn't touch the nearly $3000 in musical and recording equipment in the living room. I called the police and dealt with it. The next day my next door neighbor asks what got stolen from my house.  But here's the thing: nobody told him we were robbed. Nobody. 

When I asked him how he heard, he said he heard from another neighbor. I asked that neighbor if he had heard and he said he had not. He had not even been home until that morning so he didn't even see the police show up. 

We've had a string of car robberies and Saturday a car was stolen. All the people affected have been people who've had run ins with my neighbor and he speaks poorly of them any chance he gets. 

I have caught him walking through my back yard that my landlord refuses to fence in, and have seen him looking over our fence when my car has been in the garage. 

I'm so glad I only have a few more months dealing with it. "

Then he - a bit arbitrary - asks me what is my Rh factor. I have no idea and reply, ""negative"". He sighs, ""you know you gonna have pregnancy problems if your man is Rh-positive, right?""
I'm trying to process that a random guy plans my pregnancy. What? Should I joke? Should I run? He continues:
""Oh well. You know, actually, I have a girlfrend, sorry, let's just be friends"".

"1. Royal politics in the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire are literally fucking brutal. It was a norm to gouge your rival's eyes out and shove him into a monastery, or even push them onto a marble column. The eye gouging is actually the least painless of the two options. Irene of Athens did this to her own eldest son to make herself emperor. This is why Charlemagne was made the Roman emperor in 800. It wasn't just because she was a woman. 



2. Another is that Vlad the Impaler , while considered a war hero in Romania, forced his prisoners to build his castle in freezing weather alongside staking them. Today he'd be considered a war criminal. 


3. Ivan the Terrible had a very traumatic childhood losing his parents  that molded him into a merciless killer. Someone here pointed out that he killed his friend with a stick beating not to mention that I already know that he beat his daughter until she miscarried alongside killing her husband. 


4. Some medieval manuscripts have stories where talking penises fought like knights to save the princess.  Back when the History Channel was great, they had a late night program covering sex in different eras of history , which is where I learned about the Japanese and this. 


5. The Japanese and Chinese both had a thriving homosexual scene prior to westernization where scrolls depicted these relationships which were fulfilling. Samurai Champloo also revealed this. 


6. Pedophilia was the norm in the Hellenistic world and alongside the fact that homosexual acts being tied to pagan practices, this led for the Jews and later Christians to consider homosexuality taboo due to the highly exploitative practice. 


7. In the Roman Empire, Prostitutes weren't allowed to wear veils or what was adopted as niqabs ( the Greek/Latin name is not on my tongue) as covering yourself up was considered only for the virtuous. Doing so would get them fined. This also ties into how prudish Roman society was. 


8. The entire sacrificing of people by the Aztecs and Incas was in some ways considered an honorable way to die. 


9.  The Bushido Code was mostly a fictional construct that were used to revive radicalized elements of the samurai. Prior to this, most Japanese abandoned and forgotten much of the samurai era due to how oppressive it was towards common people. 


10. Those Harems glorified by stories? Not so much. Real harems weren't anything like the popular image and it greatly depended on the husband's wealth and temperament in how you were treated. 


11. Byzantines/Romans and other conquered peoples of the Ottoman Empire had their young sons ripped away from them to be converted and used as janissaries. 


12. The Arab Slave trade led to over 3 million black Africans' deaths due to the hard and brutal conditions. This slave trade alongside rival warring nations and tribes is the hugest reason why the Atlantic slave trade happened the way it did. 


13. Women in Chinese society were forced to have bound feet, a fashion custom that crippled many women as girls.  The practice ended during the formation of the Chinese republic as it was banned.

"I worked for a corporation for six years in a sort of executive assistant capacity. My boss, for most of that time, was great, but when he died unexpectedly, the company was unsure what to do with me, and wanted to move me to work for another partner, who'd had trouble keeping assistants. I'd heard he was difficult to work for but thought it was better than being jobless so I accepted.

I worked for this guy for a year and let's just say, he was a nightmare.  He was mean, shady, disorganized, lied all the time about everything, avoided people, including his fellow partners. He would routinely make me stay till 11pm for no reason other than he needed to fax something he was working on and couldn't operate the fax machine. 

Everyone in the place hated the guy and his passive aggressive, shady ways. Our working relationship was really disintegrating due to his ways and my being totally fed up with lying for him.

I hated it there and found a new job, across town at a big agency. I found out I got the job on a Wednesday, it was to start two weeks from Monday, so I planned to hand my notice in on the Friday, work my two week notice then start the new job. I was elated to be getting away from the idiot.

On the Thursday, the day before handing in my notice, idiot boss guy calls me into his office and in his passive aggressive, faux concerned monotone, tells me they have to let me go, because he doesn't need an assistant really, and that they're not firing me, it's just a supply and demand thing, and that they're giving me $10,000 severance pay. Also I'd have to leave that day although they'd pay me till the end of the month (this was policy there).

It was the best day ever. I was ready to hand in my notice the next day, and here I was being laid off AND given a check for ten grand. One day later and they wouldn't have had to bother.

I was packing up my stuff to leave, totally shell shocked (in a good way) when he stopped by my desk all victorious looking, to wish me luck (i.e., gloat) in finding a new job. At which point I got to excitedly tell him that not only did I already have a new job, but I'd been planning to quit the following day, but I was delighted to now have two weeks paid extra vacation before starting, and a nice check to boot. The look on his face was just...let's just say if you could bottle that and save it to relive over and over again, I would. 

It was glorious. "

"When someone is very dirty and sweaty. It shows me that they were putting their all into something. They were building something, fixing something, changing something. It's indicative of passion and motivation. My mother and father were always covered in grease, wood and metal shavings, soil, and dirt when they got home from work or came back in from the yard. That's probably where I got this from. My husband is rarely more dear to me than when he is fixing our cars, replacing boards in the deck, or taking down trees in our yard. He's working hard to make his family's life better, and that is beautiful. "
"Pros:

* Lots of space

* The cook and butler were great company

* Access to horses and fields to gallop across

* Stories about the castle's building made that bit of history particularly vivid in my imagination

* It's a castle

Cons:

* Children have sticky fingers, so I wasn't allowed in most of the castle in case I damaged the priceless tapestries or something

* Actually, any time I was noticed by my grandfather was a bad time. He didn't like children much at all, and didn't like that there was one in his fancy castle.

* This also meant that I grew up secluded from most of the other kids in town, which made me feel really isolated. I have an English accent even though I grew up in Ireland and come from an ancient Irish family. I always felt like a fake Irishman. There were cousins and things to play with from time to time, but they were all from the same weird milieu. "

I've offered to negotiate on how to make the change easier, maybe figure out some new driving arrangements if it's really a problem for her (I don't think it is, but I'll play along because this is important) - and she won't even talk about it. 
She probably feels painted into a corner - that any agreement will mean ""losing"" at this point.  And so she's convinced herself this is the right decision for him...but I can't see any sense in it at all.  I hope the court agrees with me."

"&gt;For the climactic sequence of the movie, in which Hedren’s character Melanie is attacked in an attic by a ravenous flock of starlings, the 62-year-old director had promised his jittery star, a naive former model, making her major acting debut and already highly unsettled by various close avian encounters, that he would only use mechanical birds in a very brief sequence. In the event, Hedren arrived at the studio to find several cages full of furious starlings which were duly unleashed. They were then chained to her body and hurled at her by heartless crewmembers over not a couple of hours, but five full days. They pecked at her face relentlessly, leaving her covered in scars.


&gt;In their next and final collaboration, Marnie, he insisted on subjecting her character to a brutal rape scene that he actually seemed to relish. Hedren refused to work for the director again, and as she was under contract to him for seven years, that spelt the end of her career."

This guy goes right past them into the kitchen, finds a glass (!), opens the fridge and pours himself a glass of milk (!!), then brings the milk with him to the carpeted living room (??), sets it down on the floor (??!) and immediately knocks it over. Of course he says nothing to anyone.

He does this *two more times,* based on the amount of milk missing from the fridge/found in the carpet and carpet pad. Oh, he also left a bunch of our kitchen knives (*not* what we had set out for the pumpkin carving) in a pumpkin, plus some duct tape (which had also been put away) wrapped around the whole mess. It took days to clean up/get adhesive off the knives/get milk out of the carpet.

We had to tear out the carpet and replace the carpet pad and part of the sub-floor.

Two years later he gave me a traumatic brain injury via concussion that affected my speech center and coordination of my left eye. Whenever I want to see something better, even with glasses on, I still have to close my left eye. The concussion was in 2006 or 2007.

edit for the curious: my high school was divided into two levels, with the cafeteria and library etc being on one level and the classrooms on a slightly lower level (couldn't tell if intentional or?). So the lockers were technically on the lower level but they stuck up into the cafeteria level at knee height. I was sitting on them and he pushed me off into the lower level, which was a six-foot drop onto concrete and I pretty much landed on my skull and lost consciousness. We were actually there after school for a rehearsal and my friend found me unconscious in the hallway (I guess?) and when I came to I couldn't make sentences (apparently, I don't remember) so she got the director.

Director called my mother (because I wasn't able to operate the phone - a friend even had to go through my contacts because I couldn't find the number) and said he'd take me to the ER, so she left work for the closest ER, where I was ... not,  because rehearsal was still going on for two more hours and he didn't want to leave all the other students for a silly lil brain injury.  Apparently I'm still babbling in the car once she comes back to pick me up and repeating words over and over again, which I vaguely remember - I could tell they weren't the words I wanted to use but I just kept repeating them trying to find the right word. My mother used to be a medical assistant in the ER for years so when we walked in she announced ""potential traumatic brain injury with aphasia and nonresponsive left pupil"" and they took my vitals on the fly as they escorted us to a room, including checking my pupils. Shit was scary. I kinda remember them checking my pupils and how I kept using the wrong words, but the rest is second-hand from my mother. When my father got there I didn't recognize him until he told me who he was.

Neither the classmate nor the director was held accountable as far as I know."

"In 1990 in a suburb of Richmond, VA a family was executed during the night.  Mother, father 17 year old brother  There was a younger brother not home at the time.

One I found particularly surprising (and harmful if known by others) was a lady telling me she's aborted twice and that the child she did have, happened to be born with severe intelectual disability. She regrets having this child and said that ,if given the chance, she'd swap it with either of the other ones she ""killed"".  It wouldn't be that bad if she wasn't the wife of a religious leader and part of an organisation that tries to advocate for the rights of mentally disabled children. It would discredit her completely.

"Dumpster diving. A lot of good food is just thrown out, so I see no moral problems with people taking a look in a grocery stores garbage container at night. Actually, this goes for many other types of so called trash as well. It is not just food, but all kinds of things that work just fine that are thrown out, for example electronic products, people throw out their old but perfectly fine TV when  getting a new, or even worse: vintage video games, there is a geniune interest for those, but they are not made anymore, and each destroyed console is one less in the world. While I am too lazy to try to rescue them from recyceling centers myelf, I know people who have found plenty of fantastic stuff, like that time a guy showed up with 2 C64s, one floppy station, 2 SNES units, 3 N64s, 3 or 4 PS2s, plenty of controllers, and a buttload of games (one of them Mario Party 1), granted that this is a find out of the ordinary, but that is a lot of vintage electronics, and while the PS2s are not really worth much, but the rest are worth a few bucks."

"He really was great in that movie. His issue is that he played Harry Potter from childhood to adulthood, so no matter how old he gets or how he changes, he'll just be the real-life, older Harry Potter to people. He's a good sport about it though. On the upside, playing Harry Potter hasn't type-casted him in any way.

"I was with a group of my friends in Chicago and we were meeting up with a group of my friends' friends that I had never met before. We go into a bar where the second group was already seated. We sat and ate and drank for two hours or so and then headed back to the apartment. Of the newly acquainted group was this girl who I had an immediate crush on. She was super dead-pan like Aubrey Plaza, beautiful and hilarious. As we were walking back, I noticed she was laughing with a friend in the back of the group and doing a sort of Weekend at Bernie's style walk. We were all talking loudly and I swore I overheard her crack a joke about being a smidge too tipsy to walk. So I hung back and said something like, ""you gotta watch out for those long islands, they will make you wobbly..."" 

Turns out, she has muscular dystrophy and has a walking impairment as well as an inability to make any facial expressions...which explains the dead-pan face the whole evening. She was honestly just so pretty and hilarious I didn't notice anything. However, I truly wanted to die for about three seconds before she laughed it off and called me a dummy.

"Never had to do it myself, but I operated a rollercoaster once and the E-stop button would shut off all power to the ride. Which means the brakes in the station close, the brakes in the holding zone close, and the back up brakes between that and the lift close. The chain lift also stops too, so if a train is there, it stays there, and if there is a train out on the tracks it hits the backup brakes before the holding zone and hard stops.

And you get fired. Unless you had a good reason. One of our crew members had a list of the lowest amount of money any of us would hit E-stop for.

This is also a good time to point out that if you are working on a machine that has an E-stop, you always want to ask if it's a safe E-stop or not. Cause sometimes like in my example above, you really gum things up mechanically/operationally for a while, but others the machine just turns off."

I have anxiety, so I couldn't sleep and decided to spend the night deep cleaning my apartment (while muttering sorry to my neighbors for vacuuming at 1am) 

Found he had hidden things all over my house. My only guess was so he had an excuse to come back, like in Seinfeld? Maybe, Idk. But it was a whole box of things. I went to put them outside in the hall and t3xt him it was out there and discovered he had turned the lock off on my door. (It was set up like the inside of the door had a button you could press so you didnt get locked out bringing out the trash.) 

I basically stopped talking to him anymore, and one day I was bringing in groceries, which he normally asked to help with, and instead he punched me in the ass cheek so hard I almost fell down and dropped everything. "

"[Straight men’s physiological stress response to seeing two men kissing is the same as seeing maggots](http://www.psypost.org/2017/06/straight-mens-physiological-stress-response-seeing-two-men-kissing-seeing-maggots-49217)

&gt;In heterosexual men, pictures of rotting flesh, maggots and spoiled food induce the same physiological stress response as pictures of two men kissing each other. That is the surprising finding that was recently published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Psychology &amp; Sexuality.

&gt;Measuring levels of salivary alpha-amylase, a digestive enzyme that is associated with stress and is especially responsive to disgust, allowed the researchers to examine the men’s physiological reaction to the photos. The study was based on results from 120 heterosexual men (aged 18 to 45).

&gt;“In comparing the salivary alpha-amylase responses of participants to the various slideshows, we found that participants had higher salivary alpha-amylase responses to the images of two men kissing and the disgusting images. In both cases, these responses were significantly different than the responses they had to the neutral stimuli.”

&gt;“What is most important to note is that the responses did not differ as a function of self-reported levels of prejudice or self-reported levels of aggression towards gay men,” Blair explained. “In other words, it was not our highly prejudiced individuals who were experiencing a heightened physiological response to the images of same-sex couples kissing, it was everyone in the sample, even those with very low levels of prejudice.”

And like the person before me, I'd like to clarify that I do not condone homophobia. In fact I support LGBQT."

Time is running short.

"Patent lawyer and former scientist here - with no affiliation whatsoever to Monsanto or to any other GMO producing entity. 

The patent issues w.r.t. Monsanto are woefully overblown, and (I believe) largely a result of astroturfing by big-Ag who aren't *at all* hurt by or morally outraged by Monsanto's pricing structures, but just want to expand their bottom line. 

Monsanto's main patented achievement was developing a specific type of herbicide resistence into their grains, which let farmers use fewer pesticides and risk less damage to their crops. 

They never prevented folks from doing things the old way, and never prevented folks from trying to develop different GMO crops. The legal horror stories you have heard are also overblown. 

For example, the stories of folks getting sued by Monsanto for accidentally planting GMO seeds? Mostly these stories amount to bad renditions of the facts in one case where a farmer was pulling discarded grains from an elevator, growing *test plots*, and purposefully isolating Monsanto grain for which he had previously been paying a license. 

There's one type of case, happened at least once in Oregon, where I sympathize with the farmers. A farmer's field was found to have cross-pollinated with some neighboring Monsanto grain. By virtue of containing some GMO DNA, his crops were devalued, as he couldn't ship them to a foreign country that had restricted GMO grain. I believe he sued and won that case. 

Anyway, it is a moot point now, because those early Monsanto patents are years past expiration. Now they are working on drought-resistant crops and the like. 

What really blows my mind is that, for the 20 years of patent term, nobody else invented a competing technology that was better! This is amazing, and goes to show that what they had was the real Holy Grail of GM research, probably way ahead of its time. In light of this, I think their scientists are heroes, and their company deserved every cent they eked out of their now-ended, limited monopoly. Because of Monsanto, an entire industry of plant GM exists, working on the next generation of tools to feed the world. "

I went to a birthday party for some friends that are Mexican-American.  They had a Trump pinata.  I've never seen one get hit so hard.
"Ah, well... I went to the police and to my landlord and no one was willing to help. Everyone just sort of insisted he was a little lonely old man with a harmless crush on a 20-year-old (who did cute little things like throwing and breaking empty bottles at my door at midnight, trying to break in when he saw me leave, following me to and around the supermarket (even in a crowded store, literally no one, not even the cashier was willing to help me), beating the ground with an umbrella and screaming as I waited for the bus to work because I wouldn't tell him where I was going... I'm sure there are more but I try not to think about it too often). It took a year to save enough money to move out. When I handed in the paperwork to my landlord, she asked why I was moving, and I told her, like I'd told her before, the man in room 205 was stalking me and I couldn't deal with it any longer. She said fine and I left.

Days later, I was in the process of moving out with the help of my friend. I didn't have any big furniture, the old apartment was already furnished with a washing machine, bed, table, and chairs, so I decided the bus and my suitcase were good enough to help me move. I knew it would take a while but it was cheaper than renting a truck. One day my friend couldn't help, so I went back to the old apartment on my own at about noon. The old man came out and began screaming incoherently at me. I'm... not good with screaming, when I get truly scared I just sort of shut down, so I didn't catch a lot of what he said, only that I'm a lying whore. I heard the word ""liar"" a lot. He chased me back inside my apartment and I cowered in the far corner of my near-empty room for hours, afraid he'd break down the door, and afraid if I called the police that they'd tell me the same thing as before, that as a resident of that apartment he has every right to be hanging around outside, and I imagined them agreeing that I am indeed a lying, selfish, overdramatic, narcissistic bitch. In the end I guess he grew tired of screaming at me, so I waited until sundown and booked it out of there as fast as I could run with a suitcase.

I only came back twice after that, once to get the last suitcase of my stuff with the help of a guy friend of mine (and the last time for a room check and to turn in my key). I'd forgotten to take out the trash and my friend volunteered so I wouldn't have to go outside alone. When he came back, he said he heard whispering but couldn't find where it was coming from. It was definitely the old man."

"I've told this story before, but when I was like 15 I had a best friend who was a guy. His best friend, also a guy, came over and told us he was going to break up with his girlfriend. Then he left for like 10 minutes and came back and started like screeching-wailing-hysterically crying. I didn't realize that he had gotten his girlfriend to come to our friends house and broke up with her in the driveway. So when he started crying all weirdly like that, I thought he was joking and I laughed. My best friend shot me this look of pure anger, and I immediately stopped laughing and felt like an asshole. "

Growing up I have always had trust issues so whenever a relatuve passed away I was like ""meh"" because I never allowed myself to become attached. However this doesn't apply to my immediate family. They have my absolute trust and love. 

My brother committed suicide by drowning himself in the local lake and when my family was notified it has already been 4-5 hours. Yet when I arrive there I was so scared and shaken up that I had to confirm several times that it wasn't a nightmare. Logic flew out the window as I proceeded to ask an officer ""what are the chances of my brother being alive?"" Knowing that it's been hours since he jumped. I was 25 at the time too. I had to suck everything up and comfort my parents with false hope by saying this is probably BS.

I will never forget that moment, where all logic just flew out the window. "

"I was living in Washington state in 2009 after college and the only person to hang out with was my childhood best friend.

He tells me he's ""got to make a drop off"" in a shitty part of town before we meet up and asks if I would like to come with him. Now at this point I KNEW he was dealing more than weed so I just said, ""How about you make the drop off first and pick me up afterwards?"" He says ""okay"" and shows up at my house about two hours later and he's WHITE AS A SHEET. I ask him what's wrong and he goes, ""I got held up at gun point. They took my stash, my backpack, my wallet, my phone-- everything!"" before I can reply with, ""Holy shit, that's terrible"" he says, ""It's a good thing you didn't come with me!""

As an avid DIY and projects guy, I can contest to this. I could probably pay someone who owns a shop to do the custom work I want AND include parts for less than what I end up spending on my own projects.

However, if I did that I wouldn't learn from my mistakes. Every project I have completed is it's own light bulb for the next project because I realize, ""Hey, I can actually do this and it doesn't look like shit.""  Also the things I want to create would feel hollow for me if someone else made them.

"Kathmandu Nepal. The way people drive. Constant horn honking. Driving down a street with people and bikes and scooters and rarely is there an accident. Fitting 5 adults in the back of a tiny ass taxi (a Rickshaw) was common and definitely /r/OSHA material. 

A couple stories to share from that trip that were definitely eye opening:

* We went to the temple in dakshinkali. There were several hundred people standing in line to sacrifice animals to the goddess Kali. I stood about 20' away from where they were doing the sacrifices. I have never seen or smelled so much blood in my life. And to the Nepalise, it was normal. 
* Went to this other town, I forget the name; one of the poorest villages in Nepal. There was one body of water where people bathed, washed their clothes, washed their dishes, and used for drinking water. 
* Related, we walked along the Bagmati river and watched people perform cremations in the river water. A ways down the river you could see people bathing in the water as well as drinking it. 

Never in my life had I felt like such an outsider. It was an incredible experience, I highly recommend it. "

I read somewhere - need source - that he was a victim of a brutal smear campaign because he was a companion of Jon of Arc, and of noble birth, which made him a threat to some highly placed individuals at court.


A Burgundian duke sold out Joan of Arc to the English, who tried and burned her. Joan's own trial was a despicable miscarriage of justice, which, being the middle ages, isn't awfully surprising. For anyone interested, Joan was burned after she confessed at the gallows. It is very likely that her confession was forced after she was raped in the custody of her English guards. I'm not a real historian, just a massive nerd, but even I wouldn't trust a confession from anyone from the time period famous for its creative approach to torture.


For Gilles de Rais though, being a friend of a woman burned at the stake for 'witchcraft' left him exposed to the same sort of 'justice' thus it is **extremely** unlikely he ever actually murdered any children.

You have apples on the list. What kind of apples do you want? How many do you want? Are the ones you're getting good apples, or are they bruised? Are they ripe enough? Will you be able to eat all of them before they go bad? Also, fruit is expensive. Repeat for each fruit on the list.

Similar questions for vegetables. Also, why the fuck are the packages of fresh spinach so fucking big? I can't eat that much before it goes bad! I either go without one of the few vegetables I like, or I waste food. Why do they assume anyone who eats spinach eats a ton of it?

Hey, you need some kind of meat. What kind of meat? How much? Should you spring for deli meat, or just get hot dogs? Or even frozen meat? Ground beef?

Pop-tarts are a nice, quick breakfast, but they're expensive if you're considering how many meals you get. Oh, you need cereal. Is generic okay, or do you need brand name for that particular cereal? (Hint: generic Cheerios suck for some reason.) Which generic do you want? Do you want a variety of cereal?

How many eggs should you get? You went through the last batch super quickly, so 18 sounds good, but what if you get tired of eggs? They'll go to waste.

And so on and so forth. It's exhausting, and I hate it to the point where I just delay grocery shopping until I'm almost completely out of food, which just makes the miserable task even more miserable."

"And here in Zambia, we've welcomed the white farmers with wide open arms and there has been a rapid rise in farm produce. Harsh reality, we the indigenous people of the land do not have the vast farming knowledge and discipline at a high level as these generation to generation white farmers, colonialism factors that in, yes. But, as things stand, you try to benefit where you can. So, there has been a steady increase in white farmers from Zimbabwe and south Africa coming into Zambia. It's not exactly colliding with the locals because the government has been smart about allocating the land. "

So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts.

"Warning: lengthy. 

Actually just dealt with this situation. Dated this guy for a month or so when I was a sophomore in high school (and he a junior). He is actually a nice and good guy. Fast forward to two years ago (I was a college sophomore) and we run into each other at a mutual friend's wedding. He had a girlfriend. Cool. No big deal, I wasn't interested anyways. 

Then fast forward a few months back and I get a fb message asking if I wanted to go see one of my favorite bands in Florida (I live in Georgia, so it had to be an overnight trip). I said yeah, forgot about it, never bought a ticket. A couple weeks pass with sporadic messages and I get one asking if I'm ready for the concert next month. I wasn't. Turns out he had already bought us both VIP tickets with a meet-and-greet, shirt, and limited edition vinyl. I was beyond excited! He called me pet names ranging from love to baby and I explained to him that I was interested in someone else and this was strictly as friends. Thought it was a non-issue. 

A week leading up to the concert we meet again for the first time in two years and hang out. It's fun seeing an old friend after all. Driving around town and he keeps trying to put his hand on my knee, or hold it, or kiss me. I obviously ask him to back off and he doesn't. 

I book the hotel for the concert since he got tickets. I got a room with two beds. He still ended up sleeping in my bed anyways. In the morning he told me how I talked in my sleep saying ""I really don't want to be with this other guy. I only stay because I feel bad."" And how ""I've been in love with him for years."" Mind you, I do talk in my sleep, but it's incoherent at best. Friends have told me I've said ""the yellow thing's over there"" or ""Gabe the onion"" and even ramblings about Jesus from South Park. 

Fast forward a month and I get a call at 9:05 on Sunday morning. My only day off. Still asleep I answer ""hello?"" And he replies he will be at my house in five minutes. Wait...what? We didn't make any plans that I can remember. He told me the day prior he was going to be in town for a week, but that doesn't mean I expect you to wake up at 3AM and drive from south Florida to my house the next day. End up inviting a friend to stay the night and he ends up sleeping in the guest room because he didn't have anywhere else to go. 

I work rights across the street from the base he works out of and he knows I work every Saturday and what time I get off. I usually got unannounced visits at work. One day I was very hangry and he wanted to get lunch so I agreed. I tried to buy my own, he refused. After lunch I tell him I only see him as a friend. His response: ""maybe you just need to give it some time."" I had given it time. The answer was still no. He finally stopped calling me babe and baby after me directly asking so. Still called me love and sent me ""good night beautiful sweet dreams"" texts. 

I finally had to tell him to stop communicating with me until he felt like he could just be my friend. His response to that? ""I know I've backed off. Why what's wrong? Call me?"" Backing off is not the same thing as stopping when explicitly asked to stop. After ignoring his calls and texts since two Thursday's ago I haven't heard from him since (or received any unexpected visits). 

His whole thing was ""we could have been dating for six years"" and that he remembered how awesome I was in high school. People change. We grow up. Our relationships and expectations need to as well. We need to respect each other's boundaries. 

He's actually a really decent guy. It's just he did everything wrong and didn't give me any space and basically did everything he could to make me not like him in his effort to get me to return his affections. I feel bad, but at the same time my free time is MINE and I choose who I spend it with. 

Pro tip: If you want to date a girl and she's interested in someone else, don't force dates on her guérilla warfare style. They come off creepy and unwanted. 

Edit: After two weeks of no communication I got a text today asking what I wanted to eat at the military ball he invited me to (where he was going to have me pretend to be his girlfriend). I told him I would no longer go with him and that I hope he finds another date. His reply: ""Okay. I hope everything is okay between us. I'm still not sure what happened""

I honestly don't even know what to do or say anymore. I haven't responded.

Child support payments are nowhere NEAR enough to actually support a child.

And then your child can suffer because we all know deep down that the custodial parent nearly always provides more than the non-custodial.  And that's before we even get into lost opportunity and wages due to time spent caring for the child."

She was a very quiet girl and stuck close to her friend, who I happened to be a friend of. I used our mutual friend as an excuse to come over and say hello, ended up talking to Kate. Our talking turned into drinking, then the drinking turned into making out, then our making out turned into sex. It was good overall, but I thought it was strange how at one point she turned to me and made these loud beeping sounds. It was at this point I realized my alarm clock had gone off and I was gonna be late for work if I didn't hurry."

"Goth and depressed. In reality I was VERY depressed. I needed therapy and medication that I didn't get until recently. I expressed this by dying my clothes black, ripping up my jeans and good clothes, cutting powdering my face white, stopped going to church, skipping class, got violent and quiet and I lived 3 years in headphones listening to death metal bands. Someone mouthed off to me, I blew up on them. I sent my bullies running because they thought I was going to shoot up the school. Besides that, I was the perfect student. I didn't say a word in class, made all A's and was a teacher's pet. Everyone else avoided me because they knew me as ""that weird chick that cut herself in the bathroom"" I didn't actually, it was a rumor that circulated until the counselor put a stop to it and called my parents.

I'm embarrassed about destroying my clothes and my body and making that my image but I will always be proud of myself for fighting back."

"We had a first round interview with someone a recruiter sent us. We'd read his resume and he seemed like an ideal fit for a software developer position so we scheduled a phone interview.

The recruiter was one we had never used before and he was on the line as well anticipating future placements.

After some general tell us about yourself style questions which went ok things quickly went south. The guy had difficulty with several basic tech questions and general sentence structure. Truly awful and there was also static and bad connection on the line as well. 

So the interview becomes a lost cause and we ask a few more questions to, for lack of a better explaination, not be dicks and still cut the interview well short. Out of habit I ask a standard question at closing. ""So do you have and questions for us?"".

""So this is {Name of Fortune 50} right?""

His one question was to confirm the company he'd just bombed an interview with. Silence after that. The recruiter apologized after for basically not screening at all.

For the next week or so we'd ask each other, ""So this is {Company Name} right?"

"That's a classic case of Necrophilia. Researchers say it can be divided under 10 categories. It ranges from 'role players' to homicidal necrophiles who are the most dangerous. Role players don't have sex with a dead body but get aroused by a living person pretending to be dead. Also, in the book Sexual Attraction to Corpses: A Psychiatric Review of Necrophilia, the authors also explain how the Sleeping Beauty story is the embodiment of a necrophilic fantasy. Apparently it's more common of a fantasy than we would think..."

"You get a friend who is paid to write to drop your name until you get hired. Seriously, that's just about it. You write constantly for yourself, start a blog or something, and write a lot, and one day it just happens.

Find ways to meet and socialize with other writers. Occasionally ask someone you respect to read your work. You see an opening for you where they're writing? Mention it to them.

You say aspiring, but I'm curious about you as a person. If you're a teen or very old there's novelty value. You know what else has value? Everything! Being white, black, or any other color doesn't really matter... Because they all have advantages. Just lean into them. If you're young and white you actually have it a little easier in middle sized markets full of white people and small markets where there are only white people! Use that shit! If you're a person of color you can aim for the edge cases; a niche that plays to your race, or the huge markets where your race is representative of a non-single race majority!

Play into your interests. Write what you know. Just write.

If you like a site that has opinion articles ask what it takes to write one. If not, hell, ask a local paper about writing an option/ed column about something you care about. They say no? Write a letter to the editor every week until they print the fucking thing.

And if they say yes? Try to get an agreement you can post it on your site after a while. (If they say you can link to it, say you're just worried the site will change content management systems (CMSs) and one year you'll realize you lost the first article you ever wrote.) Keep writing for yourself. Always write. Write a lot. Write nonstop. See where this is going?

Sharpen your words until your friend finally comes through and mentions you to their editor. You don't want to fuck up when you finally get your shot.

Or you can get paid to write shill marketing on websites and forums. Y'know. Content marketing. It pays, and only costs your soul.  "

Valentine's day evening he walks me to my dorm after class, asks of he can stop by for a minute so we can chat.  I'm thinking it's Valentine's day, he's been waiting for the right moment to have this talk, so I'm super excited. Of course, I invite him in.  We take a seat next to each other on my futon, and he kind of smiles and starts with... ""so you may have noticed it's Valentine's day..."" and takes a breath like he's working up his nerve.

Then he proceeds to explain to me that he's not really sure about us right now and by the way there are a couple of other girls that he's also been getting to know lately so he just doesn't think he can commit to me right now without seeing where those relationships go as well.  That was the gist of it anyway.  At that point it all kind of became a blur because I was so shocked.  Given the lead up and the day that was pretty much the opposite message I'd been expecting.

"A wizard dueling game. This would probably be a VR title with motion controls. Essentially two wizards duel a-la Harry Potter, so no dodging, spells must be deflected or blocked. But, instead of having hot keys for spells, you trace the symbols and speak the command words aloud to make it more skill/memorization based as a real wizard battle would be. This could easily become competitive. If you have a massive database of spells, add in mixing spells together for new effects, etc. you could have players specialize in a smaller collection of combo spells. The more powerful the spell, the longer it takes to cast and more damage it opens you up to. "

"This is easily the single worst part of Reddit. Everyone can subscribe to and block subs at will with incredible ease, leading to almost everyone becoming an insane circlejerker: T_D, the anti-trump subs, r/conservatives, r/ourpresident, r/twoxchromosomes, and the fucking incel subs; these *all* cause dangerous amounts of circlejerking in their readership. People on all of those subs constantly call for the deaths of people they don't like just for disagreeing, and r/killthosewhodisagree is in full effect. Centrist or third party subs are not immune to this either. Hell, even non-political subs like r/bitcoin and to a lesser extent r/highqualitygifs are a massive circlejerk. If you express doubts about bitcoin in r/bitcoin, your ass is getting horribly downvoted and on some occasions kicked out of the sub. They will oftentimes not listen to genuine criticism. And god forbid you ever express a dislike for the same ol' rehashed meta gifs in r/highqualitygifs...

You may even be part of a circlejerk yourself and not know it. There is nothing wrong with being a part of a political sub, or even being a frequent poster in subs that a lot of people don't like (like T_D). Hell, I'm a flaming liberal myself in almost every political belief of mine, and align strongly with the Democratic party. But please at least be *aware* of the fact that circlejerks exist everywhere and also try to expose yourself to new ideas every once in a while. You don't have to agree with them but at least know and most importantly *understand* other viewpoints, and maybe give your own ideas a good onceover every now and then.

Even absolutely batshit crazy viewpoints like flat earth theories and the whole ""vaccines cause autism"" shtick should at least be *understood*, so that you can debate and ridicule them more easily."

This past year an esteemed older fellow (mid 60's) I know that is a professor, a father, and very moral guy disappeared. A guy who was always there for his family, helping them in any way he could and a hard worker. Family business was taking a bad turn and he couldn't handle the feeling that he was letting everyone down. In the end we found out that he basically spent a morning with a loaded gun thinking of killing himself, and the rest of the day driving away. He finally returned, a broken man. Therapy and his family have brought him back together, but what I took from the whole thing is that it doesn't matter how old you are or how much wisdom you've accumulated in your life or how wide your perspective is after all your years: life can still chew you the fuck up and throw a curve-ball at you.

"Okay, no. Ever since I learned how the first consonant is actually pronounced, I can't stand this. Especially since, unlike some words from European languages that actually use different vowels and shit, this is a sound English actually DOES use, it's just not one letter (and we don't really think of it as a consonant).

It's not a ""w"" sound, it's a ""ng"" sound. Say ""singer"". (Note: For this to work, the way you pronounce it has to NOT have a hard G sound in it.) Then say it again, but really try to draw out the middle consonant - ""sinnnggger"". Now try to drop the ""si"" at the beginning so it's just one syllable. ""Inger."" ""Innnggger."" ""Nger."" There's your ""ng"" sound. 

If you pay attention to where your tongue is in your mouth while saying the ""n"" sound and then the ""ng"" sound, you'll find that while ""n"" has you touching almost the tip of your tongue to the middle-front roof of your mouth, the ""ng"" sound kinda has you touching the part of your tongue farther back to the roof of your mouth farther back.

He has an interesting relationship with selfishness though... In everything socially, it's all him. Every word out of his mouth is about him, whether to brag or to complain. It's never to ask about anyone or anything else not pertaining to himself. If you strike a conversation about something not him, he either makes it about him or makes dismissive statements - sometimes just grunts of ""Uh-huh"". I'd say over 70% of the things I tell him, and I mean explicitly make a point to tell him, he doesn't actually hear.

But outside of that, money-wise, he's the most generous human I've ever met. He talks a big game, huge into anarcho-capitalism, but he drops thousands left and right to support people. He fronted the bill for a family friend's lawyer fee when said friend *literally attempted armed robbery* (it was a ""suicide by cop"" situation). He spotted his brother in-law something like a thousand simply to bet on a sports team.

My dad isn't stingy, and I know he loves his family, but... He only does these things to turn around and expect the world back, and gets incredibly agitated when it doesn't pay up. It's like he knows most what it takes to be a decent human being, but missed the part about how it's absolutely filled with hardship, sacrifice, and selflessness.

I used to look up to him as a kid. I thought he was a strong, imposing figure for everyone. But now that I'm grown, and I've been around him in social situations, out at the bar and elsewhere, I see he's just a small, belligerent man with social anxiety who read one too many Ayn Rand books."

"In highschool, I worked at a paintball field as  referee and later, as a gun tech. Easily the most fun, bullshit job you could get as a highschool kid. 
Lets see, NSFW...
While working We would carry a pocket full of m80's which fit perfectly in the barrel of a tippman prolite, light it , drop it in and lob it at your buddy. Time it right and he gets a perfect airburst. Always good for a laugh. 

We would have roman candle wars after we closed (masks on). NSFW because fire...

Ref Day was always fun! Closed field, we got drunk as fuck and played paintball. Later we'd put bunny ears and a high-vis safety jersey thing on whoever was the newest hire, give him a shot of jack and a 10 minute head start then hunt him down on fourwheelers. If he could elude us for 30 minutes he was a verified legend. NSFW because a bunch of 16-18yo's with no adult supervision should not be operating ATV's while drunk as fuck. 
Further protip, never throw a full co2 tank in a bonfire. That...could have ended way worse than it did. 

We'd dress up in padded swat style gear, armor, shield, helmet masks and neck guards, and ""Run the Barn"". Basically the owner had the scraggy junkyard dog on the property. Lock him in the main hanger thing on the property and we'd run full speed from one side to the other (or at least try...fucker was vicious).

Part of your job when opening for the day was a rattlesnake sweep of the fields. You could wack 'em with a shovel if you were being a  pussy, but the ""dude hold my beer"" method was to hold the head down with a stick, grab em by the tail and kill them by cracking 'em like a bullwhip.

I've personally heard people say that they've never met a Trump supporter that wasn't retarded. When I hear things like this, an analogy comes to mind - if you heard a open member of the KKK spouting off that they had never met an intelligent black man, what would you think? Would you think, I guess he's right and all black people are dumb? Or would you think it's more likely that none of the intelligent black people want to talk to his dumb, racist ass? If you're going around saying things like that, and some people around you are broadly supportive of Trump but haven't mentioned it yet, do you think hearing things like that will make them want to discuss things with you, or keep quiet, nod along, and get away?

There's a very big and powerful cultural divide in this country these days. Some people have called it a cold civil war. There are many forces that are trying to drive the two sides further apart for their own purposes. I think that, if we really talk honestly with each other, we probably don't disagree on nearly as much as you might think. Maybe once in a while, you should ask yourself if you want to be part of the forces driving us apart, or pulling us back together.

If you want to help drive everyone apart, then keep on blindly insulting anyone who doesn't agree with you, thinking that anyone in your party is an untouchable angel, lecturing everyone on the other side about how they're too dumb to know what's in their own best interest. Be aware that you're making a hot civil war more likely. I don't know how that would go or what it would look like, but be aware that wars like that tend to not go the way that anyone expected, be very bitter and destructive, and very hard to stop once they get going.

If you want to help bring us closer together, then try to listen to the other side, and understand why they feel the way they feel. You can still support your side and your party, but try to understand that they aren't perfect either, and understand how their actions and behavior might look to someone on the other side. Neither party or side is innocent in widening the divisions in our country to dangerous levels. It's easy and fun to ignore and minimize the bad things your side has done and delight in pointing out the bad things the other side has done, and it tends to make things worse and drive us further apart. It's much harder to look at your own side and condemn them for the bad things they've done, and admit that the other side maybe has some reasons for the way they feel. It's this hard work that we need to do to bring our country back together.

If you complain that it's hard or empowers the other side to focus on the flaws of your side, well you may have a point, but keep in mind that it only gets harder the more divided and violent we get."

"Many, many years ago I worked on a team that diagnosed and fixed a similar issue with a call centre for a bank back in the good old days of machine based call switching before it all went digital.

Night staff were hearing super creepy shit in the background of some calls, or they'd even sometimes hear something without having a caller on the line. We got called in to figure it out after one woman supposedly heard child screaming and ""NOPE""'d right out of her to her car and went home.

Exact same scenario where people would swear they heard X but it didn't pick up in the recordings.

What it turned out to be was poorly shielded cabling in the walls (often several hundred metre long cable runs from the PBX the size of a large SUV in the basement) basically acting as antennas, picking up radio signals. The day shift never noticed it because far more people, far more calls = far more noise. Vs at 2 am in the morning you could hear a pin drop some nights.

The call recorder (Big ass old school reel system) never picked it up because it was attached a few feet away (man in the middle style) to the PABX and supposedly wasn't configured to record anything that didn't come through end to end. That explanation never made sense to me, I suspect the actual reality was that the recording system was too shitty to pick it up in calls and didn't engage when a call wasn't active.

The issue was confirmed by ripping open the cable runs in the walls (cutting out big lengths of plasterboard) which made the signal strong enough that you could hear at night that it was definitely radio. "

"How to make cheap ass lunches without lifting a finger:

Buy an ass ton of lean cuisines or smart ones. If they are on sale, you are looking at around 2 dollars per entree. No prep time except a microwave. Most work places have a microwave. Grab some fruit cups (50 cents per) or yogurt cups and then a big thing of cookies (2 bucks for around 30 cookies). Some fresh fruit or veggies fill in the cracks and you now have a healthy lunch of about  600 calories and it cost you like 3.50. With zero prep time besides chopping your damn carrots and putting 2 chips ahoy in a plastic bag. Cycle a different version of everything each day and you will enjoy your lunch without any monotany. Maybe bring leftover take out every once in a while. I didnt buy lunch at work all of last year and ate like a damn king!"

"I had a guy in middle school lie to the office and claim to be in yearbook so he could get my schedule to ""interview with me."" He just made a photocopy and gave it back. For an entire semester, this guy would open every single door for me. The door into the school. The door to every one of my classes. For the first while, i thought it was only a coincidence and he was just polite. Then I noticed he was only in one of my classes. That's when it started to eat creepy. I noticed him everywhere; watching me go into the bathroom and being there right in front of the door when I went out or standing on the other side of the lunchroom just staring at me. Once he got my phone number from a acquaintance (he told them we were working on a project together) I went to administration who ordered him to stop and threatened to suspend him. He then confronted me, calling me a ""friendzoning cunt"" and demanding to know why I ""hated him just for being nice"" and then he threatened to kill himself. That was cool. He got our version of ""detention"" and I had my friends come with me everywhere for the rest of the semester. Office ladies are no longer allowed to give information about people's schedules. I am reminded of it because yesterday he tried to friend me on Facebook."

"I grew up in a really small town (less than 1000 people) where my dad was (a very frugal) veterinarian. Growing up he rarely let us buy many toys so we never got to have super soakers. Instead, we got to use 60cc syringes (without the needles of course) for water fights.

"My dad would flirt with my mom in public. Like come up behind her, pinch her rear, then run off giggling. Or one time he came home, she was in her nightgown we were getting ready to go to bed. My dad comes in from work, cleans out his lunch box, takes the spoon and wacks her on the rear. She hollers, comes into our room, and is like look what your daddy did, and pulled up her gown to show us where he popped her. Of course we got on to dad and hit him with our little girl fists telling him to leave our mom alone, and stop being mean to mama. Turns out that's not normal. My friends parents just fought all the time. "

"Here's the thing : technically it was my best mate's bully, but it was my revenge. She was half-caste and the only asian-looking girl in the area. This one cock-sucker had learned some vile names and delighted in calling her them until she cried. He always did it at the bus stop because we couldn't walk away. I got angry, but she always told me not to do anything because she was worried about it escalating. I promised not to do anything that would make it worse. 

I like loopholes. I'm also from what some would call an aggressive family. We've play-fought with each other for as long as I can remember, so the desire to beat the shit out of him was strong. 

One time he was singing a song that basically was just the P word to a tune with a few uninventive insults thrown in that didn't scan. He was playing up particularly because there was a crowd of largely disinterested older kids also waiting for the bus. I figured a way to fuck him over and ensure it wouldn't get worse.

I punched him hard in the nose. No warning, just turned round and lamped him. Now I was a big girl even at 7, so when I put my full force behind the punch, it was nasty (and yes, I hurt my hand because I was a dumb kid who didn't know how to punch properly)

He staggered back and started crying as his nose began to bleed. The disinterested crowd noted that he'd been made to cry by a girl, and ripped the shit out of him. He ran away, they continued laughing, me and my mate eventually caught our bus and he left us the fuck alone forever more. 

Oh and I didn't get into trouble because 1) he had no idea where I lived and 2) rumour had it his dad was more pissed off that he'd not fought back. Charming man."

Edit: we weren't extremely close, I was already teetering on the edge with her, I am not stupid, I have a very good sense of humor and I know when someone is trying to make me laugh and when someone said something involuntarily because deep down that's how they really feel. Trust me, since I was there, that she was barely joking.

Another example of her high self entitlement was a night she came to visit me at my school. We went to a party and the whole time she was walking around asking other guys for the rest of their beers. I asked her why she kept doing that and she said ""Cause I'm hot and I know they'll give it to me."" By the end of the night she was wasted and I was buzzed at best lol."

"Couple of emergency buttons pressed in my life, one I pressed and one pressed on my behalf. 

In sixth grade, I hit the 911 button on my home phone because the house across the street from me had caught on fire. It was an electrical fire and spread fast, and an 8th grade boy from my school lived there with his parents and little sister who was maybe 9 years old. He thought she was in there, so he flipped out and tried to run in, and I (at 75 lbs compared to his 150ish) had to stop him, so I dropped the phone without hanging up and threw myself on him/held on and screamed for an adult to come help (it was a tight packed neighborhood but we were almost all latchkey kids).  Someone did, eventually, but I had to talk the kid down and get him back into my house and get the phone back so I could tell them what was happening. It turned out the little girl had gone to a friend's house and the only casualty was their little dog, which is sad, but not as sad as dead kids. I made the paper because of it and I remember being confused because they acted like I was some kind of little hero and I was like ""What the fuck else was I supposed to do? He would have died if he'd gone in there.""  (Without the cursing but same sentiment.) I also remember being really freaked out at the time because he was sobbing and holding on to me and I was just an 11 year old girl who didn't know how to comfort a 14 year old boy. I just kept sticking to the facts and telling him that she probably wasn't in there and even if she was, he'd die if he went in there and I couldn't let him do that, and the firemen were on their way. It was a crazy situation at that age.

"I was in a cave about 5 miles outside of town. I had broken my collarbone about one month prior and so my friends helped me get some of my stuff there and helped me up some slopes.

We were going to spend the night, well inside this cave was this straight-drop hole about 10 meters wide and 20 meters deep with jagged, sharp rocks at the bottom. I got last pick on where to sleep and the only flat place left was right next to it.

Well one of my friends' sister and her friend showed up. They ended up staying the night. Sister slept in my sleeping bag, which was weird with her brother there but he didn't give two shits. Her friend slept with her bf in another sleeping bag.

Anyway, so two people in the same sleeping bag wiggle around a lot, especially when it's cold in early march and you cuddle for warmth. 

Turns out there was an imperceptible slope leading down into the hole. I wake up in the middle of the night, the fire's low. For some reason my feet are really cold.

I got super drunk and passed out on the couch and woke up to this girl straddling me and aggressively kissing me and trying to take my dick out of my pants.  I remember trying to tell her no and push her off of me but I was so drunk I could barely move and ended up blacking out again. 

I woke up and she was still on top of me so I pushed her off and got in my car and left.  I'm not all emotionally damaged or anything but I just found it odd how she was just able to do something like that in front of other people and it didn't affect her reputation or how people treated her at all.

So when he went to the bathroom again, I actually went to the bathroom right outside my room, only to find him gone. He wasn't outside with his parents, and I suddenly hear footsteps coming from the basement (at the time, *nobody* was allowed there except for my dad and my older brother), and I asked what he was doing there, and he said he went to the bathroom. I asked him why he went there and not the one upstairs, and he said all of them were already used. He pissed in every single one upstairs, downstairs, and in the basement, and didn't bother flushing. To this day I don't have a damn clue as to why he did that. "

"First of all, *languages* aren't invented, they evolve. *Language* - the human capacity to communicate through speech - many have appeared (""been invented"") just one time or multiple times independently (like agriculture). No one can or will ever pinpoint the earliest steps. There are some theories, all of them rather unsubstantiated.

However, if we start from the very early stage of words for physical objects, words for physical actions, and pointing expressions (this, that, that over there), there's a good book called *The Unfolding of Language* which lays out the basic mechanisms that led to modern languages.

First, basic cognitive/psychological principles (things that relate to each other should be next to each other, references to self or to agents are generally highlighted at beginning of expressions, humans have pattern recognition and use analogical thinking).

Then, three linguistic processes:

1. Semantic extension/abstraction. For example, our place prepositions seem to come from more basic concepts like body parts. (i.e., ""in *back* of"") and abstract time expressions from less abstract place expressions (i.e., *past*, *before*). The articles *a/an* come from the less abstract number *one*, *the* is related to the physical pointing expression *this* or *that*, etc. The expression *to have* comes from more concrete expressions like *near me*, *to seize* or *to hold*, depending on the language. And on and on.

2. Reduction/Simplification: Especially on the level of pronunciation, there is a rather one-way process to slowly chip away at words, omitting, merging or reducing sounds or whole syllables. Also vowel sounds can be changed so that they are more similar and the word is marginally easier to produce. This is how we got the irregular plural feet, because the vowel in feet is the same as the vowel in the old Germanic plural -iz. Then the -iz was reduced, then omitted entirely.

3. Expressiveness: This is almost the opposite of reduction, but it refers to finding newer or more complex ways to say something to add emphasis, which may eventually become simply the required way to say something. For example, the word ""not"" (originally ne+wiht - ""not a whit"") became the required word for negation in English. And it was also reduced to one syllable.

These mechanisms result in different languages because of physical or social distance between populations, which makes their ways of speaking, over time, markedly different.

edit: Sorry for the long answer. I must have gotten some details a bit wrong (I did this to avoid other work and with no source at hand) but the main gist is accurate."
"A random fact from 9th grade biology got me an instant A in a college course once. We learned about evolution, and in particular we watched a video about the [Burgess Shale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgess_Shale) which is famous for its preservation of fossils. 

Day three of biology lecture in my first semester of college and the professor starts our section on evolution. He begins the class by talking about the fossil record and goes on to say ""There is a very famous place, known for it's preservation of fossils that we've learned a lot about evolutionary biology from. I always ask if anyone knows what this place is and so far I haven't gotten an answer in 4 semesters. So if anyone here can tell me what place I'm thinking of without looking it up, you can have an automatic A for the class as long as you still attend. I got the answer and showed up to class the rest of the semester. What would have been a C+ ended up being an A and I actually ended up graduating with honors by the skin of my teeth so it ended up mattering even more than I thought. Pretty cool. "

"Hi, yes the Annecy job.

I'm not sure where to start, it is an incredibly complex case, and there were numerous suspects and lines of enquiry. I will try not to go into too much detail but I may start rambling!

OK, so I pretty much lived this job for around 9 months. It consumed my whole life, and eventually cost me my job as for some unknown reason I just couldn't deal with it anymore. It gave me nightmares, I became depressed, and so on and so on.

So anyway, the long and short of it is that the primary suspect was the brother of the male victim, due to a dispute in a quite substantial (£1m+) inheritance from their father. The brother even went so far as to appear on a Panorama TV special to protest his innocence. To my mind he is the only person to have motive. The only other possibilities that I can see are a complete nutter with a random shooting (highly unlikely imo due to the remoteness of the location), or a case of mistaken identity.

There were numerous leads followed, such as sightings by local rangers of a specific type of motorbike, and a specific type of 4x4. I personally went through every single ferry record looking for these types of vehicles, and then compiling intel on the registered owners, their families and contacts. It took a long time!

At one point it was considered that espionage could have played a role in it, due to Said's (That was his name IIRC. I rarely remembered the names, I knew them all by their database nominations. It helped to keep a personal distance from the jobs) job with a satellite firm, but this was ruled out as he didn't work or have access to any classified material or documents.

There was also a cyclist who was killed at the scene. When I left, we had not really determined whether the cyclist was the intended victim and the family was just on the wrong place at the wrong time, or the other way around. We looked into the cyclist and could find absolutely no motive whatsoever for anyone wanting him dead, so as far as we were concerned, the family was the intended victim, and the cyclist a very unlucky witness.

It haunts me to this day because I worked well over 100 murders, and this is the only one that remains unsolved.

I hope that helps :)"

"A friend got a starter job in Hollywood. She's a writer, trying to break into the business, make connections, etc. 

She was thrilled to find out she'd be working on a Steven Spielberg project. Not bad for her first Real Hollywood Job. 

The job was continuity editor, meaning she'd watch a rough cut of a film over and over, looking for continuity errors and documenting them so they could be fixed in the final edit. 

Her first film: Schindler's List. 

She watched that movie dozens of times, and said it was just physically and emotionally draining...

"I was deployed, before I left I had told her that I probably wouldn't be able to get on Facebook or any of that, I could only use email. Fast forward to a month later my buddy went back to the big base and got on Facebook and saw her profile picture of her and another guy.

He came back and told me, I immediately emailed her with ""So, what's up?"" She must have known, and she replied back with ""hey sorry I was going to tell you when you got back, but I'm really happy and hope we can still be friends!""

7 years down the drain. The worst part was the break up ended up being dragged out for a year. I got back from deployment, she broke up with the guy right when I got back and tried talking to me. I put up a good fight for a couple months by ignoring her, but then finally caved. It took another 6-7 months before I realized this was a toxic relationship and my buddy literally threatened to beat me up if I didn't cut her off. So I did, I called her and said ""I never want to hear from you again, I'm done with this."" She replied ""okay"" and I hung up. That was almost 5 years ago and I haven't looked back. Way happier now."

"&gt; I've never understood that. If you think the fanbase is awful... just ignore the fanbase.
I mean, you're hardly obligated to see any of those things you listed. But I cannot understand how any fandom, good, bad, whatever, can affect wanting to see something.

For television shows/media especially, they can spoil the experience by just repeating the jokes that pop up ad nauseam. Like in Rick and Morty, a lot of jokes you would find funny just remind you about the idiots that repeat them over and over on reddit or tumble or facebook. For example, the ""What is my purpose?"" ""You pass the butter."" ""Oh my god"" was hilarious originally, but it'd be hard to enjoy or laugh at it after seeing it for the fortieth time because of all the memes about it on every social media site.

Social perception is a very real thing and saying ""just ignore it"" solves absolutely nothing. People can spoil media for other people. It's not just something people make up in their heads."

Well, the inherent logic in the idea says that it's one of most probable things that were in a simulation. It's like, imagine our civilization plus 1000 years, and think of the game The Sims. Where will The Sims be in 1000, or 10,000 years? Probably pretty damn good - the Sims will 'think' they're in a fully complete, logically accurate world and it will be almost identical (at the surface layer) to ours. 

Say a single copy of the game is sold - now there are two Earths where all its citizens think they're real. If you take a random person who has hopes and dreams and by all indications is a human being, there's a 50% chance they're in the universe described as 'real' - and they won't be able to tell which one they're in. Of course, multiple copies of the game will be sold. Many, many copies, and even more on the next version, or the next one. As long as humanity is alive, games of The Sims will be started, and there's one more Earth with people who think they're real. The chance that *you* are in that single real Earth? Nearly none. The chance that *you* are in one of the near-infinite Sims games? Almost 100%.

Even better is the fact that the Netflix series is ironing out a lot of those flaws, so it's also well worth a look."

"My biggest passion is exercise, nutrition and fitness.  I know you have probably tried many things, and that failure is disappointing and heartbreaking.

KEEP TRYING THOUGH.  My best advice to you is to find one single facet of being healthy that you can put your effort into to start.  You're not going to start eating a perfect diet and get into a training regimen overnight.  It is simply not going to happen.  You can pick up a healthy habit overnight though.

Are you completely sedentary?  Take a walk around the block every day.  Do 10 pushups a day.  Take the stairs at work.  Do a minute of crunches.

Do you eat fruits and vegetables?  Eat an apple a day.  Eat a serving of carrots.  Find a healthy food you can tolerate and make it a small snack.

Doing one thing is a huge step towards getting better.  It hurts me so much to see people that want to improve and become discouraged and fail.  My immediate family are all health nuts (which is where I got my habits from), but my extended family are very overweight.  I hear their struggle and want to help, but at the same time it is such a sensitive issue that I don't want to overstep my bounds.

Just do one thing.  10 pushups a day will take a couple minutes out of your day.  Even if you eat unhealthy for the day, you're going to build a little bit of muscle that wasn't there before.  An apple a day, even if you are eating more calories than you should be, is at least some fiber in your diet that wasn't there before.

You'll feel better if you make one thing a habit.  Next step is to pick up another habit.  In a month you can add another daily healthy action.  ""I've been eating an apple a day for a month.  Now I'm going to add 10 pushups.""

Really hope the best for you and your mother.  My heart goes out to you and know that you have people that pull for you."

"Maybe, just maybe, your leaders were confused by the geography of D.C. and thought it would be a convenient neighborhood from which to explore the city. 

Congress Heights sounds like it should be close to the U.S. Capitol Building. It actually is only five miles (or so) from the Capitol. But DC is a densely populated city (though not as dense as NYC or Chicago) and traffic is horrendous. And because D.C. has very real (though not de jure) racial and economic segregation, neighborhoods like Congress Heights are very different from neighborhoods five miles to the northwest of the Capitol (which are rather wealthy and fairly safe). Hell, if you'd stayed in Arlington you'd be closer to the Capitol than you were in Congress Heights; and Arlington is wealthy and very safe."

The child had been seen by doctors for a broken leg earlier in the year. The autopsy showed NUMEROUS broken bone spots, and the boy's privates basically had been stomped in on a regular basis. It's disgusting that NO ONE said anything and the system is so overworked that it failed this little boy.

They all talk with southern accents because of course they do, even though we're from Illinois.

Of course, it wasn't my dad, it was my uncle. He had looked up his work line, and lied to his secretary to talk to him. He starts begging for money, claiming his grandchildren are going to be left destitute if he doesn't get 20k and he knows he's good for it, this is the type of things you do for family, etc. Out of sick curiosity, he asked what he needed it for.

It was because he had sold his truck for my aunt to have money to gamble with, and needed to buy a new one, because she had blown through the 11K in two days. The truck he wanted was way nicer than his old one, because he figured he deserved it for his stress. He worked construction, and needed the truck to do his job, hence the hurry to get a new one.

"There was a comment thread a while ago about how the entertainment/modeling industry is predatory, and that a lot of models (usually female) have to sleep with sleazy executives to advance their career. There were quite a few highly upvotes comments from guys who were saying that they wish they could get opportunities by sleeping around, and how women have it easy. I think they fantasized about sleeping with a Sharon Stone-type MILF, when the reality is that they would probably have to sleep with sleazy male executives too.

Oh and don't get me started on rape threads. If the victim is female, it turns to ""Men get raped too!"". And in male rape threads, if the woman is even remotely attractive there's a bunch of comments saying ""Lucky guy, at least he got some!"" Or ""Where were these teachers when I was in school?!"" "

During the day she has aides and nurses come to help care for her (change her diaper, get her to the bathroom, get her food, etc.).  Some of the nurses and aides are covered by her insurance, but she needs more and is always hiring new aides on the side.  She bitches that the people she gets aren't worth what she's paying them.  I've told her repeatedly that you're not going to attract qualified people offering $20/hour and 1 hour/day.  It's not even worth it for these people to drive to the house for $20, let alone drive there, deal with her needs and then drive home.  There's something weird about the nursing profession where people see it as being an altruistic exercise instead of being an actual job."
"Threw one down a hillside of cholla cactus. They took him away in an ambulance and he never dared to even look at me again.

Grabbed one by the back of the shirt and beat him in the head with my lunchbox until his scalp came away from his skull. Took him away in an ambulance and his dad came by my house and made him thank me. 

One wanted to fight after school so I broke his arm in two places and he lay screaming in a dry wash until the ambulance came and got him. Him and all his dickhead buddies stayed away from me after that.

My family moved constantly, so I had to deal with bullies a lot. Eventually, I just became one vicious little bastard and that worked pretty well. Also, I never got in much trouble because they were well known bullies. I remember my mom looking at me after the lunchbox thing like I was a complete stranger.

The redhead follows, asking for a loaf of bread. Finally, the blond makes her request; she asks for a car door. Wishes completed, they go on their way. The two ask the brunette why she asked for a gallon of water. ""Well, if we ever get thirsty we can drink it!"" she replied. The other two nod, seeing the wisdom of the request. They then ask the redhead why she asked for a loaf, and she states, ""if we ever get hungry, we can stop and eat a bite"". Finally, they ask the blonde why she would ask for a heavy car door. ""It's simple,"" she states, ""if we ever get too hot, we can roll down the window!"""

I lived in America ever since I was a baby but knew my native language since I spoke my native language with my parents. When I went to my home country for the first time I lived at a relative's house. I once heard two of my female cousins talking in the native language that they wanted to kiss me (we were 12 years old at the time). I awkwardly shrugged it off at the time but later in the day when I spoke in my native language instead of English they were shocked. Their faces turned red and they started avoiding me for a few weeks after that
"I was 10 years old and my parents took me to their friends house for dinner. The friends hated children and I was such an inconvenience being there. I knew she hated kids so I just sat quietly reading or playing a game. 

Their house backed on to a huge park. From their deck you could see a little river. There was a gate leading out from  their fence. The Friend told me to go look at the ducks while the grown ups talk. I declined. She said it again a little more forcefully. I declined again. My dad then insisted. At the time it was getting cold and the friend gave me a giant heavy jumper(sweater) to wear. I walked down a big hill to the river. There was a path on the other side. I was bored out of my brain. Yay, ducks. A family walked by and smiled at me. A few minutes later a couple walked past and also smiled. I smiled back being polite. 

The two guys walked past. One in his late twenties and another in his late thirties with a scruffy dark beard. Scruffy beard smiled and I smiled back. He stopped the younger guy, the pointed to me and said ""get her"". Before I knew it the younger guy had jumped down the embankment only the rocks and began crossing to my side. I ran. I ran as fast as I could up a hill in a heavy jumper. 

I could hear him breathing behind me. He grabbed the jumper and we both fell up on the hill. I got up and tried running again, yelling for my parents. They should have been able to see me. He grabbed my ankle and I fell again. I kicked him in the face and ran. I got through the gate in the fence and he tried breaking through too. 
I ran up the stairs and inside to my parents. They just looked at me. I yelled ""couldn't you hear me?!"" The friend saw I had grass stains on her jumper. She started yelling at me for getting it dirty. I tried telling my parents what had happened and began to cry. The friend yelled at me to shut up. She promptly said ""children should be seen not heard"". With that I was made to sit down and not say a word. 

I was shaking for the rest of the night. When we left I asked my parents if they were going to call the police. I was told how much I embarrassed them instead. 27 years later, I still have nightmares about it. "
"Yeah...imagine that long, extremely cold, very dark winter. Nothing to do in town. Booze is illegal. To get to a city of any size (Fairbanks) you have to literally fly over nothing for 500 miles. 

You wait and wait for the light to get brighter, and your smuggled booze to arrive, and the temperature to get over 0C. Finally, one warm day in April it does. Summer is almost here.

It's now light almost constantly. The pack ice is starting to retreat. You get a flew brief flurries of snow in early June, but that's it. Summer is here. One day in July it hits 50F (10C) and you get out your shorts and flip flops. Tourists are here every day. You sit on the beach and watch them get in the 35F water and chuckle. 

By late September, everything is frozen again. Until next April. 

Canadians of course have places just like this, even smaller and a little colder too. But Europeans do as well: Svalbard. 

I've been to Barrow just a couple times, but long enough to know I wouldn't live there. That's the problem these communities are facing though: how do they hold on to their culture while so many young want to escape and essentially blend in to America. Move to Anchorage or even the lower 48. "

"When I yelled ""EVERYBODY HOLD UP YOUR BEER!"" on a bus that the groomsmen were on at a wedding. 

Context: I helped film weddings when I was a teen and was still learning the ropes of it all. My boss and I were getting shots after the wedding when the groomsmen got into one of those transfer shuttles to go to the reception. My boss suggested I shout that phrase to get a nice dolly-like shot as I walked down the aisle with everyone holding their mugs up. He was a happy-go-lucky kind of guy that could totally pull it off, and get a good reaction. I was an awkward 15 y.o... I really didn't want to do it but he insisted on it and of course me being a weak-ass, I gave in. I'm standing at the front  of the bus with the camera while all the guys are chatting it up. I have serious doubts and a total lack of confidence and my heart is racing. I look down at my boss who is standing at the bottom of the entrance and he's giving me an encouraging nod and smile. I yell out the dreaded phrase in probably the most monotone voice you can yell in. Cue everyone stopping mid-conversation with a confused look on their face, taking a quick look at their mug, then slowly raising it up. The silence was deafening as I walked down the aisle to get the shot. For some reason, one of the bridesmaids was on the back of the bus sitting by herself, no drink. As I approached the back of the bus I thought she may have been the saving grace for the shot by maybe giving a smile or a wave. Nope. She just glared into the camera with a confused look on her face. Got the shot and did the walk of shame back towards the front of the bus. 

It was so soul crushingly awkward that I still quiver at the thought of it many years later."

She lived with a herd of miniature angus cows and one day a bull came to briefly join the herd.  There was no way the bull and Ruby were going to procreate. She was a giant compared to him, but they were best buds. Not long after, the client came back for the bull and I remember Ruby lowed for hours.

I'm Libertarian, but these are my views:

* I don't want big government. The reason being is that our government is incredibly corrupt and inefficient. However, private corporations are equally if not more corrupt than the government. In fact, the government and private corporations are one in the same today.


* Because of this, I am highly against both the DNC and RNC, and rather than the typical left/right debate points(abortion, taxes, religion etc) I am more concerned with lobbying and corporate influence on politics. Neither party addresses this(left or right) so as a result I dislike both and have a nagging feeling that the system has to implode.



* Do you believe in open borders? If no, then you HAVE to believe in regulating your own borders. The only question is to what extent. But wanting to curb immigration does not mean that you are racist. 


* People kill people, not guns. Blaming guns on murder is stupid imo.



* Communism will never work in reality because it relies on a classless society as a fundamental tenant of it. That is impossible, human beings will always introduce a hierarchical class system if they are sedentary. It is unavoidable. That is why I prefer capitalism to communism. "

"I mean, if you think China's too dirty for ya... India and most of SE Asia should be crossed out too.

I think Westerners have this weird expectation of China to be some sort of hyper-modern place, prolly mostly because the media loves to use it to juxtapose America's so-called economic decline. Perhaps the fact that China's hyper-rich tend to immigrate/travel has something to do with it. 

But take those eye-popping GDP numbers and divide it per capita - China's still a poor country, and is just a generation removed from the cultural revolution and people marching the streets with their little red books. 

When you see that old grandmother helping their kid piss on the street... remember that this was a person that lived through the Japanese occupation, the famines of the Great Leap, the chaos of the cultural revolution, and only a couple decades of frantic urbanization.

Set your expectations right... and China is a wonderful, fascinating country. Get out of the cities and it's gorgeous, too."

After the great kanto Earthquake of 1923, there was definitely some mob lynching and violence against Koreans who thought to be hoarding food and water.

*1923* FFS. Nearly a hundred years ago. Times have changed.

&gt; So, every time there was an earthquake or something in Tokyo (not uncommon) the ultra nationalists would gather at Foreigner town while riot police had to hold them back from trying to go in there and hurt people because they thought they might be able to get away with it during any sort of disaster. Uncle and cousins lived there for years and had to deal with this several times. Definitely not safe to be on the streets. 

This is hilarious. You are a fantastic troll. You got me.

&gt; My cousin was a tall, blue eyed, blonde kid.

Of course, there's one or two in *every* Japan story. 

&gt; pretty fucked up when people are running after you and cutting pieces of your hair off with scissors every few days.

No, man, just no. There are tall blonde people everywhere nowadays. You might get pointed out and have some girls giggle if you're way out in the country somewhere, but that'd be it. Certainly not in a big city. These foreigners who come to Japan nowadays and think they are going to stand out like crazy for being tall or blonde are fucking hilarious. No one cares.

"It's your membership fee to the country, and in the US it's insanely complicated. Once a year, the government requires you to submit proof that you paid *all* of the membership fees that apply to you throughout the last year. If you paid too much, you get some money back. If you didn't pay enough, you have to pay some more. 

Your membership fee is based on your income and social status (married, single, age, number of kids, etc.). Your membership fees are collected constantly through material purchases (sales tax to your county and state), your regular paycheck (FICA), and a bunch of other places that may or may not apply to you (capital gains tax on earned profits, property tax on land you own, etc). 

This membership fee goes towards fixing roads, keeping parks clean, keeping the government running, funding different agencies, and so on (or at least it should go to these things...).

"My mother. She would force us to do things and never explain to me why we did things certain ways. Like when I wanted to learn about my religion, the one I'd been following for... Eight years, she just says ""just because."" and slaps me in public for mentioning that maybe I shouldn't participate in it because I can't understand the thought behind it or the origin. 

She still hasn't explained it and I haven't bothered to learn about it. It makes me think she's just following her faith blindly. 

She also let my little brother get away with abuse towards me and my father. Both physical and verbal. I've gone to school with bruises and tried to get help for my brother, without my mother knowing, but she found out and screamed at me for half an hour that I needed help instead of her son. I lost all faith in her and despise her for blaming me for the abuse. She lets his behavior slide because he's her son. 

Too bad for her, I'm not letting her meet her grandchildren. I don't want anything to do with her, nor her influence upon them. My fiance agrees after seeing her behavior towards me.

"Not to take anything away from what you're saying but most people don't realize men go through almost their entire lives with little to no emotional support, even from an early age.  If anything, they experience emotional suppression more often than anything else, where their emotions are actively discouraged, and not just by peers.  It's not hard to imagine what a lifetime of that does to anyone.  You see it in women but it's often trauma and abuse cases.  For men, it's just business as usual.  Then they become adults and get berated again for having difficulty expressing affection, support, etc."

Having a family is a pretty big career killer for women.

"Another 9/11 laugher here. This is going be be long, but I've needed to get this off my chest for a long time. 

I walked into class right after the first plane hit. TV was already on, and the teacher was sort of mid-explanation with the kids who'd already arrived. 

I thought I caught the gist of it, and burst out laughing--like a legitimate fit of laughter--only to be confronted by a dozen disturbed, confused, moderately outraged glares. 

I was 15 at the time. Based on the previous ten or so years' experiences, I had really normalized those kind of reactions into an understanding that nobody really got my sense of humor which, in hindsight, was generally either too morbid or obscure for my audience--but back then I was all too well acquainted with taking it as everyone else being too stupid, typical 15-year-old arrogance. 

So there I am, classroom dead silent save for the TV, trying to explain between bursts of laughter and wiping away the tears of hilarity, how wasted that pilot must have been to not see a giant building looming in front of him, I mean, who gave that guy a flying license anyway? 

I was interrupted by the teacher's stern affirmation, ""um, a lot of people just died.""  At this point everyone else is slack-jawed. 

That explanation made no difference to me, and I kept laughing, ""I mean, did he leave his glasses at home or what?""

Teacher's expression starts to melt away from outrage to sympathy, and he said it so quietly: ""superusurper, it wasn't the pilot. Somebody hijacked the plane.""

""Wait, what? (still laughing) They did it on purpose? But like, (still laughing) how did they think they could run into a building and not die?"" My sides were hurting at this point back then, but in the re-telling it's just my conscience that aches. 

""They didn't."" 

""Wait, so....""

""They wanted to kill people, on purpose, and they knew they were going to die when they did it.""

""But, what? Why?""

I'd like to say there went the last of my innocence, but similar experiences keep coming around to knock me down. I will probably always be ignorant about certain aspects of human nature, I will probably always be surprised. 

I'll never forget the final answer I got that day. The teacher, my classmates, all looking at me like some sad, sheltered thing to be pitied. He said to me, and to the rest of the class, ""We don't know. We might not ever really know. But a lot of people are going to try very hard to find out. You're all going to remember this day for the rest of your lives, we can only pray there aren't more to come.""

I wish I'd had more respect for the gravity of the situation, but in all honesty, I gave it about half an hour before I was laughing again, re-telling the story about how I was so stupid I'd assumed it was an accident. Of course, nobody found it funny. Story of my life. To this day, I get more laughs when I'm being serious. "

"Is the same with one of the most scummy persons I ever meet and worked with I can can say. He's a bouncer. If you already imagine a massive guy that looks like a shaved gorilla you are wrong. He should be 21 now, but he looks few years younger, skinny and short. 

He's dad was very rich, not because he was a business man, but because he did a lot of illegal stuff to get there like usury (think this is the right English word), until he ended up in jail. However he tried to teach his son not to be like him, I know a lot off those because I meet people that knows him for years and told me a lot about this guy and his father. His dad tried to keep him in school and encouraged him to study and do sport for a better future. The result was a spoiled child that ended up with everything left from his father. I have no idea how much remained beside the house and the car, because as is normal much of it was confiscated.

Now everything you can hear from him is how he lives in luxury and how he has sex with another woman every day. He boast about how he play on slot machines thousands of euros and he does not stop until he lose them all because he likes to play a lot on slot machines on big bets. He tells everyone how he smokes lots of high quality weed and he always sees himself as an alpha.

The reality: everyone hates him. Some may defend him and say that he's misunderstood, but trust me, he's beyond redemption. He has no electricity on his house because he never payed the bill. From other sources I know that he consume a lot of strange cheap drugs, one he came at work high as fuck and the manager found him sleeping in the looker room, one reason to result in his fire days later. I'm not the kind to care about cell phones and judge people by them, but how rich he brags about to be, he used a really old shitty cell phone most of time without credit. A lot of people that knows him for years confessed to me how everything he says is a lie, and the worse is that he believes himself.

I know I miss some stuff to add about him, but that really miss me now. I'll come back with an update if I remember anything else. 

This is part of ""Fuck my life"" series. I shall write a book one day about my life and people I meet. The hard cover version will come along with a bottle of bleach.

Thank you a lot, seeing people on the Internet giving compliments to non native speakers about their English instead of doing a big case about a grammar mistake is very refreshing and give me a feeling that there is still hope for humanity.

"Let me see if I understand your story correctly:  

Wife appears desperate for money during court proceedings.  
Husband drags out court proceedings hoping to financially ruin Wife.  
The dragging out has ~~apparent~~  negative effects on Wife: she loses her job and has to move in with family.  
Something happens where the court discovers the husband's nefarious plan and decides to force him to pay, leaving him in the financial ruin he'd intended to trap Wife with, as well as ongoing child support.  

After court proceedings end, ~~Wife reveals she was never hurting for money, and actually had enough money to buy a house in cash.~~  
~~*Or* perhaps she *was* financially ruined, but~~  backpay of monies owed was a windfall that allowed her to buy a house outright.   

Is that correct?

I'm a guy and do this on purpose at work. I've even tested it and no clue why but I've gotten better reviews and surveys almost unanimously when I do it. It's also hilarious to see a surprised expression on people's face when I drop my voice 1/2-1 octave back to my normal voice depending on where it was when the interaction started. I'm really curious why that happens though because I'm not a big guy in any sense of the words at 5'6 and 160lbs nor is my voice really that deep.

"This may sound childish or whatever, but I was watching Fairy Tail with my little sister and a character, Erza Scarlet, said something to another character, Minerva. I think Minerva gave up on life or something and Erza wasn't having it. She told her something along the lines of ""No matter what, someone, somewhere out there is waiting for you to come home"". That hit me deep, as I am going through some serious depression/situational sadness that is eating at my soul and made me actually contemplate suicide for a bit. Now I repeat that in my mind whenever I think about really giving up. 

Thank you Fairy Tail. From the bottom of my heart."

"Not sure - I saw her at school with the ambulance service. The underlying mechanism is the same; the heart is a hardworking muscle and blood supply is not meeting demand. At that age she's probably a bit too young for your classic atherosclerotic plaque rupture (although yes deposition is a gradual process that begins in childhood and just like in adults, the same risk factors apply) so you think of alternatives such as other vasculopathies (what else can go wrong with the tubes to block them), coagulopathies (what can go wrong with the blood flowing through), dissection (blood vessel tears so blood leaks out rather than flowing through to supply downstream tissue), spasm (arteries themselves have a muscular layer in their walls, which can constrict &amp; block flow) or congenital structural abnormality (blood vessel(s) developed wrong in utero).

It's a weird dynamic that people want to keep the status quo and helping the child makes people place blame on the person who helps instead of the abuser.

"I can actually relate to this. My dad got really into gardening. I didn't mind helping out at first because it was a small patch on the side of the house, and he let me grow some basil. But pretty soon he expanded to the field and filled up about an acre with pumpkins and plants. It got to a point where he was making me go out there pretty much every freaking day to pull weeds and pick pests off the plants for a couple hours, waking me up at 6-7am on weekends. Which really sucked because I _did_ have a budding interest in botany around that time and was growing some stuff in pots on the porch.

Dragging my ginger ass into the Florida mid summer  heat for 2 hours a day killed that pretty quick. That shit got old real fast. I put up with it for a year or two before I just had enough. Im only just now getting an interest in gardening again... 7 years later when I've got my own place and can work on appropriately sized projects for me to enjoy.

He was really stern on making me constantly work out there, but to be fair he didn't put up a huge fight when I decided I was done with that life.

I suppose the only real reason I'm bitter about it is when I got older, around 15-16, I had a huge interest on blacksmithing. They even got me classes for my birthday. However I couldn't get him to help me get a forge set up to save my life. Every weekday he'd be tired from work and every weekend he'd be doing his own projects. We lived in a rural area so it wasn't like I could get a job and drive around. It took 3 years to get a simple gas forge and anvil, and a couple tools together. Which by that point I was balls deep in college, had my own job, and planning to move to another country.

I love my parents and appreciate the fact that they at least supported my interest in principle. So now I just watch Alec Steele on YouTube. Who started blacksmithing around the same age as me, has a booming business and his own property at 19 😂🔫"

"Yeah that was terrible, and pointless. 

I think this was the era that the producers were on the internet too much and were listening to ""fans"". Many fans wanted to know what the deal with Jack's tattoo's (which are mostly his real life tattoo's). Since there were so many questions about them, and fans thought that they had some sort of significance in regards to the island, they wanted to know.

So this sloppy episode was written.

Also fans kept saying ""what about the other survivors just hanging around in the background, wtf are they doing?""

So the writers wrote in ""Nikki and Paulo"" in order to address this, but they did it so badly, that fans instantly fucking hated the characters. So the producers had to scramble and kill them off at the earliest opportunity. The characters had longer story arcs written and were to be involved in future seasons. In the end, they got accidentally buried alive... So long Nikki and Paulo, and good riddence.

Dude fell to the ground, and this kid just kept screaming and pushing harder and harder, then threw the dude down a hill next to where they were standing. The other people were in such shock that they didn't retaliate or anything, and the kid just walked off. Pretty sure I saw him wiping blood off his hands so I left him alone.

"Yeah, a few years back, my local theaters rolled out their popcorn bucket thing. Basically, you pay like ~~$20~~ $21 for a large plastic popcorn bucket, and then you get as many free refills as you want for the rest of the year. Then the next year, it became a quarter for each refill. Every year, the price of the refills have slowly increased in price to the point where it's now ~~$4.00~~ $4.25 for each refill. At that point, you may as well just buy the bag of popcorn by itself and save you the ~~$20~~ $21. I have thought of buying the popcorn bucket, and filling it with popcorn from home, and even hiding entire combo meals from Wendy's or something underneath the popcorn.

"Nothing as serious as some of these, but when I was seven, my mom and I flew out to visit my sister in Boston. It was my first flight and first time to meet my BIL and his family-- extremely uptight wealthy family. I got yelled at for asking for ketchup to put on my lobster. I know that was an abomination, but I didn't like it.
After supper, as the family sat around talking, I fell asleep curled up in a chair. Everyone else decided to go up to the third floor balcony thingie to sit and watch the ocean as the sun went down. Apparently, they lost track of time and forgot about me. 
I woke up in a pitch black, unfamiliar house with no one around. I called for my mom and sister, but no one answered.

He said it turned out to be the top of her head and the shoulder. Anyway he called the police and they dug her body out of the gravel. Nobody really knows who or why she was killed but, coincidentally, I work with both of her older sisters now. "

"This is probably going to get buried, but it was one of my first interactions in college in Mississippi. 

I was a freshman, and didn't know anyone bc I didn't grow up in MS. I sat with a new friend group, and we were talking about what classes we were taking:

Ashley: what language are you taking?

Me: Chinese

Ashley: oh? Why....

Me: what do you mean why? I mean, I guess it's because I'm trying to get to know my roots or whatever - haha.

Ashley: but...why Chinese? I thought you were Asian?

Me: *bursts out laughing at her joke*

Ashley: *stares at me dumbfounded* so, like, your mom is Chinese and your dad is Asian

Me: wait what? You know that China is in Asia right? 

Ashley: I don't get geometry.

Me: *suddenly realizes why Mississippi education is in last place and feels really bad*



It gets worse if you want to keep reading...I felt bad so I tried to help her understand.

Me: well you know how [city name] is in Mississippi? Well, it's the same idea. China is in Asia. 

Ashley: so China is the town you grew up in?

Me: oh shit, that's my fault, let me try again. You know how the U.S. is in North America? 

Ashley: uhhh.... PupperoniBologna, the U.S. *is* North America. 


😫 This is what poor education and abstinence only sex education gets you. Lots and lots of teenage babies that end up very helpless. And yes, before you ask, our school had very low standards for entry, especially if you were a Mississippi native bc of poor high school education. It's an all around cluster fuck of bad.

"I'm a firefighter/paramedic. A few years ago we were called to an older gentleman who was in and out of consciousness. When we arrived he was awake and talking, but quite weak. We moved him to the ambulance and I was the medic who was treating him en route to the hospital. I had the heart monitor turned slightly towards me so I could watch his rate and I was focused on starting an IV and a few other things. He was watching his heart on the monitor, as the monitor was only about two feet in front of him. I found out why he kept passing out, as he was watching the monitor his heart stopped flat - went straight into asystole. He looked at me and put his hand on my knee like he was going to say something then his eyes rolled back and he went down. We coded him the rest of the way to the ER and he passed away. So I'd have to say the worst thing to see immediately before dying is your own heart stopping on the monitor. "

"(Copying my post from another thread) 

When I was in high school I was home alone one night during the winter, and I was upstairs on the computer. I was on AIM talking to someone when I specifically remember having an uneasy feeling, and telling the person I was IMing that I felt like someone was in the house, or that I was being watched. I went to the downstairs and peeked around the corner and saw our back door that went into our sun room wide open. It was about 10 degrees out and no one else was there, but this door was open. I freaked out and ran to the kitchen and got a big ass knife. I started screaming shit like I knew someone was there, like ""I see you mother fucker! I called the cops!"" or whatever, I don't remember. I walked through the house in a way that no one could get out past me without me seeing,so I thought. After I cleared the house I assumed maybe it wasn't latched and a draft pushed the door open or something. Got over it pretty quick. Anyway, later that night, about 5 houses down a woman was tied up in her bedroom by a man with a knife who threatened to kill her. I don't remember the specifics, but she somehow escaped and called the cops and the guy was never caught.

Still have no idea if anyone was in my house that same night, but it's an awfully weird coincidence if not.

EDIT: Holy shit, I searched and I found the news article for it. This was definitely it, some of my details weren't perfect, but this is it... turns out he was caught. Nice... and since none of us even live near here anymore, its all good it gives pretty specific locations. http://www.toledoblade.com/Police-Fire/2002/08/03/Gum-at-crime-scene-puts-bite-on-suspect.html

"Who's more foolish? 
The fool? 
Or the fool who follows him?"
"NOOOO! With black or brown bears yes, for the most part. With grizzly bears not so much. Every encounter is different. 

First of all, rule #1 of bear safety is keeping your distance and not surprising bears. Most bears will avoid humans if they hear them coming.

Black bears: Don't run, but slowly back away, watching the bear. Increase the distance between you and the bear. The bear will probably do the same. 

If a black bear persistently follows or approaches you, without vocalizing, or paw swatting: Change your direction. If the bear continues to follow you, stand your ground. If the bear gets closer, talk loudly or shout at it. Act aggressively to intimidate the bear.

Do not play dead!!

Grizzlies: If you encounter a grizzly, do not run. Avoid direct eye contact. Walk away slowly, if the bear is not approaching. If the bear charges, stand your ground (you cannot outrun it). Don’t scream or yell. Speak in a soft monotone voice and wave your arms to let the animal know you are human.

If the animal makes contact, curl up into a ball on your side, or lie flat on your stomach. Interlock your fingers around your neck and lay as face down as possible. Protect your life, not your limbs. Try not to panic; remain as quiet as possible until the attack ends. Be sure the bear has left the area before getting up to seek help

*If you are attacked* by a brown/grizzly bear, leave your pack on and PLAY DEAD. Lay ﬂat on your stomach with your hands clasped behind your neck. Spread your legs to make it harder for the bear to turn you over. Remain still until the bear leaves the area.

*if you are attacked* by blackbear, do not play dead. Fight back and concentrate your punches and kicks towards the face and muzzle.

No matter what type of bear, if you are in Bear Country, wherever you are hiking or going you should be whistling or talking aloud to yourself or to anyone near you or playing music allowed on your phone because the number 2 rule is to not startle a bear. When they say wear Bells around your waist or on your shoes, they're not kidding. You need to be making enough noise that if I bear hears you coming they will leave the area because Bears really don't want to deal with you.

Rule number three is if you have any food on you drop it as you flee."

"Not a teacher, unfortunately, but I used to help out at kindergarten classes for community service. My last year of doing it I helped out in a bilingual class, the kids were sweet, and aside from being very tiring, they were fun to work with. Except for one girl. She was very blunt, unthoughtful, and overall a very rude child. But the problem was that she didn't seem to understand that what she would do was rude. For instance, she slapped my ass out of the blue, and I tried to remain calm as I explained to her that we shouldn't touch people like that, especially without their permission. She just giggled. A few days pass and as I was helping some other kids with their work, I hear the teacher say something, but her voice is very serious. I turn around and I see my teacher grabbing the girl's wrist, and telling her that she can't touch other people like that. The girl just smiled. Soom after, I asked the teacher what the problem was and she looked at me with wide eyes. ""She slapped me on my butt! Can you believe it? She thought the whole thing was a game!"" We both talked about our experiences, and soon enough it was behind us and we didn't think much of it, just kids picking up bad habits. That is until one day I'm helping the kids put on their jackets and scarves and all that, and I'm talking to the teacher, asking her if all the kid's parents from a certain group will pick them up. She nods, but tells me that the ass slapper girl's babysitter comes pick her up. I always waited until the last kid was picked up before I left, and usually the parents are always on time. Think of 90% of the kids getting picked up in 5-10 minutes. Twenty minutes in and this girl and I are still waiting for her babysitter. Finally, she appears. Not flustered or hurried to be so late, but instead she walked very calmly around the corner, cracking her gum as loudly as possible. When she walked up to where we were sitting, I had to help the kid up, because the babysitter made no effort to help the kid off the floor. No hello or anything either, I greeted her and asked if she was the girl's babysitter, and she just looks at me and sniffs. She didn't hold the girl's hand or say hi to her either. Just waited for her to get on her feet and they promptly walked out of the building. I soon found out that the girl only sees her mother in the morning, and that both of her parents work super late every day. Which meant that this poor girl was spending the majority of her time with a lazy, rude, piece of shit of a babysitter. Suddenly all of her actions made sense, and I felt an immediate sense of pity. Poor girl didn't know any better. "

"Get ready for the most bone chilling moment of my life!

When I was younger (13/14), some friends and I were out drinking beers on a local park/field. It's a pretty big place, with lots of copses and wildly overgrown areas and such.

Anyway, it gets to around 11:30, and we've ran out of beer so we decide to head home. It's Autumn so really fucking dark, and this park at night can be quite creepy (especially given some of the things that have happened in the various parts of it, including but not limited to murders, rapes, muggings etc.), and we keep hearing voices in the distance but never in any single, particular direction. As we start getting further through the park we hear the voices quite loudly, and clearly, on the other side of a relatively overgrown clearing. There's a small campfire on the other side and we can see two caravans and trucks parked up (the park was a popular place for Irish travellers to rest up for a while).

I don't really remember what they were saying, but I remember us all being quite unnerved by the whole situation, so being the clever guys we were we decided to cut through one of the copses to go around the clearing (which was between us and the park exit we needed). As we're going through the trees, snapping twigs and being loud, we notice the voices have stopped.

There's silence as we all stop walking. The hair on the back of my neck is standing up, all of us are just frozen in place. Were we about to be murdered by a bunch of Irish travellers (because hey, casually stereotyping strangers is what we do best!)?!?

Then we hear a horrifying, gut-wrenching scream, the kind of scream that we thought meant someone was dying. It made all of us jump out of our skin. It was...well...horrible.

We're staring out towards this campfire now, and see what looks like a body without a head lying next to the fire, with what looks like a head sitting a little bit further away.

Now, again, we're very clever and decided to go *towards* the screaming and the body and the campfire with the travellers (luckily, though, one of the trucks blinded whoever was at the campfire to our approach).

And as we get closer, inching our way out of the trees towards this campfire, the light makes everything clear. We couldn't believe it.

The body was a rolled up sleeping bag with a jumper on it. The head was a rugby ball. The scream, as we realised once the tension washed away, was a fox. This was just a normal group of Irish travellers, sat around a campfire having a good time.

Those few minutes of slowly creeping through the woods and towards the ""body"" were the most bone-chilling moments of my life, which I'm realising now has not been a very interesting life to live."

"I'm just a lowly intern at an ISP so I don't know a ton. But based on what what I know, the stance is this:

Free and open internet is supported. I don't know how anyone could argue in support of censorship and ISPs (at least my company) shares this sentiment. They do not care what you do when using their service, as long as you're paying them for it. There is no intent to block certain sites. The idea that there is seems to be a (very popular) myth. The term Net Neutrality is a bit of misnomer. The way I had it explained to me was in relation to abortion rights. Each side of the argument (Pro-life or Pro-choice) refer to themselves in a way that sounds marketable to outsiders. The same is the case here. Those who want internet service to be regulated under Title II refer to their argument as ""Net Neutrality"" even though there really isn't anyone arguing that the internet shouldn't be free and open.

I think what makes many people nervous is the fact that they're afraid ISPs will begin to charge them extra to access certain sites. As per the stance mentioned above, that is not the case. What ISPs do want to do is charge higher rates to large corporations (Google, Netflix, etc.) who use disproportionately huge amounts of ISPs' networks. This is the reason these businesses (Google, Netflix, etc.) support Net Neutrality, not because they support free/open internet, but because losing this battle will cut into their profits. The same reason ISPs don't want to lose this battle. Losing will cut into their profits.

My company also argues that the money lost from being unable to charge these companies more is money that can't be used to invest into their infrastructure. In their words, that means less services provided to more impoverished areas, aka areas where it is less profitable for the ISP to provide internet service. Interpret that how you will.

I think it's also relevant to mention that until last year, internet service was not regulated under Title II. ""Losing"" Net Neutrality would merely remove Internet service from under Title II, which is how things were up until 2016.

Take all this with a grain of salt becuase I just started as an intern and I'd also consider myself remarkably uninformed for someone who works at an ISP.

Edit: I realize this stance is probably very unpopular on Reddit, but please remember, I am merely the messenger, relaying the stance of an ISP to you, as the question asked.

Edit 2: A lot of people are asking how ISPs can justify charging popular services extra for using their network. The logic is this: The companies that are responsible for the most traffic (Netflix/Google/etc.) put enough stress on the network that the infrastructure needs to be improved. ISPs want to pass the cost of improving infrastructure onto the aforementioned companies, rather than their consumers. And yes, I realize that then means those companies (Netflix/Google/etc.) would just pass that cost to their own customers. So either way the consumer pays. But will it be ISP customers or Netflix/Google/etc. customers?

This comment also seems to have really upset a lot of people. Again, I am only trying to provide insight regarding the stance of an ISP on the subject of net neutrality. I am not actively endorsing these sentiments, you are arguing with an ISP who cannot hear you."

"I was best friends with this kid when I was younger, like elementary and middle school. He was always acting out a little, but nothing too serious. Lived with his grandparents, never had any idea where his mom or dad was (he never really talked about them), and his grandparents were really strict. We got in trouble quite often, but really just petty shit. Worst was picking up a purse that someone had left in the middle of the street (left on roof of car and fell off) and taking the money out of it. Like 8th/9th grade year, he just up and disappeared, and found out he went to live with his mom in Chicago.

Comes back a year or two later, and is a completely different person. Talks about being in a gang in Chicago (no idea if it was true or not). He starts going way off the deep end, robbing houses, stealing, assault, generally not giving a shit. In and out of juvie for a while.

After high school he ends up getting out, see him around and talks all this shit about how he is turning his life around. Ended up robbing my roommates family's place with another friend of ours, gets busted and goes to big boy jail for a while. After a few years, he gets out, and this time there is no illusion that he is up to no good. He's got the complete jailhouse makeover, teardrop tattoos around the eye included, and is essentially dealing drugs and robbing houses again. I talk to him and we hang out a little bit, he tries to make amends for the robbery, but we both (roommate and I) keep our distance cause we really don't want to fuck with this guy and we don't want him pissed off with us. Funny thing was, I still got the impression that this dude would have laid down in traffic for me if I needed him to.

Not too long after, I find out that he killed someone and burned the body in a drug deal gone bad (allegedly). Wasn't a huge surprise at that point, and wasn't a surprise that the victim was someone from the same neighborhood we grew up in. He just did not have any fucks to give about many other people, and his selfish motivations would overrule his compassionate side in every critical situation. I really wished he could have turned it around, but there was just no saving this guy, and I am really glad he is off the streets and out of my life."

"Not OP, but maybe just don't get a spaniel. Along with many other breeds, they have the potential for a lot of health problems due to the inherent inbreeding, and sometimes not getting them fixed can exacerbate these problems. Not sure if this is the case with females, but my parent's spaniel developed a weird growth/tumor right between his tail and anus and the area would get infections until they had surgery to remove it. However, to prevent the dog from being incontinent (mostly), the surgeon essentially had to remove what few bones remained in his tail (it had been cropped) and use the extra tissue to cover the removal site. Apparently this could have been avoided if he had been neutered, still not really sure why my parents didn't have that done when they got the dog. Sorry for the tangent, but the point is be careful when choosing dog breeds, also have your pets fixed if they aren't already, otherwise you'll end up with a dog that's completely blind due to cataracts (which may or may not be more of a problem for spaniels, statistically speaking), has no tail and what is essentially a broken asshole. I don't know if the vessel erosion is a common problem for spaniels, but it wouldn't surprise me."

"Family law attorney here a/k/a glorified babysitter. 

Let's see:

One client said that father's visitation should be limited because his girlfriend's shirts are too low cut.

Another client was ordered to box up his wife's belongings (and some of the child's belongings) and hand it over to her (she had him arrested and moved out). When I followed up with him, he said all went smoothly - did as the Judge directed. When we get to court, opposing counsel informs the judge (with color photographs), that he boxed up garbage. Literally took garbage into stuffed each box with it. When I asked why he did that, he said ""my wife only owned garbage. That's what she left behind.""

Same client - who was actually the worst client I ever had - once threatened to call child protective services and allege that the mother was neglecting and mistreating their daughter. The problem was that there was a full stay-away criminal court order of protection against him (in favor of the mom and child). I told him that if CPS deems that to be true, his daughter might end up with the state. His response: then so be it. Let her go to fucking foster care.

In my younger years, I think I hated every last one of them, but I grew to sort of appreciate their plight over the years.

These people are young, usually 21-24 years old when they are commissioned. The ones that end up like Sobel usually came out of Academy, where they spent 4 years learning how super fucking awesome the Officer Corps is. They were told day after day about how they are going to be the elite leaders of the best military in the world. They are told day after day that they are learning from the best military minds on the planet. They have competitions daily with people who possess unbelievable egos. The ""legacy"" folks coming through have a lot of tradition and expectation to live up to, and they have spent most of their life being told about their war hero ancestors. 

They come up with all of this ego-boosting and, the day after they get commissioned, it's reinforced when a high-ranking NCO salutes them as they walk to lunch. They just walked by a seasoned, grizzled combat vet whose uniform is covered in all kinds of elite combat and qualification memorabilia, and *he* saluted *them.* Holy shit, right? 

So yeah, they walk into their duty station ready to run the motherfuckin show. 

And of course...they think they drew the shittiest card in the deck. They think they were given an undisciplined unit full of assholes. Why? Well, because nobody respects them. Every NCO out there is second-guessing this butterbar's orders. And a bunch of smart-ass specialists are just straight-up ignoring them and doing things the same way they always have. The only people who show them any regard are the just-out-of-basic privates who get sent to Supply asking for a box of grid squares and some chemlight batteries. 

And what's worse, the Captain doesn't seem to have butterbar's back. He just tells the LT to try to listen to the NCOs and learn.

But wtf do *they* need to learn? They just spent several years being trained by the best military minds out there!

Truth is, the only thing they were taught is how to learn. That's all post-secondary education teaches any of us. 

But yeah, so they generally have a stick up their ass for the duration of their stint as a 2LT and for about halfway through their time as a 1st LT. Many of them figure it out, because if you don't...you won't go far. Officer Corps is a political game, people have to like you or you end up getting pushed out the door (or ""promoted"" off to a shitty duty station in Korea or something). You can get up to the rank of Captain being a clueless asshole, but at that point? You usually have to start being a savvy asshole. I mean, you're still an officer after all, so you still have to be convinced that your shit smells like pumpkin pie, but you have to figure out a way to make NCOs respect you enough to let you lead without question or subversion. 

Captain Sobel was the almost *perfect* portrayal of this problem. He was an asshole, through and through. And he would have gotten people killed (and he would be far from the first or last LT to turn his unit into a large chunky puddle).  But I don't think he was really an asshole of his own design, he was a purpose-built asshole. "
"Ok, I have one. I was teaching lessons at a music school and I had this kid, about 8 or 9, come in and take guitar lessons from me. Now, full disclosure, I'm a woman. I have also been playing guitar for 15 years (13 at this point). This kid sat down in my classroom and not only asked if I was ""really the teacher"" but questioned everything I was teaching him. Asking, ""are you sure that's right?"" and just generally being a condescending little shit. I asked a male instructor who had taught him before if he had the same behavior with him. He did not.
  So, then I meet the dad. The dad is the leader of our local ""born-again church"" (read: cult) . Nothing against Christians but this church did not follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. They would recruit kids from the local high school and brainwash them. Like the the point of literally thumping bibles in people's faces in the cafeteria. Their main target? The gays and women. Ding ding ding, this is why your kid is an asshole."

I mean I was a bit chubby and I certainly had an appetite. Then they started wondering with each other who would ever marry me. Then, finally, not being able to take it any further, I stood up and, in perfect Telugu, said ""You don't know anything about me"" because I'm not clever and couldn't think of anything else to say.

"I was out with a group of friends and there were two guys I hadn't met before in our group. When we were on the fourth round someone asked me why I wasn't getting another one and I replied by saying that I would like to have enough money left to survive the month (we're all students). So one of these guys that I don't know offered to buy me a drink. At first I said no, but then he kept on telling me that I could make it up by buying him a drink next time. So eventually I agreed. Later that night when the bar closed, the group split up and everyone headed home. We were about five people going in the same direction, him included. I lived a bit further away than the others at the time and was used to walking the last bit by myself. I remember asking him:

""Oh, do you live by the stadium aswell? Or do you live even further away?""

He just looked at me perplexed and said ""I don't live here, I'm going home with you aren't I?"" 

I told him that I was sorry but that he might have gotten the wrong signals, however since he had walked so far he could crash on my couch if he wanted to. 

He raged. Like full on lost controll. He started screaming at me calling me a slut and grabbed my arm really hard. I was scared but also so angry at him that I was able to hit him with my purse (I always carry a book in my purse and that night it was a hardcover) and ran home. I still had a bruise on my arm the following day. Fuck that guy (not in the literal sense).

"Posted before but here goes again:


Having a large metal ladder thrown at me when i was alone , full story below 

A few years ago before I moved out of my parents house, I was living with them at a new house, I moved in a few weeks after they had set it all up, decorated etc

First it started with footsteps, sounds etc and obviously my first though for carbon monoxide but we had the place tested and it was clean

I hadn't actually witnessed anything I couldn't explain at this point and didn't completely believe it all. 
Footsteps, doors closing could be just my mind playing tricks, my step dad had said he saw a face in a dark room when he was painting the door frame and the door slammed in his face (note when we moved in the door was bolted from the outside with no door handle inside, which is creepy enough) 

So now my experience:
We used the room of doom for storage as I'll call it

And I was putting some washing in there after work and was completely alone in the house except for the cat who was laying in the hall outside the room 
Against the far wall (about 2 metres away) is a heavy metal ladder used for the attic
So I turn to leave and as I do the cat looks at me and archs her back and hisses towards the room I'm in, I hear a scraping nois behind me (the floor was wooden and hadn't been carpeted in that room yet) and I turned to see the ladder standing upright and then after a second it tipped towards me

I jumped back and the ladder landed against the door and jammed it shut, trapping me outside. I managed to get my arm through eventually and move the ladder but it must have taken 30mins at least

No one in room afterwards, I still can't think of a logical explanation for a ladder leaning against the wall to go against it's weight and then topple towards me

After that we closed that door and it seems to die down and only minimal things would happen, such as doors closing and opening during the night 

I've moved out now but my parents continue to report voices and other strange sounds as well as things moving but nothing as aggressive as I encountered 


We also tried to contact the previous owner but she refused to talk to us for one reason or another and we did manage to pass a message through people we know and she said something along the lines of ""I don't talk about that house"""

"How to build a shelter and a fire in the middle of a forest in the middle of winter with no supplies.  If you know how to do that, then you can probably figure out how to do it with supplies or during summer, etc. so you'd actually be prepared for a lot of survival scenarios at that point."
"Tenno use the keys, but they are mere tresspassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through its Janus key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the power of the Janus key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the Baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these tresspassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn its simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity. "

"The concept of eugenics was a natural outgrowth of artificial selection. Once people understood that humans and animals functioned on the same basic genetic principles, it became obvious to people that it should be possible to selectively breed humans for positive traits.

The idea that this was restricted to or uniquely originated from the US is incorrect, though; it was simply an application of the idea of artificial selection to humans.

In fact, many countries started castrating the insane, retarded, and mentally ill in an attempt to breed those traits out of the population. The US, UK, France, Germany, Belgium, Canada, Brazil, Japan, and Sweden all practiced it.

The Nazis adopted it as part of their insane nationalist ideology and tainted it with their nuttiness and you know, the blood of 6 million Jews.

That said, the core idea of eugenics remains alive and well today. Modern eugenics is voluntary rather than involuntary, but it is widely seen as a moral practice within the medical community. Genetic counseling is one example of this, as is selective abortions of malformed fetuses.

Lots of textbooks do, in fact, talk about the eugenics movement; mine did. Yours probably did too, and you just don't remember it."

"Buckle up this question is for me.

I was on and off with a girl through a good bit of high school. She was a total babe. However, she had a boyfriend through most of her junior/my senior year. We drifted apart that year, and then I went off to college. I came back for Thanksgiving, and we had been texting a fair amount just prior to my return. We made plans to see a movie.

She was being flirty/touchy feely in the theater, but that was how she was. I didn't think anything of it; I didn't act on it. Following the movie, we drove over to a spot where we used to go. It was a road that stopped at the bay. There was a patch of grass with a bench sitting under a tree. We sat there, and we watched the moon for a long time. Eventually I summoned the courage to take her hand. She welcomed it. I turned to her, and she to me. We immediately began making out under the tree like we had so many times before. Important to note: we had never been ""on"" long enough to do *anything* other than make out. 

We got back in my car, and went back to my house. My parents knew her, so they didn't really get in the way when we went upstairs. In my room the clothes were coming off. We sped through the bases, and she finally asks the magic words every guy wants to hear: ""Do you have a condom?"" I did. 

However, my headboard is about a half inch from my wall. If we were to make any movements of the ""ee er"" persuasion, the headboard would hit the wall, and my family would quickly be alerted to me treating this girl to a nice ride on the dickmobile. I tell her so. She looks around. She suggests the floor, and *I say that it'll be too risky*. 

I suggest my car. Tried and true for many a hookup, I knew my SUV was my ace in the hole. I told my parents we were going back out, and they acknowledged without looking up. We get in the car, and once again the clothes come off. I've been waiting for this for years. Literally 3 or so at that point. We've been fooling around for ~10 minutes at this point, and she tells me to put on the condom. 

This is where it goes to shit. I took out the condom, and for some reason thought to myself: ""It's getting kind of steamy in here."" I'd left the car off to keep it quiet, but the windows were fogged up, and it looked like the post-sex scene in Titanic, without the sex. So my dumbass opens the door next to me to let some air in. As it turns out, I'd locked the car AND THE ALARM BLARES THE FUCK OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY SILENT STREET. 

I slam the door closed, and try to reassure her, but it's much too late. She's freaking out, and putting her clothes back one. She's worried my mom's going to come outside. Evening ruined.

We hung out, and fooled around a few times after that, but never had sex. It is the single worst time I've shot myself in the foot while trying to get laid."
It's also what makes it so amazing when someone like Bryan Cranston can be so memorable into two very different roles. (Let alone his stage work...he was magnificent as LBJ!)

"A little late, but I've got a good one.

I was having a party at my house. Had a fire going with hot dogs, beer and a few friends. One of my friends brought her friend from college over, and apparently she had stopped taking her meds. I knew she was really odd (was visiting for a week and never changed her outfit, wore a full body girdle), but was nice enough. 
  Anyway- she went into my house alone to use the bathroom, and never came back. After about an hour the friend she was staying with (we'll call her Kelly) went in to check on her. Half an hour later Kelly came back and said ""She's trying to commit suicide by sticking her head in your oven."" I went inside to find this girl had poured salt all over my table and spread it all around, torn up toilet paper into hundreds of tiny shreds and littered it all over the bathroom, and was in the middle of giving up trying to suffocate herself with my electric stove. Ended up biting me really hard too. Dont give crazy alcohol.

Tldr: girl came over for a party, tried to kill herself with an electric stove. And bit me.

She's also convinced I ripped her nametag from the door bell even though I wasn't in the building when it happened and has no problem spewing a flood of insult in front of her 2 year old kid.

I'm considering suing the landlords board over endangerment because she should have been kicked out months ago, but since I'm probably leaving in November I'm not sure it's worth it.

"Something similar happened with my sister when she was young.  She and I had a little accident at the park with another kid (they were playing kind of rough, and my sister got hurt), and I brought my sister home.  On the surface, it was nothing, but my sister was crying a lot - Dad thought she was just seeking attention, etc.

A couple hours later, she's shivering, sweating, throwing up, and we freaked out.  We got her to the ER, they did scans, tests, and what have you, and she'd hemorrhaged an adrenal gland.  We came close to losing her.  Dad took it easy on her for a while after that."

"""You're not responsible for other people's feelings.""

Sounds harsh but I needed to hear it at the time. I've always been a huge people pleaser and spend a lot of time trying to ""manage"" the emotions of everyone around me. After a few months with a therapist, I realized (1) how I ended up this way--by constantly having to manage my mother's feelings as a child, and (2) that it's basically an impossible task. That way of thinking led me into an unhappy relationship that I stayed in for way too long because I was afraid of hurting my partner by breaking up with him. My therapist taught me that there's a way to be considerate of other people while still having reasonable boundaries, paying attention to my own needs, and not constantly feeling like I have to sacrifice myself to keep others happy."

"I know this will be unpopular, but the Star Wars prequels ruined Yoda for me.  In the original trilogy he's this mystical little hermit who is really in touch with the Force and presumably above fighting.  Everything we know at that point is compatible with the Jedi being like samurai who share a bushido code.  They don't all have to be great warriors, and they don't even all have to think that wars make one great.  What's important about being a Jedi is being in tune with the Force, not necessarily killing people.

But then in the prequels we learn that there's a huge Jedi order, kind of like the Catholic Church, and Yoda is their leader who is the best Jedi in every way.  Yeah, I admit the scene where he first busts out his light saber and hops around all crazy is pretty amazing.  But by then I had already dealt with my disappointment.  (Incidentally, I thought it would have been a lot more bad-ass, and hilarious, if in the opener of Yoda's confrontation with Dooku, when Dooku rips all that stuff out of the walls to throw, Yoda literally puts it all back exactly where it was supposed to be, plugged in the lights, and turned them on, or something like that.  That really would have shown his control of the Force.)

Anyway, the prequels happened so long ago now that for a lot of people I'm sure they're just as cemented in the mind as the original trilogy.  But man was I disappointed to learn that Yoda wasn't just some old hermit who loved the Force and taught Obi Wan to love it too.  Ironically, making him the Kung Fu Jedi Pope ruined my image of him.

I know that people like to diss on the prequels for lots of other, very legitimate reasons, like the terrible writing and acting (""I hate sand""), but this one made me really sad too, and it goes to the core of Lucas's vision of the Star Wars universe."

He told me to stop being ridiculous and that I'm crazy and proceeded to be angry with me and berate me for snooping after he was caught. We were together for 7 years at that point.

"Because instituting a minimum wage is a policy that a nation can only afford to implement once it has become prosperous. If those poor countries could enrich themselves by passing minimum wage laws, they would do it.

If you set a minimum wage of $7.25, all you are doing is outlawing work for people who can't produce $7.25 of productivity. There aren't nearly as many people like that in the US as there are in third world countries, but we do have them, and they are the most vulnerable population, and it's a damn shame that even if they find a situation where an employer is willing to take them on, that employer is barred by law from doing so.

I get that people think working for low pay is bad, and they want to do something to help. But the answer is helping low-productivity workers become more productive, not passing minimum wage laws. Think of it this way: living in a shitty house is also bad, but does that mean we should pass a law stating that the minimum home value should be $50,000? You wouldn't make anyone's home more valuable; all you would do would be to cause poor people to be kicked out of their homes.

Or think of it this way: how do we know what a reasonable level for the minimum wage is? At some level, it becomes too high, we can all agree on that. If you set a minimum wage of $1000 an hour, no one could work. But at what level does it become too low? Why is $7.25 too low? Because you don't like thinking about someone having to work for that little? To extend the previous analogy, I don't like having to think about someone living in a house worth $15,000, but I think they have a right to do so, and I wouldn't think I was helping them by setting a minimum home price.

Or perhaps think of it this way: if two consenting adults want to do it and it doesn't harm anybody, who am I to stop them? I hear that argument all the time when it comes to sex. But shouldn't it also apply to a businessman who wants to hire a guy to rake leaves for $5 an hour? If they both agree to the transaction, what makes it moral for anyone to tell them they can't?"

She was pretty buzzed and started telling me that he has problems getting it up and she was feeling frustrated. One thing led to another and I'm railing her in the bathroom. He finds out and comes banging on the door threatening to kick some ass so we quickly finish up. She opens the door and he's standing there in a rage with a couple dozen onlookers behind him. He starts calling her all sorts of names and she just says ""You haven't been able to satisfy me in months! If you could actually get a fucking erection, maybe I wouldn't have to fuck someone else!"" It was like a scene from a movie where everyone just went dead silent and started whispering to each other. He shut up completely and his face turned bright red. He turned around, pushed his way through the crowd of onlookers and left the party. Luckily, I left for college a week later or I'm sure he would have beat my ass the next time he saw me. "

A friend shows me the newspaper and the guy down the hall's roommate is on the front page, murdered, police asking for someone to ID him. Next day, find out the guy down the hall had killed his roommate. Nasty business, back of the head, point blank range, small caliber, deserted area, body left without ID - obviously pre-planned with some care and forethought. Guy admits to it later.

"First of all, sorry for my english, it's not my first language. 

My great uncle was a resistance fighter in France during the WW2. He was partaking in train/railway sabotage and such operations. He was eventually caught by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp, I don't remember which one, but it wasn't far from the russian frontline.

As soon As he got there the other inmates dropped on him to steal his clothes. I Can't blame them given the horrendous conditions of living (Can we even call that living?) over there. 

He understood soon enough that he would die there, so he managed to escape and walked for days in the tundra while almost naked. 
When he got to the russian controlled zone, they thought he was a german spy and put him in a labor camp (Yeah, talk about luck). He managed to escape AGAIN one year later with a few other inmates towards the end of the war and after a week and days of walking through the woods he was found alone by an american division.

 He wasn't put into jail this time, although he was interrogated and managed to get back to France. The scary thing is that when he got home, my father told me that he couldn't sit properly anymore. His uncle had to squat on top of the chair/couch, because he was used to sit like that in camp/great to avoid the cold. 

The fact that he was the only one found by the american soldiers after such a long time during the winter made us also wonder if he didn't eat  the inmates that escaped with him and died in the cold...  So yeah pretty bone chilling.

Edit: Thanks stranger for the gold, now I kinda feel I have to tell you guys a bit more haha. I'm glad you're interested by my family strived.

Even if he was not a soldier, when he came back he was granted a special military pension as well as a lot of medals for being a resistant and not saying anything under torture. 
The man himself was very peaceful and very generous, I remember my father telling me he always strived to help people in diifficulty whenever he could,  because he almost never used the money of the pension, having enough with his pay and his wife's salary.

He also got the Memoirs of the General de Gaulle later on after the war personly signed by the man himself. As well as a letter from the General thanking him for his service and sacrifices. I think my great aunt received a letter again when my great uncle died. "

Two weeks ago, my mom and stepdad went away for a weekend trip, so I had the house to myself, just me and my dog. It was a Saturday night, and I got home from work about 1AM. I needed to let my dog out, so I grab a cigarette and head outside.
I live out in the country, so my house is completely surrounded by the woods. It's completely pitch black outside my house, even with our porch lights on. You cannot see shit in those trees.

I have barely opened the door to my back yard, and I hear trees moving. For a second, I thought it was just the sprinklers going off, but after listening for a few more seconds, I can hear the trees moving in different places, as if something was making its way through the trees. It sounds massive, like grizzly bear-sized, slowly making it's way through the brush about 10 yards away from me. 

I also live in a bayou type area 20 minutes away from Galveston, Texas. What kind of fucking animal lives here that sounds like a goddamned baby elephant trudging through the woods?

Thinking (hopefully) it was one of my neighbors, I yell out a helpless ""Who's there?"" Nothing but branches snapping and trees limbs moving. I could not make out what the fuck was making that sound.
Frozen in fear, I just stand halfway out the door, listening to this monster walk around my backyard. My dog is looking at me confused, whilst glancing towards the direction of the noise nervously. I call him back, and I reluctantly go upstairs to another door that opens towards the backyard, frantically searching for the cause. A mountain lion, coyote, an alligator, fucking anything, but I saw nothing. 
I finish listening to this beast make its way to the side of my house. That's when I slam the door, and proceed to lock all of the doors in the house. 

If anyone has any knowledge of the bay area of Texas that can tell me what the hell I heard, that would be great. "

"Women tend to give compliments differently than men, from what I've seen, and you pinpointed the problem directly: when women say ""that thing looks really cute!"", other women interpret that as a personal complement. Sort of like ""Wow, you had great taste/it looks good on you!"". I think there is an element of men assuming that ""oh, yeah, this thing looks good--but that doesn't say anything about me"". Not confident on the reverse version, but hey, communication's wierd. "

"I work in a small restaurant where It could probably be managed by 2 people if need be. Theres this guy that always appears when business is slow so Im just there waiting for his food to be done frying with just him and me alone up front. The thing is he's always standing at the counter staring at me, and I see it from the corner of my eye. Normally people would check their phones and maybe look around or what not but no he just fucking stares at me and doesnt say a word. He doesnt say much either the few times I try to break the ice and I tried staring back at him giving him my best ""wtf are you looking at"" face but it doesnt work."

"The final conversation with the person who abused us for three years as we cut contact.

The progression from trying to reconcile, to being manipulative, to being outright hostile was... stunning, especially with a readied clarity and fortitude to not give into it.

Looking back on it now is sorta horrifying since, even at the time, we almost believed them.

EDIT: I guess It might be helpful to me to share some of the things they've said.

From that conversation

""I said it because you're being a passive aggessive bitch.

You're a horrible person; that much is clear from your wordless block.

You could have talked it out with me, but instead you cut and run from someone who, from the previous interaction, thought you were a friend.

I bet someone was whispering in your ear for you to do it too.

But, you're being someone who actively incites a fight by implying shit; instead of taking up an offer to try to patch up our interactions, you decided to point out that ""I'm not comfortable talking to you.""

I don't even know why.

A page of text is no substitute for a conversation.

But, whatever.""

""Guess what. Talking to people is manipulating them""

""The part where you are lying to yourself and fabricating the narrative

you want to be the victim

you want to justify it so it's not your fault.
""

This person wasn't good, they were truly one of the worst people I've ever had the misfortune of meeting. And I don't really know if I'm going to get much of anything out of sharing this. But I'd like to say that if this could help anyone get through an abusive sort of relationship, or realize that it's the proper time to get out of one then it's worth it. Those things they say, they're not true. They say them because they hurt, because they have power over us, because they know just how much it can sway people. They're not evil geniuses or masterminds, it's just simply how some people think. Whether it's someone with untreated / unmanaged BPD (People with mental illnesses aren't bad, but we can't sugar coat abusers who are mentally ill). Or if it's someone who just simply is cruel by nature. The only thing you can do is remove yourself from their influence and hope they learn to be better sometime.

The person I have these experiences with took advantage of a hyper-sexual nature (from past stuff, yay more sadness...) I had from the ages of 15-18 to  basically just become overly reliant on them in online interactions, they lived across the globe so we never really met, but there were many pictures, and skype calls I regret. They'd constantly call me things like Fatass and Stupid as ""jokes"". (I'm scrawny as fuck, and have been borderline underweight due to not eating from a lack of ability to get out of bed). They'd insist I should drink alcohol and do drugs because.. I really don't know (We never really did). They wanted me to just be utterly subservient to them. We were also dealing with DID/OSDD (it's still.. sorta muddy) at the time which we thought was something else and... well... That whole time period is a mess and very hard to piece together without trying to stitch together our memories into something that resembles coherency. The abuse has effected us greatly, and It's something that hurts a lot sometimes, it hurts so much. But we have to be strong, we can't let ourselves be held down by this forever, we've got to work towards accepting it. While we can't just, go ahead and forget this all happened, we have to spend the time we take actually healing, and not wallowing in the pain.

And another important thing. To anyone in a tough situation right now. You're not responsible for your abuser, you don't have to help them, or care for them. That's not on you, your health comes first. Helping someone else live if it kills you isn't worth it. None of what happens is your fault, but you can't keep exposing yourself to it. Having the strength to leave is hard, and maybe it won't happen today but you *can* do this.

"She messaged me first. Wasn't my type, but I messaged her back thinking, ""Why not?""  We spoke on the phone twice, then met up for a date.

Over the course of our date, she asked me to move in about 45 minutes in.  This was the first red flag , then I asked if she wanted me to come back to her place. She said, ""Well, I need a ride back, silly.""  I forget exactly when, but I think it was on the walk to my car, she literally said ""I don't have a car right now, but it's okay, because your car will be our car.""

She then was bold enough to ask me to move in with her.  Adding in that once I do, I could ""do the cleaning,"" as I was tidy and she was messy (when I went to the restroom, the floor was covered in toilet water and kitty litter.)

She also confessed to me while we were making out that she likes it ""when her cat watches.""

"Not me but my friend did the rejection. Story time.

A few years ago, my friend had a blind date setup through someone he knew. He was struggling with dating and figured a blind date would be something kind of interesting and exciting. They were going to go out to eat at some local restaurant/bar have a couple drinks, talk, maybe flash some skin, you know, the typical first date bullshit. Me and a couple buds were messing with him days leading up to the date about the possibility that the girl might just be completely hideous and how terrible it would be to sit around for a couple hours and struggle to get through the complete date. Anyways, me and the buds came up with a genius plan to have our friend wait outside the restaurant and wait for the mystery woman to arrive so that he could verify if the girl was up to his standards. I know, I know, kind of silly to even set up a blind date if you weren't prepared for the worst circumstances.

So my dude was camped out in his car across the street and the woman finally arrived. Of course it was winter time, so the girl was bundled up and our friend couldn't get a good look at her. Our plan failed. So he did what any man would do in this situation... he fled the scene.

Apparently the girl waited at the restaurant for over an hour before regretfully grabbing her things, bundling back up in her winter clothes, and heading home. How devastating to be stood up in the harmful conditions of winter. But the real loser in this story? Yeah, my friend, who missed out on a date with possibly the most gorgeous woman I've ever seen. The winner of this story? Yeah that's me, who just so happened to be at the same restaurant that night (I had no idea where or when their date was) and saw how amazingly beautiful she was. And I dated her for quite sometime, and my friend had no idea it was her who he stood up until we broke up.

Edit: when I say we dated, what I actually meant was that we banged... a lot."

One is disrespectful and marginalizing someone's culture, the other especially if they attempt to do things right is introducing someone to another culture and celebrating it. "

"I teach English to young kids!

(**edit:** I should add that I teach in a country where the serial comma is not the standard; rather, it is taught as one of a few stylistic options. We teach that it is a tool that can be used (along with reordering of items in a list) where applicable. Please ~~bare~~ bear in mind that this is often the case outside of the US and does not constitute an unforgivable error.)


They way I teach it, there are basically three common ways we use commas. Disclaimer: These explanations are not thorough and there are in fact quite a number of other ways we can employ them (e.g. in writing direct speech or in between adjectives modifying the same noun) but these are the simplest and most common.


**1.** First, we use them in lists. This is relatively straightforward. It simply involves placing a comma in between each item in a list. We usually exclude placing a comma before the last item after an 'and' but this depends on where you're from (please refer to my edited introduction if this outrages you).

**Example**: I bought some tomatoes, potatoes, pomatoes and tototatoes.



**2.** We also can use commas kind of like parentheses; in other words, to drop 'extra information' into a sentence. Using a pair of commas can be thought of as 'softer' than using em dashes or brackets. In short, we tend to use commas when we're renaming or rephrasing a noun or noun phrase.

**Example**: Johnny, the tallest boy of the group, didn't know how to use commas.



**3.** Finally, we can use commas to separate clauses of a sentence. There are basically two types of clause: dependent and independent. These names will vary depending on where you are taught and who taught you but the basic idea remains. An independent clause has a subject and a verb. You know a clause is independent if it makes full sense on its own and doesn't leave any 'untied strings'. A dependent clause is missing these criteria and requires a conjoined independent clause to make sense.

*Independent clause*: I ran home.

*Dependent clause*: As it began to rain.

Now, we can use commas to join these together. If the dependent clause comes first, we follow it with a comma and stick the independent one after it. However, if the independent clause comes first, we don't need a comma.

**Example 1**: As it began to rain, I ran home.
**Example 2**: I ran home as it began to rain.

We can also use commas to connect two independent clauses ~~after~~ before a conjunction, but this depends on where you're from and the preferred style of your audience."

"Exactly. 

The child support I get doesn't even cover 25% of HIS HALF of my child rearing expenses. 

I make sure our kids have healthy food, play sports, have heat water, some entertainment, clean clothes and go to good schools/daycares. Every month I do this. 

Besides, why would I want to allow someone I am clearly not with to dictate how I can spend money in my bank account. "

"She doesn't work here anymore but I had a coworker that was much older (F, 50-60) who walked slowly with a cane because of a motorcycle accident she had earlier in her life. She started out really sweet and nice and we really took to each other and would talk on our breaks and stuff. As the months wore on she got more and more whiny and pissy and rude and just... difficult.

My husband was her supervisor and this lady would complain about *everything* like ""don't do my performance test at the start of the week"" followed a week later by ""don't do it at the end of the week either."" Really irritated him.

The tides turned for me when I lost my second pregnancy in a row. I was really open about it so she totally knew about it all since they both happened in the time I was working there. I left early to go to the ER the second time it happened and when I came back I told her I lost it and she goes ""Oh you're way too young to have a baby! I wouldn't have said anything had it lived but I thought gosh you're so young!"" I was 24, married, and we both worked here and lived on our own. I pretty much gave her the finger after that.

When I got pregnant with my daughter a few months later I didn't tell anyone so she only found out when I started to show and she goes ""Oh I'm so happy for you! I've been praying for you to have a baby!"" I hated her even more after that. Thankfully she left a couple months later."

"I had just closed down and locked the office up. It was around 9 and almost everything is closed. Almost meaning there is a bar open down the way. I park in front of that bar on purpose every morning because it's always open and pretty busy. 

I'm walking down the empty street and start rounding the corner where the bar is when someone calls me from behind.

Creepyguy: excuse me, miss? I'm sorry to bother you but I haven't eaten all day and I'm starving. 

Me: -still trying to round the corner- If you're hungry there's a bar down the way, I can buy you something there.

Creepyguy: Nah, that bar is expensive, I'd feel bad. There's a a fast food place on the other side of this street though, super cheap. Really close.

Me: -rounded corner and getting into view of bar- I don't care about the price of the food -knows for a fact the other side of the street is a dead end alley- If you're hungry I'll feed you, but we go where I say.

Creepyguy then grabbed my arm trying to force me away from view of bar and towards the alley. I screamed to let go of me and used all my strength to  stomp at his foot and push me away from him to get to the front of the bar. I screamed 'let go of me, I don't know this man!' And a group of bikers stood up from their outdoor table and the creep bolted. Don't know what he had planned for me but I knew he wasn't planning on me making it. "

"The comments about saving reciepts, keeping track of expenses, etc sounds like a lot of work to add on to a single parents list of responsibilities. It may not seem like it, but taking kids to and from various after school programs, to and from daycare, school, and then working 40+ hours a week all while managing the household alone are a lot to handle without the added responsibilities some people are suggesting. 

  I understand that seeing things itemized or tracked would make the parent paying child support feel more at ease about where the money is going. The easiest way to see that your child is being taken care of appropriately is to just talk to your child during visitation and take part in your childs life as well. Most single parents aren't blowing all their money on themselves. The majority of middle class single parents spend all the child support on their childs necessities, and then spend a large portion of their own income on their childs wants and needs as well, while making large sacrifices to their own lifestyle."

Years later, after highschool, we reconnected on Facebook. We had a few conversations, he had graduated and gotten engaged and I found that disappointing. lol. I had a very romantic fantasy we'd end up married even after all that time had past. A few years ago he was fatally struck by a car helping someone change a tire on the side of a road.

"I have two.

I was in 8th grade in Catholic school, 12 years old (23 years ago, ick), and a discussion about homosexuality started.  I never cared about a person's sexuality so I was just sort of hanging back and listening.

One kid, spewed hate, surely passed down by his parents.  It was horrible and we were all stunned into silence.  

After he let that garbage settle on our ears, the teacher asked, ""How does someone in a homosexual relationship affect your life?""

The kid had no retort. It was amazing and from that moment on it reaffirmed my line of thinking that if no one is getting hurt, it is literally none of my business. 

The second time someone changed my way of thinking was when someone was bitching about BLM shutting down the highway.  I was like, ""Yeah, how dare they block traffic.  This is so wrong and inconvenient for all the drivers.""  One of my friends said, ""Well, they're literally inconvenienced their whole lives, everyday, all day.  It's a demonstration to give you a taste of it.""

And I was on board more than before."

"Interesting question. I knew this guy back in Pakistan. He was in my school but at some point his family took political asylum and moved to the U.K.  They were feudal people with copious amounts of money and resources. 

Around 2005ish, the conditions were laxed and while his father still could not come back to Pakistan, he himself could. He came back for a month and in that time, we had a reunion and it was lots of fun. Just hanging out everyday and all that good stuff. Great guy all around but very short tempered. One night some guy rubbed him the wrong way because the guy complained about my friend revving his heavy bike and making lots of noise in the parking lot. My friend pulled out his pistol after a heated exchange and shot the poor guy dead. 

Karma wasn't too happy and only a week later my friend was riding his bike late at night when he t-boned a van which sent him and his bike up in the air only to have his bike land on him. I wasn't there to witness this. I just heard accounts of the eye witnesses. He was taken to the hospital but he succumbed to his injuries hours later and was pronounced dead 2 days before he was supposed to go back to the U.K.  

All in all, I was happy that justice was served in this way because no cop would touch him. Had he lived, he wouldn't have been prosecuted for his crime. Such is the way the rich live in some countries. This is when he is at odds with the ruling party. Imagine the chaos when he is in the ruling party.

"Lost my friend of 30 years over this: He brings a woman over for a small get together. She encourages my pregnant wife to drink, asks our friend if she's bisexual (she's not). She comes into the kitchen, grabs knives and pretends to stab everyone while doing knife Katas. 

Later she chases the not bisexual friend all over the house in what to all of us felt very rapey-- I physically stop her by grabbing her wrists and say ""What the hell is going on with you?"" She replies, ""Go ahead, break my wrists."" 

The not bisexual friend (who was so upset she took a self-defense course) made up an excuse to stay in the bathroom for an hour. 

We had a fire outside where the weird guest remarked, ""There are three things you can watch forever, a river flowing, fire burning, and someone being hurt.""

My friend of 30 years saw no problem with any of this behavior, married her, and I've not heard from him in a year nor do I wish to.

I knew a guy in my year at school who wiped his arse with a towel at somebody's party
"A few years ago, a wrongful conviction group I was involved with decided to ask for the financial records related to the case, basically what the prosecution was billing the county for. The volunteer went into the county clerk's office (I think that's what he's called) to ask for the records. She said the clerk was friendly but told her she had to call ahead to get records. Okay, fine. So she called ahead, but when she went into the office the next day, he was out of the office and the next day, he ended up taking a surprise vacation for the next seven days after that. 

When he came back, it was hit and miss as to whether she'd catch him, but every time she went in, he would have some new requirement to get the records. She had to call first, then go online and email him, and then fill out a written report, then stand on her head and dance a jig. I can't remember how many ridiculous things she had to do to get the records, but he was clearly giving her the run around. She ended up getting *some* of the records, but not anywhere near the entire thing. 

At some point, she said enough was enough and she took him to court over it. The judge sided with her and told him she had every right to see these records and he had no right to refuse them. The clerk tells the judge that most of them are gone because while he was on vacation that week (which was actually a staycation) he decided to spend it clearing old records. Legally, he has the right to destroy records that are as old as those were, so he didn't break any laws doing that, but it sure is suspicious that the second she starts asking for these records, he randomly got the urge to start destroying them. 

Fortunately the guy ended up getting released anyway, so this didn't impact the court case, but we're pretty sure the clerk is mismanaging funds. That particular case ran in the millions, so it would be the perfect case to hide some misdeeds. "

"I've copied my post from above but want to tell you about my family's experience in Morocco (Agadir)

I came here looking for Morocco. That is the place I never want to go to again. I went with my wife and also my daughter who was 14 years old then. My daughter is tall and blonde and no matter where we went she got cat called, approached, people gathering round her, trying to touch her hair, putting their arm around her, trying to ask her to go out with them. There wasn't one ""type"" of guy doing this (or rather trying to because I had to go apeshit a few times to get them to leave her alone) but rather men of 16 to 60 just hassled her everywhere we went. She was dressed in long sleeves and long shorts as advised but it made no difference.

Sorry to say but Moroccan men are just hideous. When I got annoyed with their behavior they'd say ""Fuck you! Go home!"" and call my wife and daughter whores. I'd never go back there, not with a young woman anyway."

"Fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is. If you fap to gay porn, that's 2 guys, and that's 100% gay. If you fap to 'straight' porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you're also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it's in a weird gray area, where if it's people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it's with animals, I would think it depends on said animal's sexuality. Then there's consent. If a person doesn't consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let's say that means they're about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it's now 75% gay. If it's straight rape by a man, then it's 25% gay. And, if it's trap gay porn, than that's 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that's still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is."

There was a guy who bullied me in 4th and 5th grade. He was much older than most of the students, so he was bigger and all that. He used it to his fullest advantage to bullied everybody. But I was his main squeeze.

Anyway my family moved out of the city. I was never able to really have any payback.

However few years ago, I landed a good job as a firefighter and was fighting in kickboxing and MMA as well. So I was doing good in life and having a great time.

I decided to visit the city I grew up in. I end up went to a event where few of my old friends were at.

Sure enough I spotted this guy. I walked up to him  and pretend to be friendly. We end up chat for a bit. Then I start to get him to talk about how shitty his life is (divorce, unemployment, two kids, chronicle homeless, etc...) I then talk about my life with a smug on my face.

I basically make him feel even more of a worthless PoS without directly insulting him. I do it gradually until he was fuming. I then dropped the last bombshell. I ask him how do he think the world feel about him and what his kids think of such a loser deadbeat father.

This strike a sensitive nerve. He stood up and tried to look imposing and threatening. I didn't moved a muscle and just sat there all relaxed and confident as I grinned at him.

Knowing my reputation as a fighter and fitness manic, he was too afraid to try make any moves and few people eventually stepped in to escort him away from me.

"&gt; But how do we increase competition? 

We remove the regulatory burdens preventing them from competing.  We look at whether the subsidies to the largest Pharma companies are paying off, or whether they are necessary at all.  We look at IP law that grants a monopoly to one provider and restricts the supply of life-saving drugs, we look at the FDA approval process.  We look at what level of care requires what licenses, etc.  We look at what drugs currently require a prescription (and by extension a doctors visit to get one).  Basically, we make it easier to provide health care and compete against the large providers.

&gt;And what is the price model you think we should reintroduce?

I think a lot of what we consider to be predictable, routine care. There's no reason that you should need insurance to get an annual checkup, because you should be able to ""shop around"" for a service that is pretty identical across different providers.  Does anyone do that now?  No, there's no reason, the closest thing is just staying in your Network.  Ditto for purchasing prescription drugs, particularly those that have been available for decades.  Even things like trips to Urgent Care (not talking about the ER here) for something like a UTI or a sprained ankle.  Stuff that doesn't require a ton of specialization or unique services, and where you do have the luxury of being able to compare prices."

It was very sad, and  felt very sorry for the brothers and their mother. But what can you do? "

I didn't think anything of this but when I told some friends about it later that day, they were fans of that band and someone was willing to go with me to see if it was legit. We went to the show and sure as shit my name was on the list. It was a pretty fun show!"

"How long have you had that arrangement? 

I was in a relationship with my ex for 4 1/2 years. She had (emotionally) cheated on me 1 1/2 years in, we had a short break after which we got back together. She told me after we were broken up she realized that she didn’t want the other guy but me. I had the same exact deal you have with your wife with her, although I don’t think I ever really had to enforce anything. Never gave me a reason to doubt her and then, 3 years later, after I come back from a vacation, she told me she cheated again (physically this time) while I was on vacation. Turns out once a cheater, always a cheater is not as far fetched as I thought it was (although of course there are always exceptions to the rule)"

"I didn't get revenge, but this guy beat me up in the 2nd grade. I was 7 and he was about 10 or 11. Held back a lot. He was beating up this other 7 year old kid. So me, tripping on my Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles super hero high, I tell him to pick on somebody his own size. then he says okay. Then punches me in the gut, and knees me in the eye. He stopped beating up the other kid at least.

Since i was super quiet and nice, the teachers made a bigger deal than normal about. I was this quiet kid who came from a private school to a super ghetto public school, so I stood out even though I'm sure there were plenty of other students like me there. Anyway, he got in a huge amount of trouble and his mom yelled at him.

Also, just to give you updates on his life. In middle school, he bragged about hanging out with his gang (a Crips set) and how they found a stray dog and tortured it. He was smiling about how they cut it open and saw it's heart beating.

In high school, he robbed a gunstore to supply his gang with weapons. He got caught because one of them told the cops after getting arrested and injured by cops. So the guy this post is about's brother and sister went to the hospital to kill the other guy who told, but they were caught because he was under police custody.

About 3 years ago I saw him at a DMV, but made sure he didn't my face. I guess armed robbery at a gun store is no big deal.

About 1 year ago he was stabbed in the parking lot of a stripclub during a drug deal. He died from his wounds. fellow classmates on facebook talked about how cool he was....The black community doesn't stand a chance. no one remembers the guy from our school who died a war hero, but everyone remembers this psychotic drug dealer and thinks of him fondly."

"Similarly, this was the worst time of my life - being incredibly poor in college for one of the years.  Like, not regular college poor, with ramen noodles and easymac and shit beer, but scraping pennies together and balancing between paying rent or having it be late again and risk eviction because i hadn't made a payment on time and I was a month behind in rent every single month.  I was working at a pizza place every single night until 4 AM, getting home and getting to sleep by 5 so I could wake up and get to class by 8 - my MWF class was attendance mandatory and my TU/TH 8 AM class  always had assignments due and class participation was 60% of the grade. 

What happened was that about a week before classes started, my student loan got denied and my options were to pay for school out of pocket or drop out.  Furthermore, I had one private student loan from Citibank that IMMEDIATELY went into repayment and they shot it straight to collections.  Because my semester wasn't paid for yet, they treated it like I had dropped out and that was apparently in the fine print as grounds for collections or some shit.  I don't know, I hired a lawyer and a few hundred bucks that I couldn't afford to spend later, they told me to just deal with it until my semester was paid for and Citibank would ease up or some shit.  They didn't.  This ordeal also got me dropped from my parent's insurance plans, both car and health, so I had those as monthly bills as well.

My boss would allow me to have a free pizza once per week, and I would load that fucker up with every single topping that I could and scrape them off into tupperware as soon as I got home and use them as add-ins for my rice - the only grocery I could afford.  The local Methodist church, St. Pauls (State College, PA) would give out free coffee and food in the daytime, where I would go between classes and hang out for an hour while just unwinding and either reading or playing pool while getting the only honest hot meal I could get in a day.  I'm not a religious person by any means, but I couldn't stop thanking them every single time I saw anyone there, I was just so humbled by how wonderful the people were at Abbajava (their cafe name).

I donated plasma twice a week, signed up for studies that paid 15-20 bucks for attending a 3 hour presentation every time I could.  I went on craigslist and did so many odd jobs.  I sold as many of my possessions as I could.  At one point, my dumbass roommate left the apartment door unlocked and open while I was at work and he went out to the bar.  My computer was stolen.  So was the envelope with my rent money that was in my desk drawer, firmly planting me two months late with rent.  As were some other things of mine.  Nothing of his was stolen, which still strikes me as odd to this day, and he tried really hard to talk me out of calling the cops.  It's a shame that the building hadn't installed security cameras until the week after my stuff was stolen, because I'm nearly 100% sure it was one of his cokehead friends that stole everything.

I think the only thing that got me through those times were the few people that gave me a hand.  I didn't see much of my friends, I didn't have time to ever do so.  Every so often the girl that worked at Insomnia cookies would give me a box of cookies when I went outside to smoke - she also usually gave me a pack once a week to keep me from scrounging through half-smoked butts from my last-week's pack.  I treated the time I spent with my friends when I did get to hang out with them as the light at the end of the tunnel - what I was working for the whole time.  It was rough, I'm tearing up just thinking about how hard it was, how I really hope that nobody ever has to go through that sort of experience while also understanding how many actually do.  I felt so alone, and the worst part to think about is that when I look back, I understand that being alone was a choice.  I needed someone to help me get through that time, and there were dozens of people that had their hands held out for me, I was just too full of pride to accept the help.

"When I first met this girl, it was through mutual friends. After a comedy show, we decided to hang out at my apartment and they invited her along without me knowing. I'm a reasonably personable guy, but I've never been the type to be able to charm the pants off someone. Well, for her, I was that guy. I slept with her the first night I knew her. I'm not shaming her for it, but it was not terribly difficult to do so. She was a virgin when I met her, so I know it wasn't like she just slept with a bunch of different guys. No big deal.

We dated for 6 years. Lived together, planned on marriage. I even proposed in a really romantic way. Flower petals, candlelight, the whole shebang. I had a friend that was military that was stationed in Japan for a few years. He was finally coming back, and we were all very happy. I liked his company, we shared a weird sense of humor. Probably my second best friend at the time. Once he returned, and we all started hanging out in groups, I'd notice them sharing a look or two. I wasn't worried because of the foundation and duration of our relationship. And of course, my second best friend wouldn't do anything like that to me. I talked to her about it one night, nothing angry, just letting her know that I noticed. I'm no thought police, so her having a crush is something that I didn't worry about. Actions matter. Thoughts are hypotheticals.

One night, she goes out with friends. I had to work, so I told her to have fun. I get home around midnight and she isn't home yet. Very unlike her. So I call, she picks up and says that they're having some Waffle House and she'll be home a bit later, don't wait up. I'm tired, so I sleep. Wake up, she's back and sleeping soundly. No big deal. I'm up and about, doing my thing, when her phone buzzes. Then it buzzes again about 2 minutes later. And again and again. She gets 5-6 messages in the course of about 10 minutes. I think it might be someone trying to get a hold of her, which isn't unusual, so I go to see who it is and if it can wait. Obviously, it's the friend talking about last night and all they got up to. 

I'm not happy. I start getting my things tidied up, in case the inevitable is coming. I let her wake up naturally, I'm no monster. We sit down and talk about what happened. What this means. We had a few problems, but we could work through them. But this? This is a ""do not pass GO"" situation. I end up moving out. The break up was messy. She was spiteful. I don't think her family knew why we broke up, and it felt like they thought I was just using their daughter. Lost pretty much all my stuff because of it. Had to start with practically nothing and a truck that couldn't get into 3rd gear. My new ""home"" was couches of friends for about 3 months. Lost my job because I couldn't reliably get there on time since I used to bike to work, and my friend's house was on the complete other side of town. And my dog, who I raised and trained from a puppy, died due to her neglect. All this, from the friend coming back to the breakup, was less than 3 weeks. I guess she was a lot easier than she let on.

I'm 31 now. This was 3 years ago. Now, I'm married to the woman of my dreams, I have a job that pays me well, and a car that runs better than any I've ever driven before. No new dog yet, but I'm wearing my wife down. My life is complete and fulfilling. This has been the best thing that could have ever happened to me."

"I guess I'd have to also say 9/11. I was in my second semester of college, about to go to some stupid math class. I had just gotten up and was on AIM (good ol days) when my buddy next door in the dorm sent me an IM and said, ""dude turn on the TV."" I said nah, my roommate is still asleep. He said ""turn on the fucking TV and wake up Bill,"" so I did. 

I actually didn't skip that class at first. I had quite a long walk that took me through the student center. Stopped in there just in time to see the second tower get hit on live TV. Got to class a little late on the other side of campus just in time to see some guy stumble out the door and just fucking burst into tears and literally collapse into the arms of a couple of classmates. I didn't ask questions- everyone was disturbed, but this guy was obviously directly affected and it was a kick in the gut to see. 

I lingered around for a few, then turned the fuck around and went back to my room for the day. The next couple of weeks were kind of a blur, knowing full well the world (and my planned career path) as I knew it changed. It was eerily quiet, and there were a lot of federal agents around for awhile. I went to a fairly well-known private Aeronautical university (and no, none of the hijackers trained there).

At around 2-3am, i woke up by the sound of a child crying. The sound looks like it was very near the window that I can see it when if I look, but never in seven hell that I decide to look because I know that there is a vacant lot outside the window. The crying continued for 2 hrs and I try to close my eyes inside my blanket (ghost don't come inside the blanket).

"Putting in work at learning things in high school really does make a lot of college easier. And hardass teachers care more than they will ever let on.

In particular, I absolutely *haaaated* my high school math teacher (and I had to have her for two and a half years) because she was a *brutal* hardass. Ragged on us constantly if we didn't get an easy concept, drilled everything really hard into us, called home if you missed a *single* assignment, didn't hesitate to call individual students out for big mess ups or for not paying attention, etc etc. If you were in her class, you were going to pass it whether you wanted to or not, if she had to drag you kicking and screaming the whole way.

Come college, and I *literally* slept through my algebra and trig classes because I had been taught this stuff so brutally in high school and couldn't get by not actually knowing it that I knew it in my sleep. I almost got points off of a test for not doing problems the right way because in my mind that was the most basic way and I knew so many easier ways to do it. Because my high school teacher wouldn't let any of us slack off or get by half-assing it, I absolutely sailed through the content later because I really, truly knew it.

I saw her again a few years later and thanked her for it. In my mind, she was the most mean, brutal, cruel, hardass teacher I ever had. But at that moment, she just got this smile on her face and I understood why she acted like she did, and just how much she cared about making sure we could succeed. It was a real eye-opener."

If this movie would come out today most of it would be left on the cutting room floor. I'm sad it will never get a proper release, it is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen and deserves more praise."

"We play a fun game called ""I don't know, what do *you* want to do?""
   
It starts when one of us asks the other what they want to do.  Then the other person says (predictably) ""I don't know, what do *you* want to do?""  To which the first person replies, ""I don't know, what do *you* want to do?""
   
Gameplay proceeds in this way until any of the following occur:

- actual physical violence, in which case, the player resorting to violence is the loser.

- forfeiture, where one party runs screaming from the premises, vowing never to come back again.  Obviously abandoning the field of play results in a loss for that player.

- Catatonia, where one player literally becomes catatonic due to boredom, that player cannot respond in a reasonable time, and therefore loses.

- time runs out, if the evening during which play has been initiated expires, either by virtue of the children returning home or both of the players falling asleep, the match results in a draw.  If only one player falls asleep, see the rules dealing with catatonia.
   
Note: rules have not been established yet for an instance where one of the players actually has an opinion about what to do, because that could never actually happen in real life."

"What people fail to mention when they espouse the virtues of STEM degrees is that its really just TE if you want to get any kind of well-paying job with just a bachelors and even then it doesn't guarantee anything. 

Science and Math do not have many high paying jobs right our of college without first doing other things. Math can be great, if you get your actuarial exams for example, but you need more than a B.S.

In fact, many of the Tech jobs can be gotten even without a degree in it. Even if the job requires a degree, which many don't, as long as you have the skills they won't care what kind of degree it is. Then even if you get a programming job many of the entry level jobs are just there to use up young coders as much as they can. You need to break into the higher level jobs which can be difficult.

Engineering is really the only bachelor degree that is both sufficient and necessary, and even then it depends on what kind of engineering you study. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Aerospace Engineering, for example, is in decline right now and will have less jobs in 10 years than there are today. (https://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/aerospace-engineers.htm) People say, get a STEM degree and you'll be fine because ""Oh there are tons of jobs in tech and engineering."" However, this is a vast over-simplification.

When he drove me back I told him my house was a mile away from my real house.

"Air Force former active duty and current reservist here: 

Was deployed to Incirlik AB, Turkey recently back in October 2016. I worked the overnight shift so on my day off I would typically go to the bowling alley, USO, do laundry late at night...basically just find things to stay awake as long as I could so I didn't mess up my sleep schedule.

Sometimes they would cut power to the entire base around 1-2am. We never got a warning when it would happen, but everyone was used to it and it would come back up around 5-10 minutes later. 

One night on my day off, I was out by our tins (basically the shitty trailers that we stay in, where they pack like 8 airmen to a room meant for 2). I think maybe I was trying to call my wife or just outside doing nothing, killing time. All of the sudden the power goes out completely. It's around 2 am. No street lights, no lights coming from buildings. It is pitch black on the entire base. I figure after 5-10 minutes it would come back, so I'm waiting. After about 5 minutes I hear security forces (military police) vehicles with their sirens racing up and down the streets. Still I'm like ok maybe an exercise or coincidence or something. 

20 more minutes go by, still pitch black, a steady flurry of police cars still zooming up and down the streets. My buddy and coworker comes out of his tin, telling me that a few of his roommates are security forces and their radios were going off with calls, and that they had awoken and thrown on their uniforms and left the room.

Keep in mind, this is only a few months after the coup happened, so everyone was on high alert and suspicion, and many of the people there at the time (not me) were present for the coup.

So to keep with the story, me and my buddy are standing outside in the pitch black of night, police cruisers racing up and down the street and it's now been an hour. We were worried the base may be under attack. Incirlik AB is near Adana, Turkey, less than 100 miles from Aleppo and the Syrian Border, and ISIS is obviously a big threat. Beyond that, we thought it could be another coup attempt by the Turkish people.

So finally after about 2 hours of standing outside, unable to see anything, power finally comes back. We never got word about why that happened, or why the police cruisers were racing up and down the base. Could have been a power test/routine shutdown gone bad. Could have been a coincidence with police cars. Who knows? We never found out what happened or why."

"This is true to some degree, though it would require more force than you would think. The main risks comes from missing the side of the neck and hitting the front of the neck, which could collapse the wind pipe, or them falling after being knocked out and hitting their head on something.

"I one time went to a public library for some tutoring and walked past two older men with two young girls around ages 7-8. As I kept walking I replayed the scene in my head again. The girls looked kind of nervous and the men certainly didn't seem like parents or guardians of any kind. A woman who had also seen the scene flagged me down and asked me, ""Hey did that seem kind of weird to you too?"" I agreed with her and we talked to the librarian who called security. Within about 15 minutes there were 2 police cruisers and a police helicopter circling the area. After the tutoring session I saw the two young girls again, but this time with their (presumed) mothers. 

TL;DR: With the help of another woman, stopped two girls from being kidnapped."

They are also extremely friendly people in general. But it's a 3rd world country. It's dirty. It's poor. People are hungry. There can be creeps. Corruption exists. If you want a perfect vacation go elsewhere or don't leave your resort. But if you want genuine and unique beauty it awaits you.   "

"A missionary is sent into the deepest, darkest part of Africa to live with a tribe.

He spends years with the people, teaching them to read and write, and preaching to them about the good Christian ways of the white man.

One thing he particularly stresses is the evils of sexual sin: Thou must not commit adultery or fornication!

One day, the wife of one of the tribe's noblemen gives birth to a white baby.

The village is shocked and the chief is sent to talk with the missionary.

""You have taught us of the evils of sexual sin, yet here, a black woman gives birth to a white child. You are the only white man who has ever set foot in our village. Even Stevie Wonder could see what's been going on!""

The missionary replies, ""No, no. You are mistaken. What you have here is a natural occurrence, what is called an albino. Look to thy yonder field. See the flock of white sheep, and yet amongst them, one of them is black. Nature does this on occasion.""

""Tell you what,"" the chief says, ""You never mention the sheep again, and I won't say anything about the baby."""

"I am an assistant to a family attorney and Jesus Christ, people are petty assholes. Both Men and Women equally, by the way. 

I would say the most frequent is not allowing the other parent to take the kids to Disneyland or to visit their grandparents out of state. Literally going to court to prevent them from doing that. 

It happens sooooooo muuuuuuuch! They don't care about whether or not the child has fun, they just want to sabotage the other parent for moving on. Some people just can't let go of their exes, even if they are the ones that left. Kids are just tools for revenge. The revenge they want is for their offspring to resent the other parent as much as they do. 

I realized that family law is such a huge industry because there are so many petty asshole and all out psychos that exist. The funny thing is that these people are your friends and co-workers, you would just never know how they are with their families. Not everyone is as chill as they seem."

I had so much fun with that stuff as a kid, but sadly I lost it all one day when my one cousin (1 year younger than I was) came over, DEMANDED I give her the cart, cash register and the credit card because those were 'girls toys' and she didn't have any of that stuff. When I told her no they were mine, she smashed the cart, the register and ripped the credit card up into tiny little pieces :("
"I couldn't agree more on every point of this. I grew up in a similar situation as you and the above poster, although maybe not quite as dramatically. However, having to listen to my dad bitch and moan every other weekend that we saw him that my mom wasn't using the child support correctly really put a damper on things, especially seeing as how we young kids had no idea of knowing how to track our mother's spending. 

Then, when I was 16 I moved out of the house. Those checks kept coming, while I was fucking destitute. Then my little brother moved out before he turned 18 as well, and the checks *still* kept coming. Think he saw a dime of it? Probably not. 

My father worked his entire child support paying life under the table to avoid having to pay my mom more than the minimum child support. Seeing as how she pretty much jumped from one man to the next to support her, and after the bs about where it was actually going in the first place, I can't say I blame him. We grew up solidly lower-middle class anyway.

Anyway, as I was reading through these comments, the card idea came to me too. Thank you for writing that out there so nicely. The only thing I think the idea doesn't address is school field trips.

I was playing in the garden as a 9year old boy with my transformers, (beast wars optimus prime to be exact) I decided to sit on the bench, it is a bench after all, it's for sitting. Not this bench, little did I know it was rotten to the core. I sat, it collapsed, I screamed blue murder, I've never know such pain before or since. A nail from the splintered bench rooted itself firmly in my ballsack. I had to sit in the car for 50mins to the nearest hospital with a 3inch nail pierced into my bollocks, in tears, bleeding, questioning what I had done to anger the gods in my short 9 years. If your interested the doctors pulled the nail out without anesthesia with my dad holding me down to stop me from bolting out if the door into a&amp;e with a bejeweled ballsack. I got a lollipop out of the doctor though, so swings and roundabouts. (It comes to my attention when reviewing this harrowing incident that my balls became a rank 1 maester, gaining his first link, iron) No testicles were harmed in the making of this post, only the protective sack. Thank God.

You've got to play them at their own game.  I took my then teenage kids to Egypt about 12 years ago.  I'd already dyed my blonde hair to brown to minimise attention but we set foot out of the hotel and they were all over us like a rash (woman and 2 kids).  So I decided the best thing to do would be to hire a guy for the week to show us around, take us on trips etc.  Everyone left us the fuck alone once he was with us.  He took us up and down the Nile in his felucca (way cheaper than the organised trips).  When we wanted a camel ride, instead of having to join some shitty tour of expensiveness he took us to his village the other side of the Nile and they sorted us camels out and we literally saw the real Egypt ... people sleeping in fields for the break time and everything.  One of our camels was called Michael Jackson and led by a little girl no older than 4.  I paid him way more than he asked and it was still cheap at the price.  Tourist protection but so, so worth it.

Also he took us to Banana Island and other cool places and would water ferry us up the Nile to our hotel which had a landing steps area.  He was sweet, polite and protective. We gave him many gifts when we left."

My neighbors and I (between the ages of 7-9) were playing in the woods next to my house and saw what looked like part of a shirt covered in leaves and dirt so we tugged on it a bit but it didn't move and we left because we were a bit spooked. 
A couple of days later the part of our street with the woods was taped off by police, turns out the guy who took care of the house (the owners lived out of the country) directly to the left of mine killed his wife and dumped her body in our woods. 
I'm pretty sure I tugged on a dead body.

IPhones have great cameras and allow users to move beyond technicality and more towards art and concept. 

The reason why I asked if there was any objective way to define a good photograph if all technical parameters like exposure and focus have been met was because I firmly believe that technology is helping people express their talent without having to invest their money and their lives into 8000 dollar photography equipment. I don't think that giving more people the tools to succeed makes success less of an achievement.  "

"I was raped by my brother quite a bit as a 6-8yr old, he's 8 years older than me. He made me do everything.


Does that mean my awkward kiss with that pale girl on my couch doesn't count as a first kiss?



Or that my first time (that was my choice) having sex with my long term girlfriend wasn't my first time?



If you're a girl, know this: Hymens don't matter. Plenty of girls don't have them.


Either way, sex is an activity requiring WILLING participation from both parties. We were assaulted, we didn't ""have sex.""



If you want to refute that, fine, choose not to believe that, but you only harm yourself. 


It's your choice to decide how to feel and think about every single experience you will ever have. That's how I live my life, at least.


Get therapy, even if you don't think you need it. Tell your parents, and if they're the type that would throw you out for it (they exist, and they're horrible), tell a trusted friend and speak with the police. If you didn't collect evidence directly after then you usually can't convict, but know your options. More than ever, you need to be brave and take care of yourself, because no matter what other people do to help, you're the only one that can truly help yourself. 



Good luck. PM me if you ever want to talk."

So at one point, I see a guy just fall out if the building, probably meant to be one of the jumpers, but it just looked so ridiculous I laughed out loud in the theater. And my buddy laughed at another scene in the movie. None of it was meant to be funny in the least.

The thing is, other people in the theater were laughing at different things too. And maybe it was disrespectful to the victims of the attack, but so is making a shitty movie about it so you can profit on a tragedy."

"When I was pretty young, I'm guessing around 7, my family and I were swimming at my dads Elks Club pool in Mississippi. I went out to the parking lot at night to get something out of his truck. As I was sitting there, I watched a person wearing a white sheet and hood walking back and forth catty-corner to the Elks Club parking lot and my dads truck. I must have watched them pace for 5 minutes or so and was petrified to get out. At the time I had no idea what I was seeing but I was so scared. Didn't take many more years for me to look back and realize that was a Klan outfit. I've never seen anything before or since so blatant. "

"I have a teenage son who takes lots of baths. He does not clean the tub when he is done. I had to talk with him about it and since he is still not any better at cleaning up after himself, he is now banned from using my bathroom. He can do whatever he likes in the other bathroom, but I can't relax and enjoy my own bubble bath when the tub has some kind of sticky residue and stray pubes all over it. Even after cleaning the tub thoroughly, its just kind of grosses me out. "
"I used to run a tech help desk, with very special requirements. The help desk supported a sales team of 3000 folks who worked 100% remote in the field. We supported not just the hardware and usual software, but 13 proprietary applications *and* the business rules behind them. 

You had to actually be able to troubleshoot and explain things easily to a bunch of sales folks who really don't know tech and just want to get back on the road. So none of that ""Try this and call back"". You stay on the phone until it is resolved. Period. The client paid really well for this service, so we needed people with actual troubleshooting skills and not script readers. 

I re-wrote the previous tech skills test, to put a few trick questions in there, as many candidates came right out of schools like ITT Tech or managed to score some other kind of certification. Some folks never even had a job before. Lots of folks can pass tests, but not everyone has the innate skill for troubleshooting. Some of my BEST folks had no degrees, but were naturals. Others had degrees, certs, and all, but no skill in talking to people nor in basic troubleshooting.

At any rate, I had a guy who looked great on paper, and it was one of the better candidates this shit agency had sent us. On. Paper. 

He showed up late, in dirty black sweatpants, dirty socks with sandals, a stained greasy black sweatshirt. Had a HUGE GIANT 7/11 Soda cup, which was dripping everywhere. Greasy hair, neckbeard (versus a nicely managed beard). Just unpleasant all around to everyone. 

Was shit to the receptionist. I gave him his test; kept asking me for The Real Manager and what his name was. 

Found out that, no I'm the Hiring Lead. Didn't want to take my test, ""This is bullshit and so beneath me"". Didn't like the hourly wage. Assured me that we would make him a permanent employee, and he demanded a HUGE salary. 

I took it all in stride, as I'm used to the way a lot of dudes in tech can be about non-dude tech people. Until he got to the huge salary. And I flat out laughed in his face. 

He then told me he'd take the test, just because he'll only work here until he finds a REAL job. What do I mean that I have never heard of him and that at least, he could get credit toward his search in unemployment. Hey, at least I get that one and if he had STARTED with the ""Hey I'm only here"" I would have saved us both 2-hours. 

 Of course, after this, I told the agency if they sent us shit candidates like that, I would make sure we stopped doing business with them. 

They started sending much better candidates after that. :) Many went on to be GREAT!

TL;DR It was fucking intents

When I was in my early 20's, my then girlfriend and I went to the 24 hour race at Daytona. We camped in the infield for 3 days leading up to the race in a 12 person tent I bought on the cheap from Target. We had copious amounts of sex in the tent as well as a few less private places around the grandstands. We didn't get caught any of places we fucked except for the tent. It was early-ish morning on Saturday and my gf decides to wake me up with a bj and once she had my 'attention', she climbed on top. I'm not sure when, but I noticed a slight breeze, which was nice because it was getting hot in there. After sometime, I flip her over and start slamming home as she is stifling moans to the best of her ability. We both climax and I roll off of her and lay back, eyes closed, thinking ""my life is awesome."" Then I heard a small scream from her and she shuffled up next to me. I sit bolt upright and look to see what the fuck is going on. Turns out that 'slight breeze' was the wind blowing open the door like tent flap and there were about 8-10 people milling about outside our neighbors camp site. I reach over and snatched the flap shut, but it was too late. As soon as it closed, there was an audible sigh and then applause an a whistle or two.

"When I was 18 I was working a couple of nights a week, in a service station. Our usual costumers would be taxi drivers. This old fart took far too much interest in me, asking when I would be finishing work, how I would get home, and all that. 

At first I thought, he was just being kind and wanting to make sure I got home alright. But he stayed and chatted for almost the whole night, and the questions became more and more personal. I had an awful gut feeling about him. So I lied about the time I was off.

Next day at work. He was extremely angry with me, for not being there, when he came to pick me up.

After that episode, he started stalking the service station, would ambush me when I finished saying ""what a coincidence I was just passing by. Maybe I can give you a lift home now?"" 

That gut feeling only became stronger and stronger, and I was determined not to show him where I lived. So I lied again and again. And finally I quit that job and never saw him again."

Their story isn't as innocent and great as people depict it to be. Looks great for Messi since he basically just swooped in and took her away. Doesn't look as good for her though.

"Yep. I admit, I'm kinda obsessed with Japan (not because of anime I swear) because after visiting my friend there it seemed like such a magical place where everyone was polite and clean, I totally admire that. 

I was with my Japanese friend there when I said ""Oh I'd love to live here!"" and she looked at me in shock and said ""No you don't!"". Then proceeded to rant about how fake the japanese politeness is and how she hates Japan. She's depressed but she can't get proper mental health care, her father was abusive but police wouldn't help her because it was a ""family matter"". 

The men are rude to women (we're two young asian females in our early 20s and a guy literally grabbed my arm while we were walking down the street, asked me if I speak Japanese and begged me to drink with him. This was in broad daylight btw, at night it was worse), my friend had to take high school PE twice because her PE teacher the first time was perving at the girls. 

The discrimination is really bad. She's only half japanese and she's had customers tell her (she was a waitress) ""I want a REAL japanese waitress!"". Japanese guys wouldn't date her because her skin was too dark. 

Work hours are insane. Her part time work hours are about the same as western full time. I actually have an opportunity to do an internship there but she's greatly discouraging me. 

My uncle had a good job as a professor there at Kyoto University, he studied Japanese for many years too so he was fluent but his family decided to leave because his son (9-10 years old) was facing such extreme bullying for being a foreigner. 

She had all these complaints, all I could say was ""Well Japan is beautiful"" and she said ""Sigh... yes it's very beautiful. A pretty wrapper with a terrible gift inside."" She's desperately trying to leave Japan for the US or Europe. 

This makes me kind of sad because I love East Asian cities (My favorite places are Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul), they make me feel very ""at home"", they're very... ""me"" but it's too bad the culture isn't very healthy. I still love Japan though despite all of these things. 

Every place has their good and bad, it depends on the person if the good is worth enduring the bad. For me, I think all the good things about Japan is worth enduring all the bad things (but I haven't tried it so this might change). I know there are a lot of Koreans &amp; Japanese moving to poorer Asian countries for a more relaxed lifestyle because for them, being able to relax is more important. It's up to the person I guess.

"My wife and I have been through some shit. Losing a parent, birth of a child, extended family drama, terminal illnesses, etc. we've got our money's worth thus far.

Honestly, the worst thing we've survived has been none of those things. It's been learning how to BE married. How to build and maintain this business we've started (marriage) and making THAT the priority in our lives. To be flexible enough to take on new roles, to fill in when needed, and to compromise on the accountability and responsibilities of those roles. To realize that there is no such thing as ""more important"" when assessing every job that must be done. Every job is important, and every job is key to helping our business succeed. Most of all, learning to argue and disagree without making it personal. Learning to fail without losing a sense of respect and appreciation of each other. To be accountable for ourselves, to each other, and to the work we put into our business on a daily basis. 

This shit is hard. It's not always positive reviews and massive raises. We don't always have a banner year and reap massive profits. We don't always get to travel the world. And we've yet to watch the stock split from a massive yacht in Monaco. 

But, we just hired a new employee. So we're now a company of three and my wife and I spend a fair amount of time training our new employee. That training comes at the expense of other needs in our business and we have to make it a priority to cover those needs. Just because we've expanded, doesn't mean we can let the core of our business suffer. The foundation MUST be strong. It must be maintained and that must be a choice we make every day. Even when some days we barely get the chance to take a break. There are days off, holidays, time away, special meetings, and lots of on the job sex. Because we own the company so we get to make the rules. 

In the end, the survival of our marriage is a lifelong choice we make on a daily basis. Some days we are amazing. Some days we can't even stand to be in the same room. Most days we love each other and just try to stay connected. But ALL days - there is no other partner I want to be in business with.

That, is a hard road to walk, but it is worth it."

Anyways, so I guess I forgot how to mail a letter since it had been so long. So I wrote my name and address in the center, and the address of the sendee in the upper left hand corner. The check was then mailed to me. And at that point, I wasn't thinking, man I messed up at mailing that letter. Instead I just assumed that the price for stamps went up, and I needed to use another stamp. So I put another stamp on the check, and mailed it to myself, again. I'm not a smart man. "

"In various American hotels over the years I have been served many interesting and diverse substances which bore in common only the fact that they were mostly but not entirely unlike tea.

I have learned that, even when it is well established that the topic of concern is hot water and tea leaves, it is dangerous to be become too granular in one's requests. For example, it is common for Americans to interpret anything other than ""black tea"" to mean ""herbal tea"" which to them means ""not tea at all, really""; if you'd like some caffeine, don't ask for ""Earl Grey"" or you'll get something that smells like a cold remedy (""it's 'erbal tay, just like you asked for!"").

Tea hazards vary from region to region, but in general the subject is poorly understood. At any time, in any establishment or household, you may be served tea that is, in fact, coffee or cold or sweetened diabetically or adulterated with lemon or poisoned by sweetness substitutes or accidentally medicinal or decaffeinated/non-caffeinated or green or carbonated.

I now carry my own tea, of course, and a little sign with a set of universally parsable icons depicting ""hotness"" and ""water.""

Similarly, in my English-speaking nation we often use the term ""washroom"" to indicate a lavatory, which for some reason confuses the heck out of many Americans. Asking for the washroom leads them to believe you're under the impression that Denny's has showering facilities (which, for the record, it doesn't). It's a leap too far to get from ""restroom"" to ""washroom"" I guess."

I had a shit childhood that led to shit decisions as a young adult, and with a lot of help from my friends who believed in me and cared about me, and even more from my now-wife and her family, I turned my life around and never have to worry about where I'm going to sleep, or where or where my next meal comes from.  I go on cruises and take nice vacations.  I take none of it for granted.  For everybody like me there are thousands of homeless who don't get the help they need.  "
"This is exactly my thinking.  My dad was never on time for payments, so my mom paid everything, often forgoing stuff for herself.  When support did come in, she would sometimes get real wild with the additional income that meant we weren't living paycheck of paycheck and buy a small Dunkin coffee."
"I did a google, based on where s/he said it was. And out of the snakes that live in the area, the coral snake sounds like the most likely candidate. Since their bites tend to be fairly painless (based on a bunch of reports I read), I can see it being possible that they were attacked while sleeping. Their bites also cause paralysis, so that could be a factor too. 

Still not really sure about it either though. Why snakes would attack people like that, especially if they *were* sleeping, I don't know. "

"So basically, Bone Marrow donors are urgently needed around the world to save the lives of patients with life threatening blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma. These patients need to look to the Bone Marrow donor registry to find a match. 

What I'm trying to do with Bone Marrow Drives is go to local big events and convince people to join the registry. All people need to do at these events is fill out a form and swab their mouth. 

Later, if they match with a patient, the potential donor will be called by the registry.

"Occasionally I buy this beer called Dragon's Milk. 

It's like 11% or 11.5%. For when you want to drink ONE beer and feel good for a while. 

It's a dark stout I think, made in a bourbon barrel and with some vanilla flavor too. And four of them are like $16...but still, it can be cool when you want beer, want to get tipsy, but not have to piss a bunch.

"Probably not as weird as others, but it did surprise me. 

When I started my first job I found out a friend from middle school worked at the same company part time. We started catching up and became good friends. 

After some months we make plans one weekend to hang out and meet some old friends. I stoped by her second work place. I found out she was working in her family business, something she has done since early collage, and she only took the part time job to learn more about how to run a business. 

As she told me the story of how she has worked in her family business for a while, and how proud she was of increasing sales using different techniques I got more and more attracted to her. It felt so weird, until that point I did not find her attractive and I am sure she did not find me attractive either, we were just two friends. 

Now the part where I actually got hard is when this old guy comes in to the store and starts asking for very specific and technical things. My friend handle the interaction like a pro. She knew the business in and out. For some reason seeing her in control and with almost some amount of power got me aroused. 

We are still in contact but we live in different cities, we both are engaged to different people. "

"Fine now - I needed surgery, though.  It was pretty hellish for a few months.

Long story short, I've got herniated discs in my spine.  I was squatting, got a twinge from the back, did something to protect it and managed to push my small intestine through the abdominal wall.  They fixed it by cutting me open and putting a mesh across the tear.

It can get serious, though - the intestine's pushing through a small hole, so it can get strangulated and cut off the blood supply.  If that happens you've basically got a few hours to get into surgery."

"Per /u/random_guy_11235's comment below, riders are almost always related to political compromise. Everyone wants power so they can pass the legislation they care about, and there's a tremendous amount of power that comes along with a ""no"" vote. You cash that in for a ""yes"" vote in exchange for an issue you care about (or hopefully an issue your voters care about) getting some love.

This often results in seemingly illogical/random riders hanging off of legislation left and right, but realistically very little would get done without them."

My daughter is extremely smart and quite mature for 4 years old. She was completely terrified, hiding under the covers repeating over and over the man was at the door staring at the roof. The kicker went sent shivers down my spine was how she described him.

""He had no face dad, he had no face....""

People are WORSE than animals and the women are the worst - sticking their used pads to the walls, smearing bloody fingerprints on the doors and on more than many occasions we found used tampons hanging by their strings from the taps. More annoying than those incidents though was the amount of ignorant bitches who would layer the seat in toilet paper so their precious arses didn't have to touch it then just leave the paper there and not flush either - you cunts are the REASON this place is so filthy all the time! I confronted one woman who did this immediately after I'd cleaned the stall and made her tidy it all up, the look on her face as she scurried off to her car was priceless.

"I was walking home late at night across town to pick up some medicine for my girlfriend (I don't drive), and was walking down the main highway. I had music blasting in my ears and was completely zoned out for the entire walk, until I saw a guy on a BMX bike with a backpack on the opposite side of the highway b-line right for me. He stopped his bike about 5 feet from me, unzipped his backpack, and reached in while saying 

""I'm going to fucking kill you.""

I started to pull what looked like a pain can with a handle until I put my hands up and said ""Dude, are you serious- seriously going to shoot me? For what? I haven't got any money.""

At which point his eyes went wide and stuffed the weird metal thing into his bag and got out of phone. ""Oh fuck man I'm sorry! I thought you were this guy in a rival gang that beat up one of my buddies! Here let me show you on my phone...""

and he showed me what the rest of the metal thing was. It was a homemade gun that looked like it was made of pipes and was in the shape of a sub machine gun. I have no idea if it worked, or why he was going through the effort of unlocking his phone, scrolling through his entire gallery, just to show me the thing he almost killed me with. 

Then he told me to have a nice night and to please not call the cops on him for almost killing me, then road off.

"I honestly think moms are sometimes the worst about this sort of thing. When I was 16 it was the final day in drivers ed, and my 50 year old driving instructor put his hand on my thigh and said something along the lines of ""you did great today, my little sexy"" (I can't remember exactly, this was 13 years ago). I got out of the car in a hurry and when I got into my moms car I told her and she laughed and blew it off like it was supposed to be a fucking compliment. I will never forget it and it disturbs me that my own mom didn't take me more seriously. 

Sorry you had to go through that!"

1) On the bus, hearing people chatting about me in French, talking about how the book I was reading was for kids and that I was creepy for glancing at them. As I get off, I look at them and tell them ""It is a book for young adults, but I've got to understand it because the autistic kid I work with loves it"". The look of horror was delicious.

2) Working at a children's centre, a little kid from Lebanon would just ignore everyone and act as if he couldn't speak English - we know from his mother he can. He's pissing around one day and in Arabic I tell him ""Stop messing around, sit down, and be quiet"". He looked like he just shat himself."

"But don't you know that the foreskin contains 99.9% of all erogenous penile tissue?  Mutilated men can never properly pair-bond with a woman because their penises cannot properly experience sex thanks to the loss of those hormone receptors that science totally understand the purpose of.

That's why I am 45 years old and single.  I masturbate for 4 hours every day to hardcore group-sex pornography, but my penile sensitivity and intimacy problems are 110% caused by my neonatal circumcision.

Even though the medical community nearly unanimously recommended the procedure when I was born, my parents obviously only opted for it because they hate me and wanted me to suffer.  That's why I publicly disowned them with a drunken facebook post."

"I've mentioned this before and been affirmed by other fathers, when I had kids I started crying at the weirdest stuff. I could count on one hand the number of times I'd cried as an adult, including several deaths of close family members. Then a few years ago i became a father, and suddenly every corny father-son commercial on TV, every emotional movie scene, anything having to do with the love of a father for his son set off the waterworks. I have no clue what in my brain chemistry changed, but it was instantaneous. Now that it's been a few years it doesn't happen as often, but it still does on occasion. I like to think that I'm a better man for it, it's allowed me to appreciate my emotions on a deeper level. But still humorous when my wife would look over and I was tearing up over a dog food commercial where a dog was caring for his pups. "

"I worked in the wedding industry in Louisiana (south of New Orleans which is an area that's it  own little world) 

Most popular wedding themes were hunter/camo. Brown dresses with orange ribbons and stuff. Anything fitting the camouflage theme. We had camo vests for grooms and groomsmen which was very popular. One bride was brought into the wedding on a shrimp boat. Groom wore shrimp boots.

Second most popular theme was LSU. We did a lot of purple and gold weddings. And black and gold cause of the saints. 

I always really loved getting a bride who truly had nice taste and education and wanted to have a nice traditional wedding cause we could use elegant things and make it look so nice. 

My own wedding was just very classic and the opposite of what other people around here like to do. 

I hated hated hated having to serve these tacky ass people and pretend to like all their tacky ideas but you just have to smile and nod.

Oh you're getting married in a prom dress and wearing shrimp boots and y'all are having 300 guests and food served on paper plates? Just smile and nod. "

"My mother is a narcissist who always told me growing up all she ever wanted was to be a mother, and I now understand why. My mother expected me and my siblings to love her unconditionally and obey her without question, as if children were drones and not individuals.

She *hated* me because I was a daddy's girl and when my siblings came along groomed them to think of her as a god and me as a traitor. Growing up she made sure to tell me I was lazy, ungrateful, stupid; she liked to point out my flaws (""maybe you'll grow into your big feet"" ""your ears make you look like dumbo!""); she was emotionally erratic and inconsistent, where one day thing X was ok, but the next it was unacceptable and I was grounded for a month; worst of all was the gaslighting and projection. Essentially, she was emotionally abusive and I'm still dealing with the reprocussions of that today. 

Now that I'm no longer under her abuse I can see her for what she is: a miserable wretch, someone with no friends, whose only personal connection with anyone depends on what they can offer her (something most of them find out and cut off contact), and a truly stupid person who has to be cruel to thrive in the world.

I'm not sure if I'll ever have children, but regardless I make sure to treat everyone with humility, compassion, and understanding because of that worthless cunt that gave birth to me. Well, everyone except her :)"

"I'm really struggling to post this but I hope one of you out there, might understand. 

My father. 

And I feel like shit for typing this out because he's terminally ill, the only parent I have left living. I've done my best to make peace with the type of father he chose to be to me, and the husband he chose to be to my mother. And I use the word ""chose"" intentionally, because he chose to be shitty and abusive, at both.

The bitter-sweet aspect of the ENTIRE thing, is that by doing so, he inspired me to be a better husband and father. To participate and not walk-out when things get hard. To provide me the ability to ask ""what would my father have done in this situation?"" - so I can reflect and make my own choice. It's shit to have an anti-role model be your parent. No kid should have to feel that. Earned or not.

I love my father, I appreciate my father, but I will never respect my father. That, is a hard truth to admit. For my entire life, that I can remember, I have waged a massive war to never be my father. And now, on the eve of his passing, I realize the battle was never about being different than my father but accepting that I will always be part of him. And if I can BE the part of him, that he couldn't be, maybe that is the best gift we can give each other.

A Roman coin, or brooch? Breaking open the earth to discover an object nobody has lay eyes on for dozens, if not hundreds of years... breathtaking. Lastly, opening your finds pouch after a four hour session to finally examine what you have: coin dates, values, referring to old antiquities texts and Googling what you think you might have.

"I did not see this but heard the story.

A young girl needed a blood transfusion and her brother (I think about 5 years old) was a match for her. So the doctors asked him if he would give her some blood. His parents both said it was the right thing to do. He waited a few moments before agreeing. They hooked him up to do the transfusion and he looked very worried, but that is to be expected. (I still hate needles) After a few minutes the young boy asked a doctor, “How Long until I die.” The boy thought that giving his blood would kill him and he stepped up to save his sister. That is bravery.

This is also a great lesson in making sure people know what you are asking. The boy had no idea that the blood would be replaced and he would be fine."

My friend kept saying he wanted to get out but I was enjoying it so I kept saying 5 more minutes. When we were getting out my friend stood up and stared, and then he just dropped and slammed his head into the hot tub and rolled on me. I held him above water and he started grunting and convulsing. He finally rose up and was completely coherent. We think he just got really overheated/relaxed and got light headed similar to when you stand up too quick and he just passed out. If I wasn't there he would have easily drowned. Scary shit.

"But calling women 'crazy' for the smallest things is also normal. Like actresses beyond a certain age in Hollywood who aren't Meryl Streep get labeled crazy and no one works with them, though male actors actually indulge in insane behavior and still get work!

Men call their exes crazy because she was attached to them, or because she was paranoid about getting cheated on (because the guy was actually cheating on her), or because she had a completely normal set of demands (don't spend too much money, spend less time on video games, fuck me some more). And all that behavior gets dismissed as 'oh she was crazy'.

Yesterday I was listening to a podcast with a female comic whose ex (also a comic) had abused and raped her for three years. She had been super scared to talk about it to anyone because she was afraid of being labeled crazy. She was finally talking about it on her podcast because another ex of the guy came out publicly to say she had been abused by him. It was scary to see the amount of fear and self doubt she was still in, and this had happened 3-4 years ago!"

"Used to work at a Lowe's when I was younger and thankfully one of things the women who worked in departments around mine taught me was ""always look at the person asking the questions when giving answers.""

Fun side story: one of my male coworkers told me about a time a woman walked up to the paint counter staring at color swatches in her hand and said ""excuse me can you tell me which shade you think..."" at which point she looked up and saw she was talking to a man, then said ""oh, sorry, nevermind"" and walked away.

"Not to mention absolutely *nobody* is going to be on speaking terms with the runaway bride/groom ever again. 

They've wasted the time of all of their friends and family, plus that of the friends and family of their now ex partner. 

They wasted all the money spent by the aforementioned people (not just the money spent by whomever paid for the wedding, but the cost of plane tickets, hotel rooms and childcare for guests coming from out of town, the cost of formal attire and hairstylings, etc...). 

And, worst of all... They just emotionally destroyed their ex partner in front of a ton of people, roughly half of which are his/her friends and family! 

That poor person spent the entire time up to the moment of the ceremony believing that they'd finally found the one person they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with. 

They mentally prepared themselves for marriage and everything that came with it, they talked themselves out of last minute doubts and fears, they planned the wedding of their dreams and brought all their loved ones together to witness their eternal bonding...

And then out of the blue, that person publically betrays them and runs off with someone else who came to the wedding specifically to steal them away from their fiance. 

No moral person on Earth should want to have any further interactions with someone who would do such a thing to another person. 

Their friends should be on the phone with them the next day going ""What the actual fuck is wrong with you?!""  "

"I have a little alternative advice to some of what's already been mentioned. It'll be buried but w/e

1. Bring snacks to work instead of lunch.
I work shifts and have no self control. So I bring granola bars, fruit, nuts, crackers -- stuff that is small that I can eat quickly whenever I have a moment. That way when my lunch hour finally comes along, I'm not hungry and won't feel the need to spend on a full meal; but I won't feel guilty going off with my co-workers and chatting with them. This also means that if I end up with an early lunch, I'm not hungry at the end of my shift and am not tempted to buy anything on my long commute home, thereby defeating the purpose of bringing a lunch and not spending money on food. 

2. Delete your credit card information from everywhere on the internet. 
Wherever it can be filled in automatically, just delete the information. That way when you want to buy something online, you have to take that extra step to get your credit card out of its hidey-hole and that extra hassle is usually enough to make you re-think what you're about to buy and whether you really need to spend an extra $30 to get free shipping.

3. Carry your debit card, i.d., and nothing else.
Don't carry points cards, credit cards, buy-10-coffees-get-one-free cards, any of it. If you don't carry your store points card, you won't feel like you need to buy from that store to get more points. Same with coffee. If you don't carry your credit card, you don't have the option to use it when you have insufficient/low funds on your debit card. Carrying cash is a good trick but for whatever reason (maybe it's because I'm a disgusting millennial gremlin), I keep better track of my funds from my debit card because I can actually see what I am spending listed on my statement, which helps me see the dumb shit I'm spending my money on. 

4. Sell/Trade/Donate
Sell that pile of books you haven't read and aren't going to read. What you can't sell, trade for small things you will use (like granola bars). There are lots of these trade groups on Facebook in many cities, everyone wants little things and will be willing to trade you the little thing you need. What you can't sell or trade, just donate. Donate, sell and trade until you have cleared your life of clutter.

5. Replace clutter with plants.
Plants are nice, and provide you with something to take care of while costing very little. Plants cost less than a pet yet still require some responsibility. Plants are cheap, but grow to be very big. In the space where you got rid of things, put a plant in there. Now your space does not look empty, but looks lush. Now you can't spend $100 on a new chair because there's a plant in the space where you would put the chair.

Try not to go overboard on the last point. Some spaces need chairs, not plants. "

Instead of putting my grandmother in a home they offered to move her into their house so my aunt could take care of her. Meanwhile, my mom was in the process of divorcing my dad, selling the house, and working 70 hours a week to keep up at a job she hated.

In the midst of all that, my aunt asked if my mom could come over to be with my grandmother on the day she was meeting with the lawyer to finalize her divorce. Mom said she couldn't make it and my aunt told her that if she really loved her mother she'd make time and would move her appointment with the lawyer - even though she came to the house every day after work to see her.

Finally, my mom admitted to my uncle (her brother) that she was suicidal and wanted a way out. He then proceeded to tell her she was a horrible person and was useless because she didn't want to help.

"Fullmetal Alchemist 2003 episode 10 the phantom thief. 

This episode confuses me every time I watch it. Not only is it strange, but it makes little sense when you watch it with the rest of the show. First of all the rules of alchemy are barely followed (what is this card magic?). The character decisions are idiotic at best, with Al falling for the same trick like three times in a row. Then there's the weird continuity errors. 

* At some point the main ""villain"" of the episode dresses up as a nun and hides in a catholic church. The problem is FMA takes place in alternate universe germany where the catholic church doesn't exist. Usually there's either ishval or that sun god from episodes 1-2.

* There's also a ton of japanese snacks in the episode. Understandable for an anime, but it's much more out of place in AU germany. Especially since Edward is a big eater and we see him eating a variety of snacks throughout the series. 

I swear this episode was written by different writers or something. It has so little bearing on the rest of the series. "

He's not even old enough to drink but he thinks he has the world figured out and he's on top of it. What he's really doing is pushing everyone away with his attitude and besmirching the uniform he obviously takes too much pride in wearing. The worst part?

"I had a teacher in the fifth grade who told us about her mom being pregnant woth her sister. Mom was a teeny tiny rodeo performer, who rode horses, and was allegedly very strong in her core. So strong in fact, that her abdominal muscles kept the baby farther back and she didn't look at all pregnant until seven months or so, when she got into the shower after a rodeo, before some big fancy award dinner, in a state other than where she lived. Something about hot water relaxing her muscles and idk, maybe some other factors like the baby being active in utero, contributed to the kid relocating itself farther forward, and in the span of one shower, the woman went from looking like a cheerleader in-season to a normal 7-month pregnant lady.

"It's only happened to me once, and more's the pity. After reading great stories about it all over the internet, I longed for it to happen!

I grew up in Texas. The only way you *don't* pick up at least some spanish is if you're a complete moron or you're willfully avoiding it. I took five years of spanish, between high school and undergrad, and had a couple of multi-lingual friends. When I moved, I was pretty close to fluent. I left for Pennsylvania, which has a *lot* less Spanish speakers. Go figure.

I took a retail position as a cashier to pay the bills for a while. One night in December, near closing, a family comes up to the register. If I remember correctly, a couple kids, mother and father, and a grandmother. The grandmother was just laying shit down in spanish left and right about the store, and that didn't change as they walked up to me. Dude, I got so excited when I heard it; it had been a while since I had the chance to practice my spanish, but I still understood her and I couldn't *wait* for her to start talking about me.

'lo and behold, she did! No idea what her problem was, but she started talking about how slow I was checking them out (I wasn't) and, bizarrely, about how short I am (admittedly I'm a bit short). One of the other family members half-heartedly chuckled and told her to shush a couple of times, but the whole thing was as normal as possible. I rung them up speaking in english, waiting for my moment. And then, just as they turned to leave, I told them ""Tienen una gran noche y Feliz Navidad!"" (Have a great night and Merry Christmas!)

And there was my moment where the grandmother realized I could understand her. Unfortunately, she didn't turn red, nobody laughed, the rest of the customers didn't applaud, you know... she did look at least mildly embarrassed, but they just left the store without responding.

I spent the rest of the night excitedly telling people about it. No one was as amused as I was."

I don't think that this was your fault, though. Society pressures people into shunning their darker skin. White skin is good skin. Dark skin is bad. And *dirty*. I grew up watching Filipino girls get coloured contacts because they wanted to be ""Spanish"", not Filipina. Knew lots of black girls who got copper blonde weaves and applied a tonne of makeup to keep their ""light skinned"" appearance for as long as they could.  And Chinese and Korean women dodge the sun like it's acid rain, just so they don't get tanned/dark.

You've more of a chance of winning the car by switching than staying.

A while ago there was a Minecraft server called RedWarfare. I was with the community hopping along different servers for years playing Search and Destroy, a fun class based game that was actually quite balanced and well made. But it wasn't until we got to RedWarfare where another game caught my eye: Gear Wars. You'd choose a class and a kit, and go around a destructible terrain looting chests and fighting others to the death. I chose a class that turned fall damage into strength (in addition to not taking fall damage), and a kit that gave me enderpearls, orbs that you threw to teleport where it lands, as well as doing some damage to you as compensation so you can't spam them. The game classifies this damage as fall damage, which means not only do I get the jump on someone, but I have a strength bonus.

I used these ender pearls to first get to the best chests. I had all the chests on all the maps memorized, and had routes and backup routes of getting to chests. I got very good at PvP from both that and other games from years of experience, so if someone else was at a chest somehow before me I would win. I'd win each game with a full set of enchanted diamond armor, golden apples, and strength and speed potions. I played only this game for about a year, 5 to 8 hours a day on weekdays and more so on weekends. Each game was about 10 minutes long, consisting of about 20 players each. I lost about once per day. It got to the point where I was well known in the community, people would call me a hacker, but then would spectate me playing and realize I was just incredibly good. I got a little fanbase going because of that, as those who used to call me a hacker came to my defense when others accused me. It was greatly amusing, and probably the most popular I've ever been among a group.

Then that server shut down and I stopped playing Minecraft for a year. 

But those routes and skills are still ingrained in me. I'm sure I could woop Death's ass at that minigame. "

"Not OP, but a mental health professional. It's not likely pathology so much as missing social cues and a basic lack of empathy. For instance, I (usually) don't hit on women when they're working because 1) I know it's often their job to be overly friendly and 2) I wouldn't want to be flirted with when I'm working. I also understand that complimenting a girl's glasses isn't the same as complimenting her hips for their child baring capabilities. The former says you made a good decision, the latter says you *are* a good decision (for me). Empathy says I know how it would feel if someone said this to me, therefore I will/won't say or do this to you.

Anyway, could missing social cues be the result of pathology? Sure, mild autism spectrum can lead to such issues with almost no other symptoms. But it's far more likely these people simply awkward.   "

Any large rants. Particularly those about people not responding to their messages, pleading for people to give them a change/they're a nice guy/you women are so superficial/tired of all the FAKENESS"" type crap.

Also any fully capitalized sentences. No thank you. 

""Looking for my partner in crime/soul mate/companion/queen/etc.""

Any kind of list about what attributes ""their women"" should have, including hobbies, weight, height, something your pretty sure is a direct description of their movie character,etc. ""If you don't have these I'm not interested!"" --which is funny, because myself and my friends never seem to fit in those lines, yet we've all gotten messaged by these dudes.

Plus, the majority of SF is filthy.  Not like loose garbage here and there, but straight up dumping grounds along major intersections, tourist spots, and even areas of heavy auto/foot traffic.  

The homeless situation is INSANE here.  So many homeless that exacerbate the general uncleanliness.  Smells like urine probably 5 out of 7 days in a ton of places, including the tourist spots.  Also, you shouldn't be surprised to see someone taking a shit in public or used hypodermic needles strewn along the side of streets.

The Bay Area is in for a long transition and with everything changing so fast, so many displaced people, and the NIMBY-ism going on, shit's terrible.

"Using a throw away.

Back in about 2000 I was working as a graphic artist and junior programmer in a small web developer company.

In my leetness I decided to play around with the sub7 trojan. All the cool kids were doing it.  I would infect people through peer to peer networks and then have fun rotating their screen, popping open the CD tray, reversing their mouse ...nothing malicious and no files deleted or even looked at...harmless fun, so I thought.

After about 2 weeks of ""playing"" around like this one afternoon I got back from lunch and on my work voice mail was a message saying: ""ThrowAway_NotLeet, currently residing at (my home address at the time) you need to get your bullshit trojan and your bullshit self out of my computer or you will face some serious consequences.""

Scared the shit out of me and seriously creeped me out. At that time IP addresses were very dynamic. A reboot would usually assign a new IP address. My ISP was one of the largest in the area with lots of subscribers. I still have no idea how it was traced.

Somehow this individual managed to correlate a very temporary IP address with my name,  home address, work address and work phone. My work phone had only been active for about a week.

I'm not sure if the individual was Law Enforcement, a security specialist (unlikely because of allowing themselves to get infected from a peer-to-peer site with an obviously tampered executable or something else.

Never messed with black hat stuff ever again unless it was a penetration testing on servers I was responsible for securing.

"There was a post on here a while ago where someone had mentioned that in middle school an unpopular boy gave a girl a strange figurine and the girl cried. Then another poster proudly declared that he would *never* let *his* kids react in such an unacceptable way to a gift they'd been given. The thread was locked so I couldn't say anything but that exchange enraged me and I am still so mad about it.

Sexual harassment starts really young. Picture this, you're 11 years old, still a child really, and a boy you barely know walks up and hands you something. You don't really like this kid but the thing he gives you obviously has *a lot* of meaning behind it. Everyone in the class notices and starts teasing you because of this thing you've been given as a result of a crush from a boy you don't want anything to do with. You don't want to go out with him but he won't take no for an answer and so you start to get mean to let him know you're serious. And then you get called a bitch. After all, he's just a sweet little boy with a crush. Why can't you just be nice to him? What's wrong with you??

No one gives a shit about the little girl's feelings in that situation and no one talks about how fucked up it is that we expect young girls to just know how to handle unwanted attention in a healthy way. A little boy doesn't know any better, but neither does the little girl. It would have helped me out a lot if someone had told me when I was young that it's okay to not want to reciprocate unwanted attention and that it didn't make me a bad person. "

"How to learn independently.

In school there were always teachers to teach, they gave you the books and reference resources, etc. Then they teach you how to pass tests to move to the next thing.

What they didn't teach me was how to learn in an environment without that. Especially in a pre-internet age when google wasn't there to answer everything. A lot of topics our small library didn't have information on, or it was terribly outdated if they did. So my first real learning experience as an adult was learning how to learn, how to find resources and information without someone handing them to me."

Yes, it's just fake Internet points. 

But let's say, you are at a bar hanging out with friends and making funny remarks or telling them jokes you heard at work or a story of your childhood, and they are laughing at them...  *Why do you do it?* It feels good to make people laugh.    
And maybe not all of it, but some part of your karma, is the number of times you made a stranger smile. That's what karma stands for. 

Now, when the stuff isn't funny. It might be entertaining, you entertained hundreds. 
It might be informative or something important, you may have improved lives, maybe in the slightest way, you improved someone's day a little. You may have *affected* lives. That's what karma stands for.

Not even an ""of course she's beautiful, but more importantly, she's kind and intelligent,"" etc. Never came up at all. 

And I realized that I'd never heard a speech like that at a wedding. People always--ALWAYS--at least *mention* the bride's beauty. Sometimes the groom's handsomeness too, sure, but ALWAYS the bride's beauty. 

It was really refreshing. I appreciated that speech so much. But I was also sad to notice it--to realize how automatic it is for us to talk about women's looks when we're thinking about their good qualities. And how for women, our human value is so tied up in the value we have as sex objects."

"The *first* thing we learned in therapy was that anger is a secondary emotion. It’s an elevated, rash response that protects a deeper vulnerability, be it betrayal, depression, etc. Anger is always connected to a deeper emotional cause, and the trick to actually handling those deeper problems is being able to control the anger enough to properly communicate.

While a short fuse may simply be a short fuse (something that a communication class or anger management could probably fix), it could also be an indicator of deeper problems that even the angry person may not be aware of because it’s been buried so deep. Mental health problems also aren’t necessarily lifelong conditions, but everybody can benefit from therapy or counseling when we hit the rough times–even the bad people. 

I do kind of wish that therapy/counseling was more of a “preventative care” thing than a solely “mental illness treatment” thing. I wish it were casual to say “you seem a lot more moody/angry/sad lately. Is everything okay and have you considered maybe seeing a professional if you haven’t been able to shake it?” Sometimes we need something more structured than simply venting to a friend, even if we don’t necessarily have a mental illness or disorder.

"After I was certified I volunteered when I was going to college. When I was volunteering I only went on a few fire calls, but one of them was a huge condo under renovations that caught at about 5 in the morning. Police do a pretty good job of keeping people away, but there was a time when I was in full bunker gear and some kids saw us (I think we were training, but I don't remember exactly) and they just kind of gawked at us. Not really afraid by any means, just kind of staring not really sure how to process. 

It's one of those jobs where stuff like that happens, and I can say I did the same I was younger. It wasn't my dream to be a firefighter, but when the opportunity arose I thought I could at least try it and see if I like it; I fell in love. I'm glad as a kid I thought it was really cool, or else I have no idea where I would be at today. 

And thank you, it really does mean a lot. People like you help me keep pushing through the hard boring stuff, i.e. schooling. All I've ever wanted to do was help people, and this gives me a way to do that. "

"The Australian gun ban is a fascinating subject because it is the closest thing to a controlled laboratory experiment in gun control we are ever likely to see. The Australian government confiscated and melted down 600,000 privately owned firearms, and essentially banned firearm ownership for self defense from that point forward. The murder rate should have dropped steeply and immediately, and violent crime in general should have dropped steadily if not precipitously.

But the murder rate did not drop, as you will see if you observe the Australian government's own statistics. It did not drop at all. It ticked up on the whole and did not drop for several years--as the murder rate in all other developed countries was dropping steadily as well, including the US, though our gun laws have been steadily loosening since the same time frame.

The robbery increase was steep and immediate though. If murder had dropped, everybody would have been anxious to ascribe that to gun control. Since robbery spiked, though, well, there must have been some other external factor at play, we're told. It can not be that gun control in Australia did no good and may have caused harm. That can not be it. Except that that is what Australia's own data suggest."

I can't tell you how many people I have watched spiral out of control and become the person they most hated because society told them they couldn't walk away from abusive family members because ""No matter what, that's your Dad/Mom/ grandparent/ sibling"" etc. Similar to what someone said about the ""ride or die"" attitude in relationships.

Because of that awful reputation, Funeral Directors are treated and regarded as slimy individuals who are only after your money---no. Unless they are in the family of the owners of the funeral home OR own the funeral home themselves, these men don't make additional profit from selling you a fancier casket. Funeral Directors are paid a standard salary like most jobs. Also, they aren't trying to sell you the most expensive things, they are trying to sell you the best possible memory of your loved one. Most of them are genuinely good guys (and gals) who want to give you that ""peace"" and ""final goodbye"" you need after a loved one dies. 

No, none of this standard funeral stuff is necessary. But most people want a final, rose-colored goodbye when a loved one dies."

"So the problem with water on an oil fire, for those wondering, is that water boils at a much lower temperature than oil. So if you have a 300C degree pan of hot oil, and then add water (which boils at 100C), the water will begin to displace the oil, creating water bubbles within it, boil instantly, consequently creating vapor bubbles and making the oil pop as the vapor bubbles escape. If the oil is on fire, all that happens is the oil pops just the same, but now it's on fire too."

"I love the idea of the paranormal, but don't actually really hold any belief in it. However...

There are tunnels running underneath his row of houses where they used to transport the mental patients during WW2 which just serves as a creepy setting as it is.

The only time I witnessed anything scary myself was (luckily) at about 10 a.m. on a Friday morning - there were three of us who had stayed over and we didn't have lessons until later that day so we were all downstairs playing FIFA, as 17 year olds do.

His brother's radio started playing from upstairs, we all looked at each other obviously shitting ourselves but it wasn't just the fact that it came on, it was playing ""Cry me a river"". If you can't remember, re-listen to the beginning of that song and you'll realise why it shit us up. 

Like I said, luckily it was 10 a.m. so we all went in there.. radio was unplugged.

Linking to a semi-relevant post I recently made. Additionally, don't try providing fix-it advice if you're not medical personnel.

If I'm in a depressed cycle, I don't want to hear how exercise releases endorphins and how ""doing XYZ"" helped so-and-so. In my case, I'm usually in a downward spiral of self-reinforcing thoughts about self-worthlessness, like when I start thinking I'm not useful, so I hide, and nobody notices and that reinforces the self-worthlessness.

So at times like this, I need outside input to counteract these thoughts. A quote from some dude's uncle, ""Depression presents itself in the guise of rational thought."" For me, my own thoughts are irrefutable truths that I cannot even provide counter-evidence against. Unfortunately, they could not be further from truthful, often comprised entirely of baseless broken logic and fallacies. Thus, I need someone else to be the *actual* rational thinker and convince me that, yes, I *am* worth something and yes, I *am not* a failure."

"""Liberal"" here. I also own guns. I think the largest miscommunication lies in variance by state and in lack of enforcement. But my state in particular has some big issues to work on as far as regulation.


Examples:
Most of the people I know who own firearms should have been disqualified due to their criminal record or history of mental illness. They weren't because communication in our state law enforcement system is badly underfunded (like convicted child abusers passing background checks for daycare jobs bad, it isn't limited to firearms). The policy is already pretty strict, just not enforced.

As far as the ""gun show loophole"", the law in my state dictates that a firearm purchased from a dealer outside of the state must be purchased in accordance with the laws of the dealer's state, that's it. It's very common that out-of-state dealers will process a sale ""through their business"", but in reality treat a cash purchase as a private sale. Our state basically has no recourse because we don't regulate their dealer responsibilities, private sales or their firearm laws. This isn't something I've been told, I've seen it with my own eyes. This is simply a policy issue that needs a solution specific to this situation.


Because we can't get over the ""guns bad"" vs. ""they'll take everything down to the last .22"" argument"", nobody will stop to realize that some these issues are policy but some are related to larger issues and neither will be resolved."

"But the libertarian party does nothing but leech onto the GOP while also trying to claim the moral high ground because they don't actually believe the social conservatism. Their entire modus operandi is to convince people that liberals are evil socialists so definitely don't vote for them, and vote for the GOP because they'll at least protect your economic interests, and who cares about their social positions because you're likely an upper middle white male, so you won't be affected by it, but you can still say that you don't actually believe the government should have a hand in abortion while implicitly supporting it.

This is the horrible effect of first past the post voting. The GOP just needs to die already so liberals and libertarians can engage in meaningful discussions on economic policy and foreign diplomacy instead of trying to convince half the country that a woman who loves a woman isn't subhuman."

The dumpster was so heavy that when we lifted it onto the truck, you could watch the trucks suspension drop from the weight. This happened every Wednesday for 3 months. "

"I had a full ride to college when I graduated high school and I decided not to go. Why? Because I sat down and thought ""What in the fuck am I gonna do with a history degree?"" The answer is nothing that pays well. So instead I worked small jobs trying to figure out what I wanted to do when there was a 6 month turnaround at a chemical plant my uncle worked at. He was in charge of the contractors at that site and told me he could get me a job as a hole watch/fire watch and all around laborer. Oh you guys need tools? I'll go get them. Oh, you need me to put never seize on these 200 bolts? No problem. I worked 12 hours a day for 6 months with maybe 8 days off total and I made $15 an hour and time and a half after 40 hours. It was definitely rough when it first started but I got used to it and I even enjoyed it. My uncle didn't cut me any breaks and even wrote me up when I violated a safety policy. But I genuinely enjoyed working with those guys and thought I could maybe do that. When that job ended I applied for a job with the same company at another site and I got the job. Now this job placed me in the control room with the plant operators (the company men) and I got a real sense of what they did and what shift work was like. After about a year I really enjoyed working at that plant and the operators and other contractors and decided I wanted to work in the chemical plant/refinery industry. So I enrolled myself in a trade school for Process Technology and while in school the plant I was working at started hiring. Well, I applied and I've been hired as a plant operator for 4 years now making $39 an hour, time and a half after 40 hours, double time and a half on holidays, and double time every 7th day in a row. I get 4 weeks paid vacation and my insurance only costs me $65 a month. It's got its risks and it's downsides but I made $105k last year and I'm 26 years old and my friends with bachelors degrees are struggling to find work. I make more than most engineers at work. Not to mention the welders, pipe fitters, electricians, etc... that I work with that make good money that you can really live on. I'm a blue collar worker and I'm damn proud of it and the way our teachers portrayed blue collar work is disgraceful. I would absolutely encourage high school kids to look into skilled trades instead of college. "

"These two narratives:

***""Overall, rapes and sexual assaults on women are under-reported.""***

This is because women tend to blame themselves or think (in many cases correctly) that they will not be believed. If they do report it, they are often humiliated at many steps of the process --
 they are told they encouraged it, they should have stopped it, they don't understand their own experience and are just wrong. If they make it beyond that stage, the men often get minimal or no punishments""

and

***""Overall, rapes and sexual assaults on women are over-reported""*** 

This is because society is too quick to believe any claim women make about it. Most of these events are just misunderstandings, or women using malicious lies vindictively or just for the heck of it. Often, the man in the situation is not believed and ends up with his life ruined.""

"Fun fact:

That saying actually comes from the burial processes that happen often in New Orleans. Due to the high water table and a shortage of available land, most burials are done in above ground crypts. It's common to bury a person in the crypt, then exactly one year and a day later, they exhume the body, remove it from the coffin and then push the body towards the back of the crypt. The back of the crypt has a hole that the body falls into and so the crypt can be used for the next family member. That hole just happens to be ten feet from the front of the crypt so they use a ten foot pole.

"One morning during study time, my companion answered a knock on the door. We were living in the projects in SP, Brazil, and there were two padlocks and a door lock in front of our apartment for good reason. There was a lady outside who apparently told him management had sent her to replace the valves on our propane tank. He promptly let her in and had her switch out the valve. At this point I got up to see who the hell he had let into our apartment.

Now I didn't believe that the apartment manager sent this lady at all, and as I asked her questions it became apparent she was just trying to scam us. She told us the new valve was $220 (reais), and when I told her I'd seen them in the hardware store down the street for 25 she got very defensive. That was when her partner showed up.

When she came in the apartment she had spoken into the radio on her hip, saying which apartment she was going into. The guy she had radioed took a few minutes to show up, and did so right about the time I became sure this was a scam. Unfortunately, he did so with a gun barely concealed in his front fanny pack. I said we were happy with our old valve, but they were not having it. This guy insisted that we pay the the money for the new valve immediately, and he was getting pretty antsy about it. I told him (truthfully) that we didn't have that kind of cash and our cards couldn't make purchases. They could only withdraw at the ATM. His response: ""No problem, we'll give you a ride to the ATM.""

So we got into the back of their unmarked white van, and they drove us to the nearest ATM while telling us to make sure and hook up with some ""mulatas"" while we're in Brazil. Meanwhile, my companion seems absolutely CLUELESS as to what's going on. He didn't notice the gun, and didn't think twice about agreeing to get in the van. I told him I would withdraw the money, and he should just not pull his wallet at all. I gave them the 220, and they took off.

To top it all off, when we get home I asked my companion to open the door and his eyes went wide. He'd left the keys in the apartment. We went down the street to a locksmith who picked his way through the padlocks and door in about a minute. I convinced him to let us pay later, as we'd just been robbed. My companion looked over at me with his jaw on the floor and exclaimed, ""WE JUST GOT ROBBED!?"" All I could think to say was, ""Uh, yeah dude.""

Tl:dr Got extorted, and my companion didn't even notice.

"I used to be a military policeman, so my experience is a little different but we had our share of issues. The main reason I left is because it doesn't take long for an ""us vs. Them"" mentality.outside your circle of cop friends, almost everyone you deal with is a criminal. I'm not talking about traffic stops though. Police are usually reactionary, so we get to the scene after someone is dead, we get to a domestic after the violence is calmed down, so on and so forth. I went in thinking I'd be stopping crimes before they happen. 

So you start seeing everyone as a potential criminal, it's easy to lose faith in humanity, and there becomes a real issue of either complacency, or extremism. You see things at the worst, so you *expect* the worst, and you react to it that way unless you can disconnect from that mentality.

I think that cops not being a part of the community is a real issue. Instead of going after minor infractions like speeding under 10, or drug use, that time should be spent actively getting to know the areas you work in. Helping the people that are prone to crimes, so if you do end up responding you can treat them like a human being. Unfortunately most just do a feel good community event once in a while which usually just attracts the normal person anyway."

I think the scene where he intervieuws the nurses and other patients also has a hint or giveaway that he is a patient.

"Scariest moment was probably when I almost fell asleep at the wheel as I was driving home from my ex's house. I'd pick her up from work on the weekend and then we'd go out, but she'd usually have to be home around 2-3am. This one night, I was already really tired, because I had been up since 6am, but I had to drive her home or she'd be in trouble with the parents.

I was struggling to stay awake on the drive (20 minutes each way) but she was still awake and she'd talk to me to keep me up. After I dropped her off, she told me to drive safely and to pull off if I can't make it home and to call her when I'm home safely. I'm about 10 minutes away from my house when it gets to the point where I'm only able to keep my eyes half open at best. I smack myself in the face a few times to wake myself up and continue the drive home since I'm so close. I'm sitting there occasionally smacking myself while driving home, when I realize that I somehow ended up doing a really shitty parallel parking job on the main street. I had no recollection of driving to this street (it was several blocks past where I'd normally turn to go home) or how I even managed to park the car.

It honestly scared the shit out of me, because I was so fatigued that I basically drove on autopilot mode at 3am with no other cars on the road. Not much memory of anything after I dropped off my ex. Decided right then and there that I'd just send her a quick text saying that I'm just going to take a nap in my car. I didn't wake up until 9am the next morning, and the only reason I was up was the police officer that knocked on my window to check on me."

It's just irritating, even when women are directly asked a question on this site, guys turn it around and hijack it. It's not a big problem but it does piss me off, and adds to the whole 'male opinions are more justifiable than female ones' thing."

"When I was your age I used to have to stay at work till my wife called, write down a list of things to pick up on my way home with a pen and on paper, go to a grocery store, walk around between aisles and pick out what she wanted, hope I got the right thing if I was unsure.

When I got done with that I would have to take out a checkbook, write on a check with another pen, then cart the groceries I picked up out to my car.

There I would have to fish out a key to get the door and trunk open so I could haul the stuff home.

If she asked for anything not at the grocery store, I would have to make sure I looked up places I could find it and call them before leaving work to see if they have it and also to get the address of that place, and I'd have to write that down too.  I would have to know how to get there.

When I got home chances are I'd drop something when I bent over to pick up a newspaper on my way in so I'd have something to read while I sat in my recliner and smoked.

Once in a while she'd have gotten a letter from a relative that I wanted to read, but I had to wait until she was done reading it herself.

"Honestly? Exercise. 

I hate the gym. I hate running. I hate most form of cardio. I always thought that people who said exercise is addictive were talking out of their ass, or really liked those things.

I remember reading something that said after 6 hours how much productivity is lost.
"read one of my other replies. Korea's best language program at SNU (Seoul National University) and other universities have a total of 6 levels. It's 20 hours a week (4 hours a day) for 10 weeks, for a total of 200 hours per semester. In total that's 1200 hours. If you graduate level 6 you're eligible to do your degree at that university IN KOREAN. People who have finished level 4 (800 hours) are more than capable, while those who completely finished will speak better than some native speakers.

Obviously these programs are the best of the best (having done it my self I would have to agree). Everything is just so efficient and the format is well put together, but this proves that you don't need anywhere near 10,000 hours to become fluent in a language.

EDIT: Obviously some languages (like Icelandic) will take longer than 1200 hours. Also, keep in mind these are STUDYING hours. This means that all 1200 hours are spent studying, and does not include the countless hours you would spend staring blankly at a wall."

"&gt;The robbery increase was steep and immediate though. If murder had dropped, everybody would have been anxious to ascribe that to gun control. Since robbery spiked, though, well, there must have been some other external factor at play, we're told. It can not be that gun control in Australia did no good and may have caused harm. That can not be it. Except that that is what Australia's own data suggest.

I think you're making a *massive* mistake by *only* looking at the spike, though. That spike only lasted from 1997 to 2001, then starts plummeting again. If the gun ban was such a massive detriment to self-defense that it caused a spike in armed robbery, then why does the trend suddenly reverse just a few years later?

I think one thing that you've failed to consider is that when implementing a gun ban, the benefits may not be immediate, and there may even be some expected short-term struggles. In the short-term, it'll mostly be legitimately-owned guns being surrendered &amp; destroyed, but the impact on the supply of illegally used &amp; owned guns is more gradual; it becomes more difficult to own something legally with the intent of using it illegally, the trickle of legitimate firearms into the black market dries up, and identifying/seizing illegal firearms becomes trivial because most firearms are illegal under most circumstances. I think that'd handily explain why it goes up for a few years, then shoots back down once enforcement catches up, and it'd also explain why the trend for robbery continues to move south despite gun ownership gradually increasing again.

By *only* looking at that 4-year period and *only* considering the part of the trend where it's moving up, you're doing the debate a massive disservice. The picture is bigger than that.

Also, as an Australian myself; for what it's worth, most people here are *very* happy with the state of our gun laws, and strict gun laws enjoy bipartisan support. Virtually no-one looks at it as a mistake, and everyday Australians can readily observe how unlikely we are to encounter guns being used as weapons against us. You'd be dismissed if you tried to point to those stats (especially something as specific as armed robbery in the 4 years and *only* those 4 years following the ban) as a reason for it being a bad idea."

"This seems like less of a hack and more like common sense, but make sure that you're actually answering the question that the interviewer asked. 

I recently asked several candidates what techniques and tools they use to stay organized when working on multiple complex projects at the same time. Each one told me stories about times where they had done just that successfully, making sure to mention how complex the projects were and how well they turned out, but **none** of them actually told me what I wanted to know, which was, literally: ""what tools and techniques do you use to stay organized?""

The answer to that question would likely be something like:

- ""I like to make task lists on yellow legal pads"" 
- ""I keep track of everything in my head using mnemonic devices""
- ""I really enjoy [name of project management tool]"" 
- ""I set up my Outlook calendar to track goal dates and deliverables"" 
- ""I consult several astrologers first thing in the morning before prioritizing my tasks""

The silver lining is it's slowly turning into a home I feel 100% comfortable in and can be proud of, since we've done most of the work ourselves.

"It was a Saturday back when I used to work the Saturday day shift for the local news. I was a few miles out from downtown DC when I heard a call go out on D.C. Fire for a water rescue / recovery, a person had sighted a body in the Potomac from the Memorial Bridge. I raced back downtown to Ohio Drive, guessing the body would be continuing downriver because of recent heavy rains. 

I drove about 1/3 of a mile south before pulling over and grabbing my camera to get footage of the search. As I walked to the shoreline there she was , right in front of me, about ten feet from shore, face down and bloated. She had been dead for awhile. 

Of course I would not video this scene (despite Hollywood a competent newsgatherer engages in many moral decisions daily), instead I flagged down a passing responding police officer, who proceeded to yell at me, I assume because in her mind anyone with a camera is automatically up to no good.

I retreated to a safe distance where I could video responders without getting shots of the victim for a few minutes, then headed back to my previous assignment. Like so many of the city's dead I could not tell you who, or why. "

"Running is about hitting the sweet spot groove. When you first start running it feels like death. You get the stitches in your sides, your arm movement isn't working for you, breathing out of rhythm and it just sucks. It sucks hard. Then it progressively sucks less. Then one day you find that sweet spot where you zone out and go in to auto-pilot running and the miles roll by. Running becomes therapeutic, you get the 'runners high' and running becomes something you look forward to."
"Cultural Appropriation.

Everyone being a fucking gatekeeper over what other people are not allowed to do, BUT if any of them culturally appropriate the fuck out of everything else it doesn't count.  An example would be Jay Soule, the Chippewa artist who accused Toronto artist Amanda PL of 'cultural genocide' for having the unforgivable gall of being a white person painting art inspired by aboriginal art.  If you have a look at Jay Soule's website www.chippewar.com it's pretty obvious his aboriginal art is very heavily influenced by modern western styles.  Jay Soule culturally appropriated comic books!  His artwork looks like a crude Jack Kirby background if Thor ever picked a fight with Apache Chief inside a Canadian art gallery.  And Jay Soule has the balls to accuse other people of bastardizing aboriginal art.  "

I did a series of experiments, where I lined myself up with the cracks in the sidewalk, and just walked forward at the same speed in a straight line.  I did not collide with young women.  I did not bump into homeless people.  They all got out of my way.

"There is [a Radiolab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/273532-heimlich/) that goes into the history of the Heimlich Maneuver, but also details the controversies that followed. Basically, he tried to apply the Heimlich Maneuver to not just food choking but also saving drowning victims and people experiencing asthma attacks and a host of other emergencies. It wasn't good advice, but he was persistent. He also claimed he had the cures for cancer and AIDS and some other nonsense. I think after a while they wanted to distance themselves from him. Also, abdominal thrusts are no longer the American Red Cross's first recommended method for saving choking victims, it's [back blows](http://www.redcross.org/flash/brr/English-html/conscious-choking.asp).

"Knew a guy that spent virtually his entire adult life homeless. Used to wander around all over the country and spent more than his fair share of nights sleeping in the woods with another homeless man he befriended while out in the streets.

One morning he set off into town early to fetch booze and cigarettes while things were still quiet and not many people were around. His buddy stayed behind in their particular spot of the forest sleeping.

These guys weren't too keen on being disturbed so they typically went fairly deep into the woods, a good 2 or so hours walk from town. It took him a good 4 hours to get to town, buy his stuff from the offie then lug it back to the spot where his friend was.

When he finally returned he found his friend burnt alive inside his charred sleeping bag. In the 4 hour window that he'd left to get booze his friend was attacked while he slept in his sleeping bag and was set aflame by someone in the middle of the woods."

"When I was in middle school my parents used to fight a lot. I was the oldest of three children and my brother and I went a few years having to live with my parents cursing and yelling and screaming at each other over a lot of things that I can barely remember. I think that most of the fighting centered around my mother being an incompetent deadbeat mother to three young kids and my father working very hard and then having to deal with my mom making mistakes running the house and raising her kids. Now that I'm older, I realize that both of my parents are really just loser people. My dad makes good money and we're an upper middle class family, but both of my parents come from the city and working class backgrounds and sort of city or 'street' life during the 70s and they bare a lot of inner scars from their lives before us kids were born. What this meant was that despite us living on a nice block in a great neighborhood, I never really felt like I lived in a respectable or cool family that matters to people. My dad makes the money and then a mother and her three kids live off of it. That's the way I would describe us and I would say that half of my life in my family has been dysfunctional. There have been good times and bad times together but years later I realize that this wasn't really down to my parents having a respectable or great marriage; it was mostly down to them having kids to keep them occupied and happy. 

Sometimes it wasn't enough to hold our house and family together.

When I was in 7th grade, I played CYO basketball for my parish and had practices and games every Saturday during the Winter season. At the time, the weekends were maybe the worst times to be in my house because everyone was home at once, we all had sporting events to go to, and us kids all needed to be taken care of and sometimes my parents didn't get a break and were very stressed out by it all. This led to a lot of screaming, yelling, and fighting between my parents.

This one Saturday my parents lost control of one of their fights. I was getting ready for basketball and my dad was cursing like an animal at my mom about something. I think that my mom forgot to do something or put the weight of something she had to do on my dad and he went crazy. Somehow, their fight turned towards some socks that my dad left on the floor of their room and hadn't picked up along with all of his other clothes. My dad lived like a pig and left his stuff all over his bedroom and left work stuff all over our dining room table and my parents used to fight really bad about this among other things. These fights scared me half the time when I was young and they were the type of fights and screaming matches that made you stop what you were doing and go to the top of the stairs with pain in your chest to listen to what they were fighting about. 

My mom started telling my dad to pick his socks up off of the floor and my dad started cursing at her to do it. This went on and back and forth for about thirty seconds and I got frightened by it and walked into the hallway underneath my parents' room on the floor above. The first sound I heard wasn't a sound at all. It was complete silence throughout our entire house. It lasted for about five seconds and it was the longest five seconds that I had ever lived through. Then I heard my dad stomping around his room. My mom didn't make a sound. Five seconds later, my mom let out the scariest sound I had ever heard in my life.

""ANIMAL! ANIMAL! AHHHHHHHH! ANIMAAAALLLL!""

She was screaming that over and over and over again while crying and it sounded like what I thought at the time it would sound like if someone was about to die. All the while, my dad was screaming at the top of his lungs for her to ""PICK IT UP! PICK IT UP!"" over and over and over again. By this time, my brother had come out of his room and we were both so scared that we basically were holding onto each other in some sort of terrified hug or death grip while we both screamed ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?"". When my dad stopped screaming, my mom started crying hysterically and then started crying and screaming that she wanted a divorce. The next thing she said was that ""THEY'LL NEVER FORGET THIS!"".

She was right. I never have.

I was now late for basketball practice and had no one to drive me to the gym. My little sister was napping downstairs and hadn't woken up through all of this. My brother shook a bit as he went back into his room and closed the door enough in a way so that I couldn't see him. I had no choice but to walk myself to practice in the snow and slush and cold that was left over from Thursday. It was a long and cold walk to the gym in my swishy basketball snap pants and my puffy jacket. If you've ever walked somewhere against traffic in your town, you can feel nearly every driver staring at you, whether they actually are or are not. That day I didn't feel anything. My mind was totally locked out by white noise and by trying to figure out what happened at my house. Twenty minutes later I was at the gym and made up some excuse for why I was a half hour late. I don't even remember how I got home from practice.

At the time, I thought that maybe my dad was holding my mom down by the throat or by force and she was scared and screaming about it. I was too young to realize all the possibilities and to put what happened together. When I got older, I remembered that my dad used to say that he would keep his bullets and a handgun in two different parts of the bedroom so that he wouldn't accidentally shoot one of us if he thought a robber was in the house. By having the bullets and gun separate, he would have to get up and think about what was going on instead of grabbing for a loaded gun quickly under his bed and giving himself a chance of shooting a family member who he might have mistaken for an intruder. 

Now that I'm older, I know that those five seconds of dead silence was my dad losing his mind in total, quiet, inner rage and using those seconds to decide what he would do in the next five seconds. Those next five seconds where I heard him stomping around his bedroom was him going to the place where he kept his gun, retrieving it, and then pointing it at my mom who thought that she was about to be murdered by her husband over a pair of socks. At the time, she didn't know that the gun didn't have bullets in it. My dad knew but he was so furious that he didn't care that she didn't know and threatened to kill her anyway. 

I never was in their bedroom when this happened. This is just what I've worked out over the years. Nobody in my family ever mentions what happened. I think my brother is too dumb to understand what happened and not at all introspective or thoughtful about our family. My little sister will never know because she was sleeping. She'll never know this is one of many reasons why I hate my parents and haven't talked to them since I was 20 years old. I've ignored them and only talked to them when necessary for years. The only reason they're not divorced is because my mom is a nobody with nowhere to go and no one who wants her and because to my dad - despite what you just read - my mom is the calming presence in his life and has been ever since his mother died when he was a little kid and since he managed to get away from his psychopath step mother who was abusive and filled him with all of his pent-up rage and anger. My dad needs my mom to be his dead mother. My mom needs my dad to take care of her whole life since she was a suicidal nobody when she met my dad after her own mother died when she was a teenager. 

Almost 15 years later I came to realize that my mother has borderline personality disorder and that her and my father are in a codependent relationship. I don't really consider their marriage a real marriage or normal although they appear normal to people outside of our family. My siblings don't know what I know about them or our family or what's gone on over the years. I'm alone with this knowledge and it's very hard and horrible. "
"A couple of guys I worked with at Dairy Queen had a scam to take money from the drive-through register by canceling orders and pocketing the cash. 

They would ring the order up and tell the customer the total. If the customer paid with cash they would ask if they wanted a receipt. If the customer said no, they would cancel the order in the register system, give the customer change and pocket the cash. They weren't taking huge amounts, maybe $20 each a night. But on fast food wages that makes a difference. 

I'm not morally endorsing what they did but I was like 17 or 18 at the time, and they were my friends who were a couple of years older. They were friendly stoners who lived together and were both managers at DQ. The owner was a raging asshole so I kind of didn't care. I never took part in their scam though."

"Passengers. Even if you ignore the Stockholm-driven relationship. The couple spent decades filling the spaceship with plants. Fucking plants! As the roots of those trees grow, there's a massive risk of them rupturing vital supply lines. Or even worse, making a hole that leads out into the vacuum of space. Plant roots will push through concrete, that spaceship is beyond fucked. If the humidity of the air was increased, there's also a huge amount of rusting that could happen.

And that's ignoring that the couple spent decades eating the food supplies. The food supplies were supposed to be enough for a few thousand people for a few months. Two people eating into that for decades (plus everything that got wasted during the film) means that inventory is massively depleted.

Basically, if you woke up on that ship there's a really good chance you'd die, either of starvation, or the ship degrading because of all that plant life. The two main characters put five thousand lives in serious jeopardy."

"They set boundaries, respect your boundaries, and are honest about their emotions. If someone says they don't feel like hanging out today or they're not in the mood for that restaurant, or they're comfortable stating that they don't like it when you joke about X so please don't when they're around, if they don't pressure you to drink if you're not up for it, that sort of thing. If someone is emotionally mature it's a good sign. If they're not they can end up manipulative or passive-aggressive because they can't articulate what they need openly, end up bottling everything up until they explode at you, end up having no conflict resolution skills because they try to be a doormat and don't know what to do when they really can't handle something...etc. "
"Ok so my understanding of the goatman is:
He is a shape shifting entity who is very good at changing into the form of someone ""he's"" seen. According to most accounts, his objective isn't really to cause any harm but rather to interact and get close to humans. The thing that tends to get him noticed (besides the obvious ""he's impersonating mike and mike is right there"") is that he has trouble making human noises. He makes a catlike growl which, the longer he has to adapt, sound more and more like the person who he heard. It is not known if he can use previous observations to build his speaking or appearance, that seems to be more of the skinwalkers' thing. Most people report a strange attempt at him immitating their speech after a short time of exposure ranging to a very conprehensive visual and auditory representation of someone in the visited's party. Some people report the goatman as being so smooth at integrating into their group that they don't notice the increase in number of people. Shit is fucked."

Not true economically.

"So, that's a good question. The suicide attempt was on July 4th so it's been just over a year. I don't trust the motive, I genuinely think it was an attention thing. We've seen each other twice since then and have spoken on and off (we live in the same city so, yes, this is weird). We had a lot of issues before what happened and continue to have them. She looks as if she has gained weight, but her emotional state seems the same. She is incredibly narcissistic so trying to fix issues between the two of us seems impossible because she is unable to understand any point of view but her own. For example, my boyfriend's brother died in February from a heroin overdose. When I texted my family to let them know, she responded ""I am not far enough into my recovery to say anything about this."" She has never addressed his death with me. Why? Because it doesn't have to do with her.

I'm sure this makes me sound insensitive or bitter, but the whole story is long and complicated. I'm talking years and years of build up to a very shitty culmination. I was always looking out for her, always protecting her, always trying to be there for her. I want her to live a healthy life and be genuinely happy. I'd love a relationship with her, but a relationship would have to be mutually beneficial and right now I feel like I was taken advantage of for a long time."

"I broke up with someone a year ago. I swallowed it, and tried to move on, but I was more than a little obsessed. A few months after the break-up, I heard he found someone else. So I tried to move on, but always hoped we'd find our way back to each other. No reason he couldn't be The One someday!

In May, I hung out with a friend, who told me she'd seen him online looking for dates. So began the obsession anew. I fantasized about our reconnection every night for a few weeks, and desperately hoped I'd run into him on the street on my walk home every day.

Through an AskReddit thread, I found someone who shared his name. I shared my story with him, and he said this to me:

&gt; now you are both different people, with new stories and experiences and outlooks

Within a few days I felt more over it than I had in all the year of progress prior. Because he's right. My ex doesn't exist anymore, and if he does, it will never be what I envision."

The weirdest ones were the woman that told me I was really pretty and had to meet her single son before she proceeded to go out to her car and bring the poor kid in, the guy that talked to me for 5 minutes about his new tractor and then insisted I watch him drive by so I could see it and the various women that asked me to adjust their bra straps/hooks for them.

"My current next door neighbor is awful. I actually posted about her and asked for advice after she made a CPS threat last year. The question was picked up by a couples of online news sources, so we aren't the only people who thinks she is crazy. 

She called CPS on us last year because my older two sons (7 and 5 at the time) were playing football in the front yard during a sun shower. She basically told CPS that we locked all of our kids (including our toddler) outside during a thunderstorm and wouldn’t let them back inside. She said they were begging to come in and we wouldn't let them. It was a complete lie. They were having fun, the door wasn't locked, and my wife could see them from the living room window. We got a CPS visit and the case was closed. A few days later my wife was outside playing with our toddler. The neighbor approached my wife and asked her if she learned her lesson.

We try not to make any contact with her anymore, but she has made complaints about our tree house and complaints about the kids playing too loudly outside. She also called CPS on our friends across the street because their son had a black eye. He got the black eye in wrestling, but the neighbor called anyway. She frequently yells at kids for not wearing jackets at the bus stop and still goes to the bus stop with her 12 year old. I let my kids ride their bikes to school with their friends and she has expressed concern about that as well. She's got issues, but she is moving in a few weeks. We plan on having a party with the rest of the neighbors once she is gone.

"I was a typical NRI (Non-Resident-Indian) cousin, who would visit India every other Christmas.

My cousins were too thick in the head to comprehend that even though I spoke English exclusively, I did understand Marathi, as my parents were brought up in Mumbai, India.

I was made fun of on a daily basis. One of the two would just say something to the other and they would snicker at me.

So, one of them was doing holiday homework and asked me to help out; I tried my best but couldn't explain it to him. Frustrated, he just said something to the tune of:'Idiot can't even explain properly', then looked at me, and said he'll manage.

To his surprise, I replied: *'Itka sopa kalat nahi tar tu chutiya es.'*; which, roughly translated, means 'You're a dumass for not understanding such a simple thing'.

It was a great victory for my 13 year old self. I got yelled at for calling him a *chutiya* i.e. dumass. Worth it."

Have two of your friends run out from the bank with a pair of sacks full of toilet paper and jump in the back seat yelling ""GO GO GO"" as they do it. Nod politely to them, then slowly put on a pair of leather gloves. Then accelerate like a rocket and drive at 100 miles an hour to a dock, where you have two jetskis waiting. Have your friends leap out of the backseat, jump on the jetskis and take off. While you do that, take off your shirt to expose a second set of clothes underneath. Next, floor it to the nearest crowded park, stop the car get out and tell him ""get out and blend in... our work is done"".

Anyway, we got the fuck out pretty quick, and I made fun of my poor companion for days. That was probably our most bizarre visit.

I did sit through some strangers' family fights, got flashed a few times, got deathly ill, and got sorta kidnapped. Other than that the life of a Mormon missionary can be a bit tedious."

a) you're telling me this out of context and 


b) what I can do (if I can do anything besides listen)

The mascots did their thing, and I remember thinking 'Fuck that was a hard hit' and then cheering like crazy with the other 54,000+ people there.

The opposing mascot was writhing on the ground, and I thought ""that dude is COMMITTED to the bit.... NICE."" 

It was eventually the visiting team's trainers who realized something was wrong. They got to him first and flagged the EMTs to help. The kid had a seizure from that hard hit. From what I heard eventually he ended up fine.

The next morning after we woke up and went about 20 feet outside our camp to a small lake we saw fresh paw prints in the mud, facing our camp, that weren't there the previous day.  The prints didn't have claw marks like a wolf or dog, which means the claws were retractable...like a cougar, which we have in our area.  At that moment, the buddy that was gone alone for so long turned white in his face realizing he may have been getting stalked on his way back to camp.

"4-H is a youth organization originally created for rural kids who didn't have as much access to clubs, etc. as their urban counterparts. Started out with farm kids showing livestock at county fairs. County fairs are still a big part of the organization, with kids showing animals (mostly commonly horses, beef and dairy cattle, poultry, pigs, rabbits, meat and dairy goats, and sheep, but also llamas, guinea pigs, dogs, etc.) and selling meat animals at auctions and kids showing arts and crafts, food, educational projects, horticulture (crop farming), etc. More recently it has expanded a lot in more urban areas and encouraged STEM education. For the most part a really awesome organization that teaches self-reliance and instills a strong sense of community service. For anyone with kids between the ages of 5-18 in the US, I highly recommend seeing if there are any active 4-H clubs in your county. 

Source: was an active 4-H member for 13 years and was involved with arts+crafts, dairy cattle, community service, and international education clubs "

"It would be impossible to prove.  For example, let's say Rob is the custodial parent of his two kids, and his ex Karen pays $700 a month child support.  Rob gets paid on the first of the month, and receives child support on the 28th.  The day he gets child support, he buys a $150 pair of boots, a $60 pair of pants, and replaces parts for his motorcycle for $300.  Karen freaks out that most of her money has gone to Rob's hobbies.  Rob produces receipts that show he spent $400 on groceries, $150 on summer clothes for the girls, and $500 in day care.  It came out of his paycheck rather than her child support.  He argues that in fact he did the right thing as a father by providing for them earlier in the month and treating himself later.

The vast majority of 'wasting my child support' cases are like that.  There are all ready laws against parental neglect and failure to provide material support.  If children are being neglected don't hesitate to call CPS or your country's equivalent."

She called me into her office and tried to tell me it was my bra and I did it on purpose, I laughed at her because it was a D and I was A.

"The National Park Rangers are advising hikers in Glacier National Park and other Rocky Mountain parks to be alert for bears and take extra precautions to avoid an encounter.
They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.
Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.
It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.
Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper."

So we make entry through the front and just walk around with just flashlights, the dust, decaying rooms and creeking of wood from other teams walking was unsettling. Then the audible alarm sounded. Just about jumped out of our skin. We find the panel shut it off and as we turn around 2 cops are standing behind us. One surprised jump and harty laugh later and we were out having found nothing.

The second was smoke in the building at a telecom relay house (where they keep local servers for phone and internet). We were walking around could smell electronics burning see hazy smoke but didnt find a fire. Additionally the whole building had a very ""Stranger Things"" vibe that non of us could shake."

"Going into labor the first time. When I realized i was having contractions, I calmly told my husband that tonight was the night. I told him I was going to lay in the tub for a bit while I waited for them to get closer together. Meanwhile, he is running around like a lunatic. He changed his outfit 3 times. Did his hair a way I'd never seen him do it before, and when I commented on it, he rinsed it out and did it again. 

The second time I went into labor, my water broke in the middle of the night. I actually have a picture I took of him blowdrying his hair in the bathroom. Meanwhile,  I'm standing there, patiently waiting,  with a towel between my legs. "

If I use *side* to buy a $5 coffee they'll start charging interest on that $5 balance and I can't pay that part until I pay off the $100.

None of us would have known this if he hadn't proudly told us later the next day. We call him stinkin' Lincoln now.

The sink nozzle fell apart while he was adding water to the batter, dropping parts into it.  He didn't even care.  Just told us to pick them out.  

One time he made juice without rinsing out the jug first.  There had been Clamato juice in there before so the lemonade tasted of tomatoes.

Also, his mashed potatoes.  He doesn't add milk or butter/margarine to them, just boils and mashes them.  He gets mad when we add them, says we're ruining his cooking.  Man, the food was already ruined.  

He gets all hurt when we say we don't like his cooking so we choke down as much as we can and toss the rest when he leaves.  Mom does the majority of the cooking, thank Jeebus."

"I'm tired of living to work. 

I don't enjoy my job, there aren't enough hours in the day, and I don't have enough of a social life to make working full time feel ""okay"". 

I am taking steps towards increasing the social life though, so that's a plus. But the not enjoying my job thing is arguably the biggest damper on my emotional wellbeing. That being said, I'm thankful I have a job at all, for the time being. But life is relative. I've been considering quitting for months now but haven't gone through with anything. I've got money saved up to last a while, but it never seems like enough. Plus, regardless of if I can live off my savings for a long time, how does a huge gap of work look like on my resume? That could totally fuck me over, and I've only had one job out of college (the one I'm trying to get out of). 

The job search while working is so hard to keep up too. It's gotten to the point where I'll see an interesting job on indeed, only to find out I applied a month ago. 

That's the job stuff anyways. I'm not so sure a new job would change much. I need to find a means of income that allows me to work for myself. I need my passion to be my means of financial stability, so I can continue to live in society the way I am, without having to work depressed. 

I want to make something of my own, and have that alone provide enough for me to get by. I just need my personal source(s) of income to provide:

* Enough money to pay rent or a mortgage
* Money for food, utilities and decent internet
* Some money for miscellaneous stuff every now and then

That's it. I just want enough money to be able to get by on my own, all while continuing to be able to work on my creative projects. All I want to do with my life is make my own stuff and live in society. There's an actual dollar number on what I need to achieve that, and it's not like it's that high. I hope I can get there someday.

"Long post, sorry. 
When i used to wait tables, living in the Bible Belt, i got tipped bibles/pamphlets/verses pretty often.  I was raised as a Christian, but was going through a rough patch spiritually when I had that job. I never looked at those pamphlets once and I never had any of those people actually have a conversation with me or try to reach me. Once, I had a couple of ladies at a table and they were having a spiritual discussion over their meal. They invited me to pray with them and asked if there was anything they could pray for. I ended up having one of the deepest conversations I've ever had with these women.  I cried and prayed with them, and it had a huge impact on the way I perceive people. They never offered me a bible or spouted a verse to me. They were just amazing good kind people. And thats what really changes lives.

Secondly, as described in below reactions, the full meaning of the question is somewhat lost in the translation to English from the original language. The question is to assess if the applicant is proficient in providing conversation on different professional and intellectual levels, crucial for work floor communication as well as etiquette towards high profile clients. In the original language it is sufficient and clear enough to use so few words to ask this, but the poor guy just kind of blanked in his head because of being too nervous.

"&lt;rant&gt;

As someone with a fairly comfortable life, the ""my life was shit but I overcame it and it made me better than my peers"" speeches are oddly demotivating. A first world problem, I know, but it's weird to sit through a two hour speech at college orientation of someone telling me that my underpriveleged peers are gonna kick my ass (I'm clearly not the intended audience, so whatever. In some cases it will be true.)

More importantly, though, I think it's dangerous in perpetuating the romantic ""American dream"" notion that poor people can and should just overcome their situation, and anything less is a lack of effort. It's meant to be inspiring to someone with a difficult background, but what about if they fail? Now you've convinced people in my situation that the impoverished are ""stronger"" than me and I'M the one at a disadvantage, and if you're underpriveleged, shame in failing is that much worse because you're supposed to be so much ""stronger."" It just breeds more unhealthy classism.

There's a great intent behind it, and telling young people of all backgrounds that getting a four year degree is an achievement and education is crucial, etc. But talks like that have a serious survivalship bias. Stories of startups in garages with college dropouts are clearly cases of extraordinary people, outliers. Massive successes are rare. Maybe it's cynical or complacent to say ""shoot for mild success,"" but it seems like extraordinary people aren't going to be ""made"" by some public speaker anyways. 

Maybe my view is backwards on this, I don't know. My family is upper-middle class and my perspective on poverty from the suburbs probably has its own assumptions and romanticisms.

And if you think rejection is a traumatizing experince, it might be best for you to ask someone out before you're too emotionally invested in their answer. 

If someone doesn't want to date you, your ego should be hurt, not your self esteem. And even then, it should be temporary.

"Earlier this school year we had a class meeting for all of the seniors, there's about 900 of us. We were in the auditorium and the speaker just finished going over a slide about bullying, and how we should always report it, never be a bystander, you know the drill.

"Depending on the age it's for, kids get legitimately interested in how the ordinary world around them works. It's not ordinary for them yet, it's new and exciting and fascinating, and their brains haven't progressed to the point where something like a cash register is so easy to understand as to be boring.

One of my earliest memories is being in love with the grocery store my grandma went to, because it had this system where they put your groceries in a big plastic tub, sent the tub through a set of saloon doors to outside, and let it roll down a ramp made of little wheels out to where an employee was waiting to load it into your trunk when you drove up.

That was the most fascinating thing in the world to me for about a year.

A cash register is a Thing in a child's world, a thing that makes interesting noises and has interesting buttons and a drawer full of stuff and *it's always someone else using it.* You don't use the cash register, your cashier does. The kid certainly doesn't. So being given a cash register *of their very own* that they can push all the buttons on and make the things happen, that's the holy grail to a young kid who's seen them and seen them and seen them and never gotten to play with them."

"10 years ago to this exact day, a girl I knew in school was killed in a car accident. Her older sibling was speeding to get to summer swim practice, lost control, and crashed into a telephone pole. Her sibling lived, but she was killed instantly.

I knew the girl mainly because she bullied me throughout middle school, calling me  ""fat"" or ""buck-teeth"" (I had rather larger front teeth and was on the more overweight side).

I'll never forget when my dad told me about her passing after picking me up from camp that morning 10 years ago. I quietly went to my bedroom and bursted into tears. In that moment, I didn't care about the names she called me and the rumors she spread about me. I was devastated that a young girl, with a promising future in swimming, was taken away too soon. "

Ex #1 - I had a minor day surgery procedure but still with full general anesthetic &amp; all that.  Needless to say, I wasn't going to be doing much for the rest of the day.  So since I wasn't going to be able to cook, he *took me out to eat* immediately after picking me up from the hospital, sit down restaurant type.  We're sitting there in the restaurant, I'm groggy as hell and just wanting to lie down, huddled in a flimsy blanket from the hospital.   He's pissed cuz I'm not hungry and I'm not thanking him a thousand times over for taking me out to dinner.  He was pissed at least for a week because I wasn't grateful enough.

Ex #2 - I was horribly ill with some kind of cold/flu thing (don't exactly remember).  He was hungry....""what are you making for dinner?""  I tell him nothing because I feel like hell.  He goes to the grocery store and gets a couple cans of soup, heats them up *all by himself* and shares it with me (I was SO lucky!).  Again, six ways of pissed because I wasn't profoundly grateful for a lousy bowl of soup.  Later on when with friends, says something to the effect of ""yeah and I cooked dinner when she was sick!""  I said yeah....that soup you heated up was awesome.  Pissed again.

It was so quite, then right behind me I heard this really loud screech, my heart nearly jumped out of my ass. I looked all around me and saw nothing, no disturbance in the water and no birds nothing.

I went up to them and told them that I wanted them to put everything they wanted in the cart and I'd buy it. This lady broke down in tears in my arms, they only had $50 to spend for their whole family.


I went through the store with them and helped them pick everything out. We went out to their car and put everything in there. They thanked me and invited me over, I declined and went back home and ordered pizza. "

It took me a whole 6hours of my 8 hour shift to get anywhere near the clean state they were usually in when she took care of our store.

"I always explain it like this: Handsoap is high skillcap -&gt; high reward hero. Same with Genji, Tracer, Mcree, and Widow. 

This means that these heroes generously reward incredibly skilled players, the catch is you need to be hideously good to see even a balanced (on par with other heroes) performance with them. 

Let me tell you, you are not at that skill level. I would hazard a guess its somewhere around 2500-3000 that they start really shining and working as balanced (compared to the rest of the heroes) in a comp. 

Of all the high skill --&gt; reward heroes, Hanzo is the worst.

What is also very important in the game at the moment is mobility. Note that most all the other heroes I mentioned have absurdly high mobility with Mcree being the slowest of all. To balance Mcree however, stun grenade is one of the best offensive abilities you can give a hero. Almost an insta kill vs genji/tracer/ana/zen/mercy. It also stops tanks from landing on top of you. On top of that his bullets are pure hitscan (no time elapses for bullet travel so once you fire, if you're aiming right at someone they are going to be hit). Its a decent balance for having to fucking walk like a nub. And to offset Hondsops shit kit they gave him.... climbing? So that isn't going to do anything for winston dva or rein chasing you, not going to stop another dps running you down, not going to interrupt ults (like stun grenade). This is stacked on top of the fact that he does almost nothing to teams that know how to use terrain, or hide behind shields. Oh the team is actually using side routes/tunnels? ok guess ill have to engage them at close range cause thats what hanzo is good for (hes not, i need to say this in case there is anyone left reading who believes in him). Rein and Orisa are crying tears of laughter as hanzo arrows plink their shit. Hanzo is the worst of all those guys because of this. 

But somewhere out there is some terrible weeb compilation videos of some near pro absolutely fucking wrecking bronze tier kiddies in 6v1s as hanzo, so you get all these fucking scrubs coming in here playing handsoap thinking hes great. God dammit. Yeah hes great if you're super skilled, but when you're super skilled the other players are going to realize if they just grab a tracer or genji they can run circles around handso-so and there is nothing he can do to stop them.

Mum told me that as he got sicker he stopped playing with the tennis balls - completely lost interest. He couldn't walk very well anymore, no weight on his front left leg - all that Jazz.  

I managed to get home to visit him just before he died.  As soon as he saw me he ran outside and grabbed his tennis balls and came up and showed me, wagging his tail like a little puppy, like he was saying 'you're here! Everything is cool now.' I break every time i think about it.

"I think you hit the nail on the head. The more people see women in positions of power, the more seriously they are taken. Which is why I think media representation is so important. People always use the argument that men and women simply pick different careers because of biology. I think women don't chose to be engineers and programmers because they don't see other women doing it. Humans are basically monkeys. Monkey see, monkey do. How would it cross the mind of a little girl that she can be an engineer is she doesn't see other women do it? You probably see women as having similar power because you actually grew up around women who have authority. Unfortunately, other people have a very different childhood experience. "

The next day I went to heat up some leftover wings for lunch and when I went to get a couple of the teriyaki ones, lo and behold, SOMEONE had taken one bite out of each and every one of them. When my ex came home later and went to eat his leftover wings, he opened the box, picked through the wings, saw what I had seen and angrily threw the box in the trash and said ""GOD my brother is a dick"". Apparently this behavior was just par for the course for my brother in law. I didn't know whether to be appalled or to just laugh at the audacity of what he did and the amount of creativity he put into annoying my ex. 15 years later, it's pretty funny... "

Painting is a huge example of this. The setup and cleanup take a good portion of time while when everything out it can go very quickly. If you can finish it in a day it's worth it even if its 10 plus hours. If you split it up it might take 3 days to get done in 5 hour days.

"Alright here goes mine, Anson Texas 2013. 

I worked as a reporter and was assigned a story around Halloween time, story was to cover the ""Anson Lights"" 

It's a paranormal occurrence where you drive out to the (creepy as hell) cemetery turn your car around and park. 

Basically lights are suppose to appear in the distance here's the link w the [background info on Anson Lights](http://weirdus.com/states/texas/unexplained_phenomena/anson_ghost_lights/index.php) 

Anyway - we drove out at dusk, my SO tagged along because well I was scared to go alone. 

We drove out to the cemetery and I get off begin to get my b-roll (video
 of the cemetery, shots of graves etc, all to be used in my story)

SO is waiting for me to finish getting my video, by this point I'm pretty deep in ""work mode"" trying to find the best angles, lighting etc. 

Soon after we both hear what sounds like someone walking and kicking a can down the street. I look up, SO looks around- not a soul in site. 

Ok first creepy moment, no biggie I shake it off and continue getting video. The sun is starting to set and it's getting dark really quickly.

We then get into my car, we want to drive up the road on the side of the cemetery to either get the Anson lights on video or debunk the whole story all together. 

We drive up the said road, turn around turn car off, and wait. Nothing. Wait for a few more minutes nothing. Ok no Anson Lights, no luck. 

We then turn the car on begin to drive out of the cemetery I'm getting video as we're driving out &amp; we head home. 

Next day I'm back at work going over my video and notice what looks like a green orb floating alongside our car. 

Some editors said it could have been the stabilizer on camera but I don't remember having the stabilizer on? 

And I'm pretty sure the orb was going in a different direction as my camera. 

Anyway here's link to a screen shot of the [orb ](https://imgur.com/gallery/rors1) it's the green dot in middle. Looks a lot more impressive on video but I can't seem to upload a good quality version where it's clear and not shaky. (I was an amateur videographer at the time lol) so pic will have to do. 

Anyway judge for yourself creepy cemetery ghost or just a piece of dust or camera setting? Who knows. "

"A little story about hobbema. Me and a buddy were driving from the airport to red deer and were super low on fuel. We've had a few road pops and forgot about gas. So hey there's an exit, let's take it. We have to come up to a gas station right? Wrong. No gas station and we run out of fuel. We are fucked because it's super late out and no one is around. We say there for about 45 minutes and we see headlights. The vehicle slows down and pulls up beside us, I shit you not, old school 1980's griswold family station wagon. Me and my buddy are looking at each other like wtf is going on. About 8 big Indians get out and approach the window. One guy asks what the problem is and why we are there. We tell him we ran out of gas and trying to get to the gas station. He tells us thy can tow us there if we had something to trade. I said we have a half a 15 pack of Kokanee beer and a bit of weed left. They all talk to each other about it and boom a deal is struck. These fuckin guys pull in front of the truck, pull out a garden hose and we wrap it around the front bumper. Now some of you are probably thinking there's no fucking way a garden hose will pull out truck. Well it did, you have to wrap it a few times around but then it's short as fuck. (I've had to flip a truck back onto its wheels with a garden hose before.) anyway we are on our way, might as well be a NASCAR race we are so close to their wagon and doing about 120 Km/h on a secondary highway. I keep telling my buddy to keep his foot on the brake ready to hit it cause we don't wanna fuck up these guy's sweet ride. Oh shit, lights! We make it to the gas station. Buddy pulls out keys unlocks station and pumps out gas for us. Give him weed, beer and cash for gas, we all have a beer together say our thank you's and we are on our way to the dead rear. It was a good time. They were good dudes. I know bad shit happens there but bad shit happens everywhere and I grew up right beside a res so I have a lot of cuzzins on my side.

"I was a bystander on something similar. I was only developing film and making prints, but we only had one darkroom with 4 isolated areas. I went in around midnight for about two hours, half an hour later someone began working next to me and scared me to death(well nearly). They were working on bioluminescence and they had to do basically the same. Extract sample from tank, put it under a microscope to roughly count the organisms present, put it in the differential spectrum analyser, flash it with light a little, write down the data and put the sample back in the tank. Every two hours for two days. 
It was about algae and their metabolism. I don't exactly know why, but their setup was pretty complex, but what I got from it is that they had to use the differential method to avoid noise and uncertainty.

"Was hanging out after school one day, getting ready to go workout. Just talking in a group of some friends along with 4 or 5 cheerleaders who were also getting ready for practice.

I turned to one of the cheerleaders, a tall, beautiful blond - definitely the hottest girl in school - and asked her out. We had several classes together and we got along great. I figured what was the worst that could happen? With confidence I asked if she wanted to maybe go out for dinner sometime - maybe even catch a movie [This was before Netflix and chill].

She looked at me right in the eyes in front of the whole group and said, ""Sorry, You're too short for me""

"It's a sign that everything is clean and healthy, so no quarantine. If it is clear or white in color and smells like vagina, it's just more of the same substance that happens when a girl is aroused. You can wipe it off before getting down to business if you want to, but you'll just make more if you're doing a good job. 

If it has a bad odor, don't go down on that vagina. It's not necessarily the girl's fault, but just don't. Give her some juice high in vitamin C if you're dating and tell her to consider going to a clinic for some antibiotics if there's a bad color to it. Sometimes vagina acidity is off balance and microorganisms that are supposed to be there, just like your skin, grow out of proportion. 

That's about it! The substance exists because the vagina's walls are made out of mucosal membranes, like the inside of your mouth. You wouldn't like it if your mouth was completely dry, would you?"

"&gt; This is going to get downvoted to hell, but in theory, he's not wrong.

Actually, I don't know about the theory.  The idea that you can cull the weak and improve the species is predicated on the idea that you know who the weak are.  Evolution is driven by mutation.  Imagine if every evolving species in natural history has the ability to perform the kinds of birth visual normalcy tests from before the 20th century.

Arguably, human evolution was set back by ""culling""."

With the current sport games, plus the awesomeness that is Rocket League I'm convinced something could be produced. I just think it would be an insanely fun sports game, even if the sport is fictional. 

edit: I also just remembered that JK Rowling fleshed out the basics of Quidditch leagues and teams from around the world in a book written for charity, so there are tons of options for leagues and team customization. You could even manage a team like in the usual EA Sports games.  "

Then if it was brought up they would tell you how Bob is basically their hero despite only seeing a few online quotes on facebook from him and the fact that he smokes weed.

"We made the classic mistake of moving in together.  I quickly realized she was possessive and very jealous.  She was mean to my other friends,  very condescending.   She couldn't STAND it if I went out with other people.  She would become very weird if we went out and a guy flirted with me or if I started to talking to a guy.  It wasn't anything like she was in love with me,  she was just very insecure.  
The last straw was when she left her diary laying out. I looked and she had written the night before that sometimes she thinks about coming into my room while I'm asleep and beating me to death with a baseball bat.  I moved out a month later.  "

But the people left the stage, surrounded this poor freshman and just utterly berated him for a good 3-4 minutes straight.

"Was a recruiter around 2002 for the U. S. Marines. Had a senior in high school who wanted to enlist and asked me to come talk to his parents. Obviously there was a lot of chaos happening in the world at the time so this was a tough gig. 

I arrived at this huge home in a rich subdivision as his family was finishing dinner. There was a huge gate at the end of the driveway and I had to push a button and explain who I was so I could be 'buzzed' in. It became very obvious that mom and dad had no idea that I was coming over to discuss anything. The entire time I was there in this very expensive and well furnished home, his mom would not look at me and his dad glared at me. They made me sit at the opposite end of the dinner table. As I was showing pamphlets and things from my book, I knew they couldn't see them but I didn't want to get any closer to the dad than I needed to. The entire time he just silently shook his head back and forth. 

Once I was finished I asked his parents if they would like to start the paperwork process so their son could enlist. Mom continued looking down, dad slowly shook his head 'no'. His only words that entire evening were, 'I have worked 25 years to put my son through college and he is already accepted to Yale'.  At this point, the young man slams his fists on the table and yells, 'I'm joining the Marines when I turn 18 and I don't give a shit what you say! F*** you and f*** Yale!'.  Then he stomps off to his room leaving me there alone at the other end of the long table. With his mom still looking down and the dad still staring at me shaking his head back and forth. 

I continued to talk for about 5 more minutes because I was taught not to take 'no' for an answer. When I was finished rambling about their son and the Marines, I put everything back in my bag and thanked them. No handshake, no 'we will see you out'. I just uncomfortably found the side door I came in and headed towards the gate I came in. 

About that time I heard a growl. I was at least 15-20 paces from the gate when the dad let out their German Shepherd who was making its way towards me in a fit of rage. I was in the Marine Corps dress blue uniform and carrying a heavy bag, so I wasn't able to sprint for my life like I wanted to. I was able to hurl the bag over the gate and climb over before the dog made it to me, ripping the crotch out of my blue trousers in the process. 

Back at the office my boss asked if I was able to convince the parents to sign. When I explained what happened, he chewed my ass out for not getting a signature and for being in an unserviceable uniform. Semper Fi. "

Back in about 2010 (holy shit that's ten years ago) our house turned about 20 years old. They had built the house and furnished it upon completion, meaning the furniture was aging quite a bit. One piece of furniture was a three-part curved sectional couch that wrapped around our then-three-ton tube TV. 

Wouldn't sell on Craigslist, it was pretty beat up. So my dad dragged out out the front door into the driveway and pulled out a full-size sledgehammer and busted it all apart the while laughing his ass off. We lived in a fairly well-to-do neighborhood. 

tl;dr I watched my wealthy dad reduce my favourite couch to a pile of lumber and upholstery with a three foot sledgehammer in the driveway of a million-dollar house in a matching neighborhood. "

"I always wanted a city builder kind of game that takes place during the apocalypse and you're trying to build up a group of survivors. Like, Tropico or something but with more in depth decision making when it comes to your citizens so instead of ending up with thousands of survivors you end up with hundreds. They show up at the gates and you have to decide if it's worth the risk letting them in. They can cause problems, but also help out with all the tasks. You have to secure borders and farm resources like food and water. You can upgrade buildings to hold more people etc. So I guess more like Tropico meets Fallout Shelters, but I'd prefer a zombie apocalypse instead so units can get infected and etc.  "

"And on the same note, are all school buses in Europe the same color or do they vary by country? What about Canada? Dammit man I need to know and I'm too lazy to google it.

EDIT: So far I have learned that in Europe they aren't ""school buses"" like there are in the States. Apparently, while in the U.S. school buses are owned by the school district or some similar entity (correct me if I'm wrong), buses in Europe are just buses owned by bus companies. Now I never took the bus, however, I would venture to say that if parents were forced to put there kids on public transportation in the US there would be mass hysteria because they don't want there precious children sitting next to adult strangers.

EDIT 2: Thank you all for the input and answers. Small things like how do other countries handle school buses fascinate me. As in the previous edit I will venture a guess as to why the US does busing the way it does. The simple answer is probably because at least in more rural areas there isn't any public transportation. Here in Houston the schools are just too far away so everyone either drives or takes the bus."

"Our bank has a sign over the trash in the check writing station that very clearly says ""THIS IS A GARBAGE. DO NOT DEPOSIT CHECKS HERE.""

We deposit our rent directly into our landlord's account, which is through a small credit union so doing it online isn't an option. Early into our lease, one of my roommates goes to deposit all three of our checks at once, but the bank had closed already so she had to use the overnight deposit. But instead of putting it in the actual overnight deposit, she just dropped it in the hole in the check writing station... a week later, we get an email from our landlord asking about rent. She calls the bank to ask, explains where she drops it off. Next month, I go to drop it off and see the sign.

He was always interested in becoming a police officer and he became a guard or something of that sort. Someone really close to me went to his house a few times and had dinner with his family multiple times. He said the family was pretty conservative in a way but they seemed normal. 

I lived in central florida when the shooting happened and it was surreal.

I looked over my shoulder and they plastered these stupid grins on their face before asking, ""You think she speaks spanish?"" They decided i didn't, progressively getting more vulgar.

The weirdest thing that *happens* is that I regularly have Spanish speakers not understand when I speak Spanish merely because they are expecting English. I know it isn't my accent or anything, because people who know I can speak Spanish understand me completely normally, but if they don't their assumption that I will speak English is so strong they interpret Spanish as gibberish instead of switching languages."

"This. I recently had this experience at work. Hired an african american girl, held her to the exact same standards as everyone else. I work in food, and we give menu tests until the person memorizes the menu. We corrected her test on day 4 or 5 and told her the items she got wrong-mind you, we didn't jump down her throat, just calmly explained what she got wrong-and she said we were being disrespectful to her. I asked her why she felt that way and she said we just didn't know how to manage black people. Long story short, the encounter escalated over the next couple of weeks into a big blow out because a coworker told her to ""chill out"" when she was complaining about a minor inconvenience and she lost her mind, saying we didn't understand her and her parents told her this would happen when she decided to work with white folks, etc. She got into a screaming match with the owner of the company. No one could talk to her because she would shut us down immediately and say it didn't matter what we said, we could never understand her because she's black and we're white. 


I felt genuinely bad that she felt we were all racist when I honestly never held her to any higher standard than the other people who worked there. Not one word was ever said to her with racist intentions but I can't help resolve a situation that I can't even comment on. To this day I wonder what would've made her happy as far as working there. how could I have behaved? "

Let my family know I was still alive and went back to sleep for a couple hours. 4 days later I was in Iraq and far removed from any consequences of my insane behavior."
"Yup. Dogs are an incredible amount of work. We adopted two older dogs (first was 6 months, second was 4 years old) but it's still been basically a full time job (both have some behavioural issues). My suggestion would be to tire out your dog early in the day. I take mine to an off leash park in the morning for an hour where they play fetch and run with other dogs. After that they basically sleep all day. Mental focus will also help tire them out (such as tricks). A tired dog is a happy and non destructive dog!"
"Obligatory comment about how the McDonald's hot coffee lawsuit was actually more than reasonable considering she had third degree burns, needed skin grafts, not to mention McDonald's negligence in knowning about the coffee being too hot and doing nothing to prevent it."
"This is my problem, I want 1/4 serve, but my boyfriend wants 1 serve. 

I don't want a whole serve, and I he doesn't want 1.75 serves. 

It's a waste of money to get 2 serves. 

If he says ""no, get your own fries"" when ordering, I just don't eat fries, it's no problem because whatever salad I ordered is more than enough. 

Though the only time he's ever said ""no, get your own fries"", I respectfully did not touch his fries, then as we were leaving he complained that he'd eaten too many fries and I mocked him saying he shouldn't have ordered the large serve since I wasn't having any and he replied ""you asked if you could have some of my fries, that's why I got a large!""... Turns out he was being sarcastic when he said ""get your own"" "
"&gt; I guess everyone with lower selfesteem/confidence would be prone to this then ? 

Well, you know how people say, ""It's not so bad, suck it up and be a man instead of bitching about it!"" about all sorts of small everyday issues?

It sort of starts with that.  Something that seems small from most ""factual"" or ""logical"" angles, that you tell yourself you have to be an adult about because only a baby would complain about THAT.

The abuse can start really subtle.  Abusers can ""weaponize"" ordinary interactions, mask and hide their intentions (I'm only hard on you because I love you!), so that if you talk about they did to you as an isolated event, you immediately draw scorn, from outsiders who may not understand why it hurt you so much.  

It was just a *joke*, right? She was having a bad day, all people have bad days, don't over think it, just brush it off. You were *too sensitive*. It was just that *one* time--why are you still on about THAT?  Or, my (not) favorite: ""They do that thing (that hurts you) because they care!""

Over time, all those little things that keep happening as ""isolated"" events which don't seem ""that bad"" drag down your esteem.  Because the little bad interactions are low-key, but chronic.  It's kind of like drinking low levels of lead in your water...you won't immediately keel over, but long term?  There's going to be some damage.

So by the time the abuser is getting OBVIOUS, you've already been putting up with the chronic small stuff for a long time.  You've sunk time and effort into them, even money. You think, ""*Nobody believed you before when you tried to talk about the small stuff, why would they believe you now?  Anyway, women can't abuse men--right?  Nobody would believe it, all the domestic violence shelters are for women.*""

Think of a papercut.  One is no big deal, and if you pitch a scene people will laugh their asses off at you.  But imagine if someone took a piece of cardboard, and cut you over and over.  Every day. The old one never healed.  But it seems so STUPID. It's just a papercut, right? It shouldn't hurt like that.  

Yet, if someone was to really put a papercut in the same spot day in and day out, you're going to end up with infection and scarring.  Little shitty interactions can build up over time to do real damage.

So, you and your esteem slowly bleed out over time, even if they were strong to begin with.  You doubt yourself.  Your partner, the abuser, doubts you, wants to make sure you think it could be worse, or that THEY had it worse, or that starving kids in Africa have it worse.

And then a few years down the road, when the abuser is comfortable with abusing you, *that's* when the nasty escalation stuff gets bad if you don't leave and get out.  Like, the stuff that outsiders would finally say is abuse.  So you have that. And the hoovering.  And the lovebombing.  And the gaslighting. Abuse is a cycle, the abuser will be nasty, realize they might chase you off, then they act really nice, until their nastiness surfaces again.

People who have previously been victimized (say by parents or relatives or previous partners) are more prone to it happening again because they haven't been exposed to or ""seen"" as many healthy relationships in the first place. Dysfunction can seem ""normal"" to them.

But it can happen to ""ordinary"" people too simply because they've never been exposed to people so manipulative and toxic, or aren't prepared for the gradual, long-term ramping up of mistreatment.  They don't necessarily have the tools for dealing with it, and maybe weren't raised to realize some people simply aren't fixable or savable.

But there's nobody who's just born to be a victim...any man or woman can be broken down by the right sort of pressure.  Manipulators are very good at finding the right spots to apply that pressure."
"You gotta realize 99% of people don't care about you enough to bother themselves doing some effort in keeping the friendship, they're only there when it's easy to be there, and the moment they find something better or don't feel like they need your ""friendship"" anymore it's over, and there's nothing you can do about it. A couple of those 1% will come around in your life, and when you find that kind of people, hold on to them, and hold on to them real tight. They are true friends, they are the people that will prioritize you over most things because they actually do care about you, and put a high value on your friendship. They'll last longer and you'll feel better being friends with that kind of people, but eventually they'll also go away. Everyone does, that's just life."

"I had a crazy Russian lady downstairs who would confront me, but do it at a distance so she did not have to look at me when she yelled at me. 

I'd be watching TV by myself, and I would get a knock on my door. I would look through the peep hole and there would never be any one there. When I opened the door, I would instantly hear a woman with a thick Russian accent below me ""sir, I can hear your TV while sitting in my living room. If you do not turn TV down, I will put noise complaint for your apartment"". She would literally knock on my door, then run down the stairs so she wouldn't have to talk to me face to face. So I'd turn down my TV and go on with my life. 

This happened multiple times in a week and she caught me at a bad time and I snapped. I walked down to her door to talk to her and she slammed her door in my face. I knocked on her door and asked her to please come out and talk to me like a civil person so we can figure out the issue, instead she called the cops on me for harassing  her. The cops come and I tell them what happened and they told me to go upstairs and they would come talk to me if they needed me. 

About 10 minutes later I hear a bunch of screaming outside and see the police officers dragging the Russian lady out towards the police cars, while she was twisting and turning trying to resist arrest. After they subdued her, an officer made his way up to my apartment. He then told me that when they were in her apartment she made all 3 officers there ""shush"" so that they could faintly hear my television through the walls of her completely quiet apartment. The officer said that a simple fan would have killed the noise of my television, instead, she threw a hissy fit and demanded them to give me a noise violation or something and when they didn't, she went all psycho on them.

"Went on a date with a guy I met through OKCupid. It was a very nice dinner date, we had a lot in common. We ended up walking around and talking for a couple of hours after dinner. It is getting late and I have work the next morning, so he walks me back to my car parked in a nearby garage. We are saying our goodbyes and I reach for my car door. He stands in front of it, saying, ""no, the date isn't over."" He has a smile on his face, so I think he is joking. I laugh, then reach around for the door again. He doesn't budge. I try a second time, this time attempting to physically move him out of the way. He still doesn't move. I am suddenly aware that I am on the 5th floor of this garage, there is only 1 other car on this floor, the blue light is on the other end of this floor and he did marital arts for years (he mentioned that on the date). So, I cannot win if it came down to a physical attack and asking to get in my own car wasn't working, so I start trying to figure out an alternative. We are still talking, since I figure I don't want to upset him. I mention multiple times how late it is and that I need sleep before work the next day (but stop trying to move him). His response was dismissive, saying I could just drink some coffee in the morning. After about 15 minutes, he *finally* moves out of the way and I go home.

I now refuse to let first dates walk me to my car. I used to think it was a nice gesture, but now I am worried it could easily go much worse than this did.

Worst part was that it really was a very pleasant date, one of my better OKCupid dates. I still wonder what I did wrong. Did he want to hook up and thought preventing me from leaving was akin to asking me? Did he not feel confident I really did want a second date?"

"A bar manager I worked for NEVER drank on the job, even when customers tried to buy him a drink.

His view was that it's incredibly easy to become an alcoholic if you start drinking on the job. Particularly because accepting one drink makes it very hard to decline others (this was a club type venue with regulars).

From what I've seen and experienced with barwork since then, he was spot on. I've also known people who worked bars and were functioning alcoholics by any clinical standard, due to drinking on the job."

That last bit is no joke.  I actually got into a fistfight with a cabbie for almost running me over WHILE I was holding my infant son, WHILE I was crossing in the zebra-stripes, WHILE I was crossing on a green.  He just ran the light and came so close to me I had to step back.  I kicked his car as he sped past (that's how close he was) and he slammed on his brakes and came out to yell.  I yelled back.  He punched me in the face (I'm still holding my infant son, btw) and I fucking throttled him one-handed.  I kept trying to give my son to my wife while pummeling him, but she wouldn't have it because she knew if I had two free hands, I'd have ripped his fucking head off.  When I finally got my senses I realized I was going to be arrested in a communist dictatorship if I didn't stop, so I grabbed my wife (still holding on to my kid) and beat a hasty exit into the metro station.

"&gt; Basically,visiting New York as a tourist and settling on Olive Garden shows a certain lack of inspiration, but clearly thousands of people eat there every year. 

I have a friend who was making a road trip with his family from Calgary to Disneyland, one year, and he was telling me the different places they were going to stop for food along the way.  Every single place he mentioned was a chain, whether it was fast food like In-n-Out, or a sit-down place like iHop.  He was super excited about The Cheesecake Factory for instance.  

I told him he was nuts.  I can name half a dozen places to go to between where I live in northern California, and where my dad lives in southern California, that are way better than any of the chains he mentioned (I am a travesty to all that is Californian, and only eat at In-n-Out once or twice a year, at most, when my sister who is an In-n-Out fanatic that moved to Seattle, is around...whether at my place or my dad's). 

He tells me that this is easier.  He was choosing chains that they didn't have in Canada, or at least not in Calgary, so they were all new and exciting-ish for the family, but when you go to a chain you know what you're getting for the most part.  There's no guesswork.  When you go to a hole-in-the-wall, you can find the greatest experience possible, or the most disappointing meal you've had in your life.  He didn't need amazing, he just wanted new, and consistent.

He had his wife and his 5 kids with him on the trip (I mean, it was to Disneyland).  I told him if he ever came and visited me when I was at my dad's, I would be taking him to only non-chain places;  the small cafe on the pier, the burger place on the beach, a Mexican place with quick and easy tacos and the best tortillas you've ever had, etc.  Or if he came and visited me here, the Chinese place that's always empty (took my sister, brother-in-law and then 2 year old nephew to that place, and my nephew had a blast running around the empty restaurant after he'd finished eating), the pho place where I never eat pho, the hot dog place that's only like 4 feet by 6 feet, the burger place that's way bigger and always packed.

Anyway, I understand looking for consistency when everything else you're doing, like you would be as a tourist, is the opposite of consistent."

"I have a 7 month old daughter! 

I always loved the idea of having a kid, and then my wife and I got pregnant and I realized I wasn't ready for the reality of a kid. Then we had her. My wife bonded with her the second she entered this world. And the bolt of lightning, that pure love... missed me by a good 15 feet. 

I struggled during the first 8 weeks. Mainly, trying to survive living in a world where I was no longer a priority but a participant. I did shit, cleaned shit, changed shit, and did everything I could think of to help my wife and daughter. But I felt like an intruder, an outsider in my own family. 

And then it happened...

Around week 8, I stopped mourning my old life, wondering when I'd become such a selfish-asshole. I let go of my old life and started building a new one, with my daughter in it. Slowly, she started to be more intentionally reactive, doing small things that made me feel like I was hers. 

I almost lost her one night during a choking sequence. Shit, that cry, the one the doctor said I'd never forget the moment he helped her into this world. The cry that drove me almost insane trying to help diagnosis for the first 7 weeks of her life. That cry was suddenly the one thing I needed to hear most in this world, at that moment. Fortunately, I was able to clear it and she cried out. It's incredibly difficult to try and describe what I felt in that moment. But I can tell you, I'm not certain that I've ever experienced a moment where every emotion one could feel, suddenly blended together and flooded me. I just rested my head next to her head, wrapped her up in my arms and listened to her cry. I NEEDED that. I realized, I needed her, and had since the moment she entered this world. 

And that, is what being a new parent can be like. You damn near over-dramatize and freak-out over events that are actually pretty common. And you learn through experience, through perspective, how to be the right parent for your kid. You let go of your old life, your expectations, and start building a new one while adding elements from your old one.

Best thing happening in my life right now, is sleeping in my bedroom at night. Wife in bed, baby in crib - it brings me an immense amount of happiness and peace knowing that tonight, right now, everything is okay, tucked in and safe.

I know in the future I may wonder when my daughter will get home from her trip, that date, a dance, whatever... and I may pace the house or not be able to sleep until I hear her walk in that door. But that day is not today. And I will do everything in my power to enjoy the happiness from the simplicity of this moment. The two best things in my life, sleep in the same room as I do. 

Shit, I cannot begin to tell you how happy that makes me. Just knowing the people you love, are safe."

What I was doing was the definition of insane. I keep doing the same things thinking a different outcome would arise. And then one day, I thought to myself, ""What if I don't RDM people? What if I just live the normal happy DarkRP life as a thief or a gun dealer?""

So my friend was ecstatic that I was ready to reenter society as a normal person. He said he had an idea to help me legally transition into society by becoming a gun dealer.

So he and I create a gun shop by buying this really nice petite shop on the corner of a three way intersection. We set up a really good security system and we started printing like crazy.

While I run the shop and take the orders from the customers, he would be taking care of the printers and making sure they didn't blow up. And after a few minutes, our roles would switch.

This endeavor would last hours and we made hundreds of thousands of DarkRP money. And this endeavor would come to an end whenever a custom player with god knows what abilities came and used C4 to destroy everything.

Gun dealing was a stable profession, we always got customers who were happy about the low prices of our commodities, but I still wasn't happy, I wanted to do something exhilarating.

I tried many jobs. I was a cop, that didn't work out so well because I stopped cars on the street and shot the player when they stepped out of the car.

I was a drug dealer in the sewers, that didn't work so well since there would always be this one shit nosy-ass cop who would send the entire swat team to take over my operations.

Then I became a thief, not to steal things, but to expose and destroy a very as-I-thought-then malicious group: the Ebola gang.

They were the worse. They comprised of at least 20 thieves and would swarm the map raiding the small guys who just wanted to make a buck in the harsh capitalistic world of DarkRP. And before you say ""Well those small guys should have had good security,"" these thieves were rich and always had a dealer on their side who would hand them a C4 during a raid.

The thieves didn't even need the money from the printers, they just annoyed the hell out of these small guys who just wanted a few Washingtons.

I then was determined to take them down. So I became a thief, had a cop on the line, and joined the group.

But I couldn't do it myself, I would be rammed in the ass so hard if they found out. I needed a buddy, so I search for another thief who was not part of the gang to assist me in the operation, let's call him Buddy.

Buddy and I join the gang, the guards mash the keys on the passcode and let us in.

To give you a description of how big the Ebola gang was, the gang had bought out the entire industrial section of the city. They bought all four warehouses in the city and set up an enormous amount of security. They build a multiple sniper towers and a secured bridge to connect multiple warehouses.

Continuing with the story, Buddy and I are allowed in to the building. The leader of the Ebola gang congratulates us on joining such a reputable gang and gives us the keycode for entering the base. I got it, I got the code. All I need to do is PM the chief police officer and convince him to bring every police officer and SWAT member to the Industrial section of the city.

So I PM the police officer right before I enter one of the warehouses.

We enter one warehouse and the sight is true heaven. Countless people have multiple printers set up. Drug dealers are cooking up m*** like there is no tomorrow. Buddy PMs me saying ""Fuck the undercover operation, I'm making some dough."" Great.

The chief police officer replies to my PM telling me ""Great, we're getting all our police force to the base."" Shit, I wanted money too but I just ratted the gang out.

The police cars arrive at the scene. The SWAT team comes a little later.

There's a silent standoff as the chief police officer is trying to get approval from the mayor to raid the Ebola gang base. The senior gang members are instructing us to take arms and take positions to eradicate the law enforcement from the scene.

I'm ready, I want the money and I'm going to fight to the death to defend the base. I set up position behind multiple sand bags. I have the sniper positioned on the head of the chief officer.

The chief officer gets approval from the mayor to raid the Ebola base, I was the informant, I relayed the news. The chief police officer used his battery ram to break the entrance to the base and fire erupts.

I take the first shot to the head, making a huge blow to the police officer. Police and SWAT try frantically to enter the base, only to be gunned down by the powerful weapons of the Ebola fighters.

The police try retreating firing their shots of anger to save the guns that they have, only to be stopped by the annoying remnants of what used be the security structure for the base. Every weapon is aimed at the block of police officers and SWAT members, every weapon is firing multiple shots over and over.

The showdown was a bloodbath. None of the officers and SWAT managed to escape the scene, the gang was victorious.

Everyone was cheering, the security was being constructed again, but now was the trial.

The leader of the gang was smart enough to know that there was an inside man to relay the information to the police officers. He looks at everyone in the gang, trying to deduce who would have relayed the information. He looks at my direction, I am nervous as fuck. He says ""You! No the guy behind you Ravenclaw968.""

I am relieved. The guy behind me is questioned mercilessly. He pleads innocence but then gets angrier and angrier at the leader. All guns are pointed at him now, including mine.

He gets angry to the point where he pulls out his weapon and every gun in the room goes off. He falls to the floor, such an innocent face.

I shake it off and start making hundreds of thousands of dollars from printing. Buddy and I are having a good life. While the Ebola gang raids lands far away, Buddy and I convinced them that we were defending the base, while all we were doing was printing and printing.

The cops finally showed up one last time, it seemed as if it was the battle of Bull Run. We got in a strategic position. I had the sniper pointing the cops again. We were ready but cocky.

The battery ram hit the security apparatus of the base. But I don't see as many shots coming from our gang as I thought. Wait, half of our gang was dead.

I was scared, the cops were pushing their way quickly and quickly. It felt like the Soviet takeover of Berlin in 1944 (1945?).

I remembered what loyalty meant. I took that sniper and kept firing and firing, but the cops took their shotgun and took a blow to my chest. I fell, gasping for breath. With all my energy, I pleaded to not be shot. The cops laughed, and took another blow at my chest.

My printers were destroyed, I returned to the Industrial base after a few days, only to see it rotting and desolate. This place used to be such a thriving black market.

I didn't know what to do anymore. I was aimless. Except for one thing, I always followed the path of crime. It would be one crime syndicate to another crime syndicate.

I couldn't take it anymore after one point. I took the car I had recently bought, drove to the beaches far from the city, looked at the peaceful water, and pressed escape, opened up the command line, and typed ""kill.""

"My great uncle worked as a night guard or watchman or something at a storage warehouse for an airport in the UK (many decades ago) and it wasn't uncommon for them to have animals passing through. He used to be very fond of dogs and actually kept a lead (leash) and collar so he could get them out for walks whilst he did his rounds. 

So one night a grey German shepherd was waiting in a cage in the warehouse. He fed it some corned beef sandwiches and, as it seemed friendly,  he decided to get it out for a walk. Took it on his rounds so that it could stretch its legs and then put it back in the cage later. 

Later found out that it was actually a timber wolf being shipped to a zoo.

So my great uncle accidentally took a timber wolf for a walk. Apparently it was quite chilled out and well-behaved! "

A comment like this is so incredibly stupid.

I am extremely thankful that we live in a time where all a typical teenager might have to complain about is not getting a ps4 game.

It turned out that knowing a girl well really boosted my numeric appraisal of her.

I just straight up told her, that i developing stronger feelings because of how much time we spent together (in and outside of work) and that it wasnt healthy for me mentally, so we're gonna need to dial back the contact a bit.  Cause i was getting super depressed on the weekends when she would have her time with her husband, then i was basically work husband + emotional support.  So it sucks to lose a close friend (we still have contact but not as close before, and not as often) but holy shit it was so much better for my mental state. "

Turns out, his daughter ultimately, and very soon after the death (so not like it took many months/years) inherited much of his estate. My guess is they gave the money in his honor, rather than because she was not included in his will.

The dialogue is smart (ignore the stupid acronyms used in the first episode...they mostly go away), the characters are all well written and refreshingly imperfect, and the camera work is stunning... maybe the framing is a little off putting at first, but I found it to be one of my favorite things about the show.

"Married man here, had my dream wedding. We invited (I think) 32 people and (I think) 25 made it. All family. Got married at the courthouse, judge did a phenomenal job of it and actually gave a great speech. Had a dinner/reception thing in the lovely cellar of our favorite Italian restaurant afterwords, where they did a great job with the food and service. Our wedding cake was a fudgy chocolate salted caramel cake which was our favorite from a different restaurant, but made 2 tiers. Lots of laughter, didn't feel like I had to neglect anyone, wasn't pulled around or anything, very low stress and enjoyable. Not terribly traditional, but my wife and I aren't really traditional people. Love that woman. "
It really is pretty rare. There were a few people I went to high school with who dated their high school boyfriend or girlfriend all the way thru college and then broke up after college. Then there is me and my wife. She was 13 when we started dating. One of her friends started dating some guy when she was like 11 and now they have been married for like 6 years. 
"I work at a hotel, and since I don't drive I take public transportation home. My hotel drives me in their shuttle to the airport, and then I take a subway train home. 

The shit I have to deal with at the hotel, and the customers I observe walking through the airport are usually the same people. They stay at our hotel because it's right around the corner.

Now, all that being said, travelers don't give a fuuuuuuuck about logic, or being rational. I've had a gun pulled on me because someones flight was canceled, and their son was stuck in florida. They wanted ME to undo that. 

So I can totally feel bad about the TSA workers. Their agency exists because certain types of people think they provide better security. They don't. They are all theater. The real safety goes on behind the scenes in places you never see. It's because you can't see it, that makes some people not feel more safe. Therefore, the TSA is there to make theater of being more safe. 

With all that being said, most people don't know it's all theater, and travelers don't need a valid reason to yell and complain and get irate at anyone who is doing a job. 


The TSA exists, because the government tells them to exist. But the individuals are still just average people making a living. No need to treat them like shit. "

"A colleague of mine did this a while ago. I didn't even know he was marrying, it was just him, his family (parents etc.) and one friend. He has been together with his wife for more than 15 years and has three children. They had a small, chill wedding at a fine place without most of the stress.

Compare that to a big wedding where most people don't really meet the groom and bride anyways, I was at one of those they day after my colleagues wedding and had a feeling of ""why the fuck am I here?"" most of the time. "
"That is absolutely the truth. My ex works up there and when I found out how much he made in a year, my jaw hit the floor. And he had almost no savings to speak of! He blew it all on drugs, multiple cars (which got totalled), and alcohol mostly. His tax return was more than I make in 3 months (and I make decent money). And he spent it all on alcohol!"
"TSA hires the most ghetto, unprofessional, uneducated people on the planet. Theft is absolutely rampant, to the point that I've heard of professional photographers and other people who travel with a lot of equipment resorting to adding a cheap rifle to their checked bags so TSA will stop breaking and stealing their gear. Apparently when you check a firearm, they inspect the bag in your presence and then lock it and prohibit searching it again. This is specifically because TSA doesn't want to deal with their own employees stealing guns. 

This has been going on for years and they still won't do anything about it. I don't know how we still have an unemployment problem in this country. TSA will hire the most dishonest, ignorant, brain-dead people on the planet."

"This'll get buried, and it's my sister's story, but fairly amusing/exasperating. When I was in college, I did a family history project and learned, after a lot of digging, that I am actually a distant descendent of Anne Hutchinson. This was super exciting and not something any of us knew (a great grandmother was disowned after marrying ""poor,"" and none of us us tracked her lineage before). I told my parents and little sisters and they were excited.

Little sister excitedly mentions it in her American history class (in middle school; my sister is shy and didn't usually talk). Teacher shuts her down, informs her that Anne Hutchinson has no living relatives, and admonishes her publicly for making up ""attention-seeking rumors."" 

Sister texts me what happened, I dig up the records I found and email her. She brings them to class. Teacher decided I must have fabricated them. -_-"

"The boss and their assistant committed MAJOR, MAJOR fraud, embezzlement, and the like, a few years back. They're ""public servants"" who market themselves as ""carers for the community"". Now, we're talking hundreds of thousands of dollars that they've bilked from our ""company"" and the community's children. Somehow, a coworker stumbled upon this deeply hidden information online  and then, told me (whilst boss was listening in on our conversation (office speaker system...standard, in our profession).  Boss and co. were terrified that the knowledge would be (and should have been shared) but my coworker believed that they would simply wind up ""slightly demoted"" and us ""permanently harassed and fired"", if the word got out. I figure that a scandal broadcast would be hell fire to the higher ups and gravy for the news stations. Coworker convinced me  that at best, our silence would be job security, though he and I would be sure to refrain for asking for anything (we ain't going down for blackmail and frankly, the criminals don't have much of anything worthy of it). I heartily agreed to the latter part of his statement. We would simply get to be left alone to plod away at our jobs until we transfer or retire (particularly since the boss/co. regularly harass, demoralize everybody else). Apparently angered by our insistence to remain clean and declining ANY favors and promotions from the crooks, they've made various attempts to use character assassination and stupid lies to isolate us from any camaraderie or support one usually gets with other coworkers - saying that we're adulterous lovers, or ""problematic"", etc..  It's been a tough challenge, but we've managed to create stable and consistent profiles because one by one, staff members start catching on to how evil the bosses really are (takes them YEARS for some fucking reason, but...). While my buddy wants to leave w/out making waves, when I do finally break away from this dungeon, I sincerely want to reveal them to the world and see them hit Skid Row (they won't do any jail time, I gather.

"...  last year I got a call from my X wife,  I have primary care of our child.  She was in tears and I was sure she was calling to tell me she got kicked out by her boyfriend.

NOPE, her boyfriend (who lived with her where my kid spent two days a week) had been arrested on child porn charges two weeks before and social services was asking her when the kid could come in to be interviewed by the cops.  Since I have her during most of the week it was impossible for her to bring our daughter in.  

She had not told me about the charges, she had no intentions of telling me.  Why couldn't we reach her on her cell phone?  She lost her phone at work, real reason it was confiscated as evidence.  The only reason she told me was because social services advised her that if she didn't tell me right away and that I called them to book the appointment they would call me and have the RCMP advise me...  it was a mess because charges had not been laid yet they couldn't even tell me who got arrested just that someone in the household had...

"My story is a bit different. I was so sheltered before I went there that I saw all the normal-ish things as being insane.

I grew up in an insanely rural part of New Zealand. The nearest town was just a pub, a fruit store and 80 houses. The paved roads went as far as the school bus need it to go then turned to gravel. The school had a random pile of wood and tractor tires for us to play in and build our own playground out of.

I thought that Wellington was a big city and found it nice enough. I thought going to LA would just be more of that. Nice normal people doing nice normal things.

Here are some things I saw in LA that I had never seen before in my life and blew my mind:

A snotty kid knocking some toys over because he wanted them. The rudeness was inconceivable to me.

So Lily doesn't return his affections, James is an asshole to him, and he as an adult feels the need to take that out on their 11 year old son? I don't care what else he did, he bullied a child as some kind of petty and stupid revenge. But he and Lily could have had this grand romance if things had been different! I know we don't know much about Lily Potter but if her love could save her son from certain death at the hands of the darkest wizard of that age, I think Severus ""ultimate asshole"" Snape isn't the right guy for her.

When I was ten, Rene and I were black raspberry picking, I sat on a log and a swarm of bees angrily came out. I panicked and started screaming, running, and flailing my arms. Rene came running over to me and grabbed my arms, told me to calm down. I look at her and in slow motion, a bee stings her lip, comes out, and stings her lip again. She grabbed the bee with two fingers and pinched it to death. I was absolutely amazed. I calmed down and in the end got only seven stings. She got ten saving me- eleven if you count the double sting.

He shows up and doesn't acknowledge me, in fact he gives one word answers to me. Had he done an ounce of research he would have known who I was. But wait it gets better. During the interview I ask some basic knowledge questions- lens, lights, set ups etc. He then admits he doesn't know any of this information and doesn't have a professional camera. That's ok- in college I had a shitty camera it's not the camera or lens it's the photographer but he seemed to be missing huge basic knowledge.  So I press more for his post processing work- again- his portfolio was quite impressive. He then admits he was hired by a company to do exactly 3 exposures on a pre set setting, and a company in India processes his photos- I have an American Editor on staff- but I would never hire anyone to do something I couldn't. I asked him to show me some of his work that he himself shot and edited. Out comes the worst processed images I've ever seen. Anyone with a camera on auto could do better. I asked for a few more- maybe it was one off- again he pulls up another set of images that are the bottom feeders of photographers.  I concluded the interview. The best part is we have all of our company meetings at a cafe my cousin owns- apparently he was rude to her when getting coffee- the cousin is a free loving hippie so for her to give him the axe was a shocker.

"I was walking home from school with my friends, it was burning hot that day and our usual path had absolutely nothing to protect us from the sun, so one of them suggested we should take an alternate street, which had plenty of trees. 

Now, that shouldn't been a problem, I had explored that street before, and wouldn't think twice before going with them. But I had a very bad feeling and said I'd rather stick to my route. They said 'okay then, you go'.

Later that day one of them called me and said they had been robbed, and the thief had pressed a gun against his forehead, aside from beating the crap out of his buddy.

I used to carry a hunting knife in my belt, if by any chance the thief noticed that thing, I'd likely be shot."

"It didn't happen to me, but the same friend that owns the house told me a weirder story. Like I said the house is way out in the sticks. His uncle came to the house one day to work on the farm and such. This was in the 1990's, if I remember correctly. Anyway the uncle worked on the farm some and then just piddled around the house. He camped outside on the property a ways from the house (like five acres, in eye shot but over a hill). He was into the outdoors and they're nice woods. He woke up before day break to screaming one night and machinery. He got up and chased horrific noises. He ran towards the barn and the pasture to figure out what it was. It was screaming mixed with machinery. He wasn't sure, but it sounded like a chain saw. When he got to the scene, there was a homeless man that had stolen a chain saw and was using it to kill a cow. The man had cut into the cow's neck and the poor thing was still running for it. I didn't want to use this as my original story sense it didn't happen to me lol. Happy dreams!

"When in the Australian outback or Aussie terrain where snakes may be found, always wear long, baggy pants. Australian snakes are very different to other places, their fangs are miniscule, about one eighth of the length of a sewing needle and roughly the same width as one. The difference is that a single micro drop can kill you, all you need is the tiniest little graze,  you may not even feel it... And you're dead within the hour. If wearing long pants, the snake may bite bitmap below can be delivered. (note this doesn't work in many other countries as the fangs are considerably larger as they need to deliver much more below for it to be deadly ) "

"Bali, Indonesia

This might not be a popular opinion but I was there this June and could not wait to leave. The whole island felt like it was overrun by tourism and we felt so uncomfortable being there. We avoided the obvious party/all-inclusive resort areas like Kuta and Seminayak, but even in the less popular places on the island we were constantly being harassed by drivers and vendors, and continuously being tricked into paying for everything under the sun. I understand the huge difference between the local lifestyle and that of the massive resorts that have been built to draw more tourists to the island, but it fet like every experience we had was tainted by someone trying to sell it to us. Nothing felt genuine at all. I was curious to discover the natural beauty of the island and learn about their culture, but realized that it was impossible once I got there. The whole trip left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't plan on ever returning, not even for work if I can help it. "

"One time my cousin Walter got this cat stuck in his ass. True story. He bought it at our local mall, so the whole fiasco wound up on the news. It was embarrassing for my relatives and all. But the next week, he did it again. Different cat, same results, complete with another trip to the emergency room. So I run into him a week later at the mall and he was buying another cat! And I said to him, ""Jesus, Walt, what are you doing? You know you're just gonna get this cat stuck in your ass, too. Why don't you knock it off?"" And he said to me, ""Brodie, how the hell else am I supposed to get the gerbil out?"" My cousin was a weird guy.

"Not racist, but in the same league as ""discriminatory"" (applies to ethnic groups as well as races):  When one a group of whites will get all bent out of shape on behalf of another race or ethnic group.

Glaring example:  A museum in Boston had kimono for people to try on and have their photos taken.  A nice way to get people to know about kimono, right?  Nooooooooooooo!!! That's cultural appropriation!! The museum had to bend over backwards to apologize.

Who was calling them out on it?  Mostly white people, and maybe one Japanese American.  Several surveys were done with actual Japanese people in Japan, asking if they had any problem with white people wearing kimono, respectfully or not.  Nobody cared, except those who said it was a good thing if more people were interested in kimono, so it wouldn't die out."

"Not a teacher but I went to school for speech pathology, but took a different career path. Anyways, neighborhood boy comes over to play with my 5 year old daughter and the way he talked really rubbed me the wrong way. I told my wife, ""that kid has had a brain injury or some kind of trauma,"" and she said no, it's just low education levels around here that's how they talk. Well, okay I'm from the other side of the country, not familiar with regional dialects. Six months later standing at the bus stop and meet the kids mom who has the same odd speech pattern and in conversation she brings up that she has a benign brain tumor that she said ""if they removed it, I wouldn't be able to talk no more."" The tumor was pushing on her language center and affected her speech that her child picked up on when learning to talk. Kid had speech pattern of brain damaged mother!

"My favorite excel moment was someone that didn't realize you could change the width/height of cells, and thought the cell was truncating text.  So when I got the sheet to review, the comments that she added to each row spanned between 4 and 15 columns, because she'd type 10-12 characters, then tab to the next cell to continue typing. 

I guess on the other end of the spectrum is someone who's so enamored with excel that he makes things more complicated than they need to be.  i.e. instead of requesting a report with all rows with X value in some field, he'll just get all rows in an excel sheet, and then do all these convoluted vlookups and such to drill down to the list that he could have started with if he just asked for it in the report in the first place.

"Don't expect college to be any better just because you are in college.


Sure, you will get more flexibility with courses, and it's up to you to go to class or not, but unless you decide to change your attitude to your life, things don't improve- whether it's high school or college.


Now is a good time to start thinking about what profession you want to pick up, how you want to improve your social life, and other similar things."
Don't feel too bad. At least you did it and will be done soon. I started college at 18 and went full time until I was 25 when I finally graduated and I owe the extra years to my not taking it seriously and partying. At least *your* party years didn't cost you $30k/year in student loans.
"Sleep paralysis is no joke man. My boyfriend at the time was sleeping in my bed with me, and I went into an episode. We fell asleep cuddling, but throughout the night we had drifted a bit, and he was behind me and I was facing the rest of my room. I could feel him breathing on my neck. 

Now keep in mind, he was a new boyfriend and it had been awhile since someone slept in my bed with me. I convinced myself there was a strange man in my bed and he was going to rape me and kill me. When I finally broke out of it, I nearly fell out of my bed to get away. He didn't wake up, but I felt instantly calm and silly when I saw his sleeping face.

My episodes have kind of changed over the years. I used to have vivid hallucinations, but now I just get a super bad feeling and convince myself someone is in the room. I once hallucinated my sister walking in my room, walking over to the corner of my room and sitting. She just stared at me grinning in a creepy way. I don't remember what happened next, but I was screaming, crying, and struggling to breath. My actual sister ran in and calmed me down enough to tell her what happened."

"Both my current and former employer wanted good GPAs from schools with good engineering schools, BS degrees in either Civil, mechanical, or Aircraft engineering. And both hired lots of college grads, as much as 50% of our staff was recent college grads, same goes for design jobs which are less demanding on GPA. I sit at a desk working between 50 and 60 hrs a week doing math and solving problems to make sure aircrafts are designed properly and don't kill the crew or passengers. Its a job that is demanding and has high expectations, but the pay reflects the level of work required and every year of experience increases my value as an engineer and what I can ask for when I decide to go to another employer.

Its a job that pays well enough that it can be the sole income for a family of 4, (and afford all the avocado toast we want, still working on getting a mortgage because we just moved halfway across the country)"

"Cna work is grueling. It's a rough gig. You're treated like shit. You get shit on. You're essentially the lowest rung in any facility. You get paid nothing for back breaking work. People punch, kick, verbally assault you, spit on you, throw urine in your face. Nurses that won't get off their fat asses order you around and get you to do their dirty work. Doctors don't even acknowledge that you exist. Families take their frustrations out on you. Your coworkers backstab you and everything is politics and drama. 

But take those grunts out of the hospital, assisted living, or skilled nursing facility and watch everything grind to a halt. They're the grease that keeps the machine running. 

They're often the only ones that can spend more than 5 minutes with a patient. They're the person you need to talk to if you actually want to know what the Fuck is going on with a patient. If it were up to me every single Healthcare provider should have to do a stint as a CNA. You cannot do dick all for a patient if you don't know how to provide for their most basic needs. And that is the grueling underbelly of Healthcare. The dirty work. The job nobody wants to do. 

Its possible to be a good nurse, doctor, whatever without ever having done that kind of work. But the best providers I've ever worked with started at the bottom. They know what it's like to be arm deep in shit. They respect the little guy. Recognize they are part of the team. Not just someone to be a dick to and look down on.

"The problem with type one diabetes isn't too much sugar. It's that the pancreas not being able to make the stuff (insulin) that tells cells to remove sugar from the bloodstream and absorb it into the cells that need it. As long as insulin is injected regularly the sugar hit from a twix will be absorbed; same as anyone else. Biggest problem with type one is getting the time and dosage right. And because that is so tricky type one does require the diet to be watched. But as long as the kid takes an insulin shot when his blood sugar gets high enough it shouldn't be a major issue if he has some sweets every now and then. 

Of course the father's motivations are still fucked up. But I don't see why the kid wouldn't want to take advantage of a treat when available. "

"I didn't know what it was like to buy eggs at the store until I moved out at 18. I also snubbed store cucumbers, tomatoes, etc for not being as good as the ones we grew at home.

Looking back, it's funny. At the time, I felt like I was in a different country. "

I lucked out in that I missed out on the creepers when I was going though puberty (because I legit looked eight for most of it), but I spent my 20s dealing with creepy assholes who seemed horrified to learn I was not underage. And that is what upset me most (still does tbh, as I am still mistaken for underage despite being mid thirties surprisingly regularly). Those men did not care about appearance. They wanted a literal child. Because if you think someone is 14 and suddenly you learn they're not, that should not be a problem unless what you want is not the *appearance* of youth, it's just actual youth. Which is fucking disturbing because at that point it's clearly a thought out thing, not some biological impulse like some people claim..."

"unless you have sources, this sounds like unfounded fear-mongering. Sure, pigs will eat anything, but I still eat pigs, and they are deee-licious. ""Toxin"" is an incredibly vague term, which, depending on the context and who you ask, can be referring to something genuinely harmful, or just new-age bullshit.

Even if there's a genuine danger in something the pig eats, there are several degrees of separation here.

Pig eats poison mushroom --&gt; pig digests and shits out poison mushroom --&gt; shrimp eats shit from several pigs throughout its life, some of which may have eaten poison mushroom --&gt; shrimp is killed, processed, frozen, shipped --&gt; shrimp is eaten by human.

By the time you reach the end of that chain, I'm a little skeptical that the effects of the poison mushroom are a legitimate concern.

None of this is proof *against* your point, I'm just saying I'll require a little more hard evidence that it does actually work this way before I start reassessing my eating habits."

"I don't mean to frighten you but my dad was much the same, not with drugs but with alcohol. We joke that addiction is the family hobby, but it's taken a serious toll on just about everyone. My dad was a horrible drunk, constantly in trouble, mean as all hell and abusive. He stopped when my mom got pregnant with me, and kept it up when my little brother was born. It only lasted for a few years after that, and he went right back to drinking a twelve pack a day and verbally and sometimes physically abusing us. My mom let him continue like that until I was thirteen, and just put it on me and my brother to keep ourselves in check so as not to anger him. He had several false starts on sobriety and I'm not sure what the final straw was, but my mom finally gave him the ultimatum to either quit or leave. Later that year he was in an accident and became addicted to prescription painkillers, which lasted another ten years and gave him much the same attitude.

Please, for your child(ren), if he ever shows any signs of relapsing or developing another addiction, don't let him continue down that path. No matter your confidence in him or how much you love him, your children don't deserve to have to live in a situation like that. "

"Religions, Kids, Money, Sex.

In some way or form, these are the deal breakers. 

Religion includes not only fundamental belief, but also expression. It can also include religious like beliefs, like an Ohio fan who will wake from Coma rather than let it be implied he likes Michigan.

Kids are not only if you want them, but also number, belief in adoption, and how to raise them. Sidelining into money is does one parent stay home?

Money is a fight that sucks because this one can hurt even if everything else agrees. Maybe one of you is not successful and the stress of saving and lowered expectations will put too much pressure on.

Lastly sex. Not just frequency and kinks, but what it means and what's considered sex and what fidelity is required. Some people are very open. Some people are very closed. 

Note for a lot of this you can talk about and accept differences of. But you need to accept it, not think you can change their mind down the road. "

I see where you're coming from but capitalism works best when everyone is on the same page. Giving everything away to poor countries for free causes issues in of itself. The shoe industry in some African countries have been completely destroyed because of all the free shoes they receive.

But this is definitely a tricky issue; nobody wants people walking barefoot.

The nice thing about Guild Wars 2 is that the free content is enough to play on for at least 50-60 hours, and by then you should definitely know if you like the game enough to spend money on it or not. I always recommend people try out the base game first, since it's free, and then they can decide if they like it enough to pay for it.

There's also some really compelling characters, though the best character doesn't show up in the free content unfortunately. (Canach is a treasure, he will forever be my favorite.)"

"Traditionally, women are ""supposed"" to value relationships over sex, and men the opposite. So when a woman ""gives"" sex away without getting a relationship, she's perceived as having failed — either she wasn't ""worthy"" of a relationship, or she didn't have a strong enough sense of her own worth to hold out on sex until there was a relationship. I think you see something similar in the whole ""friend-zone"" phenomenon. Men who ""settle"" for a sex-free relationship with a woman (i.e. a friendship) are seen as losers or wimps — either they couldn't get the girl to have sex with them or were too gutless to try. Very similar to the way women who have sex without a relationship are seen.

It happens because society both wants to hold women on a pedestal — the pure, virginal being — and at the same time, well, we don't lie to ourselves, we do want to have sex."

Solsiers have also fallen asleep on the train home whilst wearing the combat uniform and got woken up by the police in Germant/France/Italy. So we also invaded those in the past 5 years.

"It highly depends on the agency, but I work for Social Security and although all of my coworkers (seriously, all of them) are highly intelligent people with pretty diverse backgrounds that bring all sorts of skills to the table, they don't really have much motivation outside of not being yelled at by some member of the public.

It's difficult to advance even if you do a great job. The advancement typically takes YEARS between promotions, so even if you are advancing, the goal is so far out that it's near impossible to keep your eye on the prize.

Veteran's preference, while a good program, has certainly hurt motivation for non-vets in this agency. You see, when you apply for a promotion, you get graded based on a quiz and your work performance on a 1-100 scale. MOST people who are applying for a job they're qualified for will get a 100. But veterans get +5 no matter what, so they'll get 105, which prevents any promotion from non-vets. I understand veterans preference for getting your foot in the door. They need jobs, but man, it makes promotion almost impossible.

I really need a new career."

I knew I had to get around him to escape, so that's when I started babbling and then front thrust-kicked him. 

At the grand jury, when they played the tape, it shocked me how long everything lasted. In the heat of the moment, it felt like the whole thing went down in 2 seconds. In real life, it was probably 45 seconds. When I kicked him, he actually fell back and sat there holding the knife.

get a large metal bowl.

get a sauce pan - 1 quart pan should do it.

1/3 cup measuring cup

pop corn

oil - olive oil is okay.

cheese - extra sharp white cheddar is preferable.

Put oil in pan, make sure there is enough to cover the bottom of pan completely. Then, put a heaping 3rd of a cup of popcorn in the pan. Cover with lid, and turn the heat to medium high. Get cheese from fridge, and cut 3 slices - 1 for each third. Listen for the sizzling sound to come from the pan - once you hear it *start* to sizzle, turn the heat on high. Give it a good shake or two. Once the popcorn starts popping, do the dance and shake the pan *while it's still on the burner*. Do this until the popping stops. Pour popcorn into bowl. Salt (2-3 pinches should do). Grab cheese slices. Eat.

Pairs well with beer, wine, and Margaritas."

I slowly stood up put my trigger on my bow and was ready to draw back. The noise is coming closer and closer. It's closing in fast and it's huge. I see movement through the openings of the trees. It's at the edge of the tree line. My heart is pounding and I'm standing still waiting for the animal to walk out. It comes out.

"Seriously. So many people seem to miss the point, and just think that Oberyn was a good fighter whose fatal flaw was overconfidence. That's not what was happening. He wasn't just a better fighter, but one who was overconfident. He was playing a strategic role. As Doran says, Oberyn was the snake, and Doran was the grass. It wasn't just pride or overconfidence or whatever. Oberyn had a very specific goal when he went to King's Landing. It was to force a confession, not just for his own personal emotional-well-being. It was to open up the possibility for war on King's Landing once it was publicly revealed that the Mountain acted on Tywin's orders.

Oberyn wasn't over confident. He was doing precisely what he was meant to do. Standing so close to the Mountain's arms, though...well, that was a mistake."

"Ah, the the time I fought the Nazis back in '14... I live in a triplex and a lady moved in with her name on the lease, then moved out and let her daughter and the daughter's boyfriend move in. Within 2 days he propped up a Nazi flag in their window, visible to all from the alley. Now I am a white boy, and live in a neighborhood where I am pretty much the only white boy around, cops stop me and ask me if I know where the hell I am. That Nazi flag scared the living fuck out of me, cause my dad has lived here for 20 years, and me for 10, so I didn't leave my house for a month, but had notified the owner. He was already in the process of evicting them, and my picture of their Nazi flag was what sealed the court case against them. As they did the usual squatter legal mambo I spent the days blasting Queen at them while I swam in the pool. They tried tricking me several times into entering their apartment for various maintenance reasons, faucet dripping, ""fire in the heater"" (pilot light... duh), so they could fuck me up and say I broke in. They were tweakers of the highest order so I made sure to stay the fuck outta there. They were trying every play in the book to stay in that place longer."

He handled the rejection without insulting me like he did in highschool.... buuuut  he still keeps inviting me places (lunch, dinner, etc)  ""as friends"" but wants to pay for everything.

I'm walking past a basement apartment and notice this wiggling shape at the doorway.  As I'm walking closer I realize this shape is a middle aged guy hopping over the steel doorway with a garbage bag.  I literally froze like an idiot as our paths crossed.  Luckily, I'm on the other side of the sidewalk, so there's SOME space between us.  He locks his eyes with mine and stares for a few secs.  The moment he took a slow few steps towards me, I started speed walking away to my home.  Before I averted my eyes from him, he spat in my direction and then walked in the opposite direction with his garbage bag.

**TLDR: I think I came across someone finishing some theft and then have a short stare off with said person.**"
"Not exactly a Nice Guy story, more of a Nice Girl story (I'm a guy), sorry!

We met my Senior year of high school, and we had just started a back-and-forth banter of flirting and whatnot that High Schoolers do. Let's call her C.

One day she asked if we could hang out after school, and that she wanted to watch a movie. I had spent time with other female friends alone just to watch a movie, and nothing ever happened, as I never really think of them as dates.

She comes over, and we start watching a movie. About half-way through, she starts asking me questions randomly. Some normal, like what my favorite book was. Others... not so much. Like if I had ever eaten a girl out before.

The movie ends, and while C is leaving, she mentions how she had a ton of fun, and couldn't wait to do it again. 

Now, while in high school, I had horrible anxiety issues. I would sometimes have attacks that I would not even remember starting. Since I was a male that had these issues, I somehow became the go-to person to a few of my female friends who also had anxiety. I never minded, as I always enjoy helping people.

A few nights after the movie, C comes over around 1 am without warning, saying that she was having an anxiety attack. I never ask questions whenever someone says they need support in some way, so I spend around an hour just calming her down, and just getting her to breath normally, etc. Knowing my own anxiety and the anxiety of my friends, I had never even thought it possible to even drive while having one, although I could be wrong on that.

The next day she stops by, apologizing for coming over late, and saying that it was nice to have a boyfriend like me. I had stopped her after that, and told her that although I did think she was cute, I did not want a girlfriend at the time, and that we were not a thing. Not just straight up telling her nope was a fuckup on my part.

A few weeks pass by, her having anxiety attacks only whenever I'm nearby to see/help. I never questioned it, and every time I would attempt to help.

Around this time, this other girl and I had started hitting it off, and we were starting to go on dates.

Upon finally making it official, C started spamming my phone with messages saying that she is way better for me, that she will hurt herself over this, that I'll see what I'm missing, etc.

I watch anime once-in-a-while, and enjoy playing games like Kingdom hearts. Upon my relationship starting, C had then had her long hair (went down to around her waist) cut to resemble the main character's hair in Kingdom Hearts, which is a male character with short-ish hair. She also started changing all of her stuff to anime/kingdom hearts things. Often sending me snapchat images of these things, as I was far too nice and far too much of a pushover to block her.

There was around a month left till we graduated, and she had finally started dating someone, and it had seemed that she was finally over whatever she had in me.

So one day she asks if we could hang out one more time, as sort of a early graduation last hangout. Me being an idiot, agreed.

She came over, and I put a movie on, and we watched it.

Not even 10 minutes into the movie, and she looks at me and simply says, ""I want to fuck you right now, so that you're mine."".

After telling her no multiple times, stopping the movie, and telling her to simply leave, she started on about how she was such a great friend for me, and how we had so many shared interests, etc.

After finally kicking her out of my house, I realized that I needed to end all communication with crazy. After blocking her on everything, she started making a few false accounts to send me messages, most about how she is much better than my girlfriend, etc.

She stopped sending them, and now I can safely go off to college without crazy!

"Absolutely!  I was getting into my Mustang in a mall parking lot during busy Christmas shopping season. I opened the driver's side door, sat down, put my bags in the back seat with the door ajar, started my car,  and as I went to grab the door handle there was a man standing in between my seat and the door. 

The next 45 seconds were me thinking ""so this is how I am going to die"" and he literally pushed me over to the passenger seat, pulled out a knife and told me to be quiet. As he was backing out of the parking space he grabbed my hair with his gloved right hand and I went I to full fight mode. I kicked the windshield, honked the horn, went to bail out of the passenger door ( thank GOD Mustangs have an automatic door unlock when you pull the handle) fell onto the pavement after being stabbed several times, got run over by my car as he was backing out of the parking space, and numerous holiday shoppers came to my rescue. 
A man carrying his Christmas packages dropped everything, pulled me up off the pavement and 4 guys ran after my car and pulled my attacker out of the driver's seat. My attacker ran behind Kmart and the guys chased him and beat him up and brought him to the rear door of my ambulance for me to identify. 
It was a great Christmas story for the local news. To this day I regret that I was never able to personally thank everyone who saved  my life. Although, one of the guys that saved me was holding my hand when I woke up in my hospital room. I was very lucky.
My favorite part was where the bystanders placed me carefully lying on the hood of a Pontiac Fiero that had a warm hood and covered me with their winter coats as the snow fell on my face.
For several years I kept in touch with the man and his wife who moved me to the warm hood of the Fiero.

"This is a complicated question. 

There are some very nice parts of Gary actually, namely the Miller Beach area on the north side of the city. There are also some not so great parts. There are areas where you'll see your fair share of abandoned buildings and homeless people, and areas that I wouldn't walk around at night.

That being said, I have never felt that I was in danger of being harmed or anything in all my years living here. You just have to keep your wits about you and act smart. 

Honestly, a huge part of the city are just decent, hardworking people trying to make a living after the steel mills crashed. The crime is due to a corrupt municipal government that has the lowest paid police force in the county that leaves it extremely under staffed and overworked. And said government is never voted out because once again, people are too worried about putting food on the table to adhere to the states ridiculous voting hours"

"Heh. I was waiting on the metro in DC. Rosslyn if I remember correctly, one of the stations that gets a lot of tourist traffic. One of the escalators to my track was not working. Some tourist family were trying to figure out where they were and where they were trying to go. Fair enough. Their ~3-4 year old daughter was doing her own thing. They walked up the (broken) escalator, left said daughter. Not on purpose, not for long, but these things do not take long. 

Daughter realized, in about 1 min, that mommy and daddy were not next to her. Started doing the ""I am going to cry and cry loud"" face / body movement thing. NB: my kids are adults at this point, I am going to or from work; I have zero interest in small kids. Nobody else took any notice or wanted to intervene. I was a middle aged adult male. I absolutely cannot get involved. But I did to the point where I told the kid to start walking up the (still broken) escalator in the direction mommy and daddy went. I was going to follow at a discrete distance, but someone noticed that the kid was missing and met her while she was moving up.

The whole ""adult male can't talk to kids thing""? Yeah. That was bugging me the whole time. Along with: ""if you talk to her you will be accused of molestation in some form or other."" You cannot recover from the accusation. So sorry kid, while I want to help, I do not want to ruin my entire life because mommy and daddy cannot pay attention."

She was awesome.

"I used to work in a wine bar, and one of the regular faces you would see around was this completely wasted guy, small, thin, reeking of alcohol from a distance, often aggressive, and when not, he would be talking about some pretty gruesome imagery, while looking at people through watery, dying eyes. 
The saddest part of the story is that a lot of people in town remembered this man as the cutest little boy ever, in his youth, everyone had good memories about him, but at some point down the line his life went wrong, and he was basically living on the street, although his family and young daughter were still in town. 
Anyway, we used to serve him a couple of drink, if he was still sober and coherent, but we were also forced to turn him away many times, especially if he started being confrontational.

There is a plot twist though. I have heard the guy started helping a bar manager out with small little chores, like cleaning, picking up groceries, and so on. In time he seems to have put most of his life back in line, and I was told he now found a job, is (supposedly) sober, and has a relationship with his daughter again. 

I saw him when I went back to my home town a couple of years ago, and he looked like a new person. What mande the difference were his smile and his eyes looking alive again.

It definitely put me in a good mood, and I hope he keeps on the path he has been building!"

"Similar situation last week. Two men at a table next to me during lunch kept looking at me awkwardly. One was ""teaching"" the other about the fraud that is science, and that the Grand Canyon was from the great flood receding back into the ocean. He also said that based on scientific calculations, the Earth has aged millions of years in just the past few years alone. I didn't know if I was giggling without realizing it, or if I maybe groaned a little too loud. When I walked past a window and saw my reflection, I noticed I was wearing a t-shirt with Neil deGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan bumping fists standing under the word ""science"" in bold letters."
"This is so prevalent among my entire family. There was a time when it made sense because we were rather poor, so saving money in the long run by buying quality stuff wasn't really an option. I wanted to buy a new dresser and made the mistake of telling my mother who went on a craig'slist/yardsailing campaign to get one and it was obviously a piece of crap. She was so proud of how little she had to spend on it. Completely dismissing the time she spent finding it and that fact that it will need to be replaced. She even painted it. I tried to explain to her once about how much time she wastes ""saving money"" and tried to get her to think of it as how much she makes an hour which is probably close to $100. Could not grasp the concept."

"I wouldn't call myself a traveler, but I'm currently on vacation in Europe (from the US) for the first time in my life! 

I know that the French have a reputation for smelling like BO for not wearing deodorant but JESUS. I didn't know until I was packed onto a bus with people all around me. Same for Italy. It was unbelievably smelly and I was surprised nobody looked as sick as I felt from inhaling their odor. 

In France I also noticed that nose picking is a thing? I know most people pick their nose in their car or privately but I saw several girls going to town. Like really getting up in there.

Next is the driving in Italy. In the US we have highway patrol and cops are quick to stop you if you're speeding/going to slow/breaking driving rules. The taxi driver I was with hit over 150 on the freeway. The road wasn't too full but there were other cars who he just swerved past. He wasn't the only driver like this either. 

People here smoke a lot more than in the US, too. It's so strange to me. Afterwards they just dump their cigarette butts on the floor, not even putting them out. It's infuriating, as someone who cares about the environment and hates when people litter. 

Even though it sounds like I'm complaining (I guess I am), the city (Rome is where I am staying) is absolutely beautiful!!! 

Edit: 150 kph, not miles :)"

"Yep. The best theory I can come up with is that the douchey Americans either stay home because America is the best place in the world, or they only go to Florida/Cancun/Vegas on vacation. Europe is too far.

So the Americans that make it to Europe are generally a bit friendlier and open minded. 

Whereas with British people, Spain and Portugal are their Florida and Prague is their Vegas, so the douches are all over Europe. Meanwhile any British tourists I met in America were super polite.

Australians are the total exception to this rule, btw, they will travel anywhere, no matter if they are douchey or not."

My dad then demanded that he would only agree if it was added that I have a medical marijuana card and I was not ""allowed"" to smoke the day before or day of driving them.

My mom's lawyer promptly had that removed. She said having my name associated with marijuana in a legal document, legal medical state or not, could possibly have a negative impact on me for life. The attorney said she was confused how it was relevant.

"Happened in 2nd grade.

My last name is Booke. I liked to read on the bus. Other kids thought it was funny, screamed ""BOOKE READ A BOOK"" and would slap my book out of my hands, steal my bag, etc. I was a pretty small kid, and grew up to be a pretty small man.

Anyway, the worst one was named Chris. One day, Chris actually tried to steal my Batman umbrella. Tried to pull it out of my hand out of nowhere as he was getting off at his stop, and pulled me out of my seat when I wouldn't let go. Laughed at me with his buddies. That was when the red mist descended for the first time.

I quietly got off at his stop with him, behind the other kids. Bus driver wasn't paying attention, nobody was. As soon as the bus started to pull away, he noticed me standing there, and just looked confused. That was when I cracked him in the mouth as hard as I could with the umbrella. Immediately started crying, spitting blood on the ground. His friends drove me off.

When I got home, I was really upset at what I did, cried to my Dad and told him what happened. He taught me then that violence is not okay, but standing up for yourself when necessary, is.

A few weeks later, he didn't have many friends left. I think his cronies lost respect for him after the little kid a grade below fucked him up. I remember distinctly him sitting by himself, sad and alone. He asked me if I would be his friend. I said yes. We were buddies for a few months til he moved away."

Nearly killed me too, because the family doctor was a fucking moron.

Mom got an appointment for that day because I was complaining about pain in my stomach. Doctor examined me and declared that I was faking the pain for attention. Yes, that's right. A 3 YEAR OLD is faking pain in his stomach for attention.

So, he sent me home and prescribed antibiotics for shits and giggles.

2 days later of this shit, I passed out and was unresponive. Mom rushed me into the hospital and the doctor took a 2 second look at me and I was into the operating room. My appendix had, in essence, exploded.

The ER doctor was horrified when my Mom told him what the family doctor said. The ER doctor said that the family doctor should have known what it was. He suspected that when I went in that day, it most likely had ruptured. The ER doctor also said that if I hadn't received those antibiotics, I would have died that same day.

Edit: He also said that if my Mom had waited before taking me in, I would died within an hour."

For a *tiny* bit of elaboration as like half a dozen other people jumped to the same answer (which doesn't surprise me at all) - the entire final season was a bust, one of those things that I'm sure sounded great when it was pitched but somewhere between that stage and it actually hitting screens, a lot clearly got lost along the way. Characters weren't showcased in the way they should be, running gags weren't particularly executed well, entire episodes were wasted in order to drag out the wedding saga a little longer... and then the final episode that basically undid years of character progression that a lot of people were super invested in. It was just poorly executed and a real letdown compared to what it could and should have been.   
  
They tried to make up for it with some alternate ending which I guess deserves a very small amount of credit, but all that achieved in the grand scheme of things was to make the episode where Ted goes on a tangent about how you can't change an ending just because you don't like it considerably more amusing in retrospect.

She got upset. I tried to let it go, but she wouldn't. So we ended up talking about it for a bit. People were gathering around. My friend came to my side and tried to help diffuse the situation.

That's when another friend of ours walks by. She asked what everyone was doing. And very passionately, this aunt told her about autism and vaccines. This friend is going for a masters in biology and she's quick to point when someone says something wrong; so when she laughed I knew where this was going. ""Are you fucking retarded?""

Some stuff happened...

My friend and her parents said I shouldn't come to any events the aunt will be at any more, but if it happens, I should just avoid her. Biology friend was told to never come to any events the aunt will be at because she might die."

"Not a throwaway; I can own this story. 

Back in high school, I was sometimes a less than stellar person. I went to a school with a dorm

We had prank wars. My most favorite took place in the winter when the vents were blowing hot air into people's rooms. I had an RC truck with a trunk I would fill with raw crab meat. I would drive it from room vent to room vent on a rotation of a few days per week. I like to think of their vent as my crustacean bus station. The rooms were all in a line of a wing, with the other side being womens dorms. So I had a straight track there and back for my meat truck (no turning or navigating), and would only drive it when I could be sure no one was in the rooms (dinner usually).

I could maneuver by driving straight and I could tell where rooms were by the rectangle of light shining down into the vent/bus station. (I had a little hand mirror I would angle down my own vent to see). 

Kids were waking up and running to other kids' rooms to sleep. Many times they may even vomit when they open the door to their room if it festered all weekend. 

I would complain about the smell myself so it would throw the dorm staff off. I knew my dad was the one they would call for maintenance, so I would just wait until he texted me he was coming by (usually to take me out to dinner since he's in town), and pull out the RC car that day. I would then hide the meat in my room and the RC car under my bed. It was just so simple, so evil, and so well executed time and time again.

Never was caught. This is still amusing enough to me that when laying awake at night remembering it, I still sometimes laugh to the point of tears. 

Tl;Dr: during winter I would drive my ""meat truck"" up and down the vents of our dorm, blowing warm; raw seafood smell into different rooms every night. 


Edit: people wondering about battery life; I would charge it just the right amount that this wasn't ever an issue, but I had a string attached to it if it ever did get stuck. I would have just pulled it back to my room. "

"After years of buying $10 or $20 wallets once a year I sprung for a $55 wallet from Saddleback leather. 

That was in 2008. I'm still carrying that wallet today, it looks about the same as those $10 ones looked after 2 months and it has 91 years left on its warranty. Its a little bulky so I've considered buying a smaller model from Saddleback, but if I can afford to anytime I need a bag or other leather item I'm going back to Saddleback. "

"I named my car Ubud after that town when I was 17. 

I had a crazy trip to Bali with some friends as teens. We basically joined a music group going to Bali and took off and lived a month around Bali as teens. Two days in Kuta, I got robbed, ate some mushrooms and got lost and found myself in some shady situations, met a Javanese college student on holiday, she gave me ecstasy, went to that club that was bombed several months after, had to save my friend who lost his mind in the bathroom there, we get out in daylight, lose my virginity, and jumped in a cab and said, take us to the other side of the island. It was a rowdy 24hrs. I never wanted to go back to that town. "
It's all happening 
"Not at all. It's been a huge pain in the ass tbh. Narcolepsy is progressive so for many years I just sort of played it off. I've lived on Nodose for years. I had a lot of problems with getting up in the mornings and the brain fogs at work than with actually sleeping on the job. And I was tired... ALL THE TIME. People mostly just thought I was lazy... and at times I thought they must be right. But as time went on the urge to sleep became stronger and stronger. At some point I realized that these urges to sleep weren't going to go away and I was no longer able to fight them. I got lucky at first because I sat by friends that would wake me up and tell me that I'd been dozing. But as soon as I was put on another team and sat beside people I didn't know I started getting noticed and told on. I'd worked at this place for years and done a good job but suddenly I was persona non grata. No one ever asked if something was wrong or if a was ok. They just assumed I was a bad, lazy person. Also, since no one was waking me (the people that told on me would just let me go on sleeping) my numbers were starting to suffer. The last friend I sat beside was the one that told me she thought I had narcolepsy. I'd never even considered it; honestly, I thought she was cuckoo. But after being constantly told on and targeted I finally considered it and started researching online. I knew something was wrong. I'd known for a while at that point. I just didn't know what and I mostly just blamed myself. It must be my sleep habits or my diet or my stress levels. But when I started looking it all clicked. Narcolepsy isn't about falling over, suddenly asleep. It's so much different and so much more. And so many of these symptoms were things I'd experienced most of my life that I'd always thought were normal. So I went to the doctor who did a bunch of tests and it was confirmed. It's still a struggle as no one really gets what narcolepsy is... and my numbers still aren't always that great. But I at least have some defense. And I have FMLA for those days that I can't seem to get up on time. I try to tell people about narcolepsy when they will listen, getting the word out is what we really need. But it's a slow process. I was just very happy to have an answer to my questions and some reasons for what was happening. And having prescription medications to help me stay awake are very helpful too! Sorry for the novel. I hope this is enlightening!"
"Oh that would have been ""Schoolies Week"".  It's embarrassing to be Australian in Bali at that time."
"I went to a very large high school with precisely 7 trillion clubs and extra-curricular activities. Being a freshman with virtually zero talents or athletic ability, my choices were much fewer. I eventually settled on the crew (rowing) team.

The first day at the boathouse was the best day. I spent almost the entire time with my peers and one super cool coach, not the veteran rowers or their coaches; however, one coach, I'll call him Jim, made me uncomfortable. I had no reason to think he was a fiend, so I blamed it on nerves and just generally being an uncomfortable person.

As time went on, that feeling never went away. My second year on the team, who else would be my coach but Jim. I soon dreaded going to practice, which was partially due to my depression, but I really hated having Jim as my coach. Eventually, I quit the team.

I found out about a year ago that all my fears and queasy feelings were justified. Jim had found a hole in the plywood walls of the girls changing room in the boathouse and hid a camera. He had been recording these young girls, some of them not even in high school yet, for the entirety of my time on the team and before.

Even though I wound up hating the competition and quitting, I loved the team, and some of the girls on the team are dear to me. The fact that this guy was doing this the whole time I was there just boils my blood.

I also convinced my sister not to join the team because I didn't like this one coach...

TL;DR Hated a coach, quit and convinced my sister not to join because of him, and now he's been convicted of child pornography for recording the girls on the team."

I've been pulled over many many times in 12 years of driving. a couple times as a teenager, I moved from a legitimately dangerous spot to a safer area and the cop was extremely pissed, despite multiple obvious acknowledgements. 

Now that I'm in my late 20s, the few times that I've been pulled over and moved somewhere safe first, I got told I was forward thinking and responsible. 

my conclusion is either: a) sincerely just a coincidence that only mean guys pulled me over as a teen. or b) the cops knew that if they were an asshole, I might be less likely to dispute the ticket.

I'm sure there's a ""c)"" but I've yet to figure out what that ""c"" option is, despite many years of thinking about it."

"This actually happened during my parents' divorce.

My mom worked a boatload to put my dad through school and him not working a day in his life. He got a job with a huge paycheck, nice retirement benefits, the works. So he immediately divorces my mom.

Judge rules that because she financed his school and supported him throughout, my mom gets spousal benefits such as her own retirement plan from the company, a good deal of his money, etc.

My sperm donor knew my mom was pretty broke and he wasn't, so he hired an expensive lawyer and told her he would drag the divorce out until she had not a penny. Fought to get full custody of me when he honestly never wanted to see me again because he had partying to do. A real asshole.

He told my mom that he would stop if she signed away all her rights to a retirement package, income, etc. Eventually she did.

I grew up dirt poor and a lot of nights my mom went without dinner. All because he wanted all the money. I hate him for what he did to her."

"Pediatrician. See lots of kids almost every day.

Small kids (&lt;10) going  to court to identify their abusers- something no one else in the room can do, and sometimes the one thing needed to put them in jail.

Kids who fight for their lives for days, weeks, months, years and survive. And put up with a lot more than most adults could. 

Kids who fight for their lives for days, weeks, months, years and don't survive. Half the time they're the ones holding their family together and even comforting their parents while they're dying.

Kids who ask for help when even adults would have a hard time doing it. I once had a patient who had about fifteen seconds when a family member walked out of the room to tell me she was being abused. She did it. Sometimes I know I'm the one who finally asked the question about what was bothering them the right way. Kids gets a look in their eyes when they're about to tell you about whatever awful thing is wrong with them.

My favorite recently- little kid sticking out her arm yelling ""I'M BEING BRAVE"" while getting and IV put in. And sobbing at the same time. "

I was working for a car dealership when I was fresh out of highschool. The job got busy and I figured instead of finding a garbage can I'll just swallow my gun, save some time. 

I swallowed my gum and about 4h into the shift I have to use the washroom. 

So gum doesn't digest. That's obvious right? That would be fine too under most circumstances...

But my ass-crack has a head of hair fuller than Kanye West's inflated ego. 

Ever had gum stuck in your hair? It sucks right?

My ass hair merged with this gum as I tried to wipe. Middle of my shift and I'm sitting there for 20 minutes, getting paid to pluck gum outta my ass hair while I silently cry from the pain of forcing an involuntary Brazilian on my bootyhole.

TL;DR When it comes to swallowing gum, If you got butt hair, don't you dare.

"Despite what certain inferior style-guides would have you believe, en-dashes are the correct punctuation marks to use for in-sentence asides, provided that they're always used in pairs and have spaces on either side. (I don't think em-dashes are incorrect for that use according to APA. I just have a personal vendetta against them, as one of the writers for whom I edit has a tendency to use them in place of practically every other punctuation mark.)

I'm actually not sure if en-dashes should also be used for something like ""1900 to 2000,"" though. I'll have to check that one! It could be that I've been misusing hyphens for that purpose, and that would be embarrassing.

**Edit:** It looks like the use of either an en-dash or a hyphen for denoting numerical ranges is somewhat contested, rather like the use of en-dashes for in-sentence asides. I think I may switch over to using en-dashes, though, so thank you for teaching me something!"

When I was in high school, in my electronic music class, we were tasked with making a cover of a song the group decided on. I forgot which one it was but the beginning went something like ""And we both go down together, we may stay here forever"" and it was written by someone with a similar voice to the singer of Fall Out Boy.

"Oh man, the Cold War produced so much really crazy shit.

Check out Project Pluto for a few nightmares. It was one of the various crazy ass weapons projects the US military looked into during the Cold War. Some of their very bad ideas actually got built, like the Davy Crockett Atomic Rifle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett_(nuclear_device) 

Others, like Project Pluto, were just seriously planned before ultimately not being built.

Project Pluto was a total weapon, a nuclear powered cruise missile (manned in some proposals, as computer guidance wasn't very great back then) that flew by a plutonium powered ramjet, air goes in, is heated by a huge pile of plutonium, and jets out very fast. It was to have been armed with many megaton range hydrogen bombs, fly just barely above ground at mach 3 or 4 so the shockwave of its passage would be a weapon, while it tossed out its megaton range nukes behind itself. When it finally ran out of nukes, it was supposed to become a kinetic kill vehicle by ramming into a high value target and making it unusable by spraying its load of molten plutonium everywhere.

What really makes me wonder, and gives me occasional nightmares, is: if this is the sort of shit the USA came up with during the Cold War what lunacy was the Soviet Union getting up to, and what of their utterly deranged projects actually got built instead of just planned?"

"I wrote a post a while back about how I feel more nervous if a guy follows me down a dark street than a woman (relating to a specific point of an AskReddit question). But apparently I was wrong - women can be just as violent as men (if not more so). I hadn't thought of all the men who had been physically terrorised by women. 

Ages ago (but this sticks in my mind) a woman wrote about how she went to a guy's apartment after meeting him in a bar. All he had in the bare apartment was a tarp on the floor and a light (or something like that) so she ""noped out of there"". Pretty much all the replies were saying he was probably innocent and just decorating the place, she should have given the poor guy a chance. Like, really Reddit?

"India.  I've been to 51 countries, and it's the only one I refuse to ever go to.  Top 10 Reasons:

1)  It's dirty.  Like, really dirty.  Feral pigs eating trash out of dirty creek right outside of the Taj Mahal dirty.  I've been to 5 countries in Africa, India is dirtier.  
2)  It's unclean.  Like, the food is unclean.  Bought food from a girl on a train, later saw her preparing her food by cleaning her knife on the edge of the train latter.  I have a fairly iron stomach, got uncontrollably sick from eating street food.  Street food is my favorite part about travelling.  
3)  Saw a man f***ing a cow, in the Ganges river, in Varanasi.  The holy trifecta.  I blame India's conservative culture, not letting people date, etc.  We were so decensitised to horrible things that this didn't bother us at the time.  He was surrounded by other people who didn't seem to notice, or care.
4)  Ever see a cow pee, and have people walk up and drink from it's pee?  Yup.  
5)  Poverty.  Ever see someone at a train station that you aren't quite sure if they are dead or dying?  That you are absolutely sure they won't live to see the next week?  India.  
6)   The trains are horrible.  Our train was an average 3 hours late.  The quality of the train was like a cattle car.  
7)  Road safety.  Both driving on it, and the actual roads themselves.  
8)  Caste system.  Shameful.  
9)  10 days in India, was given fake money 3 times.  Was driven to ""official tourist office"" (aka buddy's tourism office) 4 times.

Bangkok. Complete lack of urban planning. Roads don't make any sense and lack turns to the extent of having to pass a destination by several miles before coming back if its on the other side of the road. Horrible traffic 24/7. Crossing the street requires going up on a skybridge that often smells of piss and is covered in graffiti.

" Escaped being smashed by a live power line once. I was driving with my best friend and her 1 year old daughter on a back road through our towns. It was windy and raining a bit, but nothing out of the ordinary for this area or that time of year. All of a sudden my friend's daughter started crying. And it wasn't the typical cry of hers, it was frantic and we'd never heard her cry like that before. I pulled over to the side of the road so we could check on her, and just as I did, the car behind us passed and then was immediately smashed by a live wire that snapped and fell over the road. 100% would have been us if I hadn't pulled over.

"My in-laws are incredibly dysfunctional, so my husband's sister came to live with us when she was 16.  We'd only been married a year.  Aside from regular teenage drama, she was very, very needy and had very few friends.  Only left the house for school and if she was awake, she was in a common area of the house, talking, mostly to hear the sound of her own voice.  

My husband was used to being the fun big brother and he wouldn't establish boundaries or set limits with her and he'd look at me like I was crazy when I'd try to.  Her room looked like something out of hoarders.  She couldn't complete the simplest of household chores.  You could hear her sneaking around our bedroom door if my husband and I were in there with the door closed and that's kind of a libido killer.  I ended up very frustrated with the whole situation.  I know a lot of her problems stem from the environment she was raised in, but that didn't make living with her easier.  We made her get her driver's license and a job. 

Shipped her off to college an hour and a half away, great, right?  Nope!  She can't get along with anyone there, so she was coming home every...weekend.  Two months in, she met her now-husband and *he* was coming home with her every weekend, too.  And neither of them had a job, so they were at our house all weekend.  They went to a Christian college, so he would have to sleep on our couch since they weren't married yet.  I felt like I was suffocating.  I'm an introvert who very much likes my personal space.  I did pick up a few new hobbies because I would do anything to get out of the house on a regular basis back then.

For their second year of college, my SIL and her fiancé decided to go to a different school 6 hours away.  This did a world of good for both of them (his family is pretty dysfunctional, but in different ways).  They were kind of forced to suck it up and figure things out on their own.  They lived there for a few years (got married after their sophomore year), and now they live about 2 hours away from us (they're 23 now).  They've matured so much, it's insane.  Both working, supporting themselves, getting along with other humans, having friends and whatnot.  I actually look forward to seeing them and hanging out these days.  I'm glad we took her in, but damn, that was rough on the marriage."

"Okay, as someone who spent YEARS on dating sites (and then met the woman of my dreams by a family member hooking us up):

1) Nothing at all  
Do **NOT** pull that ""Well just message me and ask if you want to know something"" bullshit.  That is how you get messages from nothing but the superficial jerks who will send you a dick pic as soon as they get your number.  The good ones out there will want to see what you're into, what you're like, etc BEFORE they message you.  And since they're spending the time to try and craft a unique message just for you that will get your attention amongst all of the ""Hey u so fine"" spam you get, the idea of going in cold with no clue what to talk about is a HUGE barrier.

If you pull that blank profile crap, all you're going to get are shallow guys that only want a quick fuck because they like your picture.  Anyone that wants more than that is going to steer clear of you.

2) Religion  
In America, the majority of people are religious to one degree or flavor, its just assumed that you will be too.  Any serious site will have an option in your details to fill out your religion (or lack thereof).  Use it.  Anyone who goes out of their way to talk about their religion on their DATING PROFILE is going to be assumed to be a fundamentalist extremist.  And pro-tip, everyone who isn't a fundie HATES FUNDIES.  You would probably scare less people off by saying you've been recently cured of Ebola.

3) Coded Shallowness  
Women can be (and are) just as shallow and superficial as men.  Thing is, if its wrong for guys to say ""No fat chicks"", its equally wrong for you to say ""Tall guys only"".  If anything, it is MORE WRONG for women to ask for only tall guys than it is for men to ask for skinny women.  Because your weight is something you can change if you really want to, his height though?  No amount of diets and working out is EVER going to make him taller.

So really, just come out and say what you want.  If you're going to be shallow, be shallow.  Let people know up front.  But don't sit there and say you don't like to be judged like a piece of meat and then turn around and judge the guys in the same way.  Hypocrisy is not a turn on for anyone.

4) Deceptive Pictures  
Not really writing, but do **NOT** use deceptive photographs.  If you've got nothing but cropped headshots, men will avoid you.  If its all creative angles, men will avoid you.

The important thing to remember is that no matter what body type you have, that is someone's thing.  Framing photos that hide what you actually look like is a recipe for disaster every single time, because you are lying to us.  If you're fat, then own it, there are plenty of chubby chasers out there.  If you frame your pictures to look skinny, well all you're going to do is piss off the people who like the idea of skinny you, while making sure the ones who would like fat you don't give you a second glance.  Same for other aspects of your body.  Got small boobs?  Great, there are plenty of people out there that love small boobs and think giant knockers are nasty.  Same as above, show it off, don't hide it!  Every guy out there knows how to spot those deceptive photos and will instantly skip over you for using them.  Headshot and full body shot are required."

Be a person you're proud to be, be a person that *you'd* want to be in a relationship or a friendship with. The right people, the ones you're proud to be friends with, will come to you before long, and you'll gain much more satisfaction from life if your success, your comfort, and your happiness come from within.

""Rachel Maines hypothesized that doctors from the classical era up until the early 20th century commonly treated hysteria by masturbating female patients to orgasm (termed ""hysterical paroxysm""), and that the inconvenience of this may have driven the early development of and the market for the vibrator.[1] Although Maines's theory that hysteria was treated by masturbating female patients to orgasm is widely repeated in the literature on female anatomy and sexuality,[7] some historians dispute Maines's claims about the prevalence of this treatment for hysteria and about its relevance to the invention of the vibrator, describing them as a distortion of the evidence or that it was only relevant to an extremely narrow group.[8][9][10] Maines has said that her theory should be treated as a hypothesis rather than a fact.""

"The movie is totally different from the book, and apparently the book's author was extremely pissed about what the movie did to his book.  I've never read the book, and always loved the movie.  But I always saw the book in the movie as a magical book that adapted to whomever was reading it.  Bastion was reading it, and he had a vivid imagination.  All of the adults were giving him a hard time, and trying to get him to abandon his imagination, and grow up.  So, when he read the book, it became about his internal struggles.  This big fantasy world being swallowed up by nothingness.  And the only thing he had to do to save it was name the Empress, because it would exercise his imagination.  And, every time he made a wish, it would further exercise his imagination, basically rebuilding the fantasy world.

So it's neverending because it's only limited by his imagination, and if the book falls into another person's hands, the entire thing starts all over, with a whole different story to tell, based on that person's struggles."

WHen the house was eventually demolished a few years back, they found out underneath the decades of renovations that it had started life as a log cabin- this isn't in the country, it's in a residential area. My grandfather and his 8 siblings and their parents lived in this 5-room house. They all drank a LOT (my grandfather only did so when he and his family came to visit, my grandmother HATED going there).

The thing about the food service industry is that profit margins tend to be razor-thin. As such, the big chains have to cut corners anywhere they can to turn a profit. This means paying their employees little. This means not being picky with their employees. This means creating a system in which the restaurant can still function with subpar employees. 

More upscale restaurants which pay their employees more and therefore can be more selective obviously have a higher caliber of staff. 

You get what you pay for, and if you're paying minimum wage, you're getting the employees who can't get a job that pays more than minimum wage. Simple as that. "

"In the United States it is illegal to possess the remains of almost all wild birds, to include naturally molted feathers, as well as nests. This includes common songbirds like robins, corvids like ravens and blue jays, raptors, woodpeckers, and pretty much everything else except non-native species like pheasants and starlings, and a few game birds like turkeys. Huntable waterfowl and crows are a gray area because you can get a permit to shoot them and you can possess their remains, but you can't sell them, you can only give them away along with the permit (IIRC.) Wildlife officials aren't likely to break down your door if your kid brings home a blue jay feather and puts in in their room, but I see people with hawk, owl and crow feathers on their rear-view mirrors or in hats all the time, and you never know when you're going to run into that one game official who decides to be a stickler.

"I was six when we moved and I'm well into my 30's now, so my memory is a bit fuzzy. 

The incident like the OP described happend on the road between Sweet Grass, MT and Great Falls, MT. My dad didn't stop though - he was a federal law enforcement officer, dude knew what was up. Apparently there was a rash of that in the area in the late 80's/Early 90's. 

We lived across a field from an old school. It was abandoned in the 1960's, we frequently saw people moving around inside the building. It was locked down tight, so... 

Just lots of weird little ''haunts'' in that area. We lost a dog in an odd and unfortunate circumstance. The neighborhood kids saw a little girl, nobody knew who she belonged to. One kid predicted a storm that killed another kid. Some kids had the same nightmare on the same night. 

I have a lot of fond memories of living there, but everything that happened was so awful my mother still won't talk about it. "

"Could've been a potential burglar! 

I have a few similar stories with my house, my family went on a three week holiday and I stayed home to house sit. Because I was home alone for 3 weeks I figured I'd get my PlayStation set up on the living room TV. We have patio doors that lead directly into our living room and the TV is in a corner opposite the doors, I had also moved one of the chairs so I was sat directly in front of the TV about 3 feet between the chair and unit the TV was stood on.

One night I'm sat playing Skyrim with earphones in, lights off and had one of the patio doors open to let some air in and so my dog could wander in and out as he pleased, it's roughly 1am at this point and I'm totally immersed.. Right up until I hear something moving above me, I immediately brushed it off thinking my dog was upstairs so I just carried on playing, I heard a loud thud above me and it sounded like something had been knocked over or dropped so I sigh and get up to check what damage my dog has done and notice he's asleep on the couch just behind me, I immediately feel awful because the patio is WIDE OPEN, like much wider than I had it originally. I slowly made my way into the kitchen, grabbed a big fuck off knife and slowly crept upstairs, bursting into each room one by one with this knife and checking cupboards etc. I eventually clear the entire upstairs and feeling relieved that I found nothing I went back downstairs to finish off Mercer Frey, as I'm about to walk into the living room I see a guy dressed in all black sprint out my patio door, slamming it behind him. 

I felt physically sick with fear when I realised that someone had actually been in my house and must've been in one of the bedrooms I went into last, meaning he'd slipped right past me on his way in and out. I called my grandparents who got me to call the police, I spent the next two weeks with a knife and baseball bat next to me at all times and every door and window stayed shut and locked between 9pm and 9am!"

"I don't know if this experience was bone chilling, but it definitely is permanently seared into my memory. When I was in high school I went to Colorado with some friends and we decided to go a climb a small mountain nearby the hotel we were staying at. The mountain was a very easy hike if you took the path, which was more of a deer trail, but being young and foolish we decided to go up the hard way. This entailed hiking and scrambling along a 100-200 ft. cliff for most of the way. 

We were having a blast and taking pictures along he edge when we spotted a precipice hanging out over the cliff. It overlooked this gorgeous valley between the mountain ranges. So naturally we tried to climb our way down to it. We finally find the ""easiest"" path down, but there's a catch. In order to get there you would have to jump down 6-7 ft. and across a 4 foot gap with nothing but 200 ft. of open air underneath you. 

No one was bravr enough to do it so I took a leap of faith so to speak. I made it fine and we got the picture and now before me lay the task of climbing back up to my friends. Since I can't jump 6 ft. into the air, I had to free climb my way back. All was going well until I ran out of foot and hand holds. The next one was a round the corner of the cliff above open air. As this was my only option I reached for it, luckily I got a decent hold and then began the process of transferring the rest of my body around the corner. 

As I was about to swing my body around my hand slipped and the next thing I knew I was falling. It was weird it was like my mind went completely blank and I had accepted my fate. Then miraculously I landed on a tiny ledge about 2x1 ft. hanging out from the cliff face. I had fallen fifteen ft. and managed to stick the landing. I quickly climbed back up and I didn't even realize what had happened until I reached the top of the cliff and wait there shaking. So yeah, fell of a cliff because I was being dumb. 

Worst of all, I lost the picture..."

"""Make it hard for them to lose weight"" isn't a thing though. That's a made up fallacy. There is still a caloric surplus somewhere.

You can't make and store energy from no energy source. If they really gain weight while maintaining a caloric deficit then they should call NASA like right now because there are some very smart people who will want to meet them."

"The key to it is to stop your mind channel-switching. 

The best way to do this is to focus on a story in your mind. So, make one up. Make it real or a fantasy (a fantasy works better, I find). 

In mine, I am taking a trip in a supercar that I have magically acquired, but you need to choose something that works for you. 

Then think about everything leading up to that event. I think about going downstairs in my house, and kicking the usual detritus that the kids have left out of the way. I think about the fact that it's early morning, so I make coffee, which I drink. Check the news/Twitter/Facebook. Flick through some Reddit threads.

I'm an amateur photographer, so I'm probably going to an event. I think about what camera gear I will take. I think about selecting the gear and putting it in the camera bag.

I think about going to the garage and prepping the car. 

This goes on until I'm in the car and driving. I've never made it to the end of my street yet.

Focusing on the detail gives your mind something to focus on. It also slows down the ""getting to the good bit"" of the fantasy, which stops you from getting overexcited (not drawing attention to all you fapping enthusiasts out there!)

"We've been married for 37 years tomorrow. I'd say the first year was the hardest - adjusting to living with someone else and all their bad habits. 

However, there was a period of time that was extremely stressful. We had a 4 yr old and 9 month old twins. Our younger son had nearly died due to heart failure because of asthma that the doctors couldn't get under control - he had been in the hospital for about a week. My husband had been experiencing severe pains in his back which the doctors were brushing off (he'd visit emerg while leaving the hospital) I finally phoned our gp to insist that he arrange a cardiac stress test as it just didn't appear to be muscle pains to me. I'm amazed that he listened to my 25 year old self and got him in right away. As I was arguing with the pediatric doctor to let my kid out of the hospital, I was paged by our doc that my husband was on his way in. Turned out he was 90% blocked in 2 arteries at age 31. We found out who our friends really were.  My family, except my sister, were for shit too. It was an incredibly lonely time. We were enthusiastic Christians at the time and the response from the people at church was fairly good for my husband except for a couple people who insisted he had secret sins he needed to confess (to them!!!!hahahahaha) but not at all supportive of me for some reason. It was just a horrible horrible time. Our GP - who loved us - was amazed that I didn't walk away from all of it. Seriously. But how could I? I loved my family. I wanted them better - how would leaving improve anything? Sure, it was tempting to run away but I knew it wouldn't solve anything.

The item will now be banish for all time or until you perform the Ritual on a different item after you have forgotten about the first, whereupon the first Banished item will promptly make itself known again.

No idea why this hasn't been patched yet tbh."

I searched EVERYWHERE for this BBQ sauce I KNOW I squeezed into a dish. I checked the bathroom, my computer desk, the oven, the cabinets, the dishwasher.

[**1996 Leonardo DiCaprio**](http://i.imgur.com/VLurBOB.jpg). This, was Leo in his prime. There's just something about the way his blond tresses flop about his face that make my heart skip a beat. His middle part pairs perfectly with his sharp jawline, uniting in harmony to create his signature youthful aura. 1996 Leo is the reason I wake up every morning; he's my rock, my anchor, my sword, my shield.. He's keeps me going when the going gets tough. He's breathes life into me. Leo..

I remember when I first laid eyes on him. Romeo and Juliet (1996). The film was very strange: placing the words of Shakespeare into a modern world. But no matter how much I wanted to walk away, my eyes were glued to him. Every second he was on screen my heart bloomed with an unimaginable amount of joy. I was enthralled by the way the tough Shakespearean language rolled of his tongue like honey. I had never been the type to cry over works of fiction, but seeing this sweet pea [cry on-screen brought](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0a/cc/63/0acc63eb663b1d99dddb8ed48301f647.gif) upon waterworks of my own, I must admit. He released emotions inside of me that knew not were possible.

 If I did anything right in my life, it was when I gave my heart to him. You never know how much you love someone, until you watch them give their heart to someone else. But, that's true love isn't it? We fall in love with people we can't always have. We just have to love, without expecting anything in return. And when you think about it, it's actually quite brave to be able to love unconditionally. It takes a lot because we don't want to fall on our faces or leave ourselves vulnerable to pain. "

"I don't think it's much of a problem if you live and work in the US, but if you're living and working in another country, you still have to file taxes with the IRS even though you'll most likely never owe them money since your domestic taxes are probably higher. A lot of dual citizens who never worked or lived in the US on their own volition (i.e. were born there and moved away as infants, and didn't even have American parents) didn't realize that they needed to file American taxes when they got older, and were threatened with massive fines as a result. America coerced other countries into handing over private banking information so that they could hunt these people down. It was all done under the guise of punishing tax evaders, when in reality the vast majority of people owed nothing because countries like Canada are not tax havens. 

Renouncing US citizenship is also a circus act that is made to be artificially difficult and expensive to try and dissuade people from leaving."

"I understand your point. Growing up I lived in a duplex. My family was poor. My dad refused to file for food stamps or welfare despite us being very poor. He worked hard, and provided what he could. 

My next door neighbors were a couple not legally married with 3 kids in a 2 bedroom duplex. Neither worked, they stayed single because they got more hand outs than they would if they were married. They had no ambition whatsoever to get a job and were very content living on government hand outs. 

That sucks. They shouldn't do that. While they are getting help from tax payers they should be actively working to better themselves. 

This is why people are against it. 

What you don't see is that as an adult when I was laid off work I was able to get unemployment, with that money was able to devote myself to finding another job rather than settling for a McDonald's job. If I had not gotten that hand out I would be trapped in a minimum wage job that couldn't have paid for my home let alone vehicle. I would have ended up losing everything I owned and becoming another minimum wage leech on the system. 

I have seen single mothers working full time that desperately need that extra income from those hand outs to provide for her children. And those kids damn sure deserve to be able to eat and go to school just as much as any other kid. It is not their fault their dad ran out on them, or was killed in Iraq. 

When you take away these programs you might get a few dead beats off uncle sams tit. But you are stealing futures away from a lot of honest and good people as well. I'm ok with a few deadbeats living that life if it means we as a society get to help those good people. "

"Anything Sony Playstation, but *particularly* the PS Vita.

I got it during the PS3's run. It had a painfully small selection of games, most of which were trash. The selection of games that you could ""remote play"" was also ridiculously small. I hear that many more PS4 games support it, but Vita was so out the door for me by the time PS4 came around...

To be honest, my experience with the PS Vita, PS3, and Sony's customer service back then is why I left console gaming. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I tried a free trial of their ""Music Unlimited"" service on my Vita. When the free trial ran out, it took my card information from my PSN account and charged me. Number *ONE*, I was never told that Music Unlimited was linked to the PSN... It never said it anywhere. Thus, number *TWO*, I did *not* know that they would be charging me at the end of my trial - if for no other reason than I *never gave the app my card information*.

When I saw the charges, I called my bank thinking it was fraud, that someone had stolen my information. When the payment was cancelled, Sony locked my account. I called Sony and everything was made clear to me... They were holding my account ransom until I paid for the Music Unlimited that I never agreed to pay for. 

To this day, my PSN account is locked. IDGAF though. Sold all my Sony consoles and moved on to PC gaming. Best decision I ever made.

"It's partial guesswork but it's more that they use vague blanket statements that could (and typically do) apply to most people, even if only slightly. Most people go there hoping to be dazzled and so they get lost in the moment and buy into it without applying even a slight bit of skepticism. 

Even looking at the list of questions OP posted - divorce, stuck in a rut, someone close to them either sick or battling addiction, etc. -  how many of those do you think would apply to the average person? Now think about the kind of person who goes to see a fortune teller - it's typically a person who is facing some kind of difficult decision or hardship and they are hoping for answers about their future."

"Yay I have a good one. 

Early 90s we lived in a nice neighborhood, but the majority of our neighbors were elderly or middle age - hardly anyone had children, and then my parents moved in. 


I have bio siblings and foster siblings - 9 of us in total. 


My sister, brother and I decided we wanted to build a fort in the woods behind our house. So, dad helped up build a makeshift fort to play in, they could see us from the house etc. 


One of our neighbors, however, hated children. She hated everything to do with children, and being a strong religious woman, she viewed all children as the spawns of Satan himself. 


If we had any fun, she'd come and complain to our parents. If we rode our bikes on the street outside her house - she'd call the cops to report that we weren't in school. 


We were home schooled. It was PE basically. 


Finally, she realized we had the fort. One day, we went to Sunday school and when we came back she had torn the fort down. All the little treasures we kept there were missing, and the children's bibles we'd forgotten the day before were torn apart and stepped on. 


We never rebuilt the fort. 


The foster siblings eventually went back to her mother - and we had to move out of the house. Before we did, my sister and I went and stole all her lawn gnomes (with parental approval I might add lol) and threw them into the now overgrown woods, where our fort used to be. 


Bitch can go choke on a ditch, she did everything to make our childhood there awful.

"I'm oddly obsessed with documentaries about plane crashes so over a few years, I've kept a bunch of safety tips in the back of my brain for just in case.

Note: the chance of you dying in a plane crash is 1 in 11 million, but that usually doesn't ease my plane-weary friends' minds.

1) remember the ""plus 3, minus 8"" rule. 80% of plane crashes occur within the first 3 minutes and last 8 minutes of flight, so remain extra alert with your shoes on during this time.

2) If you are at an emergency exit, or if there's someone at the emergency exit in panic, just tell them the #1 rule to push the door OUT don't pull the door in, that blocks the exit and actually proved fatal in British Airtours Flight 28M where 55 people died due to panic and two of four exits being blocked.

3) Don't panic. It really does kill people.

4) On top of knowing where the closest emergency exit is, try to count how many seats are between you and the exit in case it's too dark for you to see (there are emergency lights, however)

5) If you have access to blankets, or any padding material, hell, even your jacket and you are aware of your crash landing, try to wrap yourself in it or create some sort of padding between you and the chair in front of you. It even saved a man's life when he survived the crash landing and blocked himself with the padding as a flame came near him.

6) Wear 100% cotton fabric. Synthetic fabrics can melt and fuse to your skin, causing nasty burns and the fabric has to be surgically removed from your skin if you make it to a hospital

7) Even though statistically, there aren't seats that are particularly safer than others (planes can crash on their fronts and backs), sitting within 5 rows of an emergency exit is safer (less time needed to get to the emergency exit), and the back has less fatalities overall than the front. I would pay more attention to sitting within 5 rows of an emergency exit, however.

8) Never inflate a life vest inside the plane. If the water rises, you can be trapped inside the sinking plane instead of being able to swim out the emergency exit to safety.

9) LISTEN TO THE SAFETY VIDEO/INSTRUCTIONS. It really tells you everything else that you need to know to be safe. "

"Just had to deal with one of these. I met him--we'll call him Tom--through a social/sports/beer league for young professionals in New Jersey. He was on my team along with a few other people (guys and girls). He seemed like a normal, reasonable guy at first. While I could tell that he may have been into me a little bit, I tried to ignore it/shrug it off, especially since I was interested in another person on our team--we'll call him Josh. 

Our team did really well, and we started to all make plans to hang out outside of team events, usually at Josh's place. At these, Tom would get a little aggressive and a little too flirtatious, which I would try to tone down with sarcasm and dismissal. Eventually, on Snapchat, Tom started drunkenly sending me messages that he thought I was sexy, that he wanted me to come over and hang out. I told him that I only saw him as a friend/drinking buddy. He kept pushing me to come over, and I said no.

The following day, he apologized and told me that he was drunk and that he didn't mean it like that, and that he was going to not try anything. When our group started hanging out again, however, he got flirtatious again. I went so far as to flirting with Josh in front of Tom to get my point across. At that point, I thought Tom would get the hint.

Fast forward about six weeks. Tom and I are texting and things seem to be friendly...until he makes a joke about ""Coming to your place now btw (tongue out emoji)"" and he asked me where I lived. I told him that I wouldn't help him and that I was serious about us being friends. Tom responds with: 

""Not even a kiss? I don't think it's a secret that I'm kinda into you lol."" 

After telling him that he's as subtle as our current president and that I really only see him as a friend and that my feelings on that weren't going to change, he kept trying to push it. (""I mean, not to push but that might just be the situations we've huung out in. And a kiss/make it [sic] sesh can change everything."")

Needless to say, we don't talk that much anymore, though I still see the rest of our group/Josh from time to time."

I would never do something like that and wonder how anyone could spend all day talking about themselves.

"The getting out of hand part is really regrettable, because I believe that there *are* certain questions in the interaction of cultures that are worth talking about, but when you try to address them, you get lumped in with either extreme.

Or that maybe ""Washington Redskins"" isn't that cool of a name?

But, on the other hand, also acknowledge that practice of Yoga is something that India actively wants to spread across the world, that I as a German get flattered when some small town in Washington (Leavenworth) styles itself after a German alpine village.

I think the important distinction is: Are you coming from a place of respect, or are you looking for a cheap shot at the other culture's expense?

I think with respect as the yardstick, it becomes pretty easy to tell the difference between blackface, redskins, Yoga and a Japanese tea ceremony."

Dan and I were looking down at the deflated blimp discussing how we intended to inflate it and set everything else up.

And these modules are, of course, designed to hypermodulate the virtual spang interactions of vector-divorced quanticules. 

So while no force in the universe can actually inhibit quantum fields, the fields _appear_ inhibited on older analog Metzinger screens due to the spang smearing across the 1337 to 8008132 mKev spectrum.

"I worked at the Ropes Course at a Summer Camp some years ago. One day I was running the zip line. My coworkers checked the kids' safety gear, clipped them in, and sent them up to me, on the platform.   
Once they got on the platform with me, I switched their safety gear, calmed them down if they needed it, and then, when they were ready, unhooked the final extra saftey line and let them zip.  
  
One day a girl I knew (she was on my bus route) came to the tower when I was working. She, like many of the other kids, looked very scared. As I went through my routine of changing the saftey lines, explaining what i was doing and how it kept her safe, I asked her how she felt. I will never forget her answer.  
&gt;I feel like when I was in the hospital.  
  
That was not the answer I was expecting. I didn't see how, in this beautiful outdoor place, with a breeze and an amazing view, she could feel like she was in a hospital. So I asked her why.  
  
She told me that when she was younger, she'd been really sick with Leukemia. The doctors and her parents thought she might die. She was scared then. She was scared now. *That's* how being on the zipline tower made her feel like when she was in the hospital.  
  
I have to admit, I was shocked. I'd met her mother and siblings, and, suddenly knowing a little bit of what they'd been through was astounding. I was *so* glad she'd made it, and was up there on the tower with me.  
  
I took some time with her. I acknowledged how terrifying her hospital experience must have been. I then did one of my tricks where I got her attention off the fact that she was on a high tower by pointing out exciting rocks, trees, and landmarks on the opposite mountain top. Once her breathing was normal, I went over all the saftey measures in place, what she'd experience once she jumped off the zipline, and how there was no way she would die. It was scary. I told her I was afraid to jump off my first time. But it was fun.   
Like always, I gave her a choice. If she didn't want to go down the zipline, I could send her back down the tower she'd climbed up. But she was ready. She faced her fear and lept off that tower! I was so proud.    
I also gave her mom an extra hug and told her how brave her kid had been when I dropped her off that afternoon :)
  
**TLDR: Eight year old girl was equally afraid of jumping off zipline tower as she had been of dying of cancer (she came close), but she jumped anyway.**  "

That's the body doing what it's fucking designed to do, I don't get why guys are so grossed out about it.

And how is this at all like anal in any way? What do you expect to be on your dick when you put it in someone's ass, exactly? It's actually totally acceptable to say ""all men should be ok with getting shit on their dick during anal"" because it's FUCKING ANAL.

Wasn't really creepy but it scared the hell out of me. Just for reference I have pretty bad adhd. I was just driving down the road and my mind just drifted which is completely out of my control. As I was driving I happen to look up and realize it's a red light but it was too late to stop before it. I slam on my brakes and turn sideways with the flow of the traffic and fit perfectly between two cars. I somehow didn't hit anyone and just kept driving. I immediately pulled into an adjacent parking lot and had to rethink my life. I'm not a bad driver but it just happened and there wasn't shit I could do about it. I haven't had any bad experiences since then. Luckily I've found a way to keep my mind occupied so I don't zone out. That experience really hit home how dangerous motor vehicles actually are and how you can't get distracted by anything else except driving in a safe and controlled manner.

I somehow managed to convince my very confused mother to bring me to see the play where I figured out his last name. I looked him up on Bebo and sent him a message saying ""u wer so gud in ur skwl play lol im 12 btw lol"". Shockingly, he never replied."

"It was really hard to deal with. I saw the bodies being taken from the house. My parents were a 6 hour drive away, so I was alone for the immediate aftermath. The police saw how distressed I was and called my parents, my parents cut their trip short but the police didn't want to leave me alone until my parents got back. They agreed to take me to my aunt's house for the night.

"&gt; so if someone has extensive knowledge of Irish history and its modern day effects they can claim to be Irish? I don't think a prerequisite that has to be started with ""without googling it"" can really count as a metric of defining anything.

They didn't say that. They said that someone who claims to be Irish should have some kind of a basic understanding of Irish history, which is completely correct. I do not understand how you can possibly claim to be Irish if you know bugger all about the country.

"What you're saying is 100% technically accurate, but reality is a little less black and white. 

Most of my friends/girlfriends in college had waiter/waitress/bartender jobs. 

Yes, they were guaranteed minimum wage by their employer if they did not meet or exceed minimum wage with their tips. However, in the real world, if a waitress did not meet minimum wage with her tips (and then requested it from the owner of the restaurant) she would ""mysteriously"" find her hours cut next week. And the weeks after that her hours would be cut even more, until she finally would just quit and get a different job. 

Now, of course she *could* call the labor department or whoever and file a complaint, and possibly get compensated. But again, in reality it's very difficult to prove this kind of thing so it's very rare that it happens. 

All that being said though... I'm not really against tips. Some of my college friends made *huge* money bar tending that I could have never made with my crap fast food job. I'm talking about paying their rent with one night of work kind of money. 

Of course, you're not going to make that working at IHOP or something. You need a good waiter/bar tending gig. "

Finally someone saw their dog out and about and was upset. Sued him and won. The judge gave the guy the minimum he could get away with but the vet still had to pay lawyer fess and stuff. Nearly broke him. He said he would still have done it again."

"I think women genuinely have no conception of how little affection there is available to guys in this life, compared to how strongly we desire it and often work toward it. And yet most of the time we still wind up with none.

In my experience, women who are presented with evidence of this situation just respond instinctively that it can't be true, because they simply can't imagine what it's like to live in a world where affection is scarce. They spend most of their lives fighting off expressions of affection (many of them clumsy or even threatening) — so the idea of a affection being in short supply just sounds unbelievable to them, like a planet where gravity works in reverse or something.

Considering how the population is majorly overweight, the human population could probably double or triple before needing to start worrying about rationing out the food.

I was having a hard time getting a hold on it so I decided to use a pocket knife, stab it in and pry it up. That was the (not well thought out) plan anyway. Well, this pocket knife had a broken safety catch. So, after much effort (probably 20+ minutes of trying and failing) when I went to turn it over, it somehow closed on my pointer finger, slicing down to the bone. 

As I sat lamenting my stupidity, I had a thought. Maybe I could use pliers? Went outside and was able to grab the epoxy and pry it out in about two seconds. 

I still have a very faint scar that is a reminder of my stupidity. 

Tldr: almost cut off the tip of my finger with very dull, broken knife "

"""I only date white people."" Well fuck."
"I've lived in Damascus from since I was born until 2016 when I moved to the US (legally, by greencard and plane). So my anecdote is between 1997-2016.

Look, to put it bluntly, it takes extraordinary conditions for a person to sell everything, and travel to a country he doesn't speak its language on an illegal boat. ***This is how bad the country has become.***

Day-to-day life in the safest area of Syria: Damascus. Water is still cheap. The architecture is untouched. But everyone feels worn-out and depressed. No one can afford shit. There are so many mortar shells and firefights happening in Damascus that it doesn't break conversations. Old neighborhoods in Syria can expect a few mortar shells falling on them per week. The most upscale areas such as al-Hamra can expect 1 mortar shell falling per month, a safety feature!

This once cheap, communist country now has an economy worse than living minimum wage in California (Source, I've lived alone on minimum wage in California). Walking in the street, I have sighted only 3 infants between 2011 and 2016. No one is dumb enough to raise children.

Power cuts before the war were unheard of, now in 2017 electricity is available 1 third of the day in upscale areas, and a few hours per week everywhere else. Most people have bought expensive gas generators and car batteries to extend electricity time.

The air in Syria has never been clean, but since around 2013 there's been this *thick, murky brown dust* everywhere. It's smells like spring season except it's all year long. There's no sand nearby where I lived so I assume it comes from the mortar shells or wreckage of nearby destroyed towns. Locals confirm the dust when I bring it up but no journalist has brought it up so it could just be my imagination.

Because of UN restrictions: 1- Freelancing and shopping online is illegal.

2- The only foreign money transactions acceptable is through Western Union where they take around 10%, practically a ripoff. 

3- Foreign currency such as dollars, credit cards, and debit cards are country-wide illegal. Paradoxically, you can grab USDs from any bank. However, the Syrian Pound is plummeting so it would be retarded to keep your savings in SP. To exchange between SP and USD fairly, you shouldn't use banks. You need to have connections to the black market. I used to ask my neighbor, I don't know to where he would pass my cash. Even google can't get the right exchange rate between SP and Dollars. [WRONG (1 USD=214 SP)](https://www.google.com/search?q=syria+dollar&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS723US723&amp;oq=syria+dollar&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.5607j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). [RIGHT (1 USD=535 SP)](https://sp-today.com/en/).

The least insane way to travel between cities would be to take the scheduled public bus. Normally, it would have been a 3 hour drive between Damascus and Hama, but you can encounter between 0 to 12 hours of stops at military checkpoints. And the safest route changes daily, you need to ask locals frequently.

In 2015, I took a bus trip where I traveled from Damascus, though Homs, to Hama and back. Those public Bus trips are also mandated to transport armed military personnel (I think they're the main method of travel too for those personnel, fuck civilian safety). The buildings and the road we drove in were still intact [unlike google image search results](https://www.google.com/search?q=&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=rimg:CXl17FT6n5wXIjjUZC0LLze3oeiINimO44LpToHRdFpMC7iIYnOGsaEyF834EVgllt4W_1VarVkxvhcjIeE2YDvTuoyoSCdRkLQsvN7ehEfW3S27Ghsu9KhIJ6Ig2KY7jgukRJtI56BdUBqQqEglOgdF0WkwLuBFkD0w25RBEVyoSCYhic4axoTIXEVayG_1ZoS7udKhIJzfgRWCWW3hYR4tltftlBcasqEgn9VqtWTG-FyBF1E3FefwWi0yoSCch4TZgO9O6jEafiWaxbP5oZ&amp;tbo=u&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlivW-uZLVAhWX8oMKHVtbAbIQ9C8IHw&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=794&amp;dpr=1#imgdii=C_2Q9gYvc-vvzM:&amp;imgrc=RxQx-NEI8PVWEM:), but the buildings and the signs literally looked like swisscheese with how many bullet holes they had. The speeding bus I was in, and the military checkpoints were the only signs of life on the road. I was on edge for the entire bus trip and it was the scariest experience of my life. In case you're curious, a deafening mortar shell fell around 500 feet across from my bus and the driver then sped to the max.

Final score: **PTSD/10**. Would not go back to Damascus ever, ever, ever! Even if the war is over.

But, if you decide to go. [This is a source I can confirm for the correct cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Damascus) (Spoiler: 1 bedroom rent is $185, and average wage is $110).

"**I was struck by lightining a few years ago**, but not directly. I think I experienced this, allthough I did not have a lot of time to react.

**Story:**

I was sitting in a chair by my window and reading a book. (The power was out due to the thunderstorm and I wanted to get some light) 

I got a shiver through my whole body, and felt my hair moving. Then it felt like I was stung by a bee in my leg.

And then everything went white and my ears were ringing.
Everything hurt like hell and I could feel my whole body cramping and my vision went blurry then black.
When my vision came back and I could move again I realised that I was on the floor about a meter from the chair.
My skin was red all over and my fingers and feet were burned.

I think it struck the radiator which was behind my chair directly underneath the window, then jumped to me.

It took about a month for my body to stop hurting, except for my knee which still hurts today (about 6 years later). (Doctors gave up on trying to figure out why about 4 years ago)

Didn't get any cool scars though"

"The original Ghost Recon had you fill 2-3 squads with 6 maximum soldiers. Soldiers were restricted to their class, so depending on the mission at hand, you might not need a sniper, so your snipers would sit out that mission. Whoever you selected, and successfully finished a mission with, would get a stat boost.

If a character was killed in a mission, they were dead to you *for the rest of the campaign*. (Of course, you could quicksave missions, so going back and trying again without losing anyone was always possible). After a mission where you lost a soldier, the game would give you a new soldier to fill that slot, so you would never have to be a man down on future missions.

Some of the soldiers were ""generic"" with basic stats. Losing them in a mission was no big deal. However, completing bonus objectives would reward you with specialist soldiers, who had boosted stats/weaponry. Many time in missions, if I lost a specialist, I would have to restart the mission. The specialists were too valuable not to have for the rest of the campaign!

Oh, and none of that applied to multiplayer, of course. Just the campaign."

'55% of 300' is really just '55* 1/100 * 300'.

"Conservative Christian here (Primarily Billy Graham and Lee Strobel-inspired)--Joel Osteen terrifies me.

As others have said, he preaches a style of Christianity known as the ""Prosperity Gospel."" God rewards the faithful, in material wealth, is what it boils down to.

This is antithetical to Christianity. Jesus told his followers to give up everything they had, or at least be willing to do so, in order to follow Him.

Scripture says that the faithful can expect persecution in this world, for following the teachings of Christ.  John 15:18-- ""If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.""

When I look at Osteen, the first thing I think of is Matthew 7:21-23-- 
""“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter. Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name perform many miracles?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me you who practice lawlessness.’”

"Well, at the time of release, Jim Carrey was 36. If we take that as his age, and account for leap years and the fact that his in the womb was broadcast, then he spent 322,150.5 hours on camera.

Assuming he earned $5 an hour, that's $1,771,825. If someone wants to backrate it for interest, feel free. I'm on mobile. It'll be a lot, and the years range from 1962 to 1998.

More likely, he's not getting shit, because he was considered the legal child of the company, and parents can live stream their kids lives if they want. And also he will get quickly murdered by a crazed fan.

He'll probably get civil damages for the attempted murder though."

 What she did initially was to ask a few local travel agents to find her cheap cancellations, gave them a max price, and they'd ring her with a few options. Then she'd choose and away she'd go. 

Later she realised that she could just go to the nearby airport and ask at a suitable desk(s) and then take it from there. She preferred this option because it added to the excitement that she had no idea where she would be going until the last moment. Or even if she'd be going at all.

Going to the airport was also cheaper because the travel agents were putting a bit extra on top for their work etc. 

I have absolutely no idea if you can do that now, though. My best advice is contact your local airport."

"On behalf of my mom. It was her first time teaching and she was a long term sub for a middle school science teacher at a catholic school. 

1. She was teaching them about cell division and was drawing diagrams on the board. The las stage is two cells completely divided so she drew two big circles with dark nuclei. (.)(.). All the boys started laughing and of course, my mom didn't understand why. A quiet girl finally spoke up and said "" you drew a pair of boobies on the board.""
2. Still on the topics of cells. The class was doing an experiment on looking at cells in the microscope and she instructed the class to wipe their cheeks with the cotton swap. You can imagine how the 6th grade boys took that phrasing. 
3. Everyone wiped their cheeks (both sets) and now had to look at the cells under the microscope. My mom was helping the groups focus their microscopes and one group of boys kept calling her over. She went over and would adjust it and leave. A minute later she'd be called right back over, the microscope would be out of focus, and she'd have to re-adjust it. After the third time of leaning over and adjusting the microscope, she goes ""I don't get it boys. Why can't you see this."" To which a boy responds ""Oh we see it Ms. We see it real good."" That's when it clicks and my mom realizes they've been looking down her shirt the whole time. 

This all took place in the 6 weeks she was a sub. For some reason she decided to continue teaching. "

Now I know that there some Rambo types out there but as hard as I tried I couldn't look down the barrel of that pistol-My eyes kept closing and it was hard to look straight at her face. I said , "" I think you could but I wish you wouldn't"". She looked at me for a second then turned and emptied the gun by shooting up the room. 10 seconds later I was in my car and down the road.

I set it all up and get into the tent, hear someone run by, which really creeped me out, too much to bother looking for what was most likely someone who'd stolen my shit outside. After a few minutes I went outside, to find my stuff was all there, which was kind of surprising to me, but, whatever, carry on.

Then, I finally decide to start fishing. I open my tackle box and find that all of my hooks are missing, and my knife. Only thing left was my pliers. Freaked me the hell out, why'd he return the box and why steal my hooks? Well, I find out in the morning when I walk outside to my tent and there's 4 fish hanging from a tree branch with hooks in their mouths and hooks all over stuck in their bodies and my knife stabbed into the dirt. And, the old man walks by again and just stares at me while he walks by. I was too confused to talk. "

"General rule in the BDSM scene is to carry three signs when you are looking for a partner, but honestly that is overkill.

Don't call people out unless you are interested in socializing with them about the BDSM scene. Its not cute or funny.

If you are interested in learning about BDSM and getting involved socially, please make a Fetlife account and look for brunches in your nearest city. Go to a saturday brunch, chat with people, network, and learn where the local clubs are. Learn what your local laws are. The clubs are a ""safe space"" where there are too many eyes around to really get away with a crime.

Older club organizers are there to help ""guide"" you and teach you the rules. Follow the rules very thoroughly, and if you are unsure, it is better to back off and seek clarification than to proceed.

2. Heavy, cuff like clothing. A thick leather bracelet with a triskelion pressed into it is a popular purchase at BDSM conventions.

3. Unusual collars. Hard, metal loops around the neck are popular, like [this one](https://img1.etsystatic.com/144/0/9398844/il_340x270.1131940727_e2o3.jpg). Heavy leather collars are less popular, because they became super obvious after the goth stuff went out of style.

4. Handcuff motifs in clothing or jewelry. 

5. Black handkerchiefs in specific urban scenes (LA and NYC). 

6. Thematic motifs from the ""[Story of O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_O)"", an old erotic novel. Few people have read it, but the ideas get copied over and over again. Stylized letter ""O"" is very popular for various reasons."

"This depends entirely on the animal's behavior.

If the dog is holding its ground and just barking at you without being aggressive, it may be afraid rather than  about to attack.

I saw a dog off leash on a dirt road in Maine, and when I tried to approach it it began barking and holding its ground. I stood there for a minute staring at him, and when he did not come at me, I crouched to let it know I was not going to be a threat to him, and held out my arms. He wagged his tail and walked over, which gave me the chance to get a look at his address. Staring a dog in the eye is an aggressive behavior, and may trigger an attack.

If you're unsure or uncomfortable around a dog, backing away slowly is still the best option."

We went and the food sucked and I hated just being there knowing, as I did, that better food was elsewhere.  But my roommate had said ""Come to Olive Garden with me.  I have gift cards.""  And then, when the bill came, she paid her portion with the gift cards and told me what cash I needed to give to cover my portion. 
That sucked.

"I, a bald skinny guy with a red beard, was at a bar desperately trying to get the bartender's attention, and there was another skinny guy next to me who also had a bald head and red beard. 

I joked that the bartender was prejudiced against our people and we immediately became friends. 

A third bald guy with a red beard showed up and we welcomed him into our bald ginger cult. 

He ended up buying me a drink over our bond of bald heads and red beards, and it was the best drink."

"Years ago I was working the help desk for a govt. agency. One morning my boss walks in and says ""Finum, I need you to go to Mr. UhOh's desk, get his PC and bring it back here."" I had always gotten along with and had a rapport with Mr. UhOh so it seemed quite odd and my imagination ran wild as I went to Mr. Uhoh's office to grab his stuff.

Fortunately, Mr. UhOh was not in his office so no conversation or potential confrontation was required. I grabbed the PC and slunk out.

Upon my return my boss says ""Finum, take Mr. UhOh's PC to the bench and search the hard drive for any and all sexual content. Any sexual content you find should be put on a CD and turned over to me. You are not to discuss this with anyone.""

That was a bit jaw-dropping but I cannot pretend I was not intrigued and maybe even a little giddy at the prospect of being Inspector Finum. So I began my search...

It turns out that in addition to all manner of graphic pornography, that the very married Mr. UhOh had been saving AOL Messenger transcripts of chats he had been having with a married female colleague. These were not ooh-baby-do-me-hard-I'm-so-wet kinds of exchanges either. They were pegging-scat-multiple-partner-watersports extravaganzas; foul and dark. 

I did my bidding and turned over the evidence. Mr. UhOh continued to work there for the remainder of my time there. I tried not to act differently around him and the ""colleague"" but I think our rapport suffered.

I do not want to know those things about anyone!

Hey now
"""You could ski the rest of your life and you'd still not be as good as me."" - ~~elementary~~ ~~middle~~ high school bully.  


I loved skiing.  I really did.  I started at about 14 years old.  None of my family skiied so it was hard for a kid to get into, but my high school had a program where they would take kids on Friday after school for night skiing.  I am a nerd.  Not coordinated or athletic and even less so thirty years ago.  But something resonated with me and skiing.  I have an affinity for open spaces to begin with (less likely to get randomly attacked than say a crowded hallway in school I suppose).  But it was something else.  I would DREAM of skiing when I was done.  I would wake myself up making turns in my sleep.  It was mine and it didn't matter how good I was.  

So when failed backup, high school quarterback noticed that I was excited to go when we were on the bus, he did his best to crush that spark.  What is wrong with people like this?  I have no idea.  But either way, he rode me about it.  I kept to myself, but he would seek me out and harass me.  When he uttered his infamous line (which shouldn't even stand out with all the mean shit he said or the beatings I took), I decided that couldn't be right.  

Today, I ski 30-40 days in a typical year at the very best mountains in North America.  There are plenty of people better than me still, but I love it very much.  Also, I rip!  I drop cliffs and seek out the steepest terrain.  I snorkel 4 feet of powder and get cheers from lifts.  

I don't know much about my former nemesis. . . I moved out west and he still lives in NJ working as a gym teacher at the old high school.  But no matter how much he skis, there is no way he is better than me - on skis or off.

"Read about that theory too! She was a widow in a time where widows were accused for all missing people on account of witchcraft. Her cousin was suposedly making a move on the throne. The emperor owned her big big money and had no way of paying her pack. She was not catholic, at a time where her rivals were pushing to remove non catholics from power in Hungaria. Her husband was dead, and she was mad rich. Thurzo's wife raided the castles to seize her shit and loot her jewelry collection as soon as the prosecutions began. All firsthand accounts are produced under torture. People from across various countries are repeating the exact same story to the word, which is suspiscious as fuck. It could be false, but it could definitely be a scheme. Erzebet was never allowed to speak for herself or get a trial. 

As much as I like the blood countess story, Ive played enough Crusader Kings to accept the political framing theory. She might have been an evil witch, but its very possible she was one slice of a powerful family that many members of the elite wanted gone for various reasons. The whole investigation was definitely pre-meditated by Thurzo, who started moving against her immediately as he was appointed palatine of Hungaria. The sad part of this, is that of this is true, she likely died after four years in a tower, with basically no idea of whats was actually going on."

Do you think that by saying ""man up,"" it sorta reinforces the stereotype that manliness = strength/tough-it-out-ness? I dunno, every time I hear the phrase ""man up,"" it seems to be used to enforce masculinity and tell men they're not being ""manly"" enough. 

I'm not saying this as a criticism, just a point of discussion...I'm not a guy, so it's really not my place to correct guys for the way they communicate with each other. Maybe I'm overthinking it. I just feel really awful when guys get told to ""man up"" because they aren't being masculine enough, it just seems so draconian.

"Will be buried, but whatever. 

I left the health care industry because it pays shit wages for the most difficult emotional and physical labor you can imagine. The turnover for CNAs and good baseline nursing staff in care homes was astronomical.

For every doctor or nurse with multiple higher degrees making bank, you have thousands upon thousands of women and men doing the absolute shittiest (literally shitty) janitorial grunt work - bathing people, dressing them, brushing their teeth, performing all personal hygiene, feeding them, helping them toilet/changing adult diapers, watching them all the time, making sure they don't wander or hurt themselves or others, and compassionately helping them deal with the fear and pain that comes along with much of the aging and dying process. 

As an added bonus (but for no extra compensation whatsoever), caregivers have to navigate a slippery emotional landscape that includes, but is not limited to, family members' issues with death/the grieving process; the fear, rage, and grief that patients generally feel as they work through dealing with their diminished capabilities, the death of spouses and relatives and old friends, and their own failing health or mental acuity; entitled family members who treat lower level caregivers with little to no respect; the caregivers' own feelings about their charges (which can run the gamut from deep love and affection to absolute hatred, but which all must be dealt with in a mature, responsible, professional way); the crazy family dynamics that usually click into play when sickness ravages a family; and handling communication between often stressed or mentally ill family members about their loved ones (low-level caregivers often become the flashpoint and the whipping boy for patients and patients' families who wouldn't ever attack doctors, but who feel justified taking out their complicated feelings on the people who do baseline caregiving).

And those people are being paid utterly shit wages in a ""pink ghetto"" position to take shitloads of abuse from higher-ups (attending docs and nurses) and to do harder work than most people would ever dream of being willing to perform, even for people they love (hence the outsourcing of said work). Burger flippers get paid more in some states, and the astronomical burnout rate among caregivers is understandable but horrifying.

It is impossible to overstate how difficult, exhausting, time-consuming, and frustrating that job is, and how little people are willing to pay to make sure that their mothers and fathers, disabled children, and aging/ailing relatives are well taken care of.

In my opinion, few things are more revealing about our priorities as a nation and culture than the crap wages we pay to our caregivers and teachers in this society. Dementia is skyrocketing and people are living way longer, and we have a massive crisis looming on the horizon."

"Unions have had a campaign waged against them by supply side economists for decades. What people failed to pay attention to is how people entered skilled trades. Through the unions you would gain access to apprenticeships, entry jobs, networking, job protection, field level pay negotiations to keep wages competetive with changing costs of living. All this was seen as costing companies too much money but what matters more to a population, short term profits for some shareholders or long term stability and institutional knowledge?   "

Ex-wife assumed that meant only for the week she had the higher income.  Nope.  Permanent.

I remember my mother saying that the ex-wife had a horrible, horrible lawyer.

"That being said though, what you call routine stuff, like prescription drugs, are not necessarily routine when you consider that demand for an individual medication is not always high, and it's not always possible for people who unfortunately end up with these diseases to afford them even if they budget. 
 
Do you think that just because someone has the misfortune of getting a chronic, progressive, disease like MS, which is not an emergency diagnosis, which they could theoretically still shop around for if options existed, should not have insurance to help cover those exorbitant expenses? It's not like there is a huge market for MS drugs that would allow multiple companies to compete and drive down prices. The select companies that make these drugs are still going to have to sink tons of resources into developing them. How are they going to recoup those investments? Keeping drug development in the hands of corporations would ensure that there is still an incentive to keep drug prices high in order to make money off their investments, and if we drop the IP protections, no one is going to want to invest in lifesaving drug development.

Saying that ""prescription drugs"" should be the price of a box of ibuprofen is ignorant of the huge range of lifesaving medications that people rely on, and the huge amount of resources that must be expended to develop them, and the sheer lack of demand and competition potential for specialized medications for rarer diseases. So, if you're going to get rid of IP laws, and give everyone free reign to produce whatever medication they're able to, who is going to invest in developing new drugs? Perhaps the government???

"Absolutely correct. I have seen it happen time and time again. The doctor orders another dose of morphine and tells the family that their mother/father/brothers respiratory system likely wont be able to handle the dose. Families (in my experience) universally want the final dose to be given even though they know what will happen because they realise that that is the kinder option. It is really easy for people to say that euthanasia is immoral or its not feasible until they are sitting listening to their mother beg them, through the tears, to take the pain away.  "

"My point isn't Belize specific. It's in all cases where victim blaming is rampant. 

The focus should be on the attacker. It is they who own the blame not the victim. 

If you are in a vulnerable state and another person sees you and their first thought is 'i can get away with mugging/physically attacking them/raping them/violating them' it is they who have the problem NOT the person who falls victim to them. 

That is the crux of what I am trying to get at. 

I say vulnerable state as this is what usually is used to place blame on the victim, as can be seen by OP, as they state multiple times everything they did ""right"" in an effort to stop people blaming them. Yet blame is still placed with them "

"I did emergency call handling for a few months whilst at University. I remember one night shift, a youngish female rang in, she had an Indian accent and was crying extensively to the point I couldn't actually figure out what was wrong. Eventually she managed to say ""they're going to kill me help me"" I asked who and she replied ""my parents, please help me"". We sent multiple units to her location who on arrival found her locked in a bathroom hysterical, and the parents calmly sat around their dining table where they began discussing the mental state of their daughter and expressing their concern with the officers. 
To this day I have a feeling she was being genuine and feared for her life in the moment she rang, I could just hear it in her voice, but it was ruled as a domestic and she was listed as a vulnerable person with mental health issues. I hope whatever happened, she is OK now. "

As I walked towards the bathroom, (the women happened to be on a table on the way to the bathroom) I told them in Filipino that if their food is so much better, go off and create your own international restaurant chain, shut up and stop bitching.

"It honestly didn't occur to me.  It was pure panic fighting, to be honest.  I didn't even scream, I was so scared.  By the time I realized he was attempting to rape me, I just started fighting back any way I could.  Believe me, it wasn't smooth - the punches were just crazy, flailing punches and one was lucky enough to get him in the eye.  Basically, I just fought back as best as possible; there was no rhyme or reason. In addition to the eye punch, I kicked him hard on the shin, I bit him on the arm, I ripped out a chunk of his hair, and I scratched him down his face - but none of it was planned or thought out.  And it's funny, but the only thing I remember going through my head the whole time was ""I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble, jesus, I'm in so much trouble...""

So it's about 2:45am and I'm sitting there in the jungle ""watching"" the protected are of the beach while reading Lord of the Rings, and all of a sudden a red dot pops up on my chest.

"A few years ago the pretty, blonde girlfriend of one of my neighbors was moping about because her cousin had just passed away.  She was particularly upset because his eyes had been donated after his death, and she was - I shit you not - miserable about the idea of him walking around heaven with no eyes."

"Yep, a girlfriend and I left a place really late one night also stood between our cars in the parking lot talking for awhile. Because there were several ways to access the lot (main driveway/sidewalk in front, with one of the directions obscured by a building corner, back entrance at far end, and an unlit alley on one side), I kept an eye on each entry point. 

A guy walked down the sidewalk and out of sight. Nothing unusual, didn't even seem to notice us.

A couple minutes later, he and another guy walked back in the opposite direction. They looked at us while they passed. I felt the hair on my neck prick up and made a comment to my girlfriend and said we should wrap up and say goodbye.

About 30 seconds after they passed by, they came back from the other direction with a THIRD guy, walked up into the parking lot, spread out about four yards apart, and began VERY quickly advancing on us. We jumped in our cars and damn near ran them over getting out of the lot.

I was dumb to have even stayed at all after I saw the second guy. We were literally seconds away from robbery, likely rape, possible car jacking, and good odds of murder or some serious incapacitating violence.

Do NOT ignore your gut. My life could've ended that night."

"My husband has been smoking weed for years, I consider him a weed veteran of some sort, he knows everything there is to know about weed. A few years before I met him, he was at a party and highly intoxicated and someone offered him some weed. As soon as he took a hit, he knew it wasn't real but being in the party mood, he continued to smoke it anyway. A few weeks later he's in the hospital on the verge of kidney failure. They spray harsh chemicals that shouldn't be anywhere near the human body on that K2 bullshit and there's people who actually smoke it willingly because it's ""safe"" for drug tests. 

He still experiences kidney pains till this day, I help him watch his diet and take supplements and natural herbs to reverse the damage the K2 did. He has a drs appointment next week and we're gonna see how his kidneys are doing, hopefully we hear good news. 

That fake shit really is nothing to play with. Anything man made vs something natural is just bad news."

"&gt; You can actually trade with other players for the premium currency.

The best part about this is that you don't need any IRL money to start, no actual capital other than time and willpower. It starts will selling something for like 20p (roughly worth $1.34), finding other parts for guns/frames/whatever and selling those for bits and pieces. 

It took me about 2 weeks to really get it going, but I would trade for the parts I needed to complete sets for stuff so I'd pay like 10p for a stock or something and I could turn around and sell the gun for 30p or so. Before I really quit playing, I ended up making about 100p a day just trading.

"Same!  I was there for a couple of days with friends on a Bern-Milan-Venice trip. We stopped into the metro outside of the train station and a woman came up to ""help"" us find our hostel on the map. She was so pushy about helping us buy our tickets at the machine and getting our money out. It made us really uncomfortable so we just told her thanks for the help, we're going to keep looking at the map. She walked over to 3-4 guys and kept gesturing towards us while they got angry with her. We booked it because we didn't want to get robbed. We decide to splurge on a taxi.

The train station was under construction so you couldn't walk out the door straight to the taxi stand- you had to go out the side door and around the building. We were walking around from the metro and ran into two guys sitting on the hood of a Citroen. ""Taxi? We're a taxi. 13 euros each (to our hostel)""   Friend 1 and I see the car isn't marked as a cab and who charges per person? We say no but Friend 2 (of Italian descent but doesn't speak it) insists on trying to talk with them. The guys keep talking to each other in Italian. After several minutes we manage to drag our friend away, get around the corner of the building and voila, the actual taxi stand with properly marked cabs. That's when Friend 2 pipes up that the guys had been deciding how much to charge us and that they couldn't say too much because then we'd know it was a scam and they're not a real cab. WTF you say you understood that much and you were still going to get into their car?!  Did not feel very secure in Milan. "

"Spoiling, generally, is a weird term. When I hear spoil I usually think of two things. First I think of parents or grandparents spoiling *kids*. So immediately it feels like I'm going to be infantilized. Also the motives for spoiling are often fucked up (something divorced parents do to kids in order to get the upper hand over another parent), and the outcome is usually raising a shitty kid. The other major connotation is being ""treated like a princess"". Which puts a woman on a pedestal, whether deserved or not, and no one wants to live on a pedestal. Or worse, a woman wants to be on a pedestal and feels entitled to these things.

I'm an adult woman who can by myself my own things. I want to be treated like an equal and with respect. I would appreciate a partner who occasionally surprises me with *thoughtful* gifts and someone I would enjoy surprising with thoughtful gifts in return. I don't want to be treated like a child. And my affection for someone cannot be bought. 

There's basically zero scenario where I'm going to be ""spoiled"" and also in a healthy mature stable relationship."

"I got a random message from a friend of a friend on Facebook. He said he had seen me comment on the mutual friend's post and thought I sounded really interesting, would I be interested in getting to know each other better? Sure, why not. 

We sent messages back and forth, discussing music, interests, ideas, and he seemed more and more excited the more he got to know me. Once he mentioned he was in a specific suburb, and I mentioned that a friend of mine was playing guitar at one of the bars in that suburb. Nice Guy found the bar and apparently had a great night listening to my friend play guitar - he told me later that he had waited his entire life to meet someone like me. 

He knew I had a boyfriend, but the few times we met up and chatted (we actually did have a lot in common), he kept dropping comments like, ""I have never met anyone like you"" and ""I've wanted to meet someone like you my entire life"" and ""Soooo, how are things with you and your boyfriend? You don't seem to have much in common with him."" Comments like this made those meet-ups a lot less fun, and so I put less effort in chatting with him. After about 2-3 months, when conversation had kind of run dry, I unfriended him. I figured he would move on with his life and turn his attention to someone who was single.

Two days after I unfriended him, he wrote an ENORMOUS message (longer than any message he had sent me before) about how *betrayed* he was that I had unfriended him, when he had gone to so much effort to get to know me, and how *hurt* he was that I had just *discarded* him like he was nothing.

I was 22 at the time, and I don't think I was aware of the term Nice Guy^TM. It wasn't until I was a little older and more worldier that I realised he was a text-book example of a Nice Guy^TM. I sometimes wonder if he'd ever realised how stupid and unreasonable his behaviour was.   "

Sometimes we wonder and stare off into the night sky at the stars, pondering what sorts of highly intelligent life is out there capable of marvelous things...capable of telepathy and other strange things that we consider impossible...yet we never wonder what mysteries lay on our own planet, at the deepest depths of our seas."

Guys brag with each other about sleeping with girls (so do many girls) and it raises their status in the group, right? Makes them look desirable or seem like they ""have game"" or what have you?

"I'm not sure if this counts since they were A. Not invited and B. Stayed for less than ten minutes, but I'll tell it anyway. 

My SO and I were having a lazy Sunday when my friend texted and mentioned he had left something in my apartment the night before. I say okay and ask him to let me know when he wants to head over. Instead he just shows up, his shitty ex-ish girlfriend in tow. They come in and my friend grabs his stuff, then starts showing the ex-ish around my apartment. Which would be fine if my SO hadn't just finished boning and there hadn't been underwear and bras and shit thrown all over the room like a sitcom. 

The weirdest part was when the ex-ish goes into my bathroom, climbs into my empty bathtub, and just sits there for a few minutes. For some reason, that's what really sticks with me: This random girl I barely know, casually just getting into my bathtub. Then they left. She didn't say and single word to me the entire time. So goddamn weird. "

"One thing that really stood out as a step of progress for me was when I stopped thinking about things I may have done/said that maybe were awkward and now have started to pay more attention to things that others have done/said that are somewhat awkward. Not in judging way, just in an observing way. It really shows you that nobody is 100% proficient in social skills all the time. It also makes you think about if you can even remember something someone did that was awkward a week ago. I sure can't and that's a very reassuring thing."

"I worked at a hotel, and was on the last day of my two-weeks notice. Hospitality is not my field at all and I had no intention of asking this employer for a reference so I was pretty apathetic about work that day.

We had this huge crew of old ladies come in on a last minute booking, some who had gotten rooms and some who were just going to chance it. Pretty fucking stupid of them if you ask me because we are a business class hotel and it was prime tourism season, two recipes for a fully booked building.

The first wave of them came in, some checked into their bookings and the rest were able to snag last minute rooms. They left. A few more bookings came in or were made, and checked in, and suddenly we were at 100% capacity.

THEN, like twenty more old bitties came in for their Saggy Tits reunion or something, asking, nay, demanding that we give them a room for the next few nights. I told them we were sold out, and they started hissing about how I was lying, I just gave their friends rooms, therefore we must have some left. I told them that it was the middle of the summer, that we were all booked up, and there was nothing I could do. They started screeching at me, demanding I call other hotels to arrange them rooms, demanding we put cots in their friends rooms, basically just yelling and being shitty humans and filling the whole lobby with their shrill stupid voices. I just stood there and let them get it out of their system for a while until one of them said ""Well, what ARE you going to do about our problem?""

I said, ""I'm a guest services agent. None of you are guests. So, I'm not going to do anything at all.""

I left the desk and went into the back. Shortly after my coworker ended up having them escorted off the premises. We got a call from a sister hotel nearby later asking if 'we had promised them rooms at another property', because thats what they had told the other agent, and I just laughed and told them fuck no, have them fuck right off.

"My parents have been divorced since I was three, with my mom having custody and my dad having visitation. A couple years ago, my mom took him to court over child support (we believed he was claiming to make less than he did. He was claiming to make $23k a year, when the starting pay in his career is closer to $100k. He also lived in an apartment that was $1600 a month). At the same time, I was realizing my dad was emotionally abusive, and didn't want to see him anymore. My dad knew this, and got it ordered that my mom could not discuss the proceedings with me, nor could I go to court.


It was incredibly frustrating. I was dealing with a lot of bullshit at the time (we were effectively homeless, staying with my grandparents who don't get along with my mom) and I felt like I had no control over anything going on. I was pretty much constantly on the verge of a panic attack. I ended up finding out what was going on anyway by listening to my mom and grandma talk through the walls."
Child of Divorce and if parents would actually look out for what is best for their kids instead of trying to sabotage each other this world would be better.  I hope I am never a family court judge because I would insist on crazy stuff to get my point across and all children would have a court appointed lawyer that looked out for the kids not trying to get parents to agree to a deal.

"For some reason, this reminds me of something that happened to me several years ago, when I was working as a cashier. I was working at this thrift store, and one day, this woman in her early thirties came into the store with a big, three-ring binder. I was working the register closest to the front entrance, and no one was in my line at the time. She saw me and walked right toward me, and she immediately started detailing to me the specifics of a certain conspiracy that was going on in the town the store was located in. 

She opened her binder and began showing me all kinds of documents, printed out emails, lists of names, dates, addresses, and photographs. All of this evidence, as she described, proved the existence of a shadowy cabal of council members, business owners, and religious leaders in the community, who were operating a child sex trafficking and child pornography ring. This was long before the ""Pizza Gate"" thing that has been in the news, but I suppose these kinds of allegations have been around for decades. 

At any rate, after several minutes of this, I told her that I wasn't sure what she wanted me to do with this information, and to talk to a manager instead. At that point, she became suspicious, stating that she suspected that the owners and managers of this very store may be involved in the conspiracy. At that point, she left the store, and I never saw her again. 

Edit: Maybe there was a [kernel of truth](http://komonews.com/news/local/police-marysville-couple-plotted-to-rape-children) to what she was saying"

"At my University, the local Church of Scientology places brand spanking new copies of Dianetics in the free book exchange racks. I take them and unceremoniously throw them in the garbage, carefully concealing them so it's not clear that they're in there. I usually never do that sort of thing. I'm a nice and well-meaning fellow who doesn't protest or anything like that.  What's really fucked up is that I had to make a throwaway for this because there are a lot of high ranking scientologists in my family. What's fucked up is that I can't take the risk that someone would datamine my normal reddit username and draw a connection to my identity. It's not worth the risk to me.   That's sad. What's sadder is that having these people so close to me just drives me to do this all to more. I can't let other families end up like mine. "

When we were done in that hell hole and I came back home I talked to my friend from another unit, and casually brought the donkey story up, he said they had the exact same experience, down to the color of the donkey, checked up with friends from various units, sure enough, nearly everyone had the same experience, even ones that were much farther away."

I was in line at a very popular lgbt club in Dallas just a few months after coming out, turning twenty one, and kind of shedding my religion. The line is moving slowly, and a really handsome guy in front of me started talking to me. He was nice and attractive, but the line progressed and we split inside. Later, I run into Handsome Guy on the dance floor and we dance together for a half hour or so before leaving as last call hits. I give him my number. 

On the way home, he sent me a text whose wording I can't remember, but I know it made me think ""either creepy or cute..."". I went with cute, cus the attention was flattering, and it would be nice if he really filled the collected, mature, has - his - shit - together vibe he gave off. I didn't respond that night, though, couldn't think of anything to say. 

I woke up to 15+ messages ranging from ""good morning"" to asking me to move to his house in West Virginia, finally concluding that I may not be what he's looking for, given my lack of response.

I used to get 3 per day and they would always spoof their phone number so you can't block it. They don't care if you ask them to stop and the do not call list is useless. The only way is to remove all traces of your number from the internet and pretend they got the wrong number when they call. That won't work if your name is on your VM.   "

If you are in an emergency situation, nobody at 911 is going to ask you cutesy little coded questions. They need useful information quickly and they are trained to get it. We might ask you simplified yes or no questions, or even have you press a button to signify your answer if you can't speak, but no dispatcher is going to ask about black olives or anything else because **coded questions or concealed statements will lead to misunderstandings** and that is going to get someone killed. 

If you are in a situation where you can't speak openly, the dispatcher is trained to recognize that and work with you, just try to remain calm and avoid raising anyone's suspicion.

This shit is real) and wondered why they lost even more viewers. Ghost Hunters made them the joke of television, yet they kept pushing their old demographic away for whatever morons enjoy that shit now, which I'm assuming are vastly fewer than those enjoyed the older programming.

"For me and a lot of women I know it's about internalizing the idea that other girls are just a sexist stereotype and not real people.  So if you have an interest that is male dominated, the other girls are ""fake,"" if you see other girls wearing make up or dressing nice, it's because they're just slutty, or asking for it in some way, it being harassment. It's just misogyny, absorbed from the culture, and most women I know grow out of this in their early to mid 20s.  "

Nothing, because they get locked up at night, and the police return them to the construction company if they try to run away. 

You know what a sweatshop worker gets? Wages, often much higher wages than the local average. That means they can buy houses, clothes, food, entertainment, and so forth. How much purchasing power does an enslaved domestic servant in Dubai have? I bet it's not much, what with being locked inside the house and getting tortured by the owners.

"I agree.  This is one of those phrases that is good life advice, but a bad attitude for a manager to have regarding his subordinates.  A subordinate needs to be able to escalate a problem to his manager to get guidance on how the manager wants him to deal with a situation.  That's not to say the subordinate shouldn't try to also have a good idea of how he would handle the situation.  But telling your subordinates not to come to you with problems is a good way to get your subordinates to keep you out of the loop on important issues.  Then when you get blindsided with them coming up with a solution that's counter to what you would have told them to do, you (the manager) are the one at fault.  "

She once told me that she felt like she lived many lifetimes because she had just done so much. That was the one piece of advice I remember that she gave was to never stop trying things. They don't have to be expensive or elaborate, anything, just don't fall into the same pattern day after day or you'll lose huge blocks of time in retrospect.

"In all seriousness, probably around 25 or so. I know it tends to sound like bullshit when you're young, but from my own experience and those of my friends, it seems like there's a real, noticeable shift in the way your brain operates once you get around your mid-20s. That's supposed to be when puberty finishes for most people, and I think in many of us that completion manifests itself as a rather sudden realization that you just could not give less of a shit what other people think of you. From there you begin to focus on who you are as a person, independent of what you're expected to be. You still get annoyed, but you begin to stop taking things personally, which allows you to brush them off more easily. 

Though, be warned, mid-20s is also when most people have their first major existential crisis. That won't be any fun at all, but you'll get past it with time."

"That homosexuality is a choice and homophobia isn't.

I get that homophobia is a terrible thing, but for the sake of an argument lets assume that both homosexuality and homophobia are both inherited genetically, no nurture involved.  Out of the two of them, homophobia logically is more likely to be passed on.  A tribe that is completely homosexual will eventually die out, but a tribe that is completely homophobic is going to produce offspring.

Again, homophobia is a terrible thing, but in my mind when I see it in the wild I can't help but think maybe it's an evolutionary thing.  There's been studies into the genetics of homosexuality, but I wonder what the results would be if the same was applied to homophobia.

"The [Katyn Masacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katyn_massacre) is something most people don't even know about nowadays. Blokhin and Beria were both instrumental in the execution of this massacre. 

The massacre was prompted by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria's proposal to execute all captive members of the Polish officer corps and Blokhin, who was chief executioner of the NKVD, was carrying out those orders and reportedly killed over 7000 people himself over the course of 28 days. 

The executioners used German weapons rather than the standard Soviet revolvers, as the latter were said to offer too much recoil, which made shooting painful after the first dozen executions.

The total number of victims is believed to be around 22000. 

Those who died at Katyn included 

* soldiers (an admiral, two generals, 24 colonels, 79 lieutenant colonels, 258 majors, 654 captains, 17 naval captains, 85 privates, 3,420 non-commissioned officers, and seven chaplains),

*  200 pilots, government representatives and royalty (a prince, 43 officials),

*  and civilians (three landowners, 131 refugees, 20 university professors, 300 physicians; several hundred lawyers, engineers, and teachers; and more than 100 writers and journalists)

I figured if I was just super-nice enough to a girl, she'd fall for me. Then, when that didn't happen (because OF COURSE it didn't), I'd be like ""women are so strange and mysterious; who knows what they could possibly be thinking."" 

Yet, if some girl had approached me like: ""I know we just met, but I've decided I want to fulfill all of your emotional needs from now on. Cool?"" I'd have thought she was a psycho and ran away as fast as I could. Realizing that women and men might actually operate on the same plane of thought was a big eye-opener for me, and led to much better and more functional relationships. "

I had a bullying problem in 4th grade. The only advice my teacher gave was ""tell them to stop."" Sometimes, I got in trouble for asking for help.

I was bullied mercilessly in 8th grade. My family wrote to my teacher about this multiple times. We only had one conference discussing this. All other times, it was either verbal reprimands or nothing."

"When I was 16 I had a job at a fast food restaurant which was located next to a Video Ezy. There was this man that worked at Video Ezy that would come in to grab food on his break and a few times I was the person that served him. 


It started off innocent enough with general conversation if I was on break too or small talk while I was taking his order. Occasionally I would see him at work as well if I was renting a movie on the weekend and we became friends.


After two weeks he walked in while I was on break and said he had a gift, It was my birthday but I hadn't mentioned it, He handed me a cupcake which I accepted and thanked him. I asked him how he knew it was my birthday and he told me it comes up when scanning my video Ezy membership.


Another week went by and he showed up at my house, Knocking on the door and telling me he looked up my member info to get my address and phone number. This freaked me out and I started having a friend walk me to work because the guy would just show up and walk with me even if I asked him not too.


I finally got the courage to ask him to leave me alone because he creeped me out by following me everywhere I went and he told me I was his soul mate because I had a piece of him inside me, I questioned what he meant and he said he put his semen into the cupcake he gave me. 


I screamed and practically started crying as I ran home. I ended up having to call the police to make him leave me alone and my house mates would tell him I moved to New Zealand when he would show up again. 


It took 2 more weeks before he stopped showing up or texting me. 


Thankfully I haven't had any issues similar to this but it still haunts me when I see someone that almost looks like him or has a similar voice.

"In junior high, I was bullied by a kid named Marcus who oddly enough used to be a very sweet kid and even a childhood friend of mine. He would constantly harass me during our science class by whispering horrible things under his breath. We had assigned seats, so I was pretty much always within harassment range. I've always been rather thin, so his favorite insult was 'anorexic bitch'. I knew the school wouldn't do anything without substantial evidence (his bullying was entirely verbal and under the table, but he never laid a hand on me), so I was on my own.
One day, as class was letting out, he called me a bitch. Normally I'm very passive, so I just kind of brushed him off most of the time, but not that day. I'd had enough. I can't remember what I said exactly, but I ripped him a new one. His face was beet red, but he left me alone after that.

He failed a year of junior high, and later got expelled because he brought a weapon to school and threatened someone. He also got addicted to heroin at some point and overdosed on the side of the road. I think he's clean now and has a decent job, but he's 21 and has a kid with a teenage girl he's no longer with. I haven't spoken to him in years, but I really do hope he got his life together.

Now, I'm over forty and although I don't talk about gaming (since none of them seem interested), I don't keep it secret either. However, I was unaware that they all had essentially the same negative impression of what my life was like, because we were out one night and it was getting late but we were having fun, so I offered to bring everyone back to my place and keep the good times rolling. There was some reluctance, which was unsettling. I'm incredibly introverted and often have a hard time picking up on social cues. I remember thinking, 'Holy shit, they don't really like you! You just keep inviting yourself to stuff and they're too polite to tell you no one wants to hang out with you!' Literally my worst fear, apparently realized. Then one of them said something about not wanting to startle my parents and someone else said something about a basement, and it clicked. They thought I lived in my parents' basement. For no reason except that I still play video games. I took them home to essentially prove I owned my own house and had other interests, for crissakes,  but I really couldn't get over it and I gradually drifted away from the group. 

I now have one friend and I have never invited her home. When she asked about it once, I told her the house was cluttered. I'd rather have her think I'm a hoarder than a gamer."

"You're correct. It turned out that we had gone to the same high school in Texas (this was in Alaska). We were working in political campaigns. I probably only offered him the job based on this fact, and that he had chosen to be so honest with me. 

What made him such a phenomenal employee was that he required exactly zero supervision. At one point, I went out of town last minute and needed someone to handle payroll since I was about 600 miles away and the Alaskan mail service is not always perfect. He completely took over for me, coordinated and distributed paychecks to the rest of the staff (over 1200 miles), and then (without being asked) directed the entire staff  to where they needed to be. My plane landed and 60+ staff members that he had never met were paid and working as if I'd never even left. He had observed me and decided to make sure that we did not lose productivity while I was handling an emergency. He had utilized a software system that he did not even have administrator privileges, and probably saved us 200+ work hours. "

There are no aliens.  Humans are super unique and the most amazing thing in the universe.

Life on Earth is not worth contacting (stupid, useless, violent, other reasons).

Some super advanced civilization has already taken over the galaxy/universe, and is killing anyone who tries interstellar travel/communication.

"I probably should have failed my drive test. There's this weirdly angled intersection in my neighborhood, so of course it is included in the drive test. I have never used this intersection going north/south only east/west which is a fairly normal looking intersection. Well he told me to take a left at it heading north and I couldn't figure it out and ended up realizing halfway through I was NOT taking a left. 
""I'm doing this wrong aren't I?""
Homie still passed me cause I was cute and nerdy and we talked about Wonder Woman and I was very cautious and safe in the weird intersection. "

"DUI. It's all your fault, no way around it, you're an idiot. Can't act like it was just a crazy thing that happened, it was your decision. And you made a fucking terrible decision. Then you go to jail and get published in the paper. Next, lawyer. That'll be a few thousand. Go to court (which means missing work/school, and they're gonna want to know why), explain to your friends and family what happened, feel pretty much all of the shame. Then you're excluded from certain jobs. And your car insurance goes up about 300%. And you've got 7 years until it might be off your driving record. And the only respite you have is thank fucking God and luck that you didn't kill anyone. I've been 100% guilty of a DUI and it was the most shameful and terrible thing I put myself, my family, and those that care about me through. Especially these days, it's not only easy but convenient to get a cheap ride home instead of driving. It doesn't *have* to ruin your life, I believe everyone can change their mindset and with plenty of work you can get back to square one, nobody's a saint and everyone makes poor decisions, but you're gonna have to redeem yourself twice over. But with a DUI, you're going to pay for it for a loooong fucking time, it will create a lot of hardship, and rightfully so. Just don't fuckin do it. Get a cab, get an uber, walk home, call someone to help, call AAA, use saferide, anything. Just do not get in your car if you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs."
"People are saying ""having sex with strangers"" a lot but I have to say as a young guy who has done that while it is awesome, it's awesome in the moment. For example I've been in a monogamous relationship for a while with a person I really care about, but even still I get that feeling of missing the hotness of casual hookups (just reminiscent, I wouldn't cheat). It's only been like 2 years and I already think those sorts of thoughts every now and then.

My point is that missing casual sex as they age and it becomes more difficult is something people generally experience regardless of whether or not they had a lot of it as a young adult. It's not like you are somehow incomplete because you didn't do it, it is the definition of an indulgent experience that is just for fun. There is no magic, because you're just satisfying that carnal urge, and that carnal urge will always be there demanding that it's filled (or that you do some filling depending on what you've got there). You're not going to bang a stranger and then think to yourself ""Wow that was amazing I'm good now I can die happy"".

"I'm not a woman, but I did observe a *Nice Guy* in the wild. I used to work a delivery job when I was younger that involved driving around the local area delivering blue prints, mainly to City Offices. One day I make a delivery City Hall, which had an incredibly beautiful/friendly/petite 20 something receptionist working the front desk regularly. As I'm walking up to her to give her my daily delivery, some creepy looking male co-worker who resembled Judge Doom with a ponytail is sneaking up behind her like a cartoon villian holding a humongous bag filled with $20 of food from Carls Jr. (*Hardee's for those of you back East*), and a bucket sized cup of soda in the other hand. As she turns around to get me my pick-up, she gets startled since she didn't know he was standing directly behind her, after which he replied with ""*I heard you tell so&amp;so that you didn't have lunch today so I got you something to eat!*"". She nervously laughed it off and said ""*Aww, um.... thanks, but my Boyfriend already came by and brought me something.*"" and his head sunk down as she side stepped him to grab what she had to give me. After she walked out of earshot, he dumped the small feast in the trash and mumbled ""**BITCH!**"" while lurching back to his desk."

"We have the ability to empty our minds and not think about anything in particular.

A vacant face doesn't means that trouble's a-brewing. It may just be that the guys brain is offline for a couple of minutes, because he needs to relax.

Also, when I get home from work, I may need some peace and quiet before hearing every little detail about your day, and my need for peace and quiet is exactly as justified as your need to talk.

It doesn't mean that I don't want to listen to you. It just means that I don't want it right now.

Generally, a lot of men are facing a common problem where women believes that their needs are supposed to be met (listening to her at any given time, intimacy that isn't about sex etc) without considering that mens needs are just as important to the men, even though the needs may be regarded is ""simpler"" or ""not for the good of the relationship"" because it's basically always just: ""Less talking, more sex"".

But it **is** actually for the good of the relationship if it makes the man happier. Then he'll be there 100% when he's there instead of seeking refuge in his own mind all the time."

It's presented as heartwarming and ""look how great these kids are,"" but I often wonder how the kid with the disability feels. Like, does the kid know his classmates are letting him make a basket during the game? Does he feel condescended to?

"I was younger and big into online games.  

I was telling my brother how a group of friends and I kicked the shit out of another team. I used the phrase ""We raped them"".   

My brother is both a paramedic, and the most jovial person I know. Always quick with a joke, even macabre humour considering his profession.   

After I said it, he went totally serious.   

""Have you ever seen a rape victim?""  he asked.  

""No."" was my honest and sheepish reply.   

""You wouldn't say that if you did.""   

I never said it again since. It was a very simple and humbling lesson. Ignorance is no excuse to be flippant about a topic. I know many might disagree, but I have not and will not use the term rape like that again. "

"I had it where the foreskin was super tight! You're so right! Sex was possible and usually good because it was so tight it simply stayed in place over my foreskin.

Sex is much better now."

"I know this will never happen and it breaks me that I can do nothing about it. 

Spyro the Dragon HD remaster, but rather than a traditional remaster that builds the 3 games as separate parts of the same disk, it would instead be a start to finish play through of the 3 games. The castle you start in front of at the beginning of the first game has an interior that leads to the courtyard used during the intro cutscenes of the next 2 games. There's an empty portal frame that becomes the portal to dragon shores when you beat gnasty gnorc, and then you get stuck in avalar. 

Once you beat ripto and head back to dragon shores, there's a portal back to artisans, and now you're in the artisans home with the ability to swim, climb, and headbash, allowing you to find completely original levels in the home worlds, and new areas in some of the levels. Then you do year of the dragon and have a whole bunch of side levels with the new characters you unlock. Imagine Bentley having a level in peacekeepers' ice caverns, or sgt. Byrd helping his avian brethren in avalar's breeze harbor. 

Its the game that I can only dream would come to fruition. I have so many ideas that I know I could never relay to a triple A dev to make happen and it makes me sad. Especially since it's likely that spyro is gonna see an HD remaster soon with the success of the N-Sane trilogy"
