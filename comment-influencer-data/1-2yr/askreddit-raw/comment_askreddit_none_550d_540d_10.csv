"&gt; Hillary didn't have much to do with security of the embassy 

Her job at the time was WHAT at the time?

She received the requests for more security, it was her decision to make, she either wasn't aware due to incompetence, or ignored the requests due to being stupid.

"The DOJ under Obama used salacious and completely unverified opposition research paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign as a pretext to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Trump before the election. That is as bad as Watergate. 

Not to mention the fact that there was an obvious conspiracy to undermine his administration by those in the highest levels of the FBI and DOJ. Read the texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and it's undeniable. Strzok was second in command in the Trump investigation at the FBI, and he and his mistress talked about an ""insurance policy"" in case Trump won the election. They mentioned discussing this with the recently fired Andy McCabe. What could they possibly mean by this? Sounds like a coup attempt to me. 

The full weight of the federal government has been behind the Trump investigation since before the election. If there was any credibility to the allegations of Russian collusion, we would have heard about it by now. Instead, all that has happened is that Paul Manafort got charged for something so minor that the FBI agents who interviewed him thought little of it. 

Shit is about to majorly hit the fan, but not in the way that people on here are hoping it will. The IG report is coming out soon, and you can bet, based on Jeff Sessions' comments about Andy McCabe's termination, that they have uncovered some major fuckery. 

Kind of a long read, but this goes into great detail about this sham of an investigation, and the plot to bring Trump down. Of course, you won't hear any of these details in the mainstream media.

I’m not from the US so I don’t think there is much I can do. I’m not saying it’s a bad idea; I’m genuinely curious about how much people think it’d help.
Only some of them. The vast majority of them are just as tired of the continued nothing as the rest of the world is.
Trump supporters
"I'll be meeting others at my nearest protest location. :)

Update - Regardless of whether your comment was positive or negative, I want to apologize for the late replies. I was wrapped up in both work and a boatload of homework, and haven't had any free time to check my phone today.


Update 2 - All your downvotes tell me is:

- Trumpers gonna Trump.

- You're probably just salty that Trump hasn't repealed anti slavery laws*, or some other corrupt shit yet. 


Update 3 -

 Won’t really care 
Racist 
"The System hasn't gotten to a point where people feel it's really necessary to sacrifice what needs sacrificed to protest something. 

I'd say that's pretty ideal. No one wants a System so bad that everyday people are leaving work to go fight it.

So it seems our problems are minor. "
Pretty sure that doesn't work on women due to the whole abortion thing.
Probably read through the salt and laugh at imagining how 60s radicals would react at being told the director of the FBI is some kind of folk hero to people who think of themselves as leftwing in fifty years
Weight is Gravity. Hence why you weigh less up in an airplane versus at sea level. 
Do you believe protesting makes a difference or is it just making you feel like you've done something?
Laugh for a couple seconds. Check online reaction for an hour or so. Then go back to reality and get on with my life. 
"He's a long time buddy with Comey and he loaded his investigation team entirely with democrats, many of whom are Hillary donors.  He's a partisan hack."
Celebrate. It is about time Trump drains the swamp.
Got that artisan stuff in Oregon
"Celebratory Bourbon! I'm sick of that investigative creep and his investigative creep.

His boss, and the house Intel committee have both declared that there was definitively no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, so at this point it really feels like he's on a witch hunt yo find anything that might be bad for Trump.

Also I will enjoy watching all the idiots who still think Trump will get impeached cry and whine when he fires Mueller and nothing happens. "
If you don't care about politics get the fuck out of this country.
You downvotes for not liking a post! That’s a banning!
Have fun protesting.  Let us know when you want to do something useful about it all instead.
I’m fine with the investigation going  8 years. My god dude calm down what’s wrong with you?
It means we're fucked
"oh, my bad, they created a few facebook groups too."
Too bad people want to get rid of guns today not realizing they might need them later. 
"Cheer! He and his investigation are so off course it's laughable. He's supposed to be looking for Russian influence, not every other broken law.

If he finds other issues, he should have immedietly handed it off to local prosecutors and kept a beed on his target per his mandate. Instead he has gone down every convenient rabbit hole he could find and ignored his mandate."
"&gt; I thought the same thing and then the women’s march happened and I was accompanied by 100,000 of my fellow Minnesotans. I figured I’d be one of 10-20 thousand from the online organizing I saw happening ... but holy shit, 100K?! 



that womans march was the biggest waste of time on this earth. the fuck did it try to accomplish other than selling pussy hats? it was a bunch of protests that changed fuck all and were far too late to do fuck all. I can't believe you think it was anything else other than a ploy by some neo-liberal feminazis to sell pussy hats to middle class women....




go and do something in your spare time when it actually counts instead of fomoing into a crappy protest with no cause or reason "
"Spoiler alert: Even if it were found that Trump personally ""colluded"" with the Russians to win an election, there is no law against that in the United States.

It's one of the reasons that the Republicans point to it as a protracted interminable witch hunt, because by the definition of the law (or the lack of it in this case), even IF he were to find proof that he colluded Mueller would have to find some random unrelated crime to recommend ANY kind of law enforcement action.

I can guarantee you that Trump will never be even *accused* of treason, much less convicted of it.

He would literally have to be selling military secrets or something for that to happen."
Laugh my ass off and have a celebratory drink.
you are dumb
"even if you don't agree with the investigation you aren't allowed to obstruct justice, and trump has admittedly done this multiple times."
We don't need or want you either.
Probably pop champagne.  There was no way that his investigation would have happened without the Steele Dossier.  
"If you were running this investigation it would be over... because you seem to have a truth... that nobody... even the exalted Mueller you claim as the only vestibule of functioning government has.

All you have is headlines from media... that is literally your only evidence of anything. Yet he's the ""functioning government"". "

"He is firing personell over Twitter, bragging about it and he is trying to put a [Torture Center Operator](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/cia-deputy-director-gina-haspel-torture-thailand.html) in charge of the CIA.

&gt;Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of two terrorism suspects and later took part in an order to destroy videotapes documenting their brutal interrogations at a secret prison in Thailand.

 We are not deranged, HE IS. Why hasn't the lightbulb gone off in your head that we are in deep shit? You have no idea whether it is a joke or not."
"He won't be fired, he'll resign. And I couldn't care less. Unless he's the one stockpiling sealed indictments, he's going down with the rest of the leftist traitors."
Lol man I wish I was as delusional as you and thought shit posting on Facebook was one of the most serious security incidents of all time.
By now it's quite clear that at least one Russian has had a very big say on an American election.
You didn't address my part of the argument either.

"Were also far enough from that point that it still isn't a massive concern.

I'm not saying be complacent on something you feel is unjust. Use your right to protest. But to add gas to the fire with fear mongering is not going to help the situation."

The 14 Defining 
Characteristics Of Fascism



 
Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler (Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and several Latin American regimes. Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:

 

1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
 
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed
to the government's policies or actions.
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

"The past year has really opened my eyes to how willing you cultists are to lick boots and eat shit if it means you get to wear a hat.

Just disgraceful."
"In a small town, phone calls from ~50 regular customers might just be listened to. 

The highest rated comment on this thread is from someone afraid of losing their job/insurance if they take any real action. 

If employers are the choke point and businesses depend on customers, then maybe -- just maybe -- if enough customers push back, something will give.  

But since you think it's a dumb idea, I won't bother. Thanks for helping me see the light. "
Chris Rock..... racist
"Absolutely do not care. Not only do i not care, but I take joy in it. A lion doesn't lose sleep over the opinion of sheep.

"If you don't like Trump you hate white people.

"Until you show data showing that this is a normal occurrence in the population and not skewed to just sampling within that segment of the population, I'm going to think that 4 boyfriends with this same type of behavior is evidence of the latter, and does not represent an accurate sample of the population.

In which case, 4-fake-suicide-bf-redditor, you might have a type. The type that fakes suicide threats. This conclusion would be supported by you admitting you have had 4 boyfriends that show the same behavior. Their behavior isn't your fault. But you probably need to change the people you associate with.

The other comment possibly could have been worded better, it could have sounded ""victim-blamey"". Regardless, it seems you have a type, a specific population that you select your boyfriends from. Again, I'm not saying their behavior, with their suicide threats, are your fault or responsibility in any way. But you choosing this guy or that guy as your boyfriend, frankly speaking, is your fault, not theirs. So you seem to be doing something wrong. A suggestion would be to change the people you associate with, and get a different type (and also be the person you want to be, live up to your potential, etc). It's up to you now.

Of course I don't know where you are at this point in your life, maybe you've already gotten better boyfriends or married or something Idk. This is just a small snapshot of your life I'm working off of, it could be totally irrelevant by now. I truly mean no offense with anything."

"Because he doesn’t make content for you he makes it for kid, that’s like calling your kid stupid for not finding George Carling funny."

No it wasn’t the president has the power to fire anyone under him at any time for any reason.
Spirituality.  A lot of people have done a lot of bad things in the name of god. 
If he gets fired there will be a reason. I will not care if he does. It will not effect me one way or the other.

Go on the_donald and read all the delusional fucking retarded things they'll say to blindly defend this fucking aberration of a president you guys elected
As a Canadian I will prepare for the fallout of the inevitable collapse of America
"Obstruction of justice would be destroying evidence(i.e. 18 minutes of tape) but with Comey being pretty shitty, he fired him, which he can"
"No. But it is ok to fire someone for political action.

For example, while I despise trump supporters, and think they should all take a one way trip to their mother russia they love so much, unless they act in a way that makes other employees, customers, or corporate feel unsafe... they should keep their job unless they fuck up.

But going to a trump rally and trying to claim you aren't a threat to your black coworker is not ok."
They're frail people. I wouldn't want to have to rely on one. 
"If we did not collapse under Pres. Obama, we will be fine."
Moveon is owned by George Soros and he uses it as a tool to destabilize governments for his own profit.
"It is my firm belief that Trump could literally take a dump on the original US constitution on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in front of a school bus full of children and half a dozen cameras and no one would do anything significant about it, just empty gestures all around. "
Nixon resigned over a spying scandal. So exactly what was done TO Trump.
you gonna go scream at the sky?
I would probably check /r/politics to see how I am supposed to feel and then act in accordance with their directive.
Who's Robert Mueller?
"Strzok and Page were on Mueller's team until the IG discovered that they were biased and were violating policy. Then Mueller kicked them off the team.

And that is before we talk about Strzok's personal relationship with the Judge in the Flynn case who accepted Flynn's plea and then recused himself."
Reality is many see trump as corruption and many see muller as corruption. It's a divided issue. Some will praise trump for firing him and draining the swamp while others it will cement trump as the swamp. 
"As someone on the other side, Obama did not feel inclusive. It felt like he hated what I loved and created the environment for wacko SJWs to thrive.

"The Russian collusion angle is a total farce, so... option 2"
You're going to need more than a hand gun son. 
"To do what, waste your time?"

"If you ban manufacturing and the sale of weapons you have taking that right away from people who hadn't had the chance to purchase their firearms yet. 

Buy-Back programs especially mandatory buyback programs like Reddit keep saying we should do, are confiscation. 

If you make a weapon illegal to purchase you have taken that right away. Stop pretending your goal isn't banning all guns. 

Thankfully the people with the guns aren't going to give them up to the people like you that want to take them. "
"Dude. Those who live in protective bubbles can't throw needles.

Gimme a fucking break you idiots that think his hands are clean in this are just as bad as the opposite idiots who think he has nightly calls with his BFF Putin and is moments away from tweeting his dumb ass into impeachment.

You're all the same, unproductive, non-independent, dumb followers of party over good-of-the-people."
If only they had made a statement of resistance at the ballot box
"I see. I really don't think the ceasing of the investigation will help trump politically though. Just like the Republicans in the HIC prematurely declaring ""There is no evidence of collusion"" the night before the PA special election didn't help the GOP at all. Literally nothing will.  Their biggest ""win"" was the tax reform and it's responding negatively for them in the polls and made no impact on the voters in a really Republican district. "
"You're all wrong buddy. If Mueller was fired, his replacement would pick up where he left off. That's all that would happen, there would be not releasing of confidential information. "
"You like that, you fucking retard?"
Ah so then we agree. All the comments here are either questioning who Mueller is while the others are promoting a MoveOn march.
"It won't be so funny should the US actually collapse, that will lead to a worldwide destabilization, and you won't be able to afford popcorn much longer after that.

It's all funny until someone else's suffering actually causes enough of a splash to ruin the party for everyone.

So fuckin' laugh it up, chuckles.  Just don't be surprised if when you get what's coming to you."
Because that person investigating him is being funded by people with special insterests and chooses who gets to PAY TO PLAY
"Didn't vote for Trump. With that being said I want evidence. There is none. Only evidence is media literally saying ""Russia this Russia that"".

Wanna know what there is evidence of? Fisa warrants of Obama spying on Trump campaign, McCabe breaking the law, democrats colluding against Sanders, 100k illegals voting in most recent Pennsylvania election.

I can provide concrete sources. Can you? No you can't because if there were any Trump would already be impeached.


Ps: pork stars coming out of the woodwork don't count as evidence "
He should be fired.  The only reason he's still around is because the WH is smart enough to let him dig his own grave.  Trump is winning and the left playing their little games using the FBI is a big fail.
Want to emigrate even more. To be under Trump's presidency. #MAGA
So how would you distinguish  jokes from lies?
"ahh yes, the protests.. let me just check something .... oh yep, paid for by MoveOn.org.  Hi Mr. Soros! just checking in to see how you're doing.  You aren't getting too bored ruining countries for personal profit, I hope?"

"Well most of the US are fine with how things are progressing and think after 2 years of investigating its probably time to stop wasting taxpayer money and allowing the media to consistently stir the pot.  We’re good.  If you think this is the “downfall of the US” you’re just buying into the diluge of propaganda flooding the web.  You’re so torn up about Trump being guilty of something but the guy digging through everyone’s closets still hasn’t turned up anything worth impeaching him for.  But don’t worry, I’m sure given another 2 Years that will change /s.  I’m more concerned with the fact the DOJ spies on a presidential candidate, bugged his HQ, and passed all info to the sitting president of the opposing party."
Does he legally have the power to?
Lol your funny. How long have you been voting 2 years?
"Yeah, supposedly Hillary is incontinent."
"&gt; If I have to choose between pro gun candidates that I oppose in literally every other way and anti gun candidates that I agree with in every other way I'll vote for the candidate I agree with on the most issues.

That's fine and dandy, but when you vote for a party that almost universally supports taking a right away, you don't get to claim support for that right."
"Haha 😂 I love seeing libtards getting rekt epic style! 👌 LOL they’re just salty because their team is losing and our team is winning! 😂😂 I love it when our team wins! Praise Lord Emperor Trump!
"
"All I'm saying is, everyone, including trump, condemend that tragedy, but I never see Hillary speak out against the violence against trump supporters. Maybe it's because the DNC paid for it as we saw in the leaks."
"&gt;He won fair and square. Get over it. 

And Putin with the assist!"
This is what would be called anecdotal evidence and really doesn't prove anything at all.
Come was fired because he was a nitwit and showed favoritism in the Clinton probe. Trump also fired Comey because Sessions and Rosenstein advised it. I suggest you look past what the liberal media tells you and do some critical thinking.
"He said it in a political setting.

If I've got a gun pointed at you and say 'Heh, I'm going to shoot you.', feel free to take that as a joke, I wouldn't."
"Firing personell in public announcements and trying to install puppets that will bow to his whims is exactly that. Pompeo at secretary of state would rubber stamp any idea Trump wants.

Putting a Torture Center Operator in charge of the CIA who will bow to his whims is exactly that. Gina Handle would rubber stamp anything Trump wants.

He is trying to consolidate power to loyalist and yesmen. This is both stupid and striving to be a dictator.

"I'll get flak, but I've said this before and I'll say it again: I would love to return to the days, at least in US TV, where Title 47 of United States Code is zealously enforced by the FCC, which states that all free to air TV (and radio) stations are prohibited from airing profanity or indecent programs outside of the watershed (after 10 p.m. to 6 a.m local time).

Unfortunately, our FCC recently lost its spine and has allowed a lot of smut and trash to be broadcast at all hours, and networks have brazenly defied the law with little to no consequences.

So, I'd like to see our FCC grow their balls back and start sending out letters of apparent liability against the TV/radio stations that defy the law, and start threatening their broadcast license.

TV was always intended to be, at least during the day, family time, not trash, and I'd love to see us get back to that."
