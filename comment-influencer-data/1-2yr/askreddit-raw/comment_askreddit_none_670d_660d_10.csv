"The butterfly effect. Go back in time and change how something happens.

I'm gonna write down those god damned lottery numbers. I'll roll the dice on whether or not one person out of 7 billion getting a small percentage of the immense amount of money out there changes everything super drastically. Then again I'm no expert on theories of the time/space continuum."
"Personally I'm calling bullshit on the idea that the Russians are even capable of having a significant effect on the result. What could they have done that Clinton's $600m and Trump's $300m campaigns weren't doing already?

It just seems like a giant ""reds under the bed"" panic created by a US establishment who can't understand how someone so totally unacceptable to them managed to win. Answer of course being that much of the electorate was fed up with them and their bullshit, and happy to vote for anyone, however loathsome, who might rock that cosy little boat."

You are a fucking idiot. Let is not consent. You obviously haven't been a woman who has been sexually assualted. People freeze. Not doing anything is not consent you garbage person. 
"That's rape, though. You're raping her with math, which is patriarchal."
That is OK. I'm OK too. Weird name though. 
"Telling that is like telling a robber what his worst robbery xD.
I am not gonna tell you that."
Bombing Syria. He didn't say it was an act of war against the U.S.

I think it was more the mob ruining Cuba that led to his rise as a freedom fighter.
"Okay, I'll bite, smartguy.
But I need to make sure I understand your beliefs first. 
So apparently you believe that we are on a ball of rock that is spinning 1,000 mph? 
You also believe that this rock is flying through space at at an incredible 67,000 mph.?   
You also believe that the galaxy is traveling roughly 2,000,000 mph through the universe?
You also believe that this pattern has existed for trillions of years without interruption? 
Am I close so far- Is this how you believe the earth works?"
I wasn't even attempting to accuse him of being a racist.  LOL
"So the mental patient with no control over her own gender or impulses wants to control other people? 

Sounds like everyone of them

Watch around Reddit, they are a fucking cliche...the people who HATE Trump...their post history is failure upon failure, with no accountability just blame, mostly on their parents 

Yet they NEED to tell us how to live, because they know better...lmao"
"Ugh, I hated this movie. I want my time back. I can't believe  that there could be anyone that awkward."

Not butt hurt at all. Just pointing out he's politicizing a comment. And so are you.
"back in my day we had freaks who actually believed they could change their gender!

Thank god they were all exterminated in the transwar."

"Statistics can make them say what you want them to say. In your given scenario you clearly have an outlier that should have been tossed out during the evaluation. 
 
You are also only counting the low level and the high level. You are failing to take into account the mid level which when plotted on a histogram would make up the bulk of the bell curve. 
 
The 33,000 is about right. Especially considering the rise in popularity of four-door trucks (for instance). They START pricing in the 30,000 range.
 
Not everyone goes trying to find the cheapest vehicle out there. We are spoiled Americans to choice, taste, and luxury. "
"It doesn't take much time to buy the games -- you can even do it online anytime. There's also nothing stopping you from driving the nice car to work. The gun thing works out a bit more, because going shooting can be a bit of hassle in lots of places."
"Well, its a fact that less girls like videogames than boys. Its statistic really.

Always happy to meet a girl that like videogames but i won't assume she'd be interessed while there is a better probability that a random guy might be more interessed."
"True, but you‚Äôve gotta admit having them covered all the time makes it much more exciting when they‚Äôre uncovered"
"As a non american  but also non European: no, Europe is not better than america. "
And where was it proven that men and women find it just as hard to obtain love?
"Lol so she insulted your father, scratched your mum‚Äôs face... and you beat the shit out of her? The fuck is wrong with you? Doesn‚Äôt matter if she‚Äôs an asshole, I know what a court would say to that - and rightfully so. "
"""Should"" and ""Are"" are two different things. I'm not arguing how things *should* be, simply stating things as they are."
WTF?! 12 guys in a year is a lot? That seems pretty average for a sexually active person.
"Yeah, men are expendable. It's sad but true."
Some idiots might put it under that classification but it's incorrect as it does not have hallucinations. If it does it's probably exacerbating a pre-existing mental disorder.

"See I'm not sure about this because I've known women who seem to take a great deal of pleasure in having their nipples stimulated and I doubt very much they could draw the same pleasure from stimulation of their ankles.

Some of it may be emotional/mental pleasure to an extent but I bet the majority is physical. 

So I'm not sure the ""boobs are only sexualized because they are covered up all the time"" argument truly holds up.

Having said all this, I believe women should be able to go around topless if they so desire."
I was going to say something along these lines and you nailed it; nothing to add. 
maybe its cause all the man-whores ive know have also been violent and had alcohol problems.

Maybe he was nervous i cant look at chicks in the eyes without making it weird and sexual sometimes sorry
It's actually really nice. They have energy and super good bodies.
"I forgot to add the trigger alert tag. My bad. Listen. I obviously hit a nerve, so something I said rang true and caused your neurons to fire in overtime. Everything you just said SOUNDS great, but look at the deterioration of family, and by extension society as a whole, that's happened since we decided to abandon those outdated ways of thinking. We may have the ability to use language and build, but we're still animals who have to deal with the consequences of our choices. Good luck with your crusades though. Dick it up, Buttercup."

"&gt;But what's even the point of saying that?

I can say the exact same thing about evwry single post in this threas.

This entire thread is about people expressing their views and opinions. 

Stop trying to cherry pick the ones you dislike.

&gt;he came out of the woodwork to inform her that he wouldn't fuck her. Ok, thanks for the input, bro.

Except he didn't?

Stop trying to exaggerate and twist what people say to reinforce shakey arguments.

Saying ""im not attracted to body hair, don't expect everyone to be"",  isn't exactly an extreme opinion to have.

&gt;Like, imagine you're somewhere like r/games talking about your favorite puzzle platformers and some girl comes in and says "" You know, it's great that you like your hobby and all, but I just thought I'd let you know that I, and many other women, would not have sex with you as a result.""

"Right, it's simply what I've heard, but based on his reputation, I don't doubt it. He's not a smart man, let alone businessman, and has a LONG and proven history of shady deals and unethical behavior.

He's also in over his head IMO when you consider [all his business dealings.](http://trump.kimalbrecht.com/network/)"
Never drank alcohol or used drugs. Anyone who does is a sad pathetic person who can't handle reality.
"Those are both accurate statements. The nation was built on slavery. There are plenty of people alive today who lived under segregation, and who couldn't get loans for homes because of redlining. 

Was he supposed to say ""America has never been racist""? 

I don't want to relitigate Trayvon Martin, but he was a kid going from home to the store and back, while Zimmerman was a loon with a gun looking for trouble. But when you kill the only other witness, it's easy to create reasonable doubt. "

Yep, you're a creep because you act like a pedo. Upvoted you to shame you."
Geeeeez. That is the worst example to me. As soon as Alan Alda took control it went from a funny sitcom to being a melodrama. I absolutely hated every episode he directed.

"&gt;Bad advice. Do not leave the house. In the event of a breakup or separation, this will be seen as forfeiting the house.

Since she'll decline to move out immediately, he needs to leave the house for the few days he prepares himself. Then, he could go back to his house and invite family members to live with him....so he's not alone with her.

The OP also stated that they didn't own a house and that they were renting."

&gt; The sequence flew by. It was very pale. The aging makeup, unfortunately, turned all of them into characters from ""Cocoon"" or Miss Havisham, with spectral expressions and white flyaway hair. Keith's murder seemed stupid. In fact, the whole overwrought montage was at least half ludicrous"
The guy openly admits to laughing at him and closing the door. OP is asshole. Stop sympathizing with OP. All the salesman did was try get him to hold a tablet.
"Down the road would you be open to working this ordeal out?  Since you said your newborn is about 4 months old it sounds like she could've been suffering from postpartum depression and spiraled out of control.  She may not be the woman you married at the moment, but she's got to be in there somewhere.  DO you really think the woman you married would;ve been capable of all this before the pregnancy?"

take out the montage of the world and leave the frog's bell so you can wonder if the frog just happened to eat a bell

drop more in-world hints or visions that point to the real world like fish swimming in the air that would lead you to believe they're still in the lake but who knows?

there's so many other ways they could have done it to make it make some kind of modicum of sense but when a story has a gaping plot hole that's never addressed or even worse, written as such, it pisses me off to no end. just tell a fucking story for christ sakes.

on top of that, the fact that there's so many death allegories it's nauseatingly pretentious, i feel like a 5 second version of otgw could be a cartoon character screaming ""HEY DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT DEATH?"""
"What? No, we don't."
"A job I had once. I saw one of the guys keep putting pennies into another guys phone. He kept making the phone heavier and heavier over the course of a few months. Then one day he took all of the change out, so the phone weighed alot less. When the 2nd guys phone rang, he wasn't expecting the weight of the telephone and hit himself in the face. I laughed so loud that day. "

"This will probably get buried, here I go:

I was part of this band back in the 80s/90s. We started for fun but then ended up getting quite some popularity and so we did have a period touring and doing some concerts.

Well, one day, we were in Buenos Aires and the crowd threw all kind of shit (and rocks) to the all-girl opening band. We were all SO enraged with that bullshit behavior and we quickly thought of something to get back at them.

We then went ahead and teased the shit out of them for the whole concert, playing songs they didn't know and messing with them.

In retrospect we could have been more upfront but the best ideas always come later. Anyway, fantastic years of my life."

Yeah but you could choose not to give them the job because you didn't like their face. Racism in this day and age although it happens is less rare than the news would suggest. Your average employer isn't going to turn a good employee away because they're black.

Mortal enemy as far as ex was very suspicious that me &amp; this girl were fucking on the side, which, to be fair, we were, regularly.
