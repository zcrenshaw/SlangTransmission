"You vegans disgust me. Really not going to get into another argument with a non-meat eater on the internet but srsly that dick shit, pompous, look down the nose at meat eater attitud grinds my fucking gears to no end.

You know what? I eat meat and I *am* a kind and compassionate animal love. My dog eats meat and he loved animals, too.

Not all farmers are fucking barbarians, you know. Torture? You put too much weight in your documentaries. I happen to have known a *lot* of farmers/animal raisers who eat meat, provide meat for others *and* desperately love and care for every animal.

Oh and FYI, *I* need meat. With my allergies, I need meat to stay healthy and I refuse to take a mountain of supplements for ever.


Not going to reply btw, haf this conversation before, can't be fucked to have it again. Just had to post something, even a half arsed something because vegetarians are wankers."

"Considering how often you'll need your keys in a week, misplacing them around the house once a week isn't really unreasonable either. Considering you're the one outright lying in this situation about being outside it sounds like you might be the one being reasonable."

"Assuming you haven't been nagging at people posting about European states.(meaning you think places like Germany or Porto Rico are countries/ nations)

I don't think you have the proper grasp on the current state of the world.

The European states aren't sovereign nations, they are state governments that are superseded by EU law just as the state governments in California are superseded by the US national government law.

This is why the UK is trying to leave the EU.

Both California and Germany were independent nations that then joined a union and are now states.

"I spank my kids, open hand to the backside between one and five times depending on severity of infraction to respect or safety of self or others.

I constantly get compliments in how well behaved my kids are.

My sister does not. her children run wild, and she can't get anyone to ever watch them because they're complete shitheads.

I'll stick to spanking, open hand, to the back side. if my hand stings, I've struck too hard."

My comment was intended for people that like to rinse off their chicken because of the slimy film on the outside. Since you said you don't rinse your chicken(which is a good thing) you can just ignore my comment because it is of no value to you.
This doesn't actually happen and it's just a bullshit story made up by Reddit

"&gt; But it certainly feels like it's part of a growing trend in general to dismiss people who've actually studied stuff and believe some nutter with no credentials who made a youtube video,

This is exactly the mentality I'm talking about. There are people in the flat earther community who aren't like this...*at all*.. and who, too, have ""actually studied stuff"". Again..proving the point that people just like to pretend they don't exist and that every single flat earther is just some guy spouting random low quality youtube video stuff. That's not true.

&gt; and sometimes that can become dangerous, eg. when the same train of thought is applied to medicine (anti-vaxxers etc.)

Yes. But here's the thing. The flat earther mentality *doesn't*, in actual, real life, put anyone or anything in danger. There's no use in comparing it to a line of thought like anti-vax because it's entirely inconsequential. Nothing will ever come of it like it will with anti-vax.

Who cares if those people have gone through all the evidence and still deny it? It doesn't hurt anyone. There's nothing scary about it. They're never going to convince the majority that the earth is flat. You and I both know as well that the ""scary"" bit (ignoring all  the evidence) isn't ever going to be the popular or most successful way of looking at something when it comes to people that can actually do things to change the world in a scientific way (may or may may not increase in popularity among lay people)...especially not with something like the roundness of the earth. Again..nothing scary about a group of people who use their ignorance to deny something harmless and stop it there. It's an *extremely* niche view of the world (literally..). No major world changes are ever going to come of their ideas other than rustling some internet feathers.

There's nothing scary about what they do because, again, there's no real world negative consequence (unless you count being yelled by people who believe otherwise..or simply being objectively unaware of the roundness of the earth) in adopting that viewpoint.

&gt; And no, it's not harming anyone in itself. But it certainly feels like it's part of a growing trend in general to dismiss people who've actually studied stuff

And who decided this was a growing trend other your own (and people with your similar mentality) selective experience filtered through the negative lens you have for people who make that kind of error? People ignoring the advice or word of other people who actually know what they're talking about has been happening forever. There's nothing new there, and there's nothing suggesting that this is some terrible ever growing trend that's going to eventually dominate society."
Really? I think it's more like a breeding ground. Which is probably the only exposure to breeding that you people are going to get.

"&gt;...or your parents were opinionated hippies who thought that paying taxes was unethical and thus voluntarily kept their income around poverty level, mostly lived off the land, and spent hours a day reading to and teaching their kid instead of just parking it in front of a TV. 


In what way is this relevant? If you still had crayons, none of this makes a difference. 


&gt;It built the kind of reading comprehension skills that would allow one to glean from my original post that my parents did in fact buy me crayons; they just bought the cheap ones instead of name-brand. 


Rose art literally cost more than crayola. And a quick google search or trip to target is all it takes to find that out. Maybe they should have taught you to fact check before you go around acting all high and mighty because you're supposedly better read thanks to ""cheaper"" crayons. 


&gt;All in all it was a fantastic childhood and I wouldn't trade it for any amount of money, fancy crayons, or internet strangers' approval.

We finish school, save, and a few years from now we buy another home with cash, or on a very financially-friendly mortgage. 

We will be set for life, barring obscene misfortune or stupidity, in our early 30s."

So are you the ex? Are you talking about yourself in the third person? Is the first and second story different people? Are **you** the one with mental health issues?"
