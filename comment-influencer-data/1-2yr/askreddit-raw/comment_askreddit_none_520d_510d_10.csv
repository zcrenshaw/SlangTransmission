"&gt; Where did the music come from?

Who cares? Imagine a Universal Censor, who's job it is to stop paradox. What is ""music""? Is it the sheet music? That's just ink on a page, there's nothing illegal about ink and paper. Is it the sounds? Nothing illegal about sounds, if a landslide makes four bars of the ""1812 Overture"" in 10,000 BC, is that a paradox? Music is a human concept, the ""1812 Overture"" came from inside the human brain, same as it always did.

Where did Beetovhen get the music? He wrote it down and had an orchestra perform it. What does it matter if he originally heard the piece 200 years before he wrote it down. In a world with time travel, it doesn't matter at all."

"I've noticed in a lot of conversations with British people that they are very easily offended. I've had multiple cases where they say something quite rude or diminutive and when I simply point that out, they act as if I'd just sold their mother's soul to the devil.

I'm sure this isn't all Brits but it's been a majority that I personally have met."

"How could you possibly love someone like her? I'll never understand people who can just *forgive*. It's like people like you have Stockholm Syndrome or something. Is it a mark against me that I can't, or more accurately, *won't* forgive?"
"You‚Äôre arguing what *should* happen in an ideal world when OP clearly stated that that isn‚Äôt what happened. We don‚Äôt live in an ideal world. Of course people shouldn‚Äôt assume that stuff is ok...but *they do*. OP literally provided us proof of that. What *I‚Äôm* saying is that, given the knowledge that this stuff happens, the only way to make 100% sure it doesn‚Äôt happen is if you clearly delineate what is and is not allowed *before you‚Äôre even in the situation where it might happen*. You‚Äôre the only what making should and should not statements when it comes to acceptable behavior in bed. I‚Äôm agreeing with all of those. I‚Äôm just being realistic with what OP should do if they are afraid of that stuff happening. "
On the plus side you have less of a chance of being raped or murdered. They usually go for the pretty ones. ;)

"We were in an English country pub celebrating a week long intense work thing - we‚Äôre an Irish company but also had some local freelance hires with us. Very mixed bunch of men and women, young and old. Got there at 9pm and had a large sit down meal. 

We finished and got ready to drink the cellar dry then the barman called last orders. We assumed they‚Äôd obviously have a lock in for us but no. They made us leave at closing which was 11pm. We were shocked. In Ireland that would be a guaranteed lock in and hell, the landlord would have probably joined us.

So we went on our only vaguely tipsy way back to the hotel and the hotel bar thinking we‚Äôd just drink there but again, denied! The night manager let us have one round and closed the bar. Couldn‚Äôt get over it, the amount of money we would have spent. The English crew just shrugged and said that‚Äôs the way it is in England. 

So no, they do not do pubs well. "

The post in question isn't even about this subject, and does very little to counteract that point. In fact, it talks about how overwhelming Soviet numbers helps them at Great length.

Then again, (judging by your username) I suppose an authentic Soviet infantryman like yourself would know better about this subject than I would."
"It's not ""being nice"", it's the rejection of being told no 1,000 times, then they're like ""why bother even asking anyone out anymore, fuck them too"".

Its basically the thinking that, if they're going to get permanently rejected in life, then you get no brownie points for holding open the door for them.  

If none of your nice efforts will ever lead to anything more, you give up. Granted, nice efforts aren't always supposed to lead to anything more, but you hope at SOME POINT being nice might lead to SOMETHING."

I mean how do you know you're good looking. People actually see themselves more as attractive than what other people see.
"Yes because even though it is a kid, that kid is still a human. So it was rape and murder that this guy committed. I agree that, morally, it is something else but not practically. "
I see it as a way to make sure that person never can hurt another person again and it's cheaper than life in prison. Life in prison doesn't mean life in prison if you've got a good enough lawyer

"Yelling at your kid. They don't understand why your doing it and frankly neither does anyone else. Unless the kid is being a little shit time and time again, have more patience. If you let a/your child bring the worst in you out, you shouldn't be around kids. This is another issue with America's education system. A lot of the teachers overreact to every minute thing they don't want the kids doing. It just creates a stressful environment for everyone when someone is trying to micromanage the unmicromanagable. "
My point is about those not willing to work whatsoever. I fully understand that not everyone makes enough to support a family on their own and in the perfect situation our system will help that person out and that's great. However the current system is being abused on the regular to turn it into simply a paycheck for not doing any work which is not the point. Having a child does not alleviate you from the responsibility of working to provide for your children.
But it made it into the book. so...?
"&gt; Sorry to piss on your false belief that native tribes were all living in rainbowland and gumdrop city prior to white settlers arriving, peacefully tending their gardens and dancing around bonfires.

When did I ever say that?

Okay, they participated in cannibalism, but that was their culture. They thought it was normal to eat human flesh, just like Americans think their military and gun culture is normal, while Europeans think it's weird. Some Asian cultures eat eggs dipped in toddler urine and it's completely normal for them.

If they hadn't been massacred and had more time they could've developed further and slowly reformed out of cannibalism just like the US developed out of slavery after having it for 2 centuries."
