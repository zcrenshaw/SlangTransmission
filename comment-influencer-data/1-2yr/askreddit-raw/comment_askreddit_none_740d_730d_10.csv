Smoking is terrible for you and people around you. And it makes you smell like shit. You should be shamed.

OP you need to clarify your thread title.

Yes I do actually. I own a dog that was adopted from the pound. I don't claim to have rescued him nor do I spread it around as if I've done a good deed. I wanted a dog so I got one. If I didn't take him someone else would. Climb down from your high horse.

"Been to ports in Germany, Iceland, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Belgium, and the Canary Islands - generally just a few days in each.

Your bathrooms are tiny, uncomfortably so. 

People aren't really that friendly or talkative, although Ireland was an exception. I'm used to US bars, where you can strike up a conversation with pretty much anyone. 

Your cars are small and underpowered, and the roads are narrow and confusingly marked. Gas is absurdly expensive. 

Kebabs are great, but the places you get them from give me a sketchy vibe. 

Cities seem overly cramped, everything is very small. 

I was surprised at how many people knew enough English for basic communication, and google translate does an excellent job of filling in the blanks. 

I thought it was hilarious when I walked into a bar in Ireland at 10am and saw a bunch of old-timers drinking their morning beer - but I was there for Irish Coffee, so I can't judge much. 

Speaking of beer, it astounds me that Europeans are so judgmental of light American beer when so much of what they serve at restaurants really isn't any better. Craft European beer is great, but not really any better than the US. 

People got weirded out at the fact that I carry a knife at all times. I've been in the habit since I was a teenager thanks to the boy scouts (I accidentally carried my dad's old buck knife to school so many times that the principal finally just told me ""keep it in your backpack and don't tell anyone""), and it's a pretty important item to have on hand when you're working on a ship, so it just goes with my wallet and my keys. I never got in any sort of trouble for it though - but when I visited NYC, I wasn't able to visit the Empire State Building unless I surrendered it, and like hell I'm going to throw $70 down the drain. 

Pairs of heavily armed guards patrolling in Antwerp. Really nice rifles, but I couldn't tell what model they were and I wasn't going to ask.

Cars didn't yield to pedestrians in Italy. That one threw me off. "

So all that lawlessness is supposed to be there by default, regardless of war? And by your count, it has been like that for that past 1400 years?

You're fucking stupid."

Way to generalize. 
"I disagree,  both were absolute dogshit, but Trump actually understood (or rather spoke toand pretended to understand) the issues of the working class. That's why he got ANY votes

The idea that he can actually remove any of the rights you and I enjoy (I hope I can marry a bf if I can ever keep one, for example) is ludicrous.  First,  the president is not a king,  second politicians can't do crap without either a backing of the people, or their apathy.  Your reasons don't come from a realistic view of the way politics works,  but emotional ones. "

When I went to UK i found they drink tea with milk!! Disgusting!
Like fucking what?
yeah and u can adjust both. from very hot to just a little bit warm for example.
It actually is the right way. The closer you eat dinner to your bedtime the less time your body has to work off some of the meal. You not supposed to eat anything right before bed and most health guides will tell you to eat small meals as early as possible so that your body can digest it before you lay down for 8 hours to sleep.

"As someone who's neither not as biased by not being in business or engineering, people in business do just tend to be dumber on the aggregate.  There's a reason the number of business undergrads is over 10x greater than the number of mathematics undergrads.  

I chose this specific comparison to make the number stand out; but the point is, no one defaults to majoring in math because they don't know what to major in.  There are hoards of people who do this with business."

"because you have had 3 chances to apologize for your lies and present a valid retort that does not rely on lying and misrepresenting what the other person said.


But you cannot do that because of the fuhrers cock in your mouth.

Which just makes me wonder.    Why cant you pull the cock out of your mouth and provide a valid response when you get called out for your lies?


Either way.   Its clear that you are a moron incapable of rational thought.   blocked."
The use of hyperbole to announce how we feel about these peoples actions blows those actions out of proportion with things that really matter and makes those words stronger when they are used in the future.

"Unlike you I don't find myself that attractive, but I still have my moments. Anyways, what I always think about this is that I could be a jerk and get a girl like that, but I simply wouldn't want a girl that only likes jerks. I would want her to like me for what I am, because I just know that it will make us happy and lasts much longer. Doing something what I am not, only sounds great to get laid, but not for a more lasting relationship.

Now as said, it helps you getting laid, but if you get a bit older, it seems to be changing a bit and the jerks are less jerky. Still, bitches be bitches, and many are still not interested in me, but I haven't really been trying lately.

What also might be a circle is that the jerks get attention, therefore more likely to get laid, which gives them more confidence and experience, which also helps them get attention from women, which allows them to be jerks, which somehow further increases their chances to get laid, etc. I feel its somehow a way you get into or not during your teens and if you haven't then you will miss it all. Overall the same kind of bimbos I see very much liking jerks, are the same that do drugs, get pregnant early and kind of ruin their lives because of it. I don't want that."
