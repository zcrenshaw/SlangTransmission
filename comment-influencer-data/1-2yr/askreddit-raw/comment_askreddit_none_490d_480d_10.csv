"I dont believe you can retire in ten years as a marketer. Internet said median salary was ~125000 for a marketing manager in 2015 (we will assume you entered the market at this wage, which is obviosly unrealistic). Without any debt, and assuming all of your living costs are provided for, that would only net you $1.25 million. Assuming you enter the industry at 25 and “retire” at 35, that would mean your 1.25 mil has to get you about 40 years. At an annualized return of 6%, that would net you $75,000 per year in interest (non-inflation adjusted) meaning you would be living well below the standard of living you enjoyed while employed.

Note that the assumptions we made to get even this far are obviously wildly optimistic to the point of being impossible. Telling this kid a career in marketing will realistically give you the chance of retiring after ten years is absolutely inappropriate; you are either benefitting from a wonderfully improbable life style or you are intentionally misleading him or her."

then keep doing what your doing. just don't expect different results. a lot of men will use a woman for easy non-committed sex if they have the opportunity. if you are enjoying casual sex with no commitment then good for you. if you are having sex with men that don't stick around afterward when you want a relationship then maybe you need to do something differently.
What about the fact that being extremely quiet makes some people around you uncomfortable? Why is only the introverts feelings and comfort important here and not the other people? Just curious. 
That's sexual assault. Rape by deception.

"I am happy to have voted for Trump and plan to do so in 2020. I could not have asked for more and am happy with the work done so far (SC, less regs, out of TPP, out of Paris Accord, ISIS dead, Korea on track to be one Korea, less taxes for me and 90% of working Americans, ending of the healthcare fine, NAFTA close to the chopping block). 

If the next year is anything like the last I will be amazed.

If you did not vote for him I will not insult you. I am an atheist, pro 1A pro 2A, pro gay marriage but think the state should not be a part of marriage at all, pro choice but want the choice made sooner not at 6 months, pro death penalty but the proof has to be solid as fuck so its rare, pro environment but anti EPA, and I want the DoE closed and spending cut on our military but the RoEs opened wide open so when we do go to war it is brutal and short and no nation building.

Also am in favor of UBI for all citizens (removing all social safety nets using the UBI as a replacement) while being extremely pro capitalism. I like the NFL minus the kneeling and think soccer is lame."

"There's an important distinction you're not making though. ""Why are you so ugly?"" is meant to be insulting and they ask with that intention. That is not neccesarily the case with ""Why are you so quiet?"" 

If people talk to you with those kinds of intentions, just tell them to fuck off. But if they just want to involve you in a conversation, then I see no reason for you to feel insulted. "

"Conversely, it's hard to have a conversation about gun laws with people who don't understand the proposed laws, and think the government is ""trying to disarm"" them. Or people who are ignorant of how they work in other countries, and that even though America is a different country, you can still take lessons from places that have actually reduced gun violence."
"&gt; Also, you are being downvoted for simply stating your fair opinion, and trying to have a discussion.

Hah I hadn't looked at this post in a while. -48 points as of this writing. I wonder which part that the downvoters have a problem with.

That it's not OK for women to hit men with the expectation that men will do nothing, or that women are naturally weaker than men?

 Men and women should not compete in sports against each other as it's just not fair to the women. A perfect example is the Williams sisters versus Karsten Braasch. They were both ranked #1 in woman's tennis and he was #203 in men's, and he just destroyed them. "

"I mean you can. You just have to keep track of the conversations mentally. You can think of it as having multiple threads in a single thread. It's quite confusing at first, but after a while you'll simply think ""Oh so we're talking about X today"" and going back to the argument at hand.

"Probably because it sucks. If they just made a classic-style *Pokémon* game where the ""map"" was the actual world but the rest of the gameplay was still traditional, it would be going just as strong today, maybe stronger.

One of the best parts of *Pokémon* is assembling and building up your team over time. Every individual caught matters. I don't give a fuck about catching 80 Rattatas in a row to harvest Rare Candies. I want to catch *one* Rattata and train it personally in battles until it becomes a Raticate with a personalized moveset."

"&gt;there are seriously so many things women take for granted

Lol, no they're not
There is a disproportionate amount of violence against us, like throughout the entire world, we don't get taken seriously for serious problems, and basically all the 'privileges' women have in this thread are rooted from misogyny, the idea that women are less or just not human at all. Our gender is so normally sexualized that you could go talk to any group of women or girls and at least one of them has a story of being harassed or assaulted. We literally live in a world that still hates us and we still don't have all of our rights. Women especially in third world countries. Then when we actually bring up our problems or try to get women elected to help people start going on about how she's going to be inferior for the job just because of her gender. 

Don't sit there and spout bullshit because you think women have it easier when we don't. Both men and women have gotten fucked by the patriarchy and actual feminists are trying to fix it. Women and men both face unfair problems because of the fact that women are seen as less. Surprise surprise having one gender be the 'dominant' one doesn't end up working out for either. "
