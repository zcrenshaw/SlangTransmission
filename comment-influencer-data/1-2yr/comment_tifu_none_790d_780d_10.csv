Title should probably say TIFU by allowing net neutrality to end
"I've often dreamed of being the only dude in a cluster of drunk, horny, rowdy women. Your grim tale reminds me of a wise saying: be careful what you wish for. "
TIFU by not being able to edit the title without special admin access
TIFU by not thinking enough about the title
Twist: This happened in 1942
"You didn't fuck up. You saved the puppy, you're a hero!"
Man thats so fucking unlucky hahaha.  One of those 'wish you had a reset button' moments.

"Get 1 square of toilet paper, and about a 2mm Ã— 6mm strip of aluminum foil  ( seasoning packet from ramen noodle soup is great ).  Make a bowl with the tp and drop foil in. Put in microwave and WATCH.  It will light in about 2 seconds. Pull out flaming TP and light up with it. 

Source -&gt;   I have been places. 

edit:  Many question regarding the places I have been so clarification incoming.

Q. Did you learn these tricks behind bars?
A. Yes

Q.  Prison?
A.  No.  I did a very brief stint in county (very brief).

Those points - and jailhouse skills - aside, the comments below display the true genius and determination of stoners without fire.  If the US really wants to get to Mars, just tells the stoners of the world there is free weed there.  Give them some pop rocks and sodas and they will get you there next week."
"Sirens man. They lure you in with naked bodies and try to drown you. It happens to all of us

"I especially love the part where he talks like 7 months ago is a ton of time where he really grew up and matured into an adult

Maybe it was a demonic cult and you were supposed to be a sacrifice.
this is the story about him getting kicked out of art school
Honestly the title dragged me in. I thought it was going to be a warning about some website taking advantage of it just to get your info. Then spam you with garbage. 
"Every man eventually learns this the hard way. A few months ago I was in a very similar situation - 6 girls and 2 guys (including myself) in an Airbnb with a sweet pool and hot tub and big beds. Sexy time? Nope! More like vomiting, crying, bruises, and one girl shitting herself

Not to mention a large chunk of time was spent complaining about how they're still single."
I still haven't ruled that option out
"Cats can be real fucking dicks.

No more face licks for Pink- ""privileges"" revoked!"
"I mean, there was no way I could have known about his hearing disability beforehand but I still felt awful shitty."

"Hmmm...what every man should *actually* learn is to become the bartender in that situation. Make the first round 'doubles' with lots of ice and little mix, and every round after that cut the alcohol by a half oz and add less ice until you're down to a 1/2oz of alcohol in a tall glass with lots of mix. They'll be buzzed off the first drink, think you make crazy-strong ones, assume every drink is like the last, but slowly be sobering up. So long as you're not making more than 2-rounds an hour, you should end up with a large group of rather frisky women who are sober enough to have consentual fun with, and a limited selection of *who* to have fun with. In my experience it leads to lots of attention for you, while you get to watch women who have ""never done this before"" start making out with eachother when you're otherwise preoccupied."
I'm a what now? :0
It's been ten minutes. 
"Dude, you need to work on your crowd control. If you're *ever* in a situation like that, *offer* to bar tend and pour drinks lite. If people are drinking vodka, poor half of it into a different bottle and hide it in a closet. Fill it back up with water. Refill it with a little more vodka and water as needed to prevent people from grabbing bottles you aren't monitoring, but if people are drunk too quickly, just throw your shoulders up in the air and give them some ""you girls really can drink!"" comment.  Drunk people never notice. The drunker they get, the more you can hand them watered down shit and pad their egos. This aides you two-fold; it lessens the chances of people over doing it quickly and it also aides to prevent the dehydration that follows alcohol. **NEVER** try and cut off someone who is already wasted. They take that shit as some sort of biblical challenge and will act like an 8 year old searching for xmas presents. Constantly tell everyone you're hungry. Make simple things like cheesy bread in the microwave, make pasta if noodles are sitting around. Order a pizza. Anything you can do to keep food in their stomach. If you have a close friend that you trust, invite them over for the added control and have their entry ticket be Taco Bell. Act like you are drinking the entire time, but spill and pour out as much as you can. Act like a frat boy if you have to and shotgun beers in the pool while having most of it just spill all over you. Still have a good time. Have a little to drink, flirt, be normal, you're going to need it. People almost always end up naked, run around and then puke all over things. I know I did. Accept the minute you see them drinking that you aren't getting laid. Right then and there. There are a few reason for this. Firstly, never have sex with a drunk person you haven't already been sexually active with. Second, it's more important that everyone is *safe* than it is to get laid. Lastly, when you wake up in the morning, the really drunk girl that tried to sleep with you will thank you for not sleeping with her. If this happens to be your crush, this is a great opportunity to ask for her phone number or a date. Do what you can as the night slows down to clean up. Cleaning up puke is bad enough, but puke that has been sitting for 8 hours is a recipe for new puke. Don't make the house spotless, just make it look like someone has cleaned. Every one of them will notice your hard work, but don't make it seem like your goal. You'll be thanked and invited over again. Eventually, you'll be a requirement for a girls night out. You'll be friend-zoned for that, but you'll also gain 5 wingmen. And I assure you, if you're a male, an attractive female is 1000 times better than any guy you know as a wingmen. Women know men will say about anything to get laid or get their buddies laid, but are much more prone to trust another woman's judgement. Oh, and if your female friends are on point when you go to bars, they'll make sure every guy that tries to buy them a drink, also buys you one. Great job though, it's never easy to deal with what you had to."

Tell your dad; take the hit. It is better that he flushes it there than gets caught with it. He is going to find out regardless the second he uses that aftershave.

"What is it with black cats and their demand for affection? Growing up I had a black kitten named Halloween. I'd come home from school and sit in front of the console TV for my afternoon cartoons, and he'd curl up in a ball in my lap for hours. If I was sitting, there he was.

Fast forward 3 1/2 decades past his untimely demise (heartworms, poor thing.) I have a female black cat that is nervous around everyone, hides under the table, and is generally anti-social...until I sit down. Once my rear hits the couch, she jumps up and lies next to me, head in my lap. Refuses to move for any reason.

Apparently, I'm a cat whisperer..."

Op probably misunderstood. Cat bites are some of the worst as far as infection goes. Their thin teeth can act like needles and deposit bacteria in places that can't easily be cleaned out.

"Problem is cats don't learn that way. Dogs will learn who the ""alpha"" is but cats just... don't care. The only way to ""punish"" a cat is to make sure they don't know *you're* doing it - they think that a specific action is just joined by the world punishing them. If they see you involved, they just think you're an asshole.

ITT: People think their cats are special"
"That is a deaf person's entire life in a nutshell. Lack of communication is the norm. We often need to split information into two categories: what is the essential must know? what is not important? Ultimately it boils down to, how often can I ask somebody a question before they become sick of being our window to the hearing dominated world? Then do the best with what you have at your disposal. If you don't, you will get frustrated with everyone. Very tiring process.

Edit: Grammar correction and to say thanks for learning how to apologize in ASL :)"
"I don't think cats have venom, but there are lots of bacteria in their mouths that could cause an infection. That's probably why the doctor prescribed antibiotics. Venom is not treated by antibiotics, but by specific anti-venoms (idk if that's the right word, English is my second language). 

My cat bites me sometimes but now I know he doesn't really mean it, as it hurts but it never bled. 

Anyways, good luck on your recovery, it actually looks pretty painful. The cuts are very clean so hopefully they'll heal well! "
"Trust me, I'm paying for it."
None of their behavior points to tripping balls. Maybe if you don't know fuck all about psychedelics I guess.
