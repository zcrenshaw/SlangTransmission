"No need to keep guilding, he's got a lifetime supply already."
I‚Äôm surprised Spez took you to lunch. 20 is a bit old for his taste.
Every once in a while cancer gets it right.
"The kid from Pixar's Up grew up.

And got cancer."
"Yeah its pretty bad, please guild me?"
You couldn't be more than the embodiment of.what every reddit user looks like
You're dying and you ask for a shitty meme lunch? If I were you I'd have wished for a girlfriend.
Nope. 
"I head comms at Reddit, can confirm."
At least there will be a small window of time where you're skinny.
I didn't know cancer could spread outside the body
I tried but the people at Reddit cant work wonders.
"Jokes aside, I hope you're at peace brother. My father has terminal cancer and I've watched it kill him physically and mentally. Its good to see you in high spirits. Is there a link to your bucket list? I work for a large corporation and may be able to help fulfill a wish or 2."
You look like a high school teacher fired for fucking students.
"Oh you think you're special with your red username? **YOU HAVE NO POWER HERE**

^^^just ^^^kidding ^^^pls ^^^no ^^^shadowban"
Wow Reddit HQ! Your bucket list must be truly amazing...
"They probably just let you visit for some easy good pr, not because they feel bad for you."
Guess that means you aren't getting laid today either
I always wondered what the little piggy that stayed home looked like.
If having lunch with spez was your wish you kind of deserve to have cancer 
Thanks but I think I need the neck beard to complete it. 
Yeah its a race to see who will get you first - the neckbeard or the cancer.
Your nose has a nose
Amen brother!
"&gt;Is there a link to your bucket list? I work for a large company and may be able to help fulfill a wish

Oh, you work at KFC? "
This is the worst and best roastme post of all time 
Looks like Stewie from Family Guy after his transition. 
I'm sure /u/spez has some nice things to say about Chris
Maybe if you didnt take 6 hours to look like every other white chick youd realize you spelled roast wrong. 
Yeah it sucks that even being a Disney character and still getting cancer.
You‚Äôve got plenty of friends on your forehead to keep you company.  
I bet you meet a lot of dickheads being a dwarf and all. 
I hope you don‚Äôt die man.
"This is too much even for our r/RoastMe rules. 

Banned

^^^no"
"I'm sorry man, I can't bring myself to roast you. 

At least not when a crematorium will do it for me in a few months."
You forgot to say how many days you‚Äôve been sober.
"""dumb asian loves white boys"" sounds like my last pornhub search"
"Do you have any regrets..I mean, other than that hair cut?"
Cool hot wheels next to you for scale!
Showing cleavage isn‚Äôt going to distract us from the train wreck that is your face. 
BASTARD! TAKE THAT BACK!!!
FACTS!
For a swedish girl you seem to have a lot of Finnish on your face....
Just grab the money off the dresser and leave please. 
Why are you asking us to roast you? Cancer beat us all to the punch. 
Yeah I think it upped my fatality rate by 10000 fold! &lt;3 /u/spaz
They gave it to you at yours.
"Get back to work, you have three days left to finish building those toys!"
"Gets dumped before the holidays, better show my tits to the internet."

Hi Dave. My name is diet and exercise. We've never met. 
"If Make-A-Wish wishes can underachieve, this one over achieved in that department. "

Some things are so unfair. Born retarded and now cancer. 
This is the guy who goes on naked and afraid just to finally see a naked girl.
You look like an attractive girl in a face swap with Kurt Russell

Her parents must be furious with the one child policy 
Living proof that you become what you post. 
"You tried to show off your cleavage as a distraction and to show yourself ""I'm too hot to be roasted"" but it's easy to tell those are some pancake tits in a pushup bra. Congrats, you're shallow, unattractive *and* your knockers will be even with your belly button by 30."
Next on time on fake taxi...
You look like the son Michael Jackson was disappointed in. 
"You definitely shouldn't. She can't even spell ""roast"" "
Out of curiosity can you actually ban a reddit admin from a subreddit? I volunteer /u/spez as the test dummy 
"Just like your dad, Santa won‚Äôt be stopping by this year either. "

I guess the beauty sleep didn‚Äôt work. 
You're the type of girl that would fake the pregnancy AND abortion.
A quick glance at your profile shows this is the second time you have done this which just says that you‚Äôre so utterly starved of attention that you actually think giving people a peek at a bit of your tits might start to change things in the obvious train wreck that your life has become. It won‚Äôt. It won‚Äôt make your mother love you or erase the memory of all the men who molested you and didn‚Äôt call. The only bright spots here are on your chin.
"Re-posts can kill, be warned!"

Well hey! With all these qualifications you don't even have to go looking for a job after high school!

The only looking you will have to do is look into the camera and blow a kiss after he finishes!

If herpes had a face.
Poor /u/spez didn‚Äôt sign up to get roasted lmao
I bet your clit is bigger than your boyfriend's dick.
Stage manager.....you mean gets paid to fuck the band? 
Yeah. The cleavage has to be.. You know.. Desirable.. to do that. 
"I shit you not, type in ""weird emo guy"" on google and it is legitimately a bunch of guys who look exactly like you. You are a complete fucking stereotype of subculture-obsessed mediocrity.

"You're seriously depressed but in denial, hiding behind this mask of being ""scene"" or ""emo"" just so that you have a group of ""friends"" that accept you because you're your own clique of rejects, making a subconscious decision to dress and act like a degenerate, because that's how much you've committed to this act you put on. 

You could have easily taken the extra minute to put some minimal effort into making the sign, but instead you choose to take the easy way out, like you have your whole life. 

You could have sat for an extra minute and put in the effort to take a proper photo, back straight, shoulders square and confident smile. You could have made yourself look presentable, maybe even showered. You could take care of yourself, but instead you take the easy way out, because you're lazy. 

You wallow in your own depression, refusing to take measures to manage it. You decide to point out how you fail to do the most basic of self maintenance, by pointing out your shitty writing and inability to hold a sheet of paper properly, lending easy points to roast just so that you can have someone tell you bluntly what's wrong with you and laugh it off as if it's something you can afford to ignore.
