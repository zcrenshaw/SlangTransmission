Probably not using the word bitch... Asshole or another less gender specific term might be better when dealing with gender roles being shitty
"How did I have to get this far down in the comments to find this answer??? It's the obvious biggest thing. Somehow totally commonplace to slice off part of a baby boy's genitals, but suggest the same for a girl, even for religious reasons, hell, even if she's old enough to *agree* to it, and HOLY SHIT!"
So? It's not women's responsibility to cover up what men sexualize. And you seriously don't think that women don't stare at men playing shirts vs. skin?
I mean... Have you ever watched an episode of Celebrity Juice?
"If you think beer is disgusting, you're going to have relinquish your man card there, buddy."
Electing crackheads
"If you were really economically depressed you would have qualified for federal grants like Pell and FSEOG just to name a couple

Also each state has grants that they offer to low income residents of the states.

I call bullshit on your story"
Care to give sources? I would also try looking up the amount of Christians that feel the same as well. Cause I'm sure it's not an insignificant amount.
It's times like this that I appreciate *South Park* as a show that pretty much runs on telling the PC police to go fuck themselves.

"Why would you even initiate as a woman, just wait for a man to do it"
"The reason is difficulty.  It is not difficult at all for a woman, ugly or pretty or fat or skinny, to find a man to have sex with her.  It is difficult for man to find a woman to have sex with.  

If a man walks into a bar and says 'who wants to fuck', he will get no takers normally.  If a woman walks into a bar and does the same, somebody will fuck her."
Huh.
"a bit like saying we could take out seatbelts since ""you could just not drive too fast or get distracted?"""
"Haha are you serious? There are more errors than you're claiming, and even then trying to quantify the errors isn't the issue. One error can make a huge difference in the meaning of a sentence/phrase. "
No job is underpaid. You are paid exactly what you are worth and agree to get paid.
I'm afraid I can't stand her voice - it's like nails down a blackboard to me. 
Honestly. I think he is becoming a bit to unhinged. He would have been more effective 20 years ago.
"Okay, so this one example suddenly makes her insane? Maybe she was just having a rough time adjusting to high school. If someone saw me at my lowest when I was addicted to porn they'd write me off too. I remember I was using my parents credit cards to pay for private shows with camgirls (they didn't know this yet) when I won an hourlong skype roleplaying show with my favorite model (who I was convinced I was going to marry because she laughed at all my jokes and I felt her laughter was genuine) along with two other members.

The problem was that my internet was running like shit and I found out it was because my mom was using her laptop to watch a livestream of her sisters funeral (she died back in England and my mom couldn't make it home) even though mom was sobbing I just angrily demanded she turn off her computer and when she refused I screamed ""fuck you!!!"" and picked up her laptop and threw it at the brick fireplace base. Then grabbed my laptop and ran and locked myself in the background while trying to ignore my screaming parents. I had cam-to-cam so the look on the models face as she heard the screaming and pounding on the door as I repeatedly screamed ""not listening I fucking hate you all lalalalalal!!!"" while angrily beating off, was fucking priceless. 

I ended up passing out and had to be taken to the hospital (I had been on the tail end of a 30 hour beatoff marathon) apparently I almost died haha. After an interview with a psychiatrist I was put in a mental institution for 5 months. Now, you would've called me insane then but I'm all better now and have a good job and am engaged to a beautiful woman and things couldn't be better between me and my folks. But if someone were to watch a vid of me on the night of my freakout they would wrongly conclude that I'm an unsalvageable asshole. People change dude"
"What do you mean by 'delegitimize'? I'm a psych student, I know all about Gender Identity Disorder, I believe they have a mental illness and deserve professional treatment. What I dont believe is calling a man a woman simply because he believes he is one."
"&gt;Bisexual degenerate

Fucking dropped!  kek"
"Unless he raped her while she was drunk or on some kind of other drugs, how is that not just having sex?"
Black out info regarding your location
"Probably because you're not a bitter, insecure person who constantly frowns at everybody they meet. People don't seem to understand that a smile shows respect, and it's no wonder that someone would tell you to smile. It's so they can have a regular conversation without feeling like they've done something wrong."
Guess your didn't only get to ride horses that summer. 
"Yeah, I know. What I meant was, imagine if one day you look like Clark Kent and the next day you looked like someone off The Wire; wouldn't people be more fearful of you, even if you behaved exactly the same?"

"Wow! You're a lazy little brat for openning your lazy know-nothing mouth without doing a single ounce of fact checking first.

And guess what, asshole: don't be surprised people aren't nice to you when the first and only thing you said to them was you being a snotty little twat who ALSO happened to be totally, embarrassingly wrong at the same time.

So yeah, thank YOU for stopping by, saying *nothing* of value, being a rude little bitch, then acting like you're the victim. Fuck you."
And we came back to save your ass later
Call it like it is and just call OP out for being full of shit. As if a bunch of kids would attempt to climb 15m over rocks. OP is most likely exaggerating. 
"No we don't. Stop consuming bullshit biased American media and learn to think for yourself.

Or let me try a different tactic. Prove it."
"Yeah, I'm sure it's at least partly a social construct, but the fact is that men will be more attracted to women who look more feminine. If women without leg hair are 'available', they will gravitate towards them."
Assrape Trump.
"hahaha i'm your worst nightmare dude, a wealthy educated self-employed Independent who could shit all over whatever you throw at me, tool"
I can see why you're worried then!

"Er, we just gave you billions to spend on whatever you fancy.

You have the same liberties as everyone else apart from where your own mongy politicians want them gone (gay marriage etc).  So what do we do?  Tell me? Take away your right to self govern a bit because you're during stupid shit and inventing daft rules - or keep your right to self govern and have you moan about having to live with stupid shit?  Whats your plan?"

I'm sure theism impairs people's ability to assimilate in society.
"&gt;I mean...you don't have to agree with her politics but she's a former secretary of state, senator, and was a highly successful attorney prior to entering politics.  

&gt;she has more qualifications than lots of other candidates.

Comedy gold right here! Thanks, I needed a good laugh. "
"Yeah besides being self reports, it doesn't even match the divorce numbers of 33%. And again, that's how many are willing to stand up in court and say they cheated.  You can pretty safely double the divorce number. "
"The Cash version sucks, I don't know why people went nuts over it. Trent Reznor said Cash can have it because it felt like he stole it and made it his own. Cash is an asshole and I have no sympathy for him. "

Lol, no it absolutely isn't... "
Lol ok
"Yeah, it is. At a certain point I get tired of being the bigger person. "
"Let's put it this way; the onerous is on the guy, who initiated the whole interaction to begin with, to know what is and is not okay.  If he can't figure that out, then he should keep it much, MUCH more low key.  Initiator = burden of understanding."

I have never understood people who do the latter. How and why.

"My cousins had a similar incident, they're two girls and my uncle generally hates everyone but he especially hated this guy. This guy was the guy that everyone invited to parties and out to places, trusted him with their kids. People would leave their children with him when they went away, he had a game room, water slip and slide, would but the kids toys, food, and clothes, take kids camping or swimming, etc. The town thought he was a star, except for my uncle who's basically the grinch. When i went to stay with my uncle and cousins on the school holidays the guy was having this massive slumber party for the kids for some christmas thing.

The guy even came to the house to invite us and my uncle told him to fuck off. Later it was found out the guy molested like 12 children, he only got a short jail and during that time one of the girls he molested killed herself, when he was released he was mysteriously found dead in a river with broken bones and a slit throat, yet the girl's name was carved into his forehead."
Little do you know... he was just stunned you dissapeared.  He probably told all his friends he saw superwoman escape before his very eyes. 
"He didn't smoke, you dolt. "
Nope. Just normal guys. Enjoy limiting yourself to a small pool of fetishists. 
"Man ignorance is so bliss. You thinking she wouldn't have done the same to your marriage, and you two would've lived happily ever after. Maybe one day you'll realize the massive bullet you dodged. "

"If you're not an unhygenic lazy fuck, it looks good on you. Don't see the confusion really. "
"They're called family *secrets* for a reason; they're meant to be kept within the famly. Once you blab them to reddit in exchange for useless internet points, not only do you prove that your'e an inherently untrustworthy person, but but they're also no longer secret at that point. "
Indeed.
"Well maybe they are cheating too? I don't think I've ever cheated on anyone who hasn't also been cheating on me too. It's just called being young. It might be the biggest thing in the world at the time, but to get over it and grow up stronger."
... What did I get myself into
"Twenty years and an entire lifetime, but you still seem hurt. There is no forgiveness in your words and you still carry this with you. It is difficult to truly let go of something, but twenty years living with an elephant in the room sounds a lot more difficult.  
  
  My ex wife cheated, apparently a lot and in a very short time.. it demolished my ability to trust, until I got help and did my own research. I didn't want to obsess, worry or fear that my new partners were out to hurt me.  
  
  Long story short, my current fiance did some lying about a number of things early on in our relationship. All precursors to the potential for cheating. We fought a lot for a long time.. mostly because I was subconsciously battling with myself to trust her. We had a huge blowout about 4 months back that almost ended us for good.. But I had to think. I had to let go. I had to let the past be past and allow myself to love her, through all her mistakes and flaws.  
  
  Let go of your baggage or let go of your relationship. The toxicity has already ruined twenty years of your life. Should is also have control of the next twenty?"
Just don't date or marry. Trust no one
"Your President allowed ISIS to get as bad as they are, your choice of President last year is married to a rapist and she and the last POTUS helped aid terrorism for a narrative that Obama had destroyed terrorism in Benghazi.

Your party pushes for violence and calls for murder, your side advocates killing babies so people don't have to take responsibility for their choices, and your side makes excuses for Islam which has the worst human rights violations in the world.

So I think the left is what will be pleasing Satan the most."
People who make generalizations like you do are the reason we wear MAGA hats.

You don't smoke.

Seriously, that's all it is. The only way to stop smoking is to...not smoke."

I'm referring to people who buy shoes for hundreds of dollars simply because they're associated with some basketball player.
