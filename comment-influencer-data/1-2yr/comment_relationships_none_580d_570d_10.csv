"&gt; But I hold grudges like a Tolkien character so I have to remind myself others are more the forgive and forget type.

You might be me. I still hold a grudge against the girl that gave me warts on my hand when I was 6 that I had to get burnt off. 

Thank you for the advice on over-communication and expectations, I think I will show him your comments. We are both tired of talking about it (and I'm sick of crying about it) but he seems to think the weekly Friday lunches are just par for the course when it makes me feel sick. "
"What the shit. How on earth does she have a career in a creative field with this attitude to feedback?
As someone who works in a creative field, I want to let you know that if your feedback was at all phrased like it is in this post; it was fair; it was what she asked for, and above all; you gave her great suggestions that could be useful as heck. "

"I haven't bothered to access my children's emails since they were 12, and I wouldn't have done so unless I had a significant belief they were at risk of harm. Your mother has no reason to access your college account and could possibly harm credit records or your reputation at college by having access to your accounts. Under **NO** circumstances except ill health should an adult let another adult have password access to their personal email accounts.

"If you're not comfortable talking to your family about her behavior, definitely do not trust them with details about your new home or job.

"There's no way she's paying her fair share in groceries when your rent is $1,215 plus internet and any other utilities.

"Can you give me a better option at this point? He has all the mental health professionals we can afford at his disposal, I'm trying to work with his school on a daily basis, we have given him every chance we can think of and he refuses.

If my wife leaves and I stay, my current job is no longer enough money to keep my house so we'll lose that, and we owe more than it's worth so I'll be financially in a hole and become a single parent going through a divorce I don't want to go through while dealing with the fact I again gave up my dream job and have a kid who tells me it's not fair he doesn't get a car when he turns 16 and my old iPhone 7 isn't good enough for him, it needs to be new or nothing and how rotten I am to him because I take away his phone and make him listen to stupid teachers.

I don't think I can mentally do this. I'm massively depressed and losing my house, wife, and having to be a single parent isn't going to go well. Might as well become an alcoholic like my mother because I can't see any way to successfully do that when he refuses to work with me at all.

Do you have a better suggestion? I'm no rich and can't afford a boarding school for him.

I gave up ever being a kid to try and help him. I never went out during high school because I was home feeding him when my mom was too drunk to wake up. I spent my college loan money to buy him clothes and food while I went to college because my mom blew it on men and alcohol. I've given every ounce of help to him I can and he isn't grateful or helpful whenever there are any consequences at all.

Please if you have better advice on what a third option would be I'd die to hear it. I don't know what else to do and this job means so much to me. He was welcome to join us if he could literally go a month without serious problems. In the 7 months we've been planning this he hasn't succeeded in that for more than 2 weeks and it's escalated to having police called on him at school in the last month. "
"Lol, okay, thank you. Maybe I’m overthinking it."
He sounds like a jerk tbh. You aren't HIS maid in reality. Please stop taking care of him and treating him like a child.

"Your point of view is based on nothing but your perceived moral high ground.

It is quite disgusting to see you judge him like this."
"Listen to this, OP. Her behaviour is extreme, serious, highly abnormal. Worst case scenario: this could escalate into a family annihilation multiple murder. Be careful, be cautious, seek urgent mental health care for her, and prioritise the safety of you and your children at all times. 

Female family annihilators are rare, but it happens. And untreated, serious mental health issues are usually in the picture when it does. Of course I am not saying this is *necessarily* the path she is going down, but it could be. Get help for her right now. "
"Wow, this is like THE WORST ADVICE IN THE FUCKING WORLD. Are you projecting? Are you beating the shit out of women and trying to justify it? Are you trying to hit a full bingo on 'how to tell a woman to stay in a clearly abusive fucked up relationship? because you sound like a screaming idiot.

Sweet Jesus, can someone erase this terrifying and stupid comment asking this woman to stay in a relationship where her lover TRIED TO SUFFOCATE HER? Holy fuck, what is wrong with you??"

"I said he's dictating who she talks to PRIVATELY. And he is, by insisting his wife has to tell him everything his sister said."

"Wow. Like, how dare you have any portion of your life which is not about the guy you've been with less than a year. How dare you have relationships and activities that don't depend on him.

No, he's not being reasonable by complaining. Yes, you're being reasonable by going.

"Just let it go. Confronting it would make it worst. Everybody says that it's a myth that women and men can be friends. Some girls try, and it really bums you out when it turns out the guy had other intentions.  You start questioning everything about the friendship, ""Did he do it because he is my friend or because he likes me?"" It's awkward.


If anything, you can explain that you just wanted to be honest about your feelings but that you didn't mean to make things awkward. That you aren't expecting anything and that you would gladly forget about the whole thing and go back to how things were. "
"Imagine you had a kid with a health condition which might mean he or she was at a constant risk if they just did normal stuff at school? You wouldn't be happy if they risked their health would you? Neck injuries can be very serious and can end in paralysis or worse, in other words, death.

Ask you parents to write you out a simplified version of your condition. Nothing too technical, just what's likely to happen to you in the future. You do have a right to know but they may be trying to hide the worst from you due to your young age. 

When you have the full diagnosis from them do some online research so you know all the facts. Your parents are likely terrified you will damage yourself doing sports and that you will end up in a wheelchair or worse. It sucks but you will need to take it easy in some respects to make sure you stay health as long as possible.

 "
Very well said. I was wondering when someone was going to raise this point.
"&gt;it's always the woman that takes the blame when people don't like the wedding or something legitimately goes wrong.

So. Much. This.

It's also the bride that everyone runs to with questions/problems/drama. It's the bride who figures out the guest list, tracks the guest list. It's the bride who gets inundated with umpteen million questions about attire (check the website), location (check the website), time (check the website), travel stuff (check the *fucking website*). It's the bride who bears all the brunt of the dramz of other people (and there is somehow always dramz). Want a casual wedding? FMIL will have a shitfit and meltdown and blame it on the bride even if it was the groom's request. Want a formal wedding? Friends will have a meltdown and blame it on the bride. Want wedding colors of green and yellow? Too fucking bad, asshole, because half the wedding party hates those colors and are going to refuse it and the bride is going to be a ""bridezilla"" that everyone hates and makes faces at when she walks in the room because she stuck with her decision.

It is a constant nonstop research-figure-decide-get bitched at-reevaluate-defend decision process that continues the entirety of the planning.

One of my regrets was that I took on 99% of the planning when it was 99% my SO who wanted the fucking wedding. I wanted the courthouse experience, he wanted Big White Wedding, but I was the one who planned every.single.detail. Answered every question. Took every call. Handled every email. Tracked every detail. All of it.

And the day of the wedding? I was still doing all of it. Not by choice or because I didn't have ""designated people"" but because they just kept coming to me over and over anyway. 

If he had had one single complaint the day of the wedding I would have shredded the marriage license and stabbed him at the alter. (He didn't, luckily, and he was very, very grateful.) "
i'm just baffled. She should have just asked him out like a normal human!!! 
Threats to cheat always go over well.
"One way to show you are serious about not having children, ever, is to get a vasectomy.  You may or may not have to shop around to find a doctor who will perform it on you at your age, I don't know."
It's not even coworker relationship. It's having another male in your life as a friend but respecting that boundary and the discomfort your SO has for that friend. Texting from time-to-time and going to lunch is OK. What's not OK is talking on phone/texting late at night and going out for drinks 1-2x a week alone together. Especially if he has a family too. That just implies something on his side as well.  
"There's a difference between accusing and asking. If you asked your bf if he had someone in his room the night of the wedding in a relatively casual way without loaded language and he blew up on you, I'd be incredibly suspicious. If you accused him (""So I heard you slept with somebody else"") and he became defensive, it's more understandable. 

Either way, I have a hard time believing your friend would lie. It's just too irrational, you know? He gambles on whether or not you'll even leave your bf. He risks his relationship with you. He puts himself in the middle of a lot of drama, and you mention that that would be out of character for him. 

I really don't know, OP. I think I'd be with my friend on this one, but it's a hard call. Best of luck. "
Oh she also considered herself his work wife. Like no joke she think she did nothing wrong.
"Dude you sound like you're in a really bad place. I think you need to talk to a therapist and possibly check yourself in somewhere. I can't imagine the sense of betrayal you feel about your wife, but the phrase, ""I'll inevitably do something that would ruin the rest of my and my children's life,"" is pretty scary. Leave her immediately if you have to and do what you can to sort yourself out, hurting her won't give you anything."
"""There was also no reason to move flowers to the weekend, that has nothing to do with cooking her dinner.""

I can definitely see why he kept that for the weekend. I think OP was trying to construct a ""good date"" which flowers definitely figure in to that. Should he have given her the flowers on her birthday with hind sight definitely. But there was definitely a reason why he kept it bundled in with the date."
"RK accused JJ of just completely making the event up tho. If he really was with a girl, just helping her get back to her room or something innocuous like you said, wouldn't he have just explained that when I spoke to him? "
"&gt; ""I told her that I feel stuck and I don't know what to tell my Dad""

I get what you mean but that isn't quite the way it is. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I'm fine with not buying THIS piece of land, and I'm sure my Dad is as well, but WE (the wife and I) need to decide where it goes from here. Should he keep looking for property for US to buy, or not?

&gt; Also, how far away is the land from your house?

Its about an hour drive. It is a long ways away, but it is just a few miles from where we used to hunt, and actually only a few miles from her parents house."
Your boyfriend doesn’t see women as having value outside of what he can take from them. He only values you because you give him emotional support and sex. Huge red flag. He’s a misogynist.
"I didn't think I could go through the hotel tapes anyway, ha. 

It's occurred to me that probably should have provided more details into JJ's claims in the main post. Didn't expect this many questions. 

According to JJ, he was out partying with some of the other guys but returned to the hotel early to escort a friend of his to his room because he got completely hammered. I've talked to this guy and the only thing he could confirm was that he was indeed hammered and didn't remember much else about the night.

So apparently JJ helped his friend to his hotel room and as he was leaving spotted RK heading to the elevators with some girl. He said they seemed a little tipsy and they had their ""hands all over"" each other as they got onto the elevator. 

I did not return to the hotel room that night. Possibly JJ didn't want to upset me in wake of the wedding with all the stuff that was going on (that was his reason for not telling me the next day when he saw me at the wedding), but I agree that he should've called me immediately so I could catch them in the act. "
"I would think someone with kinks would have a strong grasp on the ideas of consent &amp; limits. It sounds like he doesn’t, since he won’t accept your boundary &amp; instead keeps pushing it. I understand that you otherwise really like him, so you’re trying to downplay this one issue, but ignoring a blatant warning that your partner won’t respect your boundaries is not a great idea. 

For what it’s worth, there is a time for ultimatums. This is the time. You need to respect &amp; take care of yourself, if he won’t do it. Insist that he adhere to your boundaries, or walk &amp; find someone who will. "
"Could ""hands all over"" each other mean ""she had his arm around his shoulder and he was helping her get back to her room"" or some other innocuous thing? Or something a little bit over the line but not outright cheating?

I ask because it occurs to me that JJ could have unconsciously exaggerated an innocent situation in his mind. So he's honestly convinced RK cheated partially because he wanted to be convinced, and RK is rightfully indignant because he didn't.

And JJ saw them go into an elevator and seems to have made an unfounded mental leap, assuming he was taking her back to his room? Seems like he might have just seen what he wanted to see.

Just a hypothesis though. Good luck. "
That third one actually might be a really good solution! That way my little brother in law won't be too upset when we take it with us.
"How are you not understanding what you did wrong? I'm starting to feel like you're just trolling us.

"I'd regale OP with some of my post-embolism nightmare stories and all the shit I went through that led to my PTSD diagnosis, but apparently I have no credibility since it was medical and not war. Yay?"

"&gt; chuffed with how he looks in the sunnies

this is adorable"
There's like twenty things you're reaching/projecting on here that aren't mentioned in the post and it's more than a little rude.
"Breaks are dumb and almost always just an excuse to sleep with other people and come off as single/recently broken up to the person they want to sleep with. This relationship is probably over, but either way you need to talk to him and tell him the break isn't working out. "
Yeah. My mother has rheumatoid arthritis. I to did research if I remember right no large scale testing has been done regarding a vegan diet. Only small studies of which the results have been mixed. He has to just accept there is no cure just reduction of symptoms. And if you have a mild case it really shouldnt affect your life to much in what you can do with the right treatment. I guess you can ask to see his sources and explain why they are not correct.
"Haha yea I'm a sugar baby and I think she's in for a rude awakening. 


It's also noted that guys who pay for your underwear don't exactly make legit SDs. They're closer to Johns and on average those men do not have the income to make for generous SDs. You want the guys who will take you out to nice dinners and treat you with a gift or two before he proposes a sugar arrangement--that is if they didn't meet on a sugaring website. I would be surprised if his proposals even pans out. 


As for the relationship, if there ever was a time for ultimatum this would be it. He clearly draws the line at any sexual contact and she's going down that path whether she knows and believes that or not. "
"The issue is that her SIL lied.  The other stuff is peripheral.  They made an agreement, she went back on it, in a big, expensive way and OP is mad and everybody is telling her that her boundary is stupid.  It doesn't matter if other people think it's stupid, what matters is that SIL isn't trustworthy and the OP doesn't want to deal with people like that.  "
"Not everyone wants, needs, or can handle kids. Doesn’t have much to do with being “tough” or “resilient”. OP is being honest with himself about what he wants for his future. I don’t think that means he should be condemned to being alone, even if he does ultimately have to leave his wife.  There are plenty of people out there who jive with the no kids vibe. "

"This is probably one of those ""suck it up and take it to your grave"" type things unless you want to utterly shatter your marriage and your wife's faith and trust in you. 

If the guilt is really driving you insane, I guess you have a choice to make. Bury it deeper or dig it up."
"What would have been a good response to ""why""? You really put him on the spot like that."

Why do people keep reposting my story? This is my post from November 2017. In the end it didn't work out with Hannah and we broke up.
She should be with someone who finds that rule a turn-on. Those guys exist.
It's actually pretty simple to understand if you have even a shred of empathy.
"So nobody else also shares his major? Those are the only two? Something tells me there are numerous other students that share his major, yet he's CHOOSING to spend all that time with HER. 

This is a lost cause, OP."
"Respectfully, I’m not sure I agree with him just not understanding. It’s not difficult to grasp the concept of a fluctuating disease, especially when he has a chronic illness himself. 

I have quite severe joint hypermobility syndrome, scoliosis, rigidity in my c spine that’s caused massive nerve entrapment and have had fibromyalgia since the jhs started when I was 12. As well as the myriad umbrella symptoms that comes under those conditions.

I look completely fine but regularly spend days in agony, or continuous discomfort, or will have discomfort from near enough any movement. I also have rare, shiny days when I feel good and little hurts. I am the definition of invisible, fluctuating illness. 

My So *could not* be more understanding about this, particularly where sex is concerned. His body is as healthy and well maintained as you get, but he has no difficulty with the basic empathy required to understand that my experience of life is different to his, and my body betrays me, often. "
Yeah agreed. How you dress says nothing about your sex life. Plus it's weird how he immediately thought about that. 
"All your posts on here seem to be along the lines of 'it's fine if men are gay as long as they dress and act the way I believe men should', and defending the fiance according.

"I've known and been friends with several teachers. Most teachers who say they are burned out are burned out by the administration, subject (grade?), or other more admin type issues. Most people who go into teaching are drawn to it and want to stay.

And so they look around, change grades, change schools, change students, whatever and BAM, they love it again.

Lack of support from his partner also isn't helping.

OP.... I'm not sure if staying with her is the best idea. I wish you luck. "
"That's what I mean. Mother sounds toxic, was banned from the wedding, mother twisted it into ""oh your evil brother didn't invite ANY of us, what a coward how could he do this to his FAMILY???!!?!?"""
"He went to the wife, not to other co-workers. How it got to the co-workers is still up in the air, but the general consensus is the co-workers formed their own conclusions based on how they both act. "
Exactly this girl could’ve gone gotten a masters degree before he even graduated high school 
"You're mixing your terms there pals. 13-year-old girls may be children, but they're still women. Just not *adult* women, which is probably what you're going for, as you're trying to parallel women with children. Therefore their issues - all of them - are very much women's issues."
"&gt;it’s obvious he’s rebelling at home, the act of a child, maybe he likes having a mommy instead of a wife

It's only obvious you went off the deep end on extrapolation here. Everyone has flaws. Good partners push each other to be better and get each other's backs on shortcomings. Sometimes that can go too far and be enabling bad behavior, but unless you know the person you're responding to better than I do, you are projecting a ton onto their husband off just a few flaws.

Fuck that. Babies don’t belong in a movie theater. You’re ruining it for everyone else

"You don't get to decide this because you can't control other people.

"I strongly disagree with some of the sentiments in this post.

&gt;Your medical history is yours to disclose when you see fit

This is true up to a point. But when your relationship becomes serious and you start building a life together, it becomes repugnant to keep your medical history from your partner--and this is true whether the history in question is transgenderism, mental disorders, heart disease, or whatever else. 

&gt;If she really loves you she will find a way to move forward

This is also a flat-out misleading, willfully ignorant statement. She could also have her heart broken because her boyfriend lied to her about an important topic. This is a thing with which many people are just fundamentally incompatible, and it is offensively wrong to characterize that incompatibility (if it exists here) as failure to ""really love"" OP.

Bluntly: Don't sugar coat it for OP, and don't make it out as though OP's girlfriend is wrong for ending the relationship over this, if she chooses to do so.

Ideally she'd have no issue with this and, being asexual, sexual incompatibility will not be an issue. But that may well not happen.

Let me just be super clear here: OP is not wrong for being transgender. He is wrong for misleading his girlfriend of two years. "
"Yea, I have looked into that. The problem is that animal control is not very responsive in my area until there’s an actual bite or damage. 

I also don’t want to burn bridges honestly. This is my last semester in school and I don’t want to make an enemy of my neighbor because the stress would be a lot to handle. "
"For me, a little chastisement from the right person has been tremendously helpful in recategorising something from a ""whoops, oh well"" to ""oh, I see why this is important."" That in turn impacts how much effort I put into avoiding making the same error."
"Yeah same. This is the point of no fucking return for me, I would go scorched Earth once everything was taken care of and let everyone know she left a cat to fucking die in a pile of filth. But I'm also a hardcore bitch so..."
"Write a post very similar to this one above and either give them a letter, email, or text of it. You could write that you feel weird/nervous about talking but you needed to let them know. They will most likely want to talk to you straight after but if there’s anything you find uncomfortable just say so and say you’re confused about the situation or however else you feel. 

I remember going to my mum about a similar incident when I was younger. I was so nervous and confused I could barely speak. I don’t even remember exactly what I said, but my mum handled it all for me and said I didn’t need to be alone around that person again if I didn’t feel safe. I hope this gets handled well for you too. "
"Just because your mother developed a health problem doesn't magically make her a kind, generous, turstworthy person. You'd be justified in maintaining your distance. Your mental health comes first."

"What about empowering him to control the experiences of his son? Framing it that way, that he can actively control his child’s experience by not having his son in contact with them and modelling what good relationships look like is important. And ask him if his son was an adult and dealing with this from his wife’s family or his own what he would do. 

I mean, he can continue to enable this and have his son taking his grandchildren to visit them in the future, or he can stop this cycle. He has power and agency here. "
You can tell the post is fake because of the way it is. 
"I suspect she had issues losing weight and decided it's ""healthier"" to be bigger -or- she had some variety of eating disorder and has now decided you do, too.

"100% OP needs individual therapy. There is a reason she picked a jealous, selfish asshole. If she doesn’t figure out why that happens and fix it, it will just keep happening. "
That’s odd. The cookie cutter where I live included your residence and anywhere you commonly go(work etc.)

"Agree. I've luckily never received such a call or email as a manager, but I know if I did, I would take it with a HEAVY grain of salt (like a boulder-sized one), because sane people don't call people's workplaces to warn them about an employee whilst spilling juicy personal details about them. Like...great, she snorted cocaine a couple of years ago in her private time (and doesn't operate heavy machinery or whatever)? Not my issue. And the fact you're calling to tell me she snorted cocaine? Makes me skeptical of it being true anyway. "

"It doesn’t sound to me like she plead poverty but that her friend group got together and decided to do this for her in her time of need (not realizing her need wasn’t financial but probably emotional). 

There’s a lot of things that need to be considered here. Outing her financial status is inappropriate, especially from a professional stand point for OP.  

Jessica may also have plans to pay back those who gave her money when they’re in need, simply to keep from anyone finding out her financial status. 

I sure as hell wouldn’t tell anyone if I was basically a millionaire. 

I’m also wondering if maybe the money she has is tied up in things like property, so liquid cash was a problem she was having at that moment, which she may normally not have that problem. "
"I will also note that foster kids tend to be eligible for scholarships so depending on the age of these children, that could be a major consideration towards the cost of their college education."
"&gt; I'm not considering any approach that would violate professional ethics.

Strongly disagree that what you're considering does not violate professional ethics. This is the definition of unprofessional and bordering on being a bad friend as well. There are so many good reasons for her to accept the money. As a CPA, I'm surprised you're struggling with this.

From the post alone, I believe you're acting in a more selfish manner than she is by reacting this way."
"Not to mention the cheater wasn't going to flat out confess to OP anytime soon, in fact we can assume she wasn't going to at all. Good thing he found out on his own terms."

"My mom said the same thing. She wants me to finish the semester and not worry but it's so hard.

I didn't even think about talking to services on campus. It's a long wait list but I'll make sure to check those out Monday morning and possibly email my professors or go through a center to let them know if my work will be affected by this.

Part of me feels like I'm just wasting my money in college that can be used to help her. But ultimately I know you're right and my mom would very much agree. 

Thank you."
"Also, another note: guys who only have long term friends who are girls, and those girls are only or almost only girls who a. dated him or hooked up with in the past, or b. girls who want to hook up with him, run. If someone can't maintain social relationships outside of sexual attraction it isn't a good sign, and if they feed on that kind of sexual attention, it will be hard to get them to enforce boundaries with their friends."
"How do we know the OPs girlfriend feels uncomfortable with this behavior? OP never mentions how she feels. She's also slept in their lap which leads me to believe she's comfortable with what's going on.

What OP has said is he mentioned to her and she downplayed their behavior and said they were being ""protective"". She's most likely downplaying it because she may enjoy it and doesn't what OP to know."

"Asking her to go with you, I think. But if she's in a relationship, she'll probably have plans for the night."
"Yeah, I once shared a hotel room alone with a male friend for an out of town wedding my husband didn't want to go to. I didn't even *need* to share the room - we could've afforded my own room without a problem - but it still saved some money, and my husband had zero issue with it. (I did ask first, to make sure he wouldn't feel uncomfortable, just to be clear.)

Repeat: I was across the country from husband, drinking, and sharing a room with just me and a male friend. And it wasn't a problem because we trust each other."
"Some of that is fundamentally unreasonable, IMO. If he slouches, he slouches. If he wants to develop better posture, he should stop slouching. If he doesn't, he's a grown man and can do what he wants. If it bothers his girlfriend, she knew him before they moved in together and she shouldn't have moved in if it was a dealbreaker. Taking out the trash? Yes, if that's a chore they agreed he'd do, he should do it without her asking. Brushing his teeth? I think most of us would agree that's a hygiene issue and one that's going to affect physical intimacy in his relationship. But slouching? Nope. If somebody in my house was repeatedly nagging me about my posture, I would not respond well. "
"I’ll look it up. I truly think it’s one of those things she doesn’t (or didn’t) mean to do or realize she was doing. I don’t think she meant to cast me off or turn me against my sister. I think they just bonded really well.

At the same time I think, how could she not know? Another sister wanted to try competitive dance and my mom wouldn’t let her. She was worried my other sister wasn’t good enough and didn’t want to embarrass herself. I hate when she brings it up as if that is justifiable, I think she wanted to be the mom of the gifted dancer and didn’t want to be embarrassed by her other less gifted daughter."
"not to mention she has no respect for him.

No coming back from that."
"I didn’t bring gender into this, I said woman because OP is a woman. 
And she doesn’t have kids she would leave her partner to care for when she goes out to drink, so I don’t get why going out at least once per week is not okay if you are in a relationship. "
"So much nope.

His statement doesn't make any sense.  If your weight was always a problem for him, why the hell did he get in a relationship with you in the first place and why is he losing attraction to you while you're losing weight?  What was he thinking?  ""155 doesn't really do it for me, but she'd be a real hot 115?""  That's bullshit.  If there's issues around him not being attracted to you, he's either covering something up or he just picked you up while you were vulnerable because he wanted someone to control.

You do NOT owe someone ANYTHING because they are your first love.  First rarely means only.  Get yourself a second that doesn't treat you like shit."

"I'm a white girl with no rhythm who dated a guy from a culture where they dance a lot (and well).  His ex-gf was from a similar culture and they loved to dance together.  My best friend was from the same culture and he would dance with her.  I felt jealous at first, and left out.  He would ask if it was okay if he danced with random women while we were out because I refused because I felt like I was embarrassingly bad.  I would say yes but feel so jealous.  And then I realized that it had nothing to do with the women--he just really LOVED to dance!  I should have asked him to teach me--I was too worried that I would look stupid.

Anyhow, they may be hitting on him or they may just want to dance.  But if you're interested in learning, you can be his dance partner."
"Oh, wow. That's honestly such a thoughtful reply, it's like you were able to pick through my brain and pick out every single idea I had, but maybe just hadn't formulated yet.

That's really great advice, as you not only address the issue for OP but also from her mother's side. And then, with that, you propose a solution that's fair and addresses in part everyone's need, and fosters a positive relationship too. 

Sorry, feeling blabbery. Good advice!"
"&gt; my parents don't want me to move out

Because if you do, they're next."
"Yeah, his lashing out (totally unfairly) at OP seems like a symptom of a larger feeling of isolation on his part (he basically says as much). That doesn't make it OP's problem to deal with, of course, but if she values the friendship overall, she might want to frame it as 'friend having a hard time and acting out' rather than 'friend being dramatic about unreasonable request', and maybe see if there are other ways he could be included in the group."
"This seems easy... ""Why do you say wife instead of ex-wife?"" Then see what he says. Maybe it's a habit he hasn't noticed but you don't really know till you ask him to either stop or get some explanation."
"There's a difference between unsanitary living environments (poor housekeeping) and not keeping your body clean. Sure plenty of people could improve their home cleanliness, but if you can't be bothered to take care of personal hygiene (showering, basic grooming, brushing your teeth, etc) in your 20's then that's kind of a problem."
It never turns out to be the “planning a surprise” excuse
"It’s not like you know until it hits you. Tummy aches aren’t always a reason for alarm and can be fairly mundane. I went to a New Years party at my partner’s friend’s house this year. It was my first time meeting them and got sick at the party. It was really embarrassing. I did my best to right the situation by making sure to clean up after, but it was still humiliating. My stomach hurt a little an hour in to the party. That was my only warning. Unfortunately, I just assumed I had eaten/drunk something that didn’t agree with me rather than having a stomach bug. "
"He is going to be destroyed when things don't work out. And when kids are involved OP would be guaranteed to be falsely accused (and end up not seeing his kids)

"Unpopular opinion, but I don't think she's lazy at all. She's calculated and manipulative and that's not something you might want in a partner for the long term. Some people DO want that in a partner. 

I read this and while some of the stuff is really awful, other things I thought, ""Wow. That's kind of genius"" and thought of the amount of effort put forth to do that. It's not lazy, it's working hard to get ahead but working hard in the subjectively immoral way.

"you're right there is no protocol. That means you do what is best for you and makes you comfortable. Take a few days. Talk with your bio-dad and husband. If you want to go to the funeral go. If you'd rather not attend and go to her gravesite/ash interment later and privately then do that.

"Oh my. I’m not qualified to answer your questions, but one thought occurred to me while I was reading. I wonder if leaving that note was a Freudian slip, tantamount to a spouse leaving evidence of an affair where the the other spouse will find it, subconsciously, out of guilt or wanting the partner to confront on bad behavior. 

Finding that must have been a shock. Perhaps seeing a counselor together would be best. "

"literally gagging. This is so fucking gross. You haven't tried 'everything,' you've tried nothing. You've intentionally gotten close to him, you've asked him out on a date, you've initiated physical contact. Your post screams that you're trying to make yourself look like the victim here. 'You can't help it.' Of course you can help it. Stay away from teenage boys who are literally children. You're a predator."
You should talk about it with your mom. This doesnt sound good for you. You want it to change and you have that right. She should understand. This is about you not what she wants.

"you're welcome

&gt; I was shocked, boyfriend looked confused and said ""whats this bingo?"" and my mom thought this was so cute and didn't give him the option to say no.

Nothing is going to change until you and boyfriend both realize that YOU have the option to say no. I understand in a parent-child relationship it is hard to say no; even as an adult it can feel like 'misbehaving' or 'rebelling' or 'talking back' or disrespecting your parent(s) in some way, but truly it is not. Once you become an adult you are allowed to say no.

It is not up to your mom to 'give' you the option to say no. The law has already done that (USA) by virtue of granting you limited adulthood status at 18 and complete adulthood at 21. It is not up to your mom to 'let' you be an adult. Adulthood is not given, it is assumed, so act like the adult you are and set boundaries with your mother. Be the grown woman you *are*.

Your apprehension about hurting her feelings is admirable, but trust me she'll be all right and she will get over herself soon enough. I'm about her age, have 3 adult children as well, and all my kids have had to tell me to back off (in other areas, I would never creep on their SOs) at least once or twice in their new adulthood. Its hard sometimes for moms to cut the cord, so to speak, so pushback from adult kids is normal. Let her know what's up, you and boyfriend fall back a bit on how much time you spend with her, and ask him to decline any further one-on-one invites from your mom as well as tell her to stop asking him out. Encourage her to date and find male company elsewhere besides your man.

"A few things that come to mind:

1) You're addicted to gaming. 

2) You should find someone more compatible. 

3) You don't have to love doing something in order to do it for your partner's sake. My ex was kind of like this – he couldn't grasp the concept that sometimes you do something not because it's your personal #1 choice of activity, but because it means a lot to your partner. 

I'm not saying you should stay with someone who's fundamentally incompatible with you, but it also wouldn't kill you to compromise and do things for your partner's sake sometimes.

4) It doesn't sound like you actually want a relationship? If you're not interested in company and have no intention of changing, consider being single and maybe having a FWB arrangement for your sexual needs. Not everyone has to be in a relationship."
OP's sister is only 19 but is already a professional and earn a comfortable living. That is almost unheard of in this country. They could throw that in grandpa's face and have him explain how she can be such a success. 
"I take my rings off several times a day.

"Everything you say about your parents is giving me bad feelings. I’d consider telling them a bit less about your life, and involving them a lot less in decisions. You can still chatter happily about things to them, but don’t tell them important stuff. Keep the moving plans to yourself until you’re fully set up and ready to go."
Yuuup he's interested all right.

"It is odd behavior, yes. Rude, more like it. But the answer is not that the parents ignore her and the BF makes her feel like she has no choice in the matter. If his main complaint is that she's rude to his family due to her social anxiety, they should work on _that_. "
"It’s pretty hard to understand why you’re confused when it seems so glaringly obvious.    You brought HER FRIEND back to your shared apartment and fucked her then had the audacity to ask to fuck her not two days later?   It’s not even really about feelings,  it’s about being a decent and non slimy human being.   "
"&gt; He doesn't love you.

This is obvious. When you love someone, you don't ask them to do things that make them uncomfortable or miserable because their unhappiness should be making you unhappy. "
"You have proof he cheated and lied to you, so you have a really good case to make even with your mutual acquaintances. Other than that, I would really like to know if my partner cheated on me. It would hurt and suck, but I'd rather know than live with such a person.

Don't be afraid to do the right thing, this is how such people can keep making others suffer."
"Yeah, this is beyond the pale. 

He wants her to be house manager, cook, babysitter, and sex kitten all at once. He doesn't see her as a partner, an individual to respect, and a potential stepmom because if he did he wouldn't treat her as an employee. 

He would understand he can't have OP as a mother figure without giving her authority to set rules and curb bad behavior in the kids -- she'll just be a playmate they can walk all over without consequences.

Saw OP's update and it's wonderful to see:

&gt;I am going to end things tomorrow when we see each other"
"&gt; even if a women says and does nothing men should know certain things are wrong.

Yes, you shouldn't grab a person's genitals or breasts without permission. You shouldn't have sex with them without express permission. This are things that men and women know are wrong, even if a woman/man says and does nothing. That is what #metoo is."
HAHAHAHA the laid back Olympics. That is amazing 
"He only has access to her because they are coworkers. Most workplaces would not tolerate coworkers sexually harassing each other, even if they wait until 5:01 PM to start doing it.

Any HR department worth their salt would absolutely consider this an issue within their purview.

Typically, this sort of behavior wouldn’t be an insta-firing, unless he just goes off the rails in his HR meeting. 

They will probably ask him to confirm that he sent the texts, explain to him why that is not an acceptable way to treat a coworker, and then refer him to the sections of the employee manual referring to the no-dating policy and the part about treating coworkers with respect. Then he would probably receive a written warning and be asked to detail his plan for improving on this behavior."
"You miss his point!  Its not that watching his GF was not enjoyable, it was that his GF allowed, and participated in, shutting him out!  When that was Gf's top concern!

Maybe your an experienced unicorn but this couple was not experienced, and she lost proper focus.  And won't validate his feelings.  BAD"
"Yeah. No one is in the wrong. She can't force herself to stay in a relationship where she's unhappy, and she's not a bad person for doing so.

I would feel differently if this were her child, but Maisie is not. I think she should go."
"This was my first thought. Doesn't make what they were doing okay but it is a possible explanation other than ""he was trying to poison you by replacing your pills"""
"Sounds like you’re letting this slide? Anything less than his replacing your laptop is concerning. You break something, you replace it — with the same item. That’s what a person who cares what *you* want would do. 


What’s the next thing that he doesn’t like that he’ll accidentally destroy? This incident, along with the don’t trouble your pretty little head with talk of bitcoin..."
"I did. I think your wife probably should go to therapy. It's not healthy to need that kind of validation. Your wife sounds like a really unhappy woman.
"
"You are absolutely in the wrong here. Tinder is not a place to have a friendly little chat. I'm surprised you even still have the app if you've had a girlfriend for 3 months.

If you're feeling lonely, talk to her! Or, if you want to talk to people online, there are tons of apps like tinder but for platonic relationships."
"Wow, your wife sounds like a real peach. :-/ 

My husband has things from his ex-wife, including a mug she made for him, a rare book, cuff links, etc. I have jewellery from my exes. One ex gave me a Toothless from build a bear which is a favourite of mine and my husband’s; we once lent him to our university’s fantasy department for a promotional booth, where he was a big hit. 

This type of jealousy is unhealthy and controlling. You’re so insecure you would feel the need to destroy teddy bears? Destroy your partner’s belongings without their consent? Demand they trash clothes they like? I find that unreasonable and borderline violent to the point of feel unsafe around anyone who had such an attitude. Get a grip, people. "
"&gt;and she did pinch her finger badly in the doorframe on one of those occasions.

No, YOU pinched her finger in the door. You need to take some ownership here - you both have tempers, you both fight unconstructively, but you are the one who has escalated to physical tussles, several times. 

This is not a healthy relationship, and I don't know if it can be. You personally need some help though. You are being physically abusive, and then minimizing it later. It was just a pull or a ""grab"", SHE pinched her finger. "
"She probably can't deal with you getting pregnant while she's still trying, especially given that you have a similar condition. To also find out about it in a public situation like that (she's your best friend?) is hurtful. Let them be."
"I'm a parent and in my view there are appropriate and inappropriate ways to deal with bad behaviour. 

Lets use the example in your first bullet point of when you rudely said to your Mum ""I'm coming"". Assuming you were actually rude and this wasn't just your Mum projecting on to you. 

An appropriate way to deal with this would have been to say ""Don't be rude"" or to tell you that your behaviour was unacceptable - and then move on. That's proportional because it corrects the bad behaviour, and it's proportional to what happened. 

What is inappropriate is what your Mum did, which is to spin off into personal insults, insult you as her child and call you a freak to the point you were left sobbing. 

I'm highlighting this example because I think it's important that you recognise that your behaviour and your siblings behaviour isn't really the issue here. It's possible that you and your siblings were in the wrong every time that your mother corrected you, but that doesn't mean that the way she went about it was acceptable or right. In fact your mothers behaviour is abusive and significantly over the top. There is nothing you or your siblings could have done that justifies abuse. 

Being a parent is hard and we've all lost our temper from time to time and said things we regret. The key difference is most parents show remorse and most don't behave like this regularly. No parent is perfect, but what you've described is far above and beyond that. You are describing a pattern of behaviour that hasn't changed, and you've given us no evidence that she feels any remorse. 

I don't think it's on you to fix this. Your Mum clearly has serious problems. I think your role from now on should be to protect yourself as much as possible and try to maintain a good relationship with your siblings. "
He has a raging Madonna/whore complex.
"The name thing set off extra alarm bells for me too.

My sister and I know a woman who is in an on-again-off-again relationship with an abusive guy, decided during an off phase to go ahead and use donor sperm to have the baby she'd wanted forever, told my sister that she had a beautiful girl's name picked out for the baby, and that even her mother had had a dream that that would be the baby's name, without even having been told about it first. Beautiful, right? So beautiful.

Jerkwad came back, and despite not supporting her by going to appointments and stuff with here even when they *were* back on again, the baby ended up with his last name and a totally different first name because he hated the name she had wanted. He's also enjoying all the attention he gets for being 'daddy'. I'm not sure if his name ended up on the birth certificate too, but I suspect it did given that the baby has his last name.

Fucking hate him so much. The new mother thinks, as she thought before she got pregnant, that being with him is better than being alone. I am angry all over again just thinking about that poor baby right now.

edit: Preempting any possible questions, she has been talked to about him so many times, by so many people. Even though she literally bought an apartment for herself last year as an 'escape route' from him, she keeps getting reeled back in by grand gifts (a piano, expensive watch, etc.) and other dumb stuff and the fear of being alone in her mid-/late 30s, especially now as a mom. She knows many people around her hate his guts and hate everything they know/see/hear about their dysfunctional and toxic relationship. She's also been told that she has people who will support her getting out. And afterward. There's nothing more we can do right now."
"&gt; Most physically abusive partners can contain themselves for the first couple of months until you’re more invested in the relationship. 

He knows she's already invested in the relationship because of their year-long friendship. And he's right, because if this was a stranger who hit OP after only knowing her for a week, she'd be out the door. She's hesitating because she feels like she knows this guy."
"The ""sloppy"" part, dude."
You are a horrible friend. How could you go back to him after that? How could you even so much as think about forgiving him?
"&gt;But I don’t want this to be thing to drive the wedge in our relationship. I don’t want this to be what breaks us.

You've been in this relationship since high-school.  IOW, you've never had a normal partnership.  I'm honestly having difficulty understanding why you married her; especially since she was in rehab within a year.

You seem to be a saint but you have to stop thinking that your mission in life is to be her savior.   Al-Anon might be a place for you to start understanding that."
"Well, you mention tatoos. How determined are you to make this happen?

Because you could order large quantities of heart-shaped temporary tatoos with strictly female names in them and every time you plan to meet people, press a Lizzy or Stacy on your forearm.

Edit: Well, shit, TIL Stacy is unisex."
"I wouldn’t be too upset over what he did for you in comparison. He probably didn’t realize you were going all out and he did try to get you gifts that weren’t just basic candy and flowers. I would however be upset with how he acted when you had guests over, that was rude and unacceptable. "
"I think it was incredible generous of you to allow your girlfriend's friend to move into the spare room. Did you have a discussion with her about expectations prior to her moving in? If not, it may just be that she doesn't know any better.  You and your girlfriend need to have a serious conversation with her about your expectations.  If she doesn't take this seriously and continues to be a slob then you are quite justified in telling her she has to go."
"I mean is it possible that since you haven't _asked_ your dad for the money, he assumes you don't want it yet? "
"There are actually several examples of what people are suggesting in this quotation. I see how it's not obvious if you're not looking for it or you're trying to find super textspeechy stuff like ""lol smh"" or etc., but your text is *definitely* noticeably distinct in a way some people might consider snobby. 

* ""everyone....SIL"" is a nongrammatical transition; if you wrote this you'd probably write ""everyone! SIL"" or at least use a three-dot ellipsis with a space. 

* use of double punctuation (""??) for emphasis - you do not do this. 

* ""this"" at the start of a sentence is not capitalized, where all your sentences begin with capital letters

* ""complement"" is misspelled (well, misused, it's a homophone); you do not make errors like that

* you used a semicolon and they have probably never in their lives used a semicolon

Does that help at all? "
Could Mark have taken his wife's phone texted your wife to provide said alibi? Then deleted the text so wife wouldn't know? 
Omg I can't believe you still work for him after he said that to you. I would have dumped him on the spot.
"I mean, child support is for the child. The child doesn't care if his dad is 40 or 14, he still needs financial support."
"When we originally talked she came around about the romantic gestures thing.  She originally wanted to still go out on Valentine's (to a romantic dinner) but when I explained to her that it made no sense for 2 friends to go to a super fancy romantic dinner on Valentine's she agreed.  I thought we perfectly understood each other.

That's what feels worst about the whole thing, the fact that she thinks so little of me that she would use me.  All I can think is I wanted to date, I made it clear I wanted to date, and she said no.  I really am considering just telling her I don't want to have contact with her at this point."
Where in the world are you? In most places this isn't illegal because he handled himself respectfully and cordially. Tell your friend to butt out. 
"I agree. I'm aghast at the thought of going to work only 12 weeks after giving birth, not least because of the physical trauma the body has gone through. "
"Just distance yourself, OP. No caveat about hoping or waiting for him to be available.

He's been with his girlfriend for ten years. That's a lot of commitment, and even though the OP perceives it as in ""decline"", she's viewing this through the rose-colored glasses of someone who really, really wants that to be true. 

More importantly, even IF he actually breaks up with this woman, and even IF OP and the guy end up dating immediately after he breaks up with the woman he's been with since he was, apparently, 16 - there is a huge likelihood that OP would just be a rebound or a confidence booster while he gets his dating sea legs, given that he's only dated one person for his entire adult life. He has never been single as an adult, so there's a more than decent chance that he'll actively enjoy the single life if he splits with this woman.

OP, just stop this now. There is absolutely no good reason to torture yourself with someone that you can't have. Even if they do split, jumping into a relationship with you immediately is not likely to end well.

All you're doing here is setting yourself up for heartbreak.

And please stop talking about him with your mutual friends as if he's available. Not only is it going to accelerate your feelings because you're talking about him as an option when he isn't, it's kind of gross and disrespectful and I guarantee that at least some of the people you're talking with are noting that you're willing to flirt with and pursue someone who is in a long-term relationship, and making mental notes that you're the kind of person who doesn't respect other people's relationships - and they're right.

Is that who you want to be? You're very young, so I'm being harsh because I know that you may be a bit naive and caught up in the idea of love conquering all (even, well, other people's love), but you have the power to stop this situation that is ""destroying"" you, and you also need to be aware of the fact that you're being kind of shitty by even considering confessing to this guy *explicitly* with the hope of ending his relationship.

It sounds like you're not capable of being a good friend to him right now anyway, so please just back off and let someone who is actually available catch your eye. Feelings grow where they are watered, and it sounds like you're putting all your water onto a patch of dead soil. Stop doing this, and allow yourself the distance to both heal and possibly meet someone new and available.

"Adrian appears to be stirring drama.  I don't know if this particular situation can be remedied, but you can definitely prevent future occurrences by not allowing Adrian to be the communication gatekeeper between your siblings.  Talk to your sisters directly, and (especially if Adrian tells you something secondhand, like what so-and-so told her) verify with the person involved.  

When the dust has settled, you might be able to talk to Casey (with logs of your text messages) and sort out the confusion about her birthday.  But it is much more important to prevent this happening again."
"I'm a girl. I would say ""I fingered myself"" if I were ever to describe it, but I don't talk about stuff like that, so I guess I wouldn't really know how to talk about it. Saying ""I masturbated"" sounds clinical and gross and touching myself sounds comical. But that's just me. Fingering sounds more erotic imo. So it's not out of the realm of possibility, though I agree it's 99% she's cheating."
"And taking the time to choose one that goes with the decor, a mistake he was able to recognise and agree with once it was pointed out. "
"&gt;there are certain things they tell me that she doesn't know about or wouldn't even really understand.

Your wife is an adult. Talk to her like one and she might not agree but I bet she will understand. Your boys will be boys mentality here is a big issue and I don’t know how to help you other than you should listen to your wife more. She seems smarter than you realize."
... he's a piece of shit. I am seriously side-eyeing you for being friends with this jerkoff.
"Know who DID notice though? Him. I’m so sorry, but I agree with everyone who is telling you that he did this deliberately, and he knew he was violating your boundaries. Maybe it wasn’t premeditated, maybe he just really really sucks at self control, but regardless of WHY he did it, he did it. And frankly, you deserve much better."
"7 years and you don't live together?

####Your relationship is not going to progress to marriage.

He's taking long trips to other countries and it sounds like he's falling for this girl. It's possible its mutual. 

&gt;He also never puts any pictures of us online anymore and to me, it feels like it’s because he doesn’t want to upset her. I have no proof but I feel that he has definite feelings for her.

**Trust your gut.**

End this farce of a relationship. He's checked out and is not interested in marrying you -- let along actually building a life together and sharing a home!

***Do you want kids??*** If the answer is yes then you are wasting you time. Marriage -&gt; Buying a home -&gt; Starting a family won't occur  in that order with him. Even if you two get pregnant accidentally -- he won't be up for planning for a kid when he's constantly traveling between countries and building his career with his new inspiration. This is a dead end."
You should drive them to the clinic and not tell your parents.
"The sad part is that you don't even really subscribe to your religion.  You're just afraid to be a grownup.

Whatever you decide to do with yourself, do not let your boyfriend throw away his autonomy for the sake of your baggage.

You know what you should do.
You know what you want to do.

But you're afraid.  Set him free.  Drown on your own."
"Don't ask your cousin for another plane ticket. It's her wedding. He's not entitled to her money.
You're the person she wants to be at the wedding. Your plus one needs to pay his own way if he wants to join you.


Your cousin also doesn't even know your boyfriend. Why would she spend nearly a thousand dollars or more on someone she doesn't even know? He's entitled as hell. I'd leave him at home for that attitude if he didn't shape up."
Let's ignore Beth as a person and just focus on Beth as a friend. You're friendship seems very one sided. You give and she takes and takes and takes. And now your sick of it. That makes sense and is a normal healthy response. You deserve a better friend. I would tell her you can't watch her self destruct anymore and that you wish her the best buts it's for your own mental health to end your relationship. Block her and don't get sucked back into her whirlpool of bad decisions. 
"&gt; I mean.... it sucks to have been cut out of the group chat. But your husband is just proposing an idea for how to fix things. Why is your big vocabulary more important that harmony in your marriage and family? Chill out!

Why doesn't it matter that I've been nothing but kind and loving towards them? I've cooked meals with them, I've gone on vacation with them, I had them in my wedding party, I've celebrated every Christmas for the past 8 years with them. These are not minor relationships, but they thought nothing of cutting me out, with no warning. The group chat is symbolic - their issues with me clearly go deep. Why couldn't they try to give me any small bit of the benefit of the doubt?

Everyone has accurately made the point that my writing and word choices need to be changed...but I went from having daily text conversations with his family to them basically saying I'm the worst. You can't understand how that could be hurtful, just because I have trouble simplifying my language?"
"Wow, didn't know this. I'm not American, so I found the 'fortnight' example as the tamest of all of them. "
"Full court press by the mom and all, that’s really unfair to do that to you. At least you know what you don’t want. Try a
Little less baggage next time. I spent my 20’s dating women with kids and it always ended the same way. I thought it was the women’s fault, they were crazy, they had issues blah blah blah.... it turns out I didn’t want to be a step father in my 20’s. I wasn’t happy and did things to sabotage the relationship with 1000 little cuts. You need to face some hard truths about what you want out of life.  "
He feels the need to leave HIS kids with her all the time. I say she can’t do as she pleases. She’s not hurting anyone. The child SPIT on her. That’s nasty. 
You think they still don't know the consequences? Really? After being terrified of their families finding out? After *getting an abortion*? Still think they don't know that sex leads to babies?
"&gt;I am going to end things tomorrow when we see each other.

Good. You deserve far better than him."
"You did everything right in this situation; you stated your intentions clearly, you respected her when she told you that she wasn't attracted to you, and you tried to genuinely make a friendship work. You were respectful every step of the way.

Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like she had honest intentions in this situation. Whatever her reasons for exploding on you were (whether she was using you for attention or depressed about the holiday), it doesn't make it right how she treated you. I think you dodged a bullet in the long term, even if it hurts right now."
Don’t be surprised if his ex wasn’t actually mentally ill.
"Based on his post I doubt an Amazon wishlist would work, because I'm the same way with gifts as her - if I find the exact thing and link it, then I can just buy it myself and there's no value to it. Click, click, done, no thought or effort put into it.

Of course with that attitude you have to compromise (if something is highly thoughtful but not the thing you'd get for yourself), but not to the point that you have to be happy with an unwrapped gift bought the day of the occasion."
"Yeah, I would drop him and treat yo self to the birthday gift he didn't buy you."
"Slapped like BDSM.  She discovered she really likes it rough like that, and I don't, so that's just another issue.  He went way too hard, but he immediately realized he fucked up and apologized.  Even went out and got her chocolates and something else the next day.  I've never fucked up like that but I also never was good at giving gifts.  I know she really liked that.  They're probably better off together =/

for real, man.  what should I do when I shave it?  I kinda want to go in pieces -- take off the cheeks and go to work with the big mustache+goatee combo one day, then maybe take off the chin and just pretend I'm my dad with a big 'stache, lol.  I dunno if I could live with myself lol.  It would be funny to go on a date with a big stupid pornstache maybe."
"Has your idiot ""friend"" ever actually read The Lord of the Rings? That is, he does know that the One Ring is utterly evil and corrupts everything that it touches, leading to absolute misery for anyone who comes into contact with it? Not only is he being completely disrespectful, he's also doing so in a way which literally translates as ""I hope you both end up utterly miserable, waste away and end up in Hell."""
"From your replies, it looks like you're already set on having this idiot be an idiot at your wedding so why make this post in the first place?"
Also: you are powerful. It may feel like you're facing a huge Teostra but he's all spark and no flame. You have control of your life and you can call the friends you have and stand on your own feet. Don't let anyone make you feel weak.
"It's not about her. There is always going to be another 'muse' , another project, another artist. This is about YOUR relationship with HIM. You have to decide what you want. "
I can guarantee you a large percentage of women in shelters right now felt exactly the same way. “He never did anything to really hurt me” is a very common thing that abused people tell themselves in order to cope with their abuse.
Ask Dad what would make him more comfortable? To satisfy both I think Dad driving with mum to take you to school might be the best option if Dad can tolerate it. It is all about you and what is in your best interest.  Stepmother will have to show some flexibility.
"I'd break up with someone who, after a year of dating, was unwilling to think ahead even such a short period of time as one year into the future. You can't take a committed, monogamous relationship one day at the time! It's one thing to not know at 24 if you will want marriage and/or kids with your gf one day down the line, but if you can't even say to her that you still see yourself with her *next year???* That's bizarrely short-sighted for someone your age.

As for marriage and kids--if you are pretty sure now that you won't ever want those things (not just with her, with anyone), stop wasting her time. If you genuinely aren't sure, let her know so she can figure out if she can live with the uncertainty for a while. "
But then he shouldn't be happily accepting presents back.  He could propose a no-present-pact.  
"My level of fear is based on literally having random men on the street cuss me out, follow me, or physically grab me when I say ""no"" to their advances. Paul might not be a random man on the street but he's almost three times my size and has a history of being unpredictably aggressive at *least* once. This also happened less than 12 hours ago so I'm especially unnerved. I did not know that one of my roommates would be 6'6"", have an extremely stressful job, and be sexually attracted to me when I moved in, and now that I'm on a two year lease, there's not exactly anything I can do about it."
"I don't post in these often but this is seriously not how a relationship or even a human should function. If she doesn't want to get help in the form of therapy then what's to say she'll ever change. Do you see this working in the long term.

You need to make an ultimatum about her getting therapy because this behaviour is not acceptable and regardless of her condition there is no possible way you can be happy."
"Agree with other comments about asking her outright or in therapy, whatever feels right.

Can I just suggest too that you sit down and write a list of what you love about yourself: your best qualities, what makes you a good friend, why you are wonderful. I'm sure your self-esteem will have taken a huge knock by this - it sounds utterly traumatising! You poor thing.

Good luck with next steps. "

"&gt; A one year old doesn't need any kind of party

This is a very big event in some cultures, and of course the party isn't for the child, it's for the family.
"
this sounds like your now caught in a lie and a dramatic story change 
"Okay on one hand, yes someone said something about you they shouldn't have. But on the other your reaction seems a little over the top. 

Clearly it was not okay for people to assume these absolutely terrible things about you, but it is entirely possible that it was a drunken misunderstanding that unfortunately someone remembered the next day.

You expecting a separate apology from each individual is not realistic. Most likely some of them had literally nothing to do with it and the rest of them don't even clearly remember their part in it. Honestly this is a situation where you should have remained calm and let people know that none of it was true. Your boyfriend should do the heavy lifting of sticking up for you as well. But really just let them know that wasn't cool how it was handled and let people know to talk to you directly next time so you can clear things up right away before it gets out of hand. 

I can't help but think that your anxiety you said you were having is coloring your reaction to this situation. Even though it feels like it in this moment I doubt that the whole group is conspiring against you. It was probably a misunderstanding. 

The biggest takeaway I have from this is that I hope your boyfriend sticks up for you. Not that he should drop all his friends over it. But he should absolutely set the record straight with them and let them know not to handle things that way again. If they were to continue to treat you that way after that then you can start to have a reason to be mad."
"Nah I would be livid. My first thought was that they must have had something against you from the start and now got a chance. However, it does not make sense as you dont really know this people.

Then my second guess was that something happened on that guys night, which in turn needed one big distraction. That also add up with noone want to say anything and sweep this under the rug, after all it was only you who took the hit here. I would go after your bf on this one.

What I do not get is why the other ladies are not livid? They were with you, you took care of one of them, then Peter makes it sound like you are the queen hoe out with their girls geting frisky with other men? I would not accept that.

There is a saying that look at your partners closest five friends and he will be the average. In this case his behavior is equally shitty as them. "
"Reddit didn't make your relationship fail, you did. If you don't like her and she's not seeking help for her conditions then leave.   Sometimes relationships fail because one person doesn't know how or won't take care of themselves and is unwilling to change. The other issue is are you not aroused by her or are you not aroused by anything?"
"I concur, this relationship is going exactly nowhere."
You know you don't have to say yes to everything your SO asks you to do. Hopefully she has friends or family she can take that actually want to go and if not she can go alone. The best thing is to stand up for yourself.  You have to make compromises on some things but going to a concert you know you're not going to enjoy isn't one of them. If it's absolute critical that you go can you find SOMETHING to enjoy about it?
"Love is not enough. By Mark Manson. Google that article and read it. In summary, you can love someone all you want, but that doesn't make them a good life partner. They also have to be, for example, responsible."
"hey, become a foster parent if you feel that strongly about it. "
Don't hold your breath. 
"I'm not the one who is calling OP selfish and suggesting he is a monster in this situation - that's all you.

He's not just leaving a minor out in the streets - he would be left in the care of a friend, with an opportunity to get his shit together and come join them in Europe, or go into foster care. The freaking lawyer is saying *that OP should do this*.

OP was caught in a super awful situation and he has stepped up to the plate and gone above and beyond in this situation. However you cannot help those who refuse to be helped. OPs little bro has show *nothing* that suggests he will change. He needs a reality check, and he needs it hard.

Don't forget OP has a **wife** and **children**. What about them? Should he just abandon them, abandon his career so he can spend the remaining 3 years sacrificing everything for this person who won't take the help? He will have lost everything and it will be for nothing.

I can't imagine how difficult this decision is for OP. I imagine if he does go to Europe he will be wracked with guilt over this situation. No matter which way he chooses, he will loose in some capacity.

Going to Europe is the capacity in which he will stand to loose the least, and may even be able to preserve his relationship with his **wife** and **children** and his happiness.

You don't agree with him? Fine. You are entitled to. But to reduce him to a monster? That is incredibly unfair of you, and easy to do since you are so far removed from all of this."
Seems like it's less about being adopted and moreso being adopted by OP's mother.
"Come on man, you know it’s incredibly easier for you to say that as a outside-party than it is for me. "
"Yeah, that's kind of what happens when you abuse the fuck out of them. No one gets loved and wanted in life just for existing (except by parents, and even then only sometimes). You have to meet minimum decency standards to get it. I'm not saying it has to be 100% balanced - we all tolerate some crap from our kids, because they're young and learning. But people who assault people aren't generally wanted, and it's not a bad thing for OP's brother to become aware of that, before he commits to that sort of thing as a life path."
He does but it's not a lot and the amount he eats and his mental health care takes it all. Our electric bill went up a third and it doubled our food bill each month. So over half his costs (I have to track for social security purposes) come from my personal money
"So he should throw his entire life away?

Bullshit. Fucking bullshit."
Alcohol doesn’t make people violent- it makes violent people less careful about hiding their voilent tendencies. 
"My God.  No question your brother is traumatized, but you are traumatized as well.  Understanding why someone is acting abusive doesn't change the fact that they are abusive.  Protect your wife and marriage, she is your responsibility and you have gone as far with your brother as you can.  You can't possibly help your brother if he is demolishing your mental health and quality of life.  Interesting that your brother is legit acting like a monster but you fear self-preservation makes you one.  Absolutely not, you have been a saint enduring this all this time.  Choose yourself - he doesn't deserve you.  Love him from a distance for now. "
"I think they meant emotionally. 

Think about smothering or choking the person you love most."
"That makes sense in and of itself, but the result has been that he hasn't met any of them yet and that is bound to make him feel weird. I think he is overreacting, but I also think maybe you could make an effort for him to meet your work crew. Like, take him to one of these family social events one time even if it is a little weird since you don't have kids, just so he doesn't feel sidelined. Or invite your work friends over to your place for beers if that's not too weird. Just try to compromise!

But he should definitely back off his insinuations that you will cheat or that you wouldn't be honest with him about getting hit on at work."
"Thank you, this is what I believe as well. I'm positive that what he *really* wants is to hear me say that I think he's a good person and that I'm sorry for hurting him (I have no idea what I ever did to ""retraumatize"" him other than saying no to sex when I didn't want to have sex, telling him I was upset when he did things that upset me, and breaking up with him when I didn't want to be with him anymore) . I thought he was trying to be nice and take accountability when he ""offered"" to go to therapy with me, but when he admitted that *he* actually wanted it I realized he's the same self-absorbed person he's always been. Like, why would you come in like a knight in shining armor with this ""offer"" when you know what you actually want to do is make a *request*?

Thank you, it's helpful to hear other people confirm what I know is true."
"The sister is at an age where sex is a subject.  So I would guess that OP's husband is suddenly realizing that this means she might not yell at the sister for thinking about sex.  He knows OP sexually and thinks of her as maybe not a good role model since she had sex with him, probably before they were married, probably not just missionary with the lights out.

If he thinks that the sister's thing belongs to her daddy/brother until marriage, this might make him angry."
"&gt;She told me that my friendship with this coworker is too important and that I should continue to emotionally depend on this person.

Ask your wife what she actually means by this. Without knowing literally anything else it kind of seems like she's trying to get you to leave her by having you fall for someone else, probably due to feelings of self-loathing that lead her to try and sabotage her relationships in order to not inflict her damage on other people.

That's the worst possible interpretation, which leads back to my first sentence: Talk to your goddamn wife."
"&gt;She reads /r/relationship a lot and she gives great advice. She has over 100k comment karma. I asked why that mattered. She said ""It shows I've helped a lot of people. That really means something.""

Who is she trying to impress? Other anonymous Reddit users? You? Herself?

She sounds like she has low self esteem and needs that ""boost"" from feeling like she's making a huge difference.

There's a saying on this subreddit that I'm sure she's seen - ""setting yourself on fire to keep someone else warm"". If she gives her coat to a homeless person but then freezes herself and can't afford a new coat, that veers from being charitable to being stupid. She would rather get the esteem boost than take care of her actual needs.

You were right when you said it's like an addiction. And it's not sustainable. She's being self-destructive and needs to get a handle on why she dislikes herself so much. It's only a matter of time before she starts emptying bank accounts and giving away your shit, because Reddit comments and donating old clothes don't give her the same rush as it used to."
"This is so true. 


At this age men already know how to take care of themselves independent of their mom or they don’t. Some learn after they get away from home, but it really is a process OP should not want to be around for. 


Many women put up with this shit though because they saw their moms do so for their fathers and brothers. OP, break the cycle. Devote yourself to science."
"Him being there was what any spouse should do, not some saintly effort. Your accident clearly messed you up mentally, you dont owe him your life for not turning tail and running."
(Soon to be) 6 kids with 5 different men is frankly all the information needed for OP to judge on...
"Notice you said Parents, with an s. 

OP's concern is how can his sister be a good mom when she's a single parent with no income that's attempting to live off of assistance."
"This isn't your fault, nor is it your penis's fault. In fact, I'm going to say this 100% your wife's fault. Like, despite your penis size, she made the decision to marry you and to be faithful to you. Even though you picked up on something from the start (are you sure it wasn't just your own insecurity?), it's still shame on her. There really are a lot of women who would be completely satisfied with your penis. Would you expect your wife to be like ""Golly gee, I guess it's okay you fucked those three skinny, big boobed Hungarian girls because I've always been chubby and have small boobs."" Of course not! It would be shame on you for marrying her if something about her ""wasn't enough"", right? This is why you can't simply rationalize your insecurity about your penis size into making what she did (and why) okay.

Here is the one bit of advice I have for you: Please go see a therapist. You've got to take care of yourself, you've got to take care of your kids, and you have to figure out what happens with your marriage, and none of that is easy. Maybe even delay talking about this with your wife until you've had more time to process this."
So your boyfriend wants to go and drink with a girl in college who admittedly crushes on him? Can you not see this isn't good boyfriend material? College parties = hookups
"Like I said, you guys seem to have a fundamental incompatibility and I don't see this working out with you staying together. "
If you're not capable of monogamy then don't lead people to believe that you are.
"I'm sure other people's suggestions for surgery and the like are more helpful, but I just wanted to assure you that a lot of women don't like penetrative/piv sex and would be happy to never have it."

"Many people would hold off longer than four months before revealing a new relationship to a long-term ex. But she can't seriously expect to keep this up for years. 

Even if she keeps up the pretense of being single for 20-30 years, surely he'll eventually change his will, unless she remains a big part of his life (do they have kids together or anything?) 

If she has an urgent financial need (like medical care or a child to put through school) and he feels a duty to provide for her, then she should ask him for money now. But waiting for him to die and hoping she's in the will is ridiculous.

"I had a bad boss like that once. Go to HR and make sure you document everything. Your work load, the swearing the lack of guidance. Use the term hostile work environment.

"Seconding this.  I sometimes say “No, thank you.”  But I don’t offer an excuse or reason. Just “No.” and done.  I’ve had one person push once as to “why” to which I answered “I don’t want to.”    That was the end of that. "
"He broke the rules of the relationship. Just like an affair in a monogamous relationship.

It isn't the sleeping with someone else. It's the lies, the deceit and the going against the one of only two rules you had agreed together.

He had broken your trust and its up to you where you go from here. I would suggest that you stop seeing N while you figure out what you want to happen with your husband.

Open relationships take an incredible amount of trust and strength in a relationship. Would you be able to have an open relationship with him again? Would you be okay with NOT having an open relationship anymore? Would you give up N to concentrate on your marriage without resentment if that's what you chose?

Obviously you don't have to answer those questions here, but in your case it isn't just the relationship at stake, it's your whole lifestyle.

I would quit with both men at least temporarily while you get your head together and figure out what you want and from whom.

Good luck lovely! "

I'm glad you weren't, but you made some poor language choices in your question here. I respect making distinctions between a person, and a person's attitude or behaviour, but you didn't make those lines very clear in your original post at all. 

Hopefully, with the other responses you've got you can pivot to encouraging her to seek out counselling or coaching where she can choose some solutions for herself. She sounds like she's down pretty low. She needs more support than you can give. The kindest thing you can probably do for her at this point is to acknowledge she is suffering, that it is above your pay grade as boyfriend, and encourage her to get the support she needs and deserves."
"Is Stacy in the market of having kids herself one day? If so, tell her that because it's HER father, she should name her son the traditional name.

If your husband is on your side, have him talk to his dad about this. It's your baby, and you shouldn't feel any need to name him what other people want. I would definitely talk to FIL about this and be calm, genuine, and serious about the topic. Compromising on a middle name is perfectly generous of you. Once you've talked to the FIL, then break it to Stacy that he already knows and isn't bothered by the fact you're choosing to carry on the tradition in a middle name."

"&gt; Not treatable? How do people get this way? :(

My sister is a classic Narcissist. She has been her whole life. When I came home from the hospital as a baby, my father ""jokes"" (not funny) that she was pissed I took the attention away from her and tried to kill me from that day forward - she was 3. She is now 57 and nothing has changed. If anything, she's doubled down on her behavior and it's become worse with time. She claims she's in ""treatment"" but Narcissists don't tell the truth - they manipulate and lie and don't take responsibility, all things that make therapy useless. You can't change what you don't take responsibility for. And they never, EVER, take responsibility. 

This pops up over on r/raisedbynarcissists frequently, because it's so true:

A Narcissist's Prayer: 

That didn't happen. 

And if it did, it wasn't that bad.

"&gt; bragging about how much bigger and better they are than me

lol, your relationship is 100% over. Most women who like the man they are with will never say this. hell, most will tell you, you're the biggest and best sex they ever had etc.

"Look, you don't have to have anyone in your wedding that you don't want. But, I did notice that in your OP you ""one upped"" her on every description. It makes me wonder what your attitude is in real life. Maybe she's jealous or insecure, but I get the feeling that you may have contributed to that in a major way, whether it was intentional or not. 

My advice to you is this. Go directly to her. Don't talk to outer family members, just go to her. Say something like ""I feel like our relationship has deteriorated over time, and I'd like to make an effort to fix that, but my wedding isn't the place for it. I feel like you should step back from the wedding and afterwards we can revisit this and work towards a better relationship."" Will there be fall out? Yeah. But at least you will be the one that was straightforward and not gossiping or causing exterior drama. It sounds like this gal may be in your life for a long time, so you may want to reevaluate your behavior towards her and your relationship with her down the road. "
"It's entirely possible that your sister has a VERY different relationship with your parents than you do, and you're a little oblivious to it. It's not uncommon for kids to have complete different experiences with their parents, it might be that you're the golden child and she's the scapegoat, but you just never really noticed because that is your normal (and that doesn't make you a bad person at all, if there's a rift it's on your parents, not you).

If  possible, you could try sending her a gift basket of new born &amp; momma care things and a note saying something like ""Dearest sister, I don't know what's going on or what drove your decision to exclude me from your life right now, but I wanted you to know I love you and respect your choices. I hope in time we can reconnect when you feel it's right. Till then please know I am thinking of you &amp; Waverly lovingly and hope you are well and happy. I am here for you whenever you need me. Love, pipipi123""

Don't include your parents in your gift or your note, make it clear it's just from you (so don't say ""we love you etc).

Otherwise, this may be a good time to be patient and leave her be for now. I am sorry you're going through this, I know it must be confusing and upsetting, I hope it gets cleared up and healed soon for you all."
"Started couples about a month ago, briefly touched on social media between other issues. Will be discussing further for sure.

I'm starting to think she could turn anything in to a full blown multi hour argument. I've never argued over such small things in my life."
"Wait. OP, *is* the mom invited to the wedding?"
"It will. MLM people are encouraged to essentially manipulate every person they know into buying from them. They are basically guaranteed to destroy every relationship around them if they don't get out. They will NOT leave you alone, and this is because the MLM is bleeding them dry financially while convincing them they just need to work a little harder and buy just a little more product."

This guy doesnt sound all that fun to be with. This is straight up ridiculous and childish honestly.
"I'm being direct, because it's something you need to hear.  

-You broke up

-He blocked you

-You found some other way to contact him

-He told you to leave him alone AGAIN

-You couldn't leave that alone, and emailed him AGAIN 

Now, after 4.5 months, you want to reach out one more time to ""apologize"" despite a mountain of evidence that proves he's not interested in hearing from you at all.  This is a bad idea.  You should not do it.  "
She means...'the unicorn dealer'.
"You should avoid them both 100%. Your gf can’t be alone with the husband at all ever. But she should try to keep at arms length from her sister; maybe cool down contact but not go completely scortched earth. Her sister clearly isn’t cool with this. It’s likely she’s being abused, or manipulated, something like that. She doesn’t want her husband to fuck her sister. But that’s what he wants. The guy sounds absolutely nuts. I suspect her sister will need her by her side if there is a hope of getting away from him. I wonder if there are fertility issues with her sister? “I’ll stay with you if you let me knock up your sister.” It’s hard to say but this is really crazy. You’re not wrong at all for wanting nothing to do with either them, who would??

Your girlfriend might not be as unbothered as she says. It’s probably really difficult to process this kind of thing. I wouldn’t want to accept that something this insane actually happened to me, especially invloving my sister. I would definitely be there for her to talk to about processing this, maybe suggest therapy. "
"It’s great to be concerned for their health but it sounds like you are more concerned with how their appearance and lifestyle reflects on you. That is not ok. That’s the mentality of a teenager, not a middle aged woman. If you want to help them, do so by expressing love and concern not shame and embarrassment. "
"Before my father died, I had the same problem as you: he was a smoker, and although he wasn't allowed to smoke in the house when I was growing up, his failing health eventually left him bedridden and he started doing it anyway. The last Christmas he was alive, we flew out to see them and my husband and I had to stay elsewhere, despite them having a perfectly good guest room, because my husband couldn't stand staying there with all the second hand smoke. I know my mom was super disappointed, but she understood, probably because she's not a smoker herself. It's hard for a lot of smokers to realize just how awful it makes everything smell, just how much of a difference it makes in your breathing. You're going to have to be firm with them about this. Of course they don't want to hear that the decisions they've made have resulted in you not wanting to stay with them in your childhood home. But that's what they NEED to hear. You have to tell them that refurbishing the place isn't enough -that you won't stay over at their place because they smoke."
You leave when you *suspect* cheating? That's ridiculous. 
"Perhaps. Being mindful is still HIS responsibility, and not hers. It could also simply be incompatibility. If he requires a relationship where they can rag on each other, then she doesn't meet those requirements. 

He would then have two choices. He mindful and not say hurtful things because it's been made clear that they're not appreciated. Or, he can find a partner with a matching sense of humour. 

Even if he isn't being intentionally malicious, he IS failing to honour a very reasonable request. That's not her fault or her problem. They only human being in the world who is responsible for his behaviour is him."
"His brother has an IEP plan, meaning he's in a special education program. He throws laying-on-the-floor tantrums at 15.  There is something going on here more than a discipline problem (edit: [OP says his brother has been diagnosed with ADHD, and has been evaluated for BPD and anxiety several times](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/7w7kb2/i_27_m_have_to_choose_between_dream_job_and_wife/dtyhw82/?context=1)).  He needs the help of trained professionals, not military school.  Military school is probably the worst thing you could do for this kid, he has at least one neurological disorder and probably a mountain of emotional trauma.  OP please don't send your brother to military school.  There are special schools for people with neurological disorders, please look into those.

Thus it renders your comment useless...
Have you tried dating both men and women? I had NO idea I was gay until I was your age. I wanted men to like me but as soon as they did it freaked me out. Something to think about. 
She's sick. Get away from her
"Hey. I am 100% your boyfriend. Well.. Not literally, but I have done this exact same stuff in many of my relationships. 

All of my close friends were girls and we were always way too intimate. I didn't realize it at the time but every girl I dated brought it up at some point or another. The situation is not quite identical. This was not a girl that rejected me but definitely was a situation where we expressed feelings for each other but it ""didn't work out"" or ""wasn't the right time."" On behalf of your boyfriend, I'm sorry. It's a shitty thing to do and it sucks. As far as advice..


It's tough. If you give him and ultimatum between you or her, it's a lose lose honestly. If he picks you, he will probably resent you for it and it will come up later in the relationship. If he picks her, it could be because he's in love or it could be his loyalty to his friendship.


If you ignore it, obviously you are developing feelings for him while he could be progressing his feelings for her. Its a shitty feeling to think that if she changes her mind, you're gone in a second. And you have no way to know this one way or the other. 
But just to give you some insight from my personal experiences.. I never wanted to leave my girlfriends for these friends. For me, I was so scared of being the guy that ""loses all his friends because he started dating someone"" that I would over compensate. I would show a ton of attention to all of my friends and very little to who I was dating. I figured they would just know.. Because. Duh. I'm dating you. Obviously that's not how it works but you get the point.


Personally, I think you should keep communicating. Let him know how it makes you feel. Set reasonable boundaries. See if he respects those boundaries. Once you set the boundaries, it's not about who he likes and doesn't like. It's about him respecting you. And I think that's something you can make a decision from.


Whatever you decide, good luck. Hope you find someone who makes you happy (him or not) Cheers.

"Id just like to hop in and debunk that women stain their underwear because they are 'wet throughout the day'. You're talking about cervical mucus which is a different thing from arousal fluid entirely. You produce arousal fluids because you are stimulated, you produce cervical mucus because of your menstrual cycle. Cervical mucus generally does NOT make for great lube, especially at certain points in the cycle.

The vagina will always feel a bit wet, that's it's job. But if your girlfriend is feeling pain during sex maybe she simply isn't aroused enough. Could be due to nerves or just quite frankly lack of correct stimulation. Or, as above, maybe she just has a hard time getting wet. Definitely get some lube and pay close attention to your sexual partner and their needs! "
He tells you he’s at work for 10 to 12 hours with no phones. Does he work somewhere with high security clearance?
"Set up one day of the week as a ""try something new"" day. Play a board game together, go for a walk, visit a pet shelter and play with animals, etc...Just until you find something you both can enjoy together and then make that a thing.

In the end, though, you both seem like you are doing well. You both have time occupying activities that keep you busy, and you still find time for each other. Sounds like a happy couple to me."
"I'm impressed you are able to realize that what happened with your friend is wrong and figured out that you should tell somebody.  I'd trust your gut and tell someone at the school as soon as possible. I also think it's the right the to do. Think of all the gymnasts that just testified against the pedophile! 

Tell an adult you trust at the school. "
I'm sorry your boyfriend is so mean to you.  Using humor as a mask to insult you is cowardly and it's still just being mean.  You deserve better OP.
"I too had a friend exactly like this, used to work with animals, just kept taking more and more on and not taking care of them properly. She also had 2 kids and a chronic health condition, and things got so bad that I seriously considered calling animal welfare myself. I'm afraid I dont have much in the way of advice, as a few of her animals died over the course of a few months, some were just old and some of the others ... well at this stage I don't want to speculate. But anyway it seemed to wake her up to the fact that she wasn't coping, and she rehomed all except her cats and her 2 rabbits that lived in the garden. They all seem really well taken care of now so I don't think I need to do anything these days, but I do think pwople like this need a sharp wake up call. I wish I had had the guts to call animal welfare on her before, but I can't go back and change it now. 

I just wanted to say you aren't wrong in how you are feeling, and I think an anonymous tip to animal welfare may well be the wake up call she needs to sort herself and her animals out. "
"Yeah I don’t think the boy did anything wrong, although handled it a little rudely. Getting confronted by a girl and her group of friends is just awkward. He was definitely put into an awkward position, and it’s okay for people to have preferences. 

Also, OP even considering this racist is kind of a stretch. I seriously hope she doesn’t go off and start spreading rumors and hurting his reputation simply because she got rejected. "
"You don't get to tell other people what their boundaries are. Your boyfriend didn't handle this properly, but you completely gloss over any explanation of how you reassured him you weren't cheating on him. Clearly your ""friend's"" wife had some issues with the relationship, too. It's so selfish to dismiss other people's feelings with ""well i just have so many guy friends! I get along with them better! boyfriend knew this!""

EDIT: On second thought, if my boyfriend did to me what you did to your BF, I'd be livid. Texting late into the night with BF right there, going out for drinks late after work with a married man who has a wife and kids at home? OFC I would tell the spouse if I thought my SO was cheating on me with her husband. You stomped on your BFs boundaries and shamed him for having boundaries in the first place."
"You can always correct people and say ""actually he goes by michael""."
"He's doing what's known as testing the boundaries to see what you will put up with. It's considered emotional abuse and is a standard of how abusive relationships escalate. 

He is conditioning you to accept more and more abuse over time, and that means you have to get out as soon as you can.  "
"Let's be real here. The kind of person who wants to name their kid William Lastname XVI is absolutely the kind of person who would be offended by using his wife's last name.

This is why they do tests and they ask the parents if they want to continue making the zygote."
"Honestly, who cares? It's frustrating when somebody is obviously a selfish, cruel, awful person, and people defend them because 'illness.'

She's obviously mentally ill, but that does not make me feel any more sympathetic towards her. She isn't trying to help herself in any way, and she does not care about OP having to deal with the consequences of her actions. This woman is a grown ass adult and if she wants help she'll get it - OP isn't going to be able to swoop in and miraculously turn her sister's life (and personality) around. If anything, sister is going to be pissed and is probably living so deep in denial that she believes her perspective is the right one.

I have lots of mental illness in my family, so I do understand - but if I let that justify terrible behavior, my life would be full of toxicity.

You can expend all your remaining energy leading the horse to water, and even endure the pain it causes; in this case, she doesn't seem very likely to drink.

"This question is why I ended a serious and long term relationship last year.

I wanted attention, and I poked him playfully in the armpit, and he sat up, set aside his laptop, and kind of...slap punched my face? it was only once, and he was very sorry, but I still haven't forgotten the look of anger on his face when he did it, and when it was taking me weeks to ""get over it"" I asked if he'd see someone about his anger issues (he'd punched a hole in the wall before too) and he suggested instead I go see someone about my issues that were preventing me from letting it go.

I let loose one night on a friend and coworker about what I'd been going through and he just shook his head, said ""damn lady... I just can't help but wonder like what if this happened to my little sister"". Which made me wonder what I'd do if this happened to my sister. or my friends. or anyone I loved.

Broke up and didn't look back. 

edit to OP: respect yourself enough to make the choice, right now, that you are not the kind of woman that will ever put up with physical abuse of any kind. ever.
 
I never thought I'd have to make that decision and even though it was unbelievably hard to leave the person I genuinely thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, I am so proud and my life (and new relationship with a loving, and amazing man), are better than I ever thought possible. "
"Go talk to a lawyer so you know what your eviction options are, follow through and put down when you want her out in writing. You don't owe her anything at this point and you'll likely have to cut contact with her. It's going to be unpleasant but you need to just deal with it now directly. "

"&gt; Express your remorse that the dog died and explain that wasn’t the intent.

OP mentioned the sister demanding ""damages"" and the possibility of a lawsuit, and however unlikely it seems to us external observers, she knows her family best.

So no, she absolutely should not send a written note expressing ""remorse that the dog died."" Under the evidence law of most states that would be admissible, relevant evidence to prove fault. Remorse is not the right idea here even absent legal concerns anyway, it implies guilt, and OP's husband did nothing wrong.

I agree OP shouldn't needlessly antagonize the sister, but sometimes expressly agreeing to the false self-serving narratives family members construct for themselves can be counterproductive and encourage them to be even more unreasonable. And it is unlikely OP's husband would be ok with it--witnessing your child be attacked by an animal is horrible, and being blamed for the result of having to protect the kid is supremely unfair. The most he is probably going to be ok with is sympathy for the loss, while staunchly defending his actions, and understandably so. 

Private expressions of sympathy are fine, but if the sister or other family members try to say the husband was at fault, I would recommend immediately countering with a calm statement that ""if an animal attacks a small child, it could be fatal. My husband did what was needed to protect our child, and I fully stand behind him."""
Yep....Ive spent too much of my life staring at the refrigerator like its going to give me answers while acting like a pissed off she bear. I've learned to keep something small on hand to just shove in my face before I hit that point. 
"Yep.

And honestly, if he *does* break down and sleep with her, she'll lose interest immediately. And he'll be stuck with the guilt and broken family.

OP, keep your dick in your pants, tell her to back the fuck off (in a professional way), and get a lawyer. Imagine if it was your wife getting aggressively flirted with at work by a hot young coworker. Isn't that you would want her to do?"
"So many cases end up 'no charge' if the prosecutor doesn't see enough evidence for a solid case. It's not always best to immediately go to the police;in fact once they become aware their victim is trying to escape or fight back it often steels an abuser's resolve to not get caught. They may become more controlling or better about what they're doing.

A lawyer can be very helpful if successfully hidden.

"They actually do hurt someone. I watched a documentary about these drawings/comics and the people who buy them, which completely changed my attitude about them. Before that, I had the same thoughts that you had; ""oh it's just fantasy, what's the harm?"". What it's doing is normalizing pedophile thought patterns to the point where the actual pedophiles in Japan doesn't see their condition as a big deal anymore themselves. It leads to an extreme focus on underaged and often very young kids, not only in art and comics, but in photography and film - where the subjects are **real**. It's taking over Japanese culture. It normalizes their behavior. Therefore, in REAL LIFE, *real* kids are being hurt by the gradually accepting culture. Do you see the connections yet? "
"Dude. Everyone is giving you suggestions about how to fix her and help her and feed her. They are wrong. This is NOT your responsibility and you should not have to take over the emotional and physical labor of feeding a grown-ass woman. This is an ongoing problem and she needs to figure it out, whether that means seeing a therapist or doctor or keeping snacks on her person at all times. Right now she's prioritizing not having to deal with her eating disorder/hypoglycemia/hormonal imbalance/shitty annoying quirk over your feelings, comfort, and relationship. Even if she really really REALLY doesn't want to see a professional, all it would take to not ruin both of your days is remembering to pack a couple granola bars or some carrot sticks, for God's sake. If I was you, I would sit her down when she is happy and well-fed one day and explain to her that you can't be responsible for making her not be a jerk to you when she's hungry (in nicer terms). Set some boundaries, let her know how you will deal with these boundaries, and then follow through. Try: ""Girlfriend, I really love you and I'm here to support you but this food thing is impacting our relationship and fixing it is way above my pay grade - I don't have the expertise to figure this out and you need to talk to a doctor and come up with solutions. Next time this happens, I will make one suggestion, and if you don't like it and are unable to come up with something else, I will take you home so that you can get some food up in your body."" And absolutely follow through. ""Sweetheart that thing you just said really hurt my feelings. You're hungry and not feeling good. I'll get you an Uber home so you can go get your blood sugar up."" If she is unwilling to go ""Gee, I'll throw an apple in my purse because I don't want to hurt my boyfriend with a 100% completely and utterly preventable temper tantrum this afternoon,"" then I think you might have bigger problems anyway. Good luck, friend!"
"Of course, don't get cooped up. But that means going for walks or to the park. Or  to the library or community centre for baby/mom friendly activities. Most recent sized towns have things designed for babies and parents. 

But it's clear that OPs sister just wants to do activities that she likes even if they are not baby compatible and that is a problem. 

If you go to a ski resort, that means you're going on a drive there, maybe paying to get in etc. And so baby can touch some snow that they could touch at home? Beyond that, it is clear from the original post that mom would not be content with this. She would want to ski while someone holds the baby. 

Yes parents should try to keep their sanity by trying to do some activities, get some adult interaction etc. But they should also be reasonable in terms of what is and isn't possible or good for the baby."
"What kinder teaching moment are you suggesting could/should have been done, practically? It sounds like they tried really hard to find a solution that would work for the sister, and she refused everything that wasn't ""Bring the baby to laser tag and expect someone to hold them while she plays"". I definitely agree that it sounds like she needs to grow up a bit and realize that life is different now, but I'm not sure what OP could have done to handle this better."
"It sounds like you might be addicted to video games. Sometimes when I get too into something, I have to take a step back and look at it from an outside perspective. Is it really that fun, or is it just comfortable? Are there other things you think would be a better use of your time? If you are like this your whole life, will you look back on it in your old age and feel satisfied?

Perhaps you really do think it is the best use of your time, but if so you have to recognize you are prioritizing it over relationships. You shouldn’t pine for a healthy relationship on one hand while being completely unwilling to put any work or effort into it at the expense of gaming on the other hand. If you really don’t want to change, stop putting women through this. 

There are plenty of other gamers out there, and it sounds like you need to find a girlfriend with similar interests if you really want to keep dating. Even so, she is a person with needs too, and she likely won’t always want to game when you do. You have to prioritize her at times. Make time to do things with her and really be present. If you choose to be with someone, *be with them*. That isn’t just a physical requirement, but a mental one too. Train your mind to focus on being in the moment. Learn to recognize the benefit of not dwelling on other tasks like gaming while doing other activities, especially talking with her or fooling around with her. 

It’s a big wide world out there, and even if you don’t enjoy other popular pastimes, there may be other activities you enjoy that you haven’t explored yet. Try to figure out is it you really don’t like about other activities and work out what actually might be appealing if you try. Don’t like crowds? Well just getting out on the town might not be for you, but maybe there are some venues that aren’t packed and are filled with other quiet laid back people in your area. Like a chill bar with plenty of comfy seats that has a focus on board games. “Going out” doesn’t have to mean going to a club. Maybe you could get into some outdoor activities. Maybe for you it really does mean being home all the time, but maybe there are other activities at home you could enjoy with a partner. 

Bottom line is, you have to be someone who is appealing to date to have healthy and fulfilling relationships. You don’t sound like someone I would enjoy dating with this behavior. Imagine how people feel being with someone who prioritized something trivial over them? Relationships may not seem appealing to you because you haven’t ever been in a good one. Don’t date someone just to do it, try finding someone who really inspires you to please them and be your best self if this is something you actually want. And hey, if not that’s ok too. You might be asexual or aromantic, and that’s absolutely fine. You just need to really dig deep and figure out it is what you really want, and then act on those as long term goals instead of succumbing to the short term pleasure gaming easily provides if it is antagonistic to those goals.

It was an accident that happened at work due to our close quarters, so they understand. Im so glad we work for a company that's so caring towards their employees, aren't you?"" Ending on a question she's pretty much obligated to say Yes to and also changes the topic helps. It basically says, ""What you want isnt happening so lets talk about something else."" 

If you want to toss some shade US style, ""Co-worker, I'm sorry you feel that way. But, you know, that is some of the risk you take when you use a personal computer at work instead of a company-issued one. Accidents do happen, even at work. Thank goodness the company is going to take care of it anyway."" Which basically means, ""Idiot, should have accepted the free stuff. Not quit complaining cause your shit is getting fixed."" 

But, to be honest, she sounds like a nightmare, even by US standards. And what she's doing isn't an uncommon scam in the US. Tell someone they ""broke"" something expensive of yours, quote a high (but not too high) repair or replacement bill, and pressure them for the money until they just give in. People who do this know it doesnt always work but that is does work often enough, especially in a workplace where coworkers are motivated to keep the peace. "
"It seems pretty straightforward to me.  Your wife was cheating on you.  She's lied to you on multiple occasions.  She becomes manipulative when you catch her in her lies.  You no longer trust her.  She's checked out of the marriage for whatever reason.

Tomorrow, do some research and find a good lawyer.  Go see them first thing on Monday (turn off find friends).  Do what they say.

Do not let your wife know your plans until you actually file.  You don't *have* to file but it's good to know what your options are and what you'll need to do to prepare.  Even if you do file, you can withdraw.

Between now and then, think about what you would need from her to salvage this relationship and think about whether she has given you any indication about being interested in giving that to you.  If you think there's something left to salvage, also look for a marital counselor.  Go see them (together) as soon as you can.  Do what they say, too.  If she's not interested, see above re: lawyer."

"&gt;What kind of a fetish is this? Is this a normal thing for guys? It makes no sense, how can a man be attracted to seeing a woman just get fatter and fatter?

Google 'Feeder'. It's a real thing where someone gets off by making their partner gain more and more weight, which brings me to the first thing in your post that made me think you should dump him. He was doing this to you without your consent. He was intentionally trying to get you to gain weight. That's fucked up.

&gt;He's not getting the message that I don't want to be this weight, let alone even bigger. How can I make him understand?

It's not that he doesn't understand, OP. It's that he doesn't care about what you want. He's made it clear that his arousal is more important than your health, your feelings, or your self confidence. He's not going to stop trying to sabotage you. You need to end this before your health takes a nose dive but he can't prioritize you as a person over his erection. "
Ignore her. She's crazy. You did the right thing.
"&gt; am I supposed to pretend like it doesn't bother me then?

You say that you're having sex less frequently and if that's bothering you this much, you *should talk to her about it* (at a completely separate time to any initiating/being turned down incident). Sit her down and address it (help her to understand how undesirable it makes you feel; open up to her) but, don't pout if she turns you down because that'll push her even further away. "
"No, she won't. She's a 19 year old girl. She's not going to be able to do shit for you, and will likely not be in your life long. At her age she's got a lot to figure out for *herself.* She is not a university, or a welfare office, or a job placement agency, or a shelter. You should not be relying on her in any way. She doesn't belong in this post. Delete this and post the following:

""I'm a 21 year old man with no home, no job, and little education. How can I get it together?""

These are adult moves you need to make. A 19 year old girl should not be part of the equation right now. "
"When someone is basically waving a giant sign at you that says, ""I'M CHEATING ON YOU"", they lose the right to act offended when you suspect they are cheating. Even if it turns out that she (somehow) isn't cheating on you, it's completely reasonable for you to suspect she is, and if she can't explain her behavior (and acts like you're the crazy one for being suspicious) then you should probably just assume she is cheating and move forward in the same way you would if she had confirmed it. The alternative is to keep sitting there, watching her wave that sign around."
"&gt; Hearing someone parrot blatantly wrong things on a regular basis is like nails on a chalkboard

How is she wrong for wanting a plastic bag? Or liking spinach dip?

Since getting married last fall, except for a couple of extended relatives I've excised almost my entire blood family from my life.  My in-laws have been so fantastic, it's mind-blowing.  Her entire extended family has been so warm and welcoming, it's like I'm living in another dimension.

As for my father, he and one of my brothers couldn't even be bothered to come to the wedding!  (One other brother could of, but was legally barred from leaving the State due to his ankle bracelet.)  Not only that, but father hasn't even sent so much as a Congratulations, instead could only make snarky comments on photos people posted of the big day; it was so bad, even his siblings told him to zip it!!"
"In my opinion the older you get the less the age gap becomes a problem, if I read someone on here 27 with a  35 yo I dont bat an eyelid, 24 with a with a 32 yo, ok well have your fun, but maybe at some point the older person will want to be more serious while the 24yo may wanna still just have fun and enjoy life, 18 with a 26 yo. The 26 yo is a weirdo and I dont understand it. I think under 20 is still a bit different. But thats just me."
"I think some context would help. Is this the first major issue in your relationship? Have you successfully negotiated major issues before this?

"How was it a 'bait and switch' for her to come to a point where she felt overwhelmed? If she started off knowing she wouldn't be able to handle the situation and lied about it, *that* would be a bait and switch, but she didn't. I think your assessment is incorrect."

"He flat out stated that the only benefit to dating in his mind, is getting sex.  He is not thinking of them as a person to date, just as a service to provide for his needs.  He won't read, cuddle or hang around with them.  He wants someone who will come over to fuck and then leave him alone to game.  Thats not a girlfriend, that is a FWB or prostitute.  He needs to admit that's what he wants and look for that, not keep pretending he actually wants a relationship.  That is why people are saying he is being selfish.  He claims he wants a girlfriend and then refuses to provide any of the time or emotional requirements of a relationship, and that is selfish."

"The reason he wants to stay is the same reason you gave in the first time. Because it's EASY. What I mean is that the situation you have going on now is easier than going through a breakup. I've done this a couple times in two different long term relationships that I knew were no good. But it's a natural reaction to want to do things that are easy. But realize that the easier choice is not always the best one. As others have said (in less than supportive ways), you have decided you're not happy so it doesn't matter this reasoning for wanting to stay. You can't live your life trying to make someone else happy when you're miserable yourself. Good luck girl. I know it's hard. "

"My fiance and I read over the comments last night and discuss my history with Beth at length.

She's never there for me, but always expects me to be there for her. 

I've thrown her multiple birthday parties and she's never even thrown me one.

If I call her about an issue I'm having at work, she chimes in with a bigger issue she's having at work, then expects me to help her figure it out, all without acknowledge my issue.

She continuously redirects conversations so that the focus is on her. If she calls ""just to talk"" and I try to tell her about something exciting going on, she interrupts and takes the focus of the conversation back to her. Same thing when we're out with friends- she has a big issue with letting others have their time to talk.

She's ALWAYS negative. I honestly thought she just had an off sense of humor. But my fiance pointed out that Beth says awful things without sarcastic inflection and only claims she's joking when someone accuses her of being rude/intensive/etc. For example, when Beth's younger sister got engaged, Beth said, ""I hope he didn't make you pay for half of the ring, we all know how cheap he is"". She said this because they split costs evenly and Beth's sister paid for half of the trip that she got engaged on.

There's other examples too, but more alarming is her victim attitude. I never saw it until yesterday. Most recently it concerned going to the dentist. She commutes a long way to work (2.5 hours round trip). Because of this she leaves early in the morning and gets home after normal business hours. She had a filling come out a year ago. She complains all the time about not being able to go to the dentist because of work. When a viable solution is suggested- take a day off, go during vacation time, find someone that works weekends- Beth has an excuse as to why she can't. It's always someone's fault- they'll fire her for taking off, she shouldn't have to use her vacation time for that or that she can't go during vacation because they'll be booked already because that's everyone's vacation time, she called one dentist's office and they were ""rude"" to get when she asked if they were open weekends and told her that NO ONE is opened on weekends.

It's exhausting to watch her run after any excuse she can find while simultaneously she's searching for reasons to complain. She wants sympathy and I'm all out."
"Do you have children?

If you don't, I wouldn't spend another second with someone who doesn't have the decency to respect all of that history. History betrayed is for me, taking a huge positive number, and sticking a negative sign next to it. You have 1 million credits of history? Cheating is turning it into 1 million debits.

The beautiful thing is, at your age, you have the time and resources to find someone who is not a decision you made when you were less young, less wise, and less the person you are now. But a decision to be with someone who matches the person you ARE, not the person you were, and who respects and loves you and can be faithful to you. 

You are being idealistic. History does not make up for betrayal. Cheating is cheating. But even worse - you CAUGHT HER. She did not confess. She did not stop it herself. You caught her and her apologies and guilt only came after.

There's no excuse for it. Leave. Heal. Grow. Come back and find the love of your life, someone with enough character and loyalty to not cheat."
They probably think you're naive because you definitely are.  You just want a relationship 100% on your terms instead of meeting in the middle or addressing that they have needs too. A woman 5-10 years older likely doesn't have time for your bs. You might be attracted to older women but the relationship your looking for is much easier to find with someone your own age. 
As others have stated. You need to sit down with him and have a discussion about all of what marriage entails. And weddings as well. Maybe ask him what he thought weddings are for? 
If any guy proposed to any girl with the condition she has to undergo plastic surgery to alter herself we would all blow up at him. He’s asking you to alter yourself in order to get married and a marriage with conditions does not sound like a happy one. 
"Shit needs to go down then. What you're saying is literally ""if I decide to have any free will or agency in this relationship, shit goes down."" He's trying to argue you out of your own emotions. That's not okay.

He needs to deal. If your relationship can survive him realizing that you can make your own decisions, then it'll be stronger for it. If it can't, is that the relationship you really want?

Loving someone is not enough to have a good relationship. Respect, communication, etc. are also required."
She's put in zero effort with the family herself. This isn't on them entirely. She doesn't talk to them or even look them in the eye. Why in the hell would they feel like they need to make her feel welcome?

"I don't think your being an asshole or unreasonable, but I think you could take some steps before kicking her out. 

Since she is from an unusual situation, she probably isn't used to cleaning up after herself. This isn't really an excuse and she should be, but it needs to be taken into consideration. 

I think you, your gf, and the friend need to sit down and talk about expectations of keeping a cleanly home and respect about sharing spaces. Make a chore list, or remind her to pick up right after she cooks (just don't be snotty about it). Talk about what is okay for you to say to her when you want to her to clean up, so you don't hurt her feelings. 

I think it's going to be a learning curve, but I think it can work if you're patient. "
"A scant four months in and I’m blissfully in love. My guy is kind, a giant geek (like me!), funny, and handsome. I knew things were going to be great since the first date.

2. He's actually wrong about nutrition. You can skip meals. It's actually fine if you get the nutrients and macros you need from other meals. There is no precious time window where you'll whither away if you don't supply your body with nutrients. He would blow a gasket if he ever heard of r/intermittentfasting !

yes, I can carry and have children, and no, cerebral palsy is not genetic. It's basically a traumatic brain injury.

"As someone who was actually physically abused, this mentality that a spanking every once in a while is the same as hitting your children and that it's so horrible and scars them really frustrates me. It belittles actual abuse when you act like spanking is the same thing. It's not. It's quite frankly a really offensive and naive point of view.

I'm not saying spanking is a great form of discipline but what you're basically saying is that grabbing a stranger's ass is equivalent to raping them. Neither are okay, but let's not pretend they're the same thing please."

"It's not about napkins... her entire family and all of her friends have opinions about her wedding... the whole event is reflection on her ability to plan and accomplish, not to mention all the stress that having a bunch of family in town does.

Because she is suuuuuper stressed... Clearly I mean, she CRIED OVER NAPKINS."
"This is just some perspective.  We have a saying in our house though.  Every day is Valentine's Day.  My husband doesn't do much for valentine's day itself - no gifts or cards. (He did do a nice dinner last night but that was mostly because the lobster was on sale at the grocery store. lol.)  On the regular, my husband does nice, lovely, thoughtful, considerate things for me, like warming up the Keurig so it's ready when I come downstairs, surprising me with subscriptions to my favorite magazines, leaving treats in my purse, or clearing snow off my car and warming it up.  This is how he shows his love for me.  It's all the time, not just on special days.  So, ask yourself - is your boyfriend good about shows of affection in other ways?  If so, then maybe give him a pass for V-day.  If not, then maybe a conversation about expectations and realities is called for, at a time when you're not upset or angry.    "
"To add onto the excercise ball. When thinking of gifts, be sure to keep in mind if the gift is related to something she does for herself or something she does for the family. 

Examples of things she may do for herself: manicures/pedicures, hobbies, reading books

Examples of things she may do for the family: cleaning, cooking, giving birth, raising a child, having a job

Do not buy her something that helps with something she does for the family. That should come out of your joint expenses, it's not a gift. For example, you shouldn't buy her a vacuum cleaner to help her clean the apartment. You shouldn't buy her a new pan to help her cook.

"A real best friend wouldn’t try to pit OP against his wife, like he’s doing here, sending you all the screenshots, etc. All for a joke that isn’t that great. You want people who support your relationship at your wedding, not people who try to cause rifts between you for petty reasons.

I say you have a come to Jesus talk with him, and if he still won’t budge, you gotta demote him and reconsider the friendship."
"I don't know how this company works but as someone that has been an interviewer at a tech company, I usually go into the room with very little information about a candidate except their resume. I don't ask other people's opinions of them because I don't want their bias to affect me before I've made an evaluation. (Later we do combine all our impressions and make a group decision.) This might be the 6th interview for you but it will be the 1st for me and my intention is for you to leave with 1) the feeling that you were able to show your best side during the interview and 2) a positive impression of the team and the company.

If you're getting this far in interviews, you're probably doing great. You just need that final push to get over the finish line. Getting this interview means you've got another chance to make a first impression with someone, and that someone could be a great advocate for you behind closed doors."

"I grew up in an actual abusive home and was stealing our groceries by the time I was in high school, but I can still buy my boyfriend a VD gift, for Chrissakes.

"I think your wife being more worried with the ""corruption"" of your daughter rather than her getting hit in the face by a boyfriend is very concerning. Your sons may have escalated the situation but I'm assuming they did so with good intentions and they weren't just looking for an excuse to fuck someone up. You've got good kids that can work together and look out for one another.

It sounds like your wife could use somebody else to talk to. I would encourage her to seek other opinions (both personal and professional) if she's not willing to listen to you."
"&gt; I really don't think that I am an overly pretentious communicator

But your opinion of yourself is not the only one that matters here. Conversation is between you and another person. If the other person thinks you are pretentious, then you might be, and regardless you have to make a change if you want to improve the relationship. 

&gt; typical manner of speech as possible

I'm laughing because you're already speaking so much more formally than I or my friends ever do, and we're fairly well-educated. I would have said something like ""the way I usually talk."" You may not be the most pretentious person but you're far from the least, that's for sure. 

&gt; spoke to me like an adult from a young age and expected me to follow suit

So, that's a great parenting technique they used on you. It does explain who you are today. However, be careful that you don't assume this is a normal way for people to talk to each other. Parents can talk to their kids and challenge them if they want, they have that power. But your husband's family are your peers, they are adults. You can't just blab all your favorite words and expect them to nod along children. Did your parents ever code-switch? Just because your parents talked to you that way, doesn't mean they talked to every child that way, or every person that way. 

&gt; his family feels like they are playing The Vocabulary Game when they're with me and get frustrated trying to ""keep up."" 

This is a whole bunch of issues wrapped together. Not only are you using words that they think are snobby, but they also feel unable to keep up. Do they ever stop you and ask to define a word? (This may embarrass them too much to ask.) Do they ever seem to think you are talking too much, too long, or too selfishly? (What topics are you talking about with them when the big words come out, exactly?) How much do you ask them about themselves and how their lives are going? Pay attention to what kind of words they use and use active listening to respond. Use similar words to what they use, don't jump at opportunities to use your favorite words even if it would be the ""perfect"" word for that moment. They don't care, haha. 

&gt; Fair enough, re: flummoxed. It's just difficult because it's natural to me to use slightly more advanced (or unusual, more precise to context, etc) words and I think sometimes genuinely don't know which ones are less commonly used. 

This indicates to me that you are not really listening to his family. You say your own friends and family say those words all the time, but what about his family? What kinds of words do they use? Think about each person and their favorite words and phrases, as an exercise. 

&gt; I'm hurt

I mean.... it sucks to have been cut out of the group chat. But your husband is just proposing an idea for how to fix things. Why is your big vocabulary more important that harmony in your marriage and family? Chill out! 

&gt; When I asked how I could do this without being condescending, he got defensive 

Well yeah. You asking ""but however could i possibly do this without being condescending?"" you are acting like it's an impossible task or that you don't want to do it. Your husband was suggesting a fix for a problem. You could have replied, ""OK, I want to speak plainly. But I'm worried I don't know how. Can we maybe practice together or something?"" But instead you dismissed his idea outright. Of course he got defensive. 

&gt; But when I asked for more concrete examples of how to change, he couldn't really answer.

Why don't you both go brainstorm some ideas separately for how to fix this? Why is it only his job? You should do some research too. 

&gt; I'm not even sure that how I speak can be toned down

If you're as smart and educated as you say, then you can figure out a way to do this, no excuses!

As a college-educated person who loves books and poetry, I still think many of your words are overpowered for everyday speech. Here's a word, and what I would say instead: typical, usual. boon, benefit. embraced, loved. flummoxed, confused. And a lot of your words are flat out unnecessary too. Most adverbs aren't that useful in everyday speech. Also, sentences can be shorter. ""By young teenagers, sure, but it's been said nonetheless"" could easily be ""By teenagers, but still"" 

The reason why I mention this is because there's a huge difference between saying ""man, this problem has got me flummoxed"" and ""This problem, which I believe we all hold as important to our family, has me quite flummoxed, this is far beyond the typical problems I have encountered."" The former has a single difficult word in an otherwise simple, to-the-point context. Someone could easily ask, ""Flummoxed, what's that?"" or ""How so?"" for clarification. But the latter is more complex in multiple ways and has multiple difficult words. Can you see how it might be frustrating for someone to understand? Can you see how you might adapt your speech beyond just vocabulary? "
"Un-hunh. See he's right that . . .

&gt; He says inviting only half of a coupe to a trip is disrespectful 

But that's not what happened here. He is invited. 

&gt;and believes my cousin should have either not offered to get me a ticket or should have got tickets for both of us.

This is both extremely selfish and downright laughable. That he expects the bride to pay for his ticket is laughable. She doesn't even know him. Why should she do that? That he thinks you shouldn't get a ticket if he doesn't is extremely selfish. He's actually saying that if he doesn't get offered a free vacation to see *your* family then you shouldn't be able to see your family? So he'd literally rather you both not get to see *your* family then you be happy without him for a couple days. It's like he doesn't care about your happiness or your family at all. 

&gt;He expects me to do what's best for our relationship, which in his opinion is to either not go, or ask my cousin to get him a ticket as well, or at least cover half of the cost of his plane ticket.

Nope, nope, nope. Assuming you want to keep dating this guy you need to keep this to yourself. I'd be clear with him that his behavior is extremely entitled and you love him so you don't want your family to hear about this as you want them to like him. Also, it's just rude to ask. Horrible first impression. You not going is just cruel on his part. If he can't get a free vacation you can't see your own family so as not to hurt his feelings? He's acting like the kid who needs his parents to buy him a present at other people's birthday parties. And it's not your job to pay half his ticket either until you get married. So long as you are adults with separate finances sometimes one of you will have something or get to do something the other doesn't. Is he going to be expected to buy you a matching present every time his family gets him something? 

Honestly, I'd show him this thread. Hopefully the fact that every single person thinks he's wrong and his behavior is embarrassing will be a wake up call to him. If like you said he's an otherwise nice and reasonable guy hopefully he'll realize that it's not a normal thing to ask and maybe even apologize. That best for the relationship line was out of line. It's best for the relationship for him to turn this around and give you the apology you deserve. "

I am so sorry that he is not the same person that he used to be.  You seem to be a really strong person to deal with all this and to keep trying to heal this relationship.  I certainly don’t have that patience haha.  Just know that you have the qualities of a good wife and that someone is sure to appreciate and see that - even if it’s not your current husband.

No more credit cards, no loans, no nothing. Work out how much can be paid on each account until it’s paid off. Destroy the cards and don’t let a single additional charge happen. 

3. He needs to get a second job to start paying this debt. He can work evenings/weekends and put every dime he earns toward the debt.

"While that's a sensible approach for the most part (and I think a lot of people would do the same if they came into significant money), you **took it too far**.


This isn't about the money, this is about you not trusting your family / girlfriend enough to tell them. You should have told them before you even knew it was successful. Succeed / fail, it doesn't really matter.

Instead, she's finding out now about this part of your life that *you didn't trust her enough to know about*, and is understandably upset. If someone betrays your trust, you probably won't want to buy them a present right?

Take a step back, figure out why you really didn't tell her (hell, maybe you're just young and ashamed to fail in front of people), but focus on working through that. See if you can rebuild your trust and keep your girlfriend. The whole money thing is just a sideshow. "

You also said that she loves you but love doesn't hurt you like she is hurting you.  Her words do not match her actions.

I'm a service industry professional. Your girlfriend has gotten caught in a cycle of hopelessness. She can only see her crappy job and her crappy future with that crappy job. Obviously there are better bartending jobs out there. Bartending is a very lucrative part of the service industry and she should not be struggling with her bills if she is at a good place.

"You aren’t friends with John. You’re not. If you were his friend, you would have met his wife more than at a work party. You would have been invited to events at his house, with your boyfriend. You may not see it now, but you were in an emotional affair with this guy who is 11 years older than you with a REAL wife and kids. "

"Idk, it could be a little embarrassing for her. Wearing glasses indoors is really conspicuous and her friends and family probably think its odd. If I had a partner who got into a fedora-wearing phase, I might be asking for advice on how to approach the topic sensitively."

You don't have to start going to gay bars or marching in pride (though it's fun as hell). "
"I agree with you and did raise an eyebrow myself reading this comment but at the same time, I can see where the person who wrote it got this belief from. 

By pure chance I just stumbled upon an amazing article that's been doing the rounds on social media and describes this issue brilliantly. Links are not allowed here but google **The female price of male pleasure** , it's from The Week."
"His special punching bag. It’s also telling that he was at his most affectionate when you were weak. But don’t be so hard on yourself. When abusers are charming they can be very charming, like your dream guy. You can feel like you’re going crazy trying to get back to when it was good, and you mourn the parts that were good. 

The fact you got sucked in by an abuser and are sad doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with you or you’re weak or dumb. I have friends who went to Ivy League schools who have gotten sucked in by abusers. “He’s a special snowflake, he just has a temper when he drinks!” 

You saw it, you got out of it, and you’ll know better and choose better next time. That’s the important thing."
"If she was having some type of inappropriate relationship with this guy, then many people would tell her boyfriend to tell the wife. That's repeated here a lot (and debated, too)."
This is exactly what I was thinking. Sister is in trouble.
"There's not much you can do, honestly. Just remember that they said it because they're immature and full of shit... not because you are. Their opinions mean nothing. "
Right so listen to what you’re saying.  You watch Asian porn but have a white gf.  Would YOU prefer to date an Asian woman is that why you’re insecure because you’re projecting?  I only watch lesbian porn but have a boyfriend.  
Maybe you don't want to stay with this guy. I wouldn't want to stay with a partner who was mean to me and then gaslighted me by calling me sensitive. He's putting you down so you'll be insecure and easy to push around. That's not a healthy relationship dynamic.

"This worked for my aunt when her mom (my grandma) wouldn't stop urging her to have a relationship with her dad.

She said something like this: ""Mom, this is my life and my relationship, and I can choose for myself who I do or do not want in my life. I understand that it's hard for you, but YOU have to understand that if I ever am going to have a relationship with him, it's going to be MY choice and will never be at your request. I need you to respect my boundaries. From now on, if you mention this, I am going to walk away from the conversation. Please don't bring it up again.""

Of course her mom reacted exactly as you'd assume, ""I'm just trying to help,"" ""I don't see why you won't just talk to him for five minutes,"" etc etc. 

But the thing that made the difference is that my aunt would actually literally get up and walk away if her mom brought it up. She would, without a word, just get up and leave the room. Or if they were on the phone, she would hang up. After a few times, my grandma got the picture and begun to bring it up less and less. Eventually they were able to have an actual conversation about it where my grandma apologized and my aunt actually felt heard/respected.

Obviously this won't work for every situation, but I think the core of the method is the important part. Your grandparents need to know that if they push any more, they'll push you away. I hope this helps! Good luck with all this. I don't envy your situation. "
"Ahahhahaha. 

You posted a description of your situation here and asked if you’re being an asshole, I responded that you’re being dumb, and you say that it’s impossible to judge that you’re an asshole based on what you posted. 

How about next time, you just leave out any story at all and just post “I’m right, right?” and everyone can agree with you no problems!

"I imagine it likely would end up in small claims, and the damages, wouldn't be much. It likely would not be worth pursuing, but I have a feeling (it's been a long time since I've looked at battery tort elements and it's state law dependent anyway) this could result in civil liability for him. Regardless, what matters is mostly that the hair cutting was a fucked up thing to do."
"Picking is never a one way street and you know that. I’m glad that your tiny handful of ridiculous anecdotes makes you think that there’s nothing to raise an eyebrow at when a person dates someone in a different stage of development, though.

"Its really nice that he let you know that you could have stayed in the bed, without either of you getting upset. Its also really nice that he wasn't upset you left. As far as sleeping in the bed together, I think its really ok (when you are all ready for it). You have been together a couple years now, and recently met his daughter. You guys are really on the right track! I would suggest that it is time to start thinking and talking about how his daughter will fit into your relationship, so that when these situations occur again, you have a plan and don't obsess over it in the days after."
"Sounds like he is trying to turn being an *insensitive jerk* into something that she should *feel sorry for him* about.  Like he's the real victim here.  No one UNDERSTANDS him.

"If this girl came back to the same city as your boyfriend, single, and told him she was ready to date him again - tell me, in your heart of hearts, what would your boyfriend do?"
"I completely understand not wanting a person your group isn’t  intimate with crashing your trip, however, it sounds like this girl is okay with that and is largely doing her own thing with her own friend.  Without knowing anything about her, I’m not sure why you’re nervous she’ll be “stalking”?  Or even why you think it’s weird that she would plan a trip at the same time as her significant other? It makes perfect sense to travel and vacation while your partner is also doing something - first, there’s no rule that says while he’s out having fun she has to sit home and be bored. Why *not* take the time he’ll be spending with his friends to see her friends? Also, if either has some spare time that works out they get to meet up someplace cool like NYC. She might also see it as a chance to meet you guys all together once while also seeing her friend. Lots and lots of reasons why this makes sense.

If this girl shows up and suddenly insists on being included in everything, yes, stick up for yourselves. But don’t jump to conclusions."
That age gap is nothing. You guys are at the same stage in life.
"They can never get anything from you anyway, only from the estate. But yeah never sign anything, they will try and manipulate you."
"OP, sorry to say this, and I hope you use it to reflect, but I think this is your chance to look at your family as an outsider. You know your parents, they raised you. You expect this from them. (Just as children of drug addicted parents expect abuse and neglect.) Your parents are over bearing and obnoxious. You allow it, because it doesn't bother you. It bothers your wife. She's addressed it with you. She's tried to tolerate it. But it isn't getting better.

She understands your parents mean well, which is why she doesn't want them to not be involved. She, herself, just cannot handle them, since you won't address the issues."
"You do not need to convert to be married in a Catholic Church. Only one of the parties has to be Catholic. You do however have to do premarital counseling, which varies by parish. At our parish it was a single counseling session, at others it can be a lot more."

"I'm thinking a bit part of what you're feeling is that he judged you and put you down for this. It's sad he did that, and TBH I don't think the follow up comment of essentially ""Don't worry, I'll teach you"" is all that better. 

BUT despite that miscalculation on his part and unfortunate choice of words, it doesn't sound like this is a big deal in your relationship and nothing can really change the fact that, here you are, getting ready to marry one of the first guys you were serious about. I don't recommend you open the relationship, take a break, or cheat to change that fact. What you need to figure out is whether this is going to become a rift for you. Are you going to constantly have the nagging feeling that you should have had more experiences? Are you going to feel self-conscious about not having more 'skills'? Is he going to treat you like you're a second-class citizen because you haven't slept with several partners? If the answer to these is no, then let this go. "
"I had this with a guy I was interested in. Much like you, I like to be left alone when I’m sad (however, for me, that’s not *always* the case and sometimes I’ll want to talk right away). 

&amp;nbsp;
After one such time of sadness, I wanted to be left alone. I was in the middle of my emotions and I wasn’t handling them well. I couldn’t really articulate my feelings and I was giving a bit of an info diet to the guy. The day after, I told him what I was feeling when I had the words to do so. I also tacked on that sometimes, when I get like that, I don’t have the words to tell him how I feel and I want to deal with it privately. I also said that I’d tell him how and why I was feeling like that when I was ready. It may take a while, but I’ll get there. It could be a few minutes, it could be a few days, but eventually I’ll tell him.

&amp;nbsp;
Tell her that when you get sad, you want to be left alone. If she presses, tell her that’s just how you are and how you deal with it. Compare it to how she is when she gets sad. Does she like to be held and comforted during that time? Does she like to have her own space and privacy, then talk about it later? Does she just bottle it up and then it explodes everywhere when shit hits the fan? Everyone is different when it comes to being sad and she needs to understand that (if it’s the last one, that’s not really good for mental health). Tell her, just do it when you’re not sad, that way you can calmly tell her how you feel. 

&amp;nbsp;
I did the opposite of that with my dad. I was sad and he asked me what was wrong and I said “nothing”. He sees that something is wrong and asks me again. I repeated that nothing was wrong. He kept pressing and the more he asked, the angrier I got. We ended up fighting for probably most of that car ride and you could feel the tension inside. He now knows that I want to be left alone and does so. "
This is the best way. She’s being an ass. You’ve only been together 6 months. Time to cut loose.
"That's really compassionate of you, but I do agree that if he were indeed suffering from a mental illness, he probably wouldn't be super receptive of you pointing it out. "
"21 and 16 is an inappropriate age gap and is going to be unhealthy and inappropriate to keep a secret relationship going for 2 years, end it and find someone closer to your age or at least in the same stage of life. "
You need a lawyer immediately. This is horrifying on so many levels. LISTEN to the panic. Your body recognizes the threat this guy poses. Do not just start popping pills. This is going to lead you down a whole other horrible path. Leaving needs to be your priority. Your husband is incredibly unwell and who knows how dangerous. Please LEAVE. Heed all the advice you are getting here and go.

"I had a similar issue after my first breakup where I had no idea who I was because I depended so much on that relationship to define who I was.

Try thinking if there's anything that you wanted to do but previously couldn't because of him.

"This. The legal and financial aspect will work itself out, it’s temporary. The bigger picture here is taking care of yourself and making the right choices for a happy future.

This completely contradicts what you said earlier about how she gave you her friend's number, told you you were free to date her friend sarcastically, and hasn't been talking to you. "
"If you don't want to waste your time, sit him down and talk to him about it.

Be concise and make a timeline with specific dates. It's time for an ultimatum.  If he doesn't follow the timeline, leave him. He's wasting your time.

Honestly, the way he reacts to you bringing it up is worrying. I think he is acting this way because he's probably not ready for marriage anytime soon. It's been 8.5 years, shit or get off the pot."
"First: finish your project, and if possible check if he's single. If he is, go for it! Worst case scenario, it'll be briefly awkward, and that's fine. Ignore the ex, and don't worry about dating within your major. "
"Yes, it's a red flag. It's a double-red flag that the morning after, he's pressuring you for immediate reassurance ""or I guess we're breaking up then,"" and making you to all the emotional labor to ""fix"" it (asking what he needs to do to make it right, instead of himself coming up with suggestions like counseling or giving you some space).

Now, this next bit is NOT to justify or excuse his behavior, but I do want to point at that even if your outbursts are not directed ""at him,"" when you throw things or punch things, that IS a physical expression of anger, and it is VERY scary to be in the presence of someone who is punching and throwing things, even if it's not AT someone, it it scary and FEEELS like aggression. BUT that does not make it okay for him to act the way he did, either.

He acted violently. Then he pressured to you be ""over it"" by the next morning, and implied if you weren't, the relationship is over, AND even though you're the victim, he's trying to get YOU to reassure HIM. That is seriously manipulative. If you still want to try to salvage things, even knowing that, I would at least insist on counseling separately for him, and together."
"She's projecting like an IMAX, sounds like."
Strongly agree with this. Not agreeing to meet will end badly for you. Just go calm and prepared. Don't let the shit she flings in the meeting stick and be the pinnacle of professionalism.
"She made plans before you two were dating, she likely spent money buying tickets to go, clothes, etc... just because you two started dating recently doesn’t mean she has to cancel plans she made before. 

Edit: honestly she isn’t “ditching” you, get over yourself if you want to make things work. If you are gonna be like this only two weeks in I’d be incredibly annoyed and rethinking the relationship. "
"First, sorry my broken english, its not my native language.

Second: she seems to never had tell she's a lesbian to anyone. Think about it, she just outed herself, she's in love (not love, infatuation, but lets just call it love for now) with you probably for a very long time. She exploded in just one shot. There is some bad behaviour about force you to be in a relationship, but please, put yourself in her shoes one second, she's confused and probably ashemed and scared.

Talk to her, but in person, no calls, no messages.

Hope you can save your friendship and sorry  if my texting is a little bit weird."

"As far as I understand it you can’t get too far back as an American in the south without finding out your family owned slaves.  That’s not to say everybody owned slaves, but it’s not as if it was uncommon.

The sad part about this is she probably means well.  When your young and learning about injustices it can be hard to hold back.  It’s not as if we can immediately learn nuanced opinions on slavery and reparations.

But also like...  chill girl!  What makes you so great? "
"I’m a little confused as to why you feel disgust towards her because she did something that was totally sanctioned in your relationship? It doesn’t sound like she did anything disgusting. 

I think I would start by being very honest about the emotions you’re feeling. Is it really disgust/anger/hurt? What is it exactly? And why do you feel that way? It’s not going to help if you’re being dishonest (even inadvertently) about the real emotions you’re feeling."
"Hah, that's what I was thinking. Sounds just like my ex-Marine cousin. Married a girl he met in Mexico immediately after he got out. Always going on glamorous adventures, and it was a total mystery where his income came from. (They were together for ten years and remain friends!)"
"&gt;  I'm at my wit's end, honestly. I don't know what went wrong when I raised him. No one in the family is physically abusive, or verbally abusive.

The fact that you think that's the only thing to parenting shows me that you really have no idea. 

You've obviously been extremely slack in ever actually disciplining him or setting rules, this is something you need to fix immediately, preferably with the help of an adolescent psychologist"
"&gt; M ended up finding out about my past. We had a talk he told me to be honest about everything, he told me that he believes women can do whatever they want, but they can't expect guys like him to be there for them when they are done sleeping around. He told me that I didn't even left the party scene, I was kicked out because I got replaced by prettier and younger women. His words made me cry not just then, but long after too. 

Wow, what a cruel, shitty thing to say to you. If he had said ""I'm not comfortable with your past and I can't be with someone who lied to me,"" that's one thing. Anyone can break up for any reason they want, and while that sucks on it's own, it's understandable. 

But for him to then say that you were replaced by prettier and younger women in the scene? And that because of your past you don't deserve a steady healthy relationship now? To yell at you, and then ghost you? He may have treated you better than anyone you'd been with before, but that doesn't mean he was a good partner. 

You were only 8 months in, the honeymoon period. Just as you concealed your past and it finally came out, he concealed the shittier parts of his personality, and those parts finally came out.

Please take care of yourself. You deserve a partner who will treat you well all the time."
"It starts after moving in, and it's so gradual that I don't tend to notice right away. I don't expect constant attention so it's easy to just see it as life getting in the way, rather than a pattern, until one day I kind of wake up and realize it's a pattern. "
"Ghosting is NOT an adult or acceptable way to breakup with someone. I think you might just have shitty luck based on what you've told us here but it's hard to say when you write things like your description of yourself or ""I am thinking that if I had a lot of money, my chances of being ghosted will decrease in the future."" That comes across as kind of needy and nice-guy type. 

Could you send her an email/fb message/whatever and tell her that you know it's over but would really like an explanation so you can be better for someone in the future? This has only happened twice out of how many relationships, two?"
"Some people tend see other people as projects. They make it their goal to ""fix"" another person, then pat themselves on the back when things work out. These people also tend to get very upset when the target goes off-script. Someone who does good things for bad reasons isn't a good person, and it sounds like you've realized where this guy's true intentions lie."

"This! **Tact!! Consideration!!** The horror!! 

Even if that is what you think - OP's bf HAD to know that it was going to make her feel bad. These are situations when white lies are perfectly acceptable. "

"""Respect"" for her Ex at the cost of being massively disrespectful to you....huge red flag "
"There's a big difference between being supportive and being overbearing and pushy.  

You can't support him if you don't respect him.  And if you keep bringing up his weight when he's making it *very* obvious that he doesn't want to talk about it with you, you aren't respecting him.  What you think of as his jokey demeanor is him trying very hard avoid the topic.

This is a marathon, not a sprint.  Focus on your relationship with him.  Focus on making sure he feels loved and respected by you.  At some point he may decide it's time for him to lose weight and some support could be really helpful.  You want to be the person he calls when he's been running for a week and can't deal with it, but you need to *earn* that by being someone worthy of opening himself up to.  "
"It is funny actually, because at least your brother probably realises that he is too heavy. But you are absolutely blind when it comes to seeing that you are doing more harm than good.

And his ""healthy"" sister is probably the last person he wants to talk about it."
"If the other person is smart, now that they’ve stolen the nice case they won’t be storing their instrument there anymore.."

The fuck?! That’s just out-right misogyny there. I think you need more than just a new laptop. 
"
I would forgive and forget about this one.
"Honestly, I see so many relationships where people are introducing people to their kids possibly after the second date and moving in after a couple of months...it's super refreshing to see you guys taking it as seriously and responsibly as you are. 

Edit: I don't know how you feel about kids in general or your future developing a relationship with her, but my daughter is the exact same same--three in April--and it's absolutely the most fun stage so far. Kids this age are a delightful bundle of affection and laughs and trouble and surprising cleverness, so if you're fully signed up then you could be in for a fun ride. :-)"
Carbs in a bucket is what she’s been avoiding!
lock your door until he moves out
"I really agree with what you've said here, and I think several other commenters are being quite unfair with their criticism towards OP in bringing up his race. Unfortunately stereotypes and prejudice can greatly hinder your ability to date. I can't tell you how many times I've started talking to/dating a guy and he broke up with me because his parents/grandparents/friends/whoever would be against the relationship. Purely because of my race. My POC friends have more often than not had the same experiences in interracial relationships. One of my friends even had a guy tell her he wanted to continue seeing her, but in complete secrecy. It can be very discouraging and have an effect on your self esteem in the long run. "

"I've really been thinking about this comment and I am a big promoter of positive reinforcement. I am going to try this, thank you for your viewpoint. I just don't want to do it so many times that it plays me for a fool. "
"No, it's ok, you didn't do anything wrong. I sound frustrated but just because I'm mad that there's this whole category of guys who drag their feet on proposals. The general advice is, you have the right to a solid timeline in your relationship, and wanting to get married is a reasonable goal. If your bf doesn't want to get married for whatever nebulous reason, he owes it to you to tell you so. If he does want to get married, you should be able to tell him you want a proposal and he should deliver one. Usually people here suggest giving a timeline, like ""we will be engaged by the end of the year"" and then he has 12 months to get it together, after which you will leave him if he doesn't. Wanting to get married is *not* unreasonable.

Edit: I'm also mildly annoyed the mods don't collect similar posts in general. Not frustrated at OP at all. "

"google 'death grip' ... i'd bet money that's his problem. that plus negative mentality.

as for the fact that he 'doesn't seem into' other things besides PIV, well, he'd better start trying to get into it! there's absolutely NO reason you should be left feeling unsatisfied if he's at least got working hands, mouth, and a Can Do Attitude. honestly, the fact that that wasn't his M.O. from the beginning of your bedroom issues makes me think you're swimming upstream in the wrong river, honey."
Take her out to lunch and cherish the nice friend you have.
"Thank you. I think I’ll have to sit her down and talk to her once she is feeling a bit better. I’ll tell her just what I am feeling and how I am having trouble coping and see what she says. I know she doesn’t think my feelings don’t matter which is good, but it still doesn’t fix them."
"&gt; The only reason I can think of for doing that is that you plan to sleep with this woman eventually and if your wife knew she was being inappropriate, she would be on the lookout for strange behavior.

 This is an unfair promise to make to OP. You have no way of knowing whether she'll regret keeping the pregnancy or not. 
"Yeah... and that whole thing about how he doesn't like some bugs because they bite and whatever, I mean, you're allowed to not like things but this reasoning sounds annoying, especially for someone who clearly loves them and knows how important they are for biological control.

It needs some context, do you keep saying how you don't like bug 1 or something, like, non-stop? I'd be annoyed if that was the case.

Also the whole cooing and constantly saying ""I love you"" to the plants ... I mean... that's how you talk to pets and babies, not your SO. I tell I love my cat and turtle all the time... dude

"&gt; I can buy a trailer today and realistically never be homeless again so I want to do it. My Mom will never be homeless again. My sister will never be homeless again. Because I own a piece of property and worse case scenario we will always pay rent on the land

That's actually not realistic at all. Even if this is a brand new trailer, a trailer isn't gonna be even standing by the time you retire. Plus you're planning on paying for maintenance AND the rent for the rest of your life on the possibility that maybe one day you or your family may need to move in? It would be a waaay better choice to save that $100 a month + expenses and just put it in a saving account as an emergency fund for rent for a cheap place if something were to happen. Your math and ideas of an investment are way off, maybe you two should see a financial planner."
"Fair enough, I absolutely was assuming it was the US, since your writing seemed consistent with American English! My apologies. 

I won't pretend I'm up to speed with Philippine family law, but wherever you are the certainty of an agreement is better than the not knowing without one in my opinion. 

I encourage you to follow it up sooner rather than later. Who knows what the wife will do when she finds out, and if she decides to leave him and claims first then she may end up with a larger slice of the pie so to speak. Good luck with it. "
"Why my wife and I learned to do is to say, “I need space, I’m going to go have a bath/go to bed/take a walk, can we revisit this afterwards?”

I think what she hates is not knowing when or if the issue will be discussed and resolved. You’re absolutely right to take a breather if you’re feeling overwhelmed, but please understand that her way of resolving conflicts involves finding a resolution quickly and efficiently. When you don’t give her a timeline or just shrink away and avoid it altogether, her brain gets stuck in that high-tension “ready to deal with it right now” mode.

It’s a fair compromise to assure her that you WILL talk about the issue and you WILL help resolve it, but you can’t put her on an undefined wait for that to happen."

"Speaking as someone who has gone through medical issues:

One, stop feeling guilty and apologizing all the time for being sick. You've got IBS. It sucks. Try to accept that you are not inherently a bad person because you got unlucky in the health lottery.

Two, stop pretending that you're a normal healthy person. You *do* need to plan your life around your illness. Everyone plans their lives around their biological needs: you bring lunch if you're hiking all day, you go to bed 8 hours before you need to get up for work, you bring a bottle to pee in if you are crazy and want to watch the ball drop on New Year's in NYC. Just that you have some extras that other people don't need to worry about. So figure out what your limits are and what accommodations you need to make to be prepared in case you get sick.

Communicate this with your friends. Understand that there will be plans that you can't come along with because they involve being away from a bathroom for too long, there will be plans that you have to call out sick for, and there will be plans that you have to make a bit awkward because you need to suddenly leave. You can be angry about this, because life is unfair, but don't apologize or feel ashamed for it."
"If you can accept that she's willing to guilt trip you into a relationship, sure. But it's probably for the best if the friendship stops here before she gets more manipulative."

He clearly wants reassurance he won’t be a teen dad lol, and I think giving him an “out” (if you’re ok with that, obviously) is much more reassuring than just saying “I won’t get pregnant” when there’s still a chance you could, albeit a very low one.

"This is some of the worst advice I've ever read on this sub.  So just because you had food and shelter, you should be grateful ?  No.  OP, your mother is abusive, selfish and narcissistic in the way that she treated you.  Calling you ""selfish"" and putting the ""sacrifice the whole family"" guilt trip on you for your normal teenaged wants is colossally fucked up.  This is not ok.  Making you responsible for her happiness and making you feel responsible for the entire family dynamic is abusive.  Straight up.  

OP, I recommend you look into moving yourself and all your assets out of your country.  What can your country do if you're not local ?  As for your anger, it's completely understandable, and I really think some therapy might help you.  Also check out /r/raisedbynarcissists, I think you'll find a lot of parallels there.

EDIT: Yes, you do come across as entitled here with some of your claims, but I'm specifically referring to your mother guilt-tripping you about having to forgo your entire family's vacation so you can go to martial arts class.  That should not be your job or responsibility, and a child should not be made to feel guilty for wanting to do normal kid stuff.  The way she twisted it around on you was messed up."
"I disagree with ALMOST everything MisterSnah says. 

Having your parents descend upon you like locusts is more often a third world problem. It's certainly not limited to the first world.

Moving is an over reaction. 

I am in the USA so I don't know what your options are. Here, we'd recommend you go talk to a financial planner for a couple of hours and see how to protect your and your wife's assets. Divorce might be the best way to do that- God knows the USA is full of people divorcing so that medical bills don't destroy the entire family's ability to survive past age 60.

I don't blame you for being angry. One of my parents is similar and thankfully a rich relative stepped in to help until they died (prematurely). Otherwise I would have left them on the street, no joke. 

The one part of MisterSnah's comment I agree with is that therapy might help. However fucked up it sounds, I would have been able to leave them on the street without seething in rage- I'm only irritated with their narcissism and I could have perfectly civil conversations and even enjoy them while not giving them my money or my living room to move in to. I was really glad that when they died I didn't hate them. 

But... no rush on that part. Protect yourself and your wife as best you can and if that means divorce, then divorce and live together. "

"The message you need to send is ""Hey dad, is that offer still on the table? I meant to ask *before* buying the place, but things were obviously a bit chaotic.""

Don't talk about why he didn't *offer* it. Don't talk about your siblings at all. This is just about you wanting to take him up on the deal he offered years ago. It's not about equality, it's not about him shortchanging you, it's just about you following up on the deal.

Maybe your dad offered them without them having to ask, or maybe they mentioned it recently and reminded him or even explicitly asked for it. The fact that he didn't offer it up when you started shopping is not indicative of intentional withholding at all. That's super toxic self-story-telling you're doing there. Don't assume someone's motivations, or assume your ""hints"" should have been enough for them to know what you want. Just talk. Always. 

The solution is always to talk, explicitly, honestly, clearly, and with no hints or games. It's not about equality, it's not about deceit, it's about understanding and communicating. 

""Hey, remember that deal. That still on the table? If so, I'd like to redeem the offer!"" Done, conversation started. Whether your brothers got theirs is irrelevant. "

"Ouch! First off, sounds like you are having a tough time. That happens. I’m not going to “hug box” with you so let me apologize now I’m case I come across a bit crass. But otherwise my heart does go out to you. Disability or not, we have all been there. 

Your disability wouldn’t be an absolute ‘deal breaker’ for me but it would surely be a road block. I would have two big issues with it off the top of my head. One, can she do everything that I want to do? Two, do I have to worry about children and genetics? Now your problem with dating is both obvious and common (there are plenty of “normal” ladies that have the same exact issues you are having).

My advice: first find some groups to get involved with that have nothing to do with dating. Your probably going to want to find someone where the relationship begins with an emotional connection and not a physical one. You aren’t going to find that on tinder. Secondly, I would hit up the cerebral palsy community and go to some fundraising events. They tend to be a lot of fun and I’m guessing you get in for free which is nice. Point here is that you will meet more people with exposure to cerebral palsy. A lot of men are likely to lack knowledge and that is going to make your disability more of an issue (than it really is). 

I would say some stupid shit like keep your head up but you honestly seem like you already have the right attitude. Everyone in this world has issues but the only way to solve problems is to address them head on. I wish you the best. I’ve got nothing but love for strong women like yourself.

"It's none of his business. You aren't asking him to eat the exact same foods that you are, correct? You are healthy and you exercise (which he apparently doesn't). You're a grown woman, and you are damn well allowed to eat what you like. It is incredibly inappropriate for him to try to force you to follow his preferences or throw tantrums when you don't. You should not be coerced into going along with your SO's rigid food rules.         

Different eating habits work for different people. For instance, both my spouse and I are in the process of losing weight. Our approaches are quite different. He much prefers eating lots of healthy foods but never missing a meal or snack, whereas I would prefer to save up my daily calories to eat things that actually taste good to me, so I take the intermittent fasting approach. Neither of us is forcing the other to follow their way, and we're both succeeding. Your SO sounds like he thinks his view of food is the One True Way, and any deviation is heresy.        "
"Wtf happened to basic notions of domestic economy, people? I can think of at least 10 easy alternatives to just tossing some cilantro or chicken in the trash.

"Agreed. Also from Seattle, if i was single I'd love a nerdy black guy! "
"Makes you wonder doesn’t it? Honestly, if I was meeting my girlfriends parents for the first time, I’d probably try to power through it too just because it’s an opportunity to meet them. That said, in his position I’d probably have told her to stay home and reschedule dinner the next night or do brunch the next day or something. I’d never want my girlfriend to be feeling potentially sick meeting my parents, particularly when it’s the first time meeting them. 

The whole thing is a red flag to me and I have a hard time feeling his parents/family would be legitimately upset. She was sick, she clearly didn’t want to throw up at dinner and, after being together for a year, clearly would have wanted to make the best of first impressions. 

Also, upset she “ruined” his favourite shirt? I might be naive or something but I’ve never ruined a shirt by puking. Hell, dry cleaning returned a suit I had an alcohol induced incident in years back along with the shirt and tie. 

Honestly, I think you’re right in that he would have likely guilted her for staying behind or cancelling."

"Dude, being drunk is not an excuse to be physically violent. She has more than enough reason to break up and at this point, you need to leave this woman alone and give her the space and time she needs to figure out what her next move is. Stop drinking if you can't control your actions when you're drunk enough to not be abusive. And get solo counseling for yourself. 

If she decides to stay, then you need to prove to her that you're going to change by not drinking and getting counseling to learn how to control your temper. If you aren't willing to do that, then let her go. "
"He needs to get a job. Fuck looking for something that works with your hours. He needs to get a job that is full time, period. That way, you can quit your current job and find something that's part time like you two had agreed. It is okay to demand more support in this situation.

I want to let you know that many couples find the first year after a baby is born to be one of the toughest years of their marriage. It is stressful, people aren't getting as much sleep as they used to, you suddenly have this big responsibility...it's a lot. Something that can help is finding ways to go on little dates (even if it's only for dinner), or starting to go on little ""family dates"" where you take the baby and do something together as a family. Maybe on one of your days off each week you guys can get out of the house and have some quality time.

As for how to get the support you need, I am not sure what you can do besides sitting him down at a time when things are not heated and having an earnest discussion about what you need from him. Try to go into it having already thought about what you want to say and what points you want to make. Let him know that this is a big deal, and you want to work on the relationship part of things too, but you really need support in terms of income right now. If this doesn't get anywhere, I really don't know what to tell you. He might not like working, but he might have to if he winds up needing to pay child support."
"He needs to know she is a giant blabbermouth. It's likely he's already heard her share things she shouldn't have, but thought she was sharing because they are just so close. He doesn't know she just blabs generally.

Actually - you might want to share with him that she was a bit oversharing in this one instance. Maybe she does this when nervous, maybe she had too much to drink. Who knows? But if this is a general habit of hers, the sooner he knows about it, the better."
"Don't rule out friendships - get better at selecting who you're friends with.  Guys who want you to kneel at their feet - aren't your friends and NEVER were.

I've lost multiple friend groups at various times.  I'm 37 now.  I have a ton of friends who I know from things like board gaming, knitting, various nerdy hobbies, etc.  We support each other.

I'd suggest focusing on making some good LADY friends right now.  You don't need another male ""friend"" who only actually wanted a romantic partner."

"&gt;My mother is making my life miserable and I was hoping for some help how to deal with this.

Go no contact, seek therapy. When the government contacts you about your familial obligations, deal with it then. 

No one in this sub can help you with your legal problems, which is the only real way to fix this. Also, you're not actually going to be able to like...""fix"" your parents. You can't convince them to do anything, change, etc. You can only control you. 

Your best bet at this point is contacting a lawyer in your country and finding out if you have any recourse in regards to lessening your obligations. If you have none currently, find out what options you may have in the future. For example, maybe divorcing your wife is a reasonable option. Or maybe moving to another country. The changes that anyone on this sub is familiar enough with Swiss Familial Obligation Laws to provide any decent advice is slim to none though. 

This isn't a relationships problem, its a legal problem. "
"Lol there was literally a post I think a year ago I read in the perspective of an ex-boyfriend who was jealous that his ex had a fiance who was poorer than him. (And they stopped dating in the first place because he accused her of being a gold-digger).

Husband dropped a huge bomb on me that he wants to go on a 2 week trip. I won't go, we have way too many pets to care for, and he knows that. He wants to ride his motorcycle to see his sister, which i figured he might want to do, as she hasn't been well. But on the way there, he also wants to go to a huge motorcycle rally. We went together in the past, and we drank and fought probably 80% of the time, because he can't keep his mouth shut and flirts with girls. I have quit going to those events. I have social anxiety anyway, I need quiet time. So needless to say, not my idea of a romantic time. I drank a few glasses of wine last night and I'm feeling it more than usual today, probably just tired and stressed."

"Ok so real quick....helping them t and avoiding parental awareness is going to involve more than taking them to a clinic. 

Abortions aren't easy. Even if you're early enough along to get a pill induced abortion, she can expect pain, bleeding, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Her body will be doing some pretty major purging. And it will likely last a few days. I absolutely don't want to dissuade anyone from getting an abortion. Child birth is worse on the pain scale and being a parent is a whole other animal. However, everyone involved needs to be prepared for what to expect. 

Maybe you three can sit down together and learn about what's going to happen and how to prepare. She is likely going to need a reason to be away from home for a weekend. She cannot try to do this under the radar while staying at her parents house. Is she going to a friend's house? Are they both going to stay with you? Are they going to get a hotel? They need to figure out the logistics beyond catching a ride from you. And if you are agreeing to a ride in secret then you want to be sure their bases are covered because if it comes out you helped them it will be a shit storm. 

Anyway, you don't know her family situation or what consequences will happen if you tell her parents. They want the abortion, they're legally old enough to decide, help them out and respect their privacy. Just my two cents on your actual question. "

"Read all the comments in here and this is by far the best. I think people sometimes forget how much of our expectations/biases we inherit from our upbringing and how sometimes those things are counter-productive/self-destructive to what we want for our lives. She told you at the beginning that restrictive acts due to jealousy were a deal breaker and you stayed in the relationship, probably because it’s really healthy and happy. Now you just have to do the emotional labor to keep it that way. It okay to feel that way, it’s okay to talk to her about it, but it not okay to make someone else responsible for our feelings. My SO and I have worked on jealousy a lot over the years, more so in the last 2/3 years, now we are to a point where if he wanted to go on a trip with a female friend or visa versa we’d be happy for each other.

Everything, from his extreme jealousy to his not wanting you to confide in friends, to isolating you by having you move far away with him, these are all classic maneuvers.  

Hey, listen.  Washington has a lot of great resources.  IDK where in Washington you are but I ran from an abusive relationship and was tremendously helped by the ladies in the women's shelters.  They're DV shelters, so their locations are confidential, and Washington has a lot of them.  I know it sounds scary, but they are basically houses with a lot of bedrooms and big shared kitchens.  They're filled with women in similar situations to you.  They have caseworkers that are amazing.  They will help support you so that you don't feel embarrassed or helpless.  They will help you find a job and an apartment.  And the other women in them are awesome, too.  You will make friends, you will support each other.  You'll be housed and fed and given resources.  It is nothing to be ashamed of.

They saved and changed my life.  They gave me the skills to spot red flags from the beginning.  They helped build my self esteem and they helped me get a job and a place.

Call 211, they'll give you some of the numbers in your area.  It may take a few weeks to find an opening.  It's a scary step to take at first, but once you get there you realize it is like a home and that everyone wants to help you and each other.  You won't regret it."
"For sure your plan to no longer hang out one-on-one with him is a good one. Keep firm ""we're just roommates"" boundaries. Don't text unless it's related to roommate business. Get a robe for trips to and from the bathroom. Don't accept favors from him. Don't go into his room ever. Don't hang with him in group setting when substances are being used (I assume smoking was pot, not just cigs?). Get a lock for your bedroom."
"I can see her point, though. He has problems with any male friends regardless of history, but female friends she has hooked up before are ok? That's not a boundary, that's an irrational double standard."
"Instead of buying flowers for yourself, you should buy yourself a visit to a therapist, because your self-esteem is way too low.

How are you feeling 'ungrateful' because your fiance *didn't have a gift for you ready* and then largely ruined your gift to him (by just having dinner in front of the tv). This has to be a joke."
"First, your safety is paramount. Please put that first.

I went through this with a friend.

Traumatic brain injury is real. Does he have any kind of diagnosis of TBI and/or does he remain under a doctor’s care?

He may also have some PTSD from the crash, the hospitalization, etc. It’s a massive, massive life disruption.

With either of these issues, the treatment is a process, and you’ll have to decide whether you want to support him through that. It’s possible that his personality has permanently changed.

It sucks, and it’s no one’s fault. You’re not a bad person if you decide to end the relationship."
"Lofuckingl, that’s a book I use to demonstrate sexism, you shouldn’t feel insulted, you should work on yourself.

EDIT: btw the other commenter is correct, you’re in no position to be offering me, a feminist in a successful and happy four year relationship with none of this messy non-sense you’ve got going on, advice about my relationship dynamics. Yours, which you’re modeling after this sexist book, are not working out. Mine, which create mutual respect and stability, are."
Or is it you. Who does not. Use enough. Periods. 
"Personally I have no issue with people bringing their SOs over. I share a room and I am perfectly fine with my roommates friends and her bf sleeping over whenever, as long as I get some warning. 

In regards to my apartment mates, I don't care if they have people over as long as they aren't obtrusive or loud. I don't even need warning if someone wants to sleep on the couch because I stick mostly to my room and the kitchen area anyway.

I sleep over anywhere from 3-5 nights a week at my boyfriend's flat, usually closer to 5. I usually get there during dinner time or after, and leave in the morning for class. I get along well with his flatmates and I help out with some stuff, like paying part of the electricity bill for a month I was over a pretty excessive amount, purchasing some cleaning supplies, cleaning dishes bonus dishes that aren't mine, and spoiling the apartment cat with fancy cat treats and playtime. I already have an apartment where I keep my stuff and pay rent, but I am okay with spending for small expenses to help make me a ""net positive"" to my boyfriend's apartment.

**HOWEVER** I am a bit younger than you (20) and in college, so communal living might be more acceptable to me. Also, it's kind of a given in our friend group that SOs are always welcome to stay over, as long as we all get along and everyone is respectful. If you aren't necessarily opposed to a significant other coming over, it may be okay to ask that they pay a portion of a utility bill, like electricity or water, to make up for their usage. Also, it's kind of an unspoken rule that SOs don't usually hang out at the common area of the apt without their partner. "
"I think it’s pretty creepy and tragic that he’s been storing up “clues” like that for at least five years. Laugh about it with your husband and stop replying.

&gt; I expect an answer

Possibly the weirdest, most creepy way he could have said that. What makes him think you owe him anything?"
unless it gets back to her and she feels she can't trust OP anymore.
"Stop paying the mortgage RIGHT NOW. Don't tell her--the reason I am saying that is 1. it is her problem, it has been her problem all along, if she is ignoring things and relying on you then she deserves the consequences but really 2. you need time to get money saved up so the less you rock the boat the better. Just don't pay anything unless it's on your credit, and get out. You can do this and you deserve better.
Even the fastest moving foreclosure will take many months. It's not your problem. She has already stolen your scholarship and 3 years of your life. Her lazy ass can figure out how to pay for a roof over her head."
"That's how it is though. People are attracted to what they see. If started dating a girl who was 120 pounds you probably wouldn't have started dating her if she was 190 when you met her. It's just how things go. Same with men. If you get fat then your girl is less likely to want to have sex with you because she won't be physically attracted to you anymore. 


It doesn't nobody any good to pretend like looks don't, or shouldn't, matter. They do and they always will. That's 70% of attraction. "

 If you're going to get the marriage annulled or cancelled anyway why open yourself up for me potential lies or pain  ?
I'm showing her this thread. Lmao
"People who are abusive due to mental illness typically do not question whether they are abusive. They don't seek therapy for years to improve themselves. They don't work on their anger. They don't worry whether their partner is being treated right or doing okay.

The fact that you do all of that means that you are not your parents. You are something different. Perhaps you have a temper, but you are working to improve yourself, and that qualifies you to be in a long-term relationship with a loving partner. 

Stay in therapy. Do a mindfulness program. Keep working on yourself. And don't question whether you deserve love. You do."
"Why would he stop when he doesn’t have any incentive to? He clearly doesn’t care about your feelings, and you’ve made it clear you won’t consider breaking up with him. Sounds like you are ok with this behavior to a certain extent. "
"&gt;He always did tell me he didn't want kids but he also did tell me he would never get married because it's ""stupid"" and a ""waste of money"", and here I am with a ring on my finger after him proposing.
 
This sentence actually gives you away.  You think that's proof that you can eventually prevail.   You are in denial about how important this is to you and the likely outcome."
I may do this. Being alone is preferable to fighting something as ridiculous as this.
"I care more about her right to have the freedom to choose whether she stays with a cheating scumbag or not. Because SHE isn’t the one who cheated. 

He had plenty of time to do the right thing himself, now it’s time for someone else to step in and do the right thing, which is tell the fiancé. 

&gt; Is it illegal?

No, but neither is telling her. "
"She didn't just get a wild hair up her ass about the dog's health over nothing, though, she's following a vet's orders. Excessive diarrhea can cause dehydration and then even more health problems.

She's not looking at this as just a lie. She's looking at it as you choosing laziness and your own convenience over the dog's health. "
"Extreme adhd. He's been evaluated for depression and bpd and anxiety at several points in time. We see his psychiatrist every 3 months at this point and his psychologist every two weeks and his counselor weekly.

I have worked with every school he's been in to get him on a behavior plan and they make accommodations, he just doesn't want to work with anything he finds he doesn't like or is boring or he needs help with. "
"Honestly, even at a stoplight, it isn’t fine. If it were fine, car manufacturers would have built computer screens into the steering wheel. It really isn’t fine. I can’t tell you how many times the light has turned green and people are still just staring at their social media likes and validation points while people are waiting to go. It’s selfish. "
We've been in family counseling weekly for years... They don't even know what to do anymore at this point 
What kind of diagnosis does your brother have? The reality is you may not be the best Home for him. And that is ok. What are the other options for him? He is certainly old enough to understand consequences and old enough to realize he’s screwing himself.
"Thank-you for this! That cave line killed me. 
"
"Do not under any circumstances wait this out for a few years to see if he changes his mind. This is the biggest dealbreaker possible. You need to have a conversation about this, and if you two can't get on the same page, then you can't be together. It sucks, but that's the deal."
"After a stressful debate on whether we wanted a wedding or not, we decided that we should just do what we wanted to do and my fiancé and I are eloping! Picking up the Marriage License this afternoon &lt;3"
Agreed. She is brushing this off as if they are just deciding whether to get a Ford or Chevy. This is a huge deal.
"OCD is not a “personality quirk”. If you have been diagnosed with OCD then you should be working with your therapist to learn how to stop yourself from engaging in those behaviours and this will help in your relationship with you girlfriend, although how her hair loss is part of your apparent “OCD” is confusing to me. "
"I mean, OP said straight up that they have anxiety. She isn't claiming to be healthy. Asking your SO who seemingly knows about and is okay with this mental health issue to text you intermittently during a night with a bunch of strangers doesn't seem that wild to me for someone with anxiety."
"I wouldn't bet on it being obvious that he was jealous unless you said something?  But yes, it would be awkward...for HIM.  

Honestly, if my SO went out as often as you do, it'd be a huge red flag.  My group only goes out once every 2-3 weeks and rarely consecutive weeks.  Why? Because most of us have serious relationships with other people and they come first. Always have and always will."

Annulment looks like the best option here.
He is trying to control both of you. 
"Block the shit out of him.

He isn't your problem anymore. Here's what happened:


You say that he needs to stop with the weird romantic bullshit.
He makes excuses and says it's not ~really~ romantic, so he's not actually wrong.


You enforce a strong boundary.
In order to avoid admitting he did anything wrong, he says that he was only being polite (ahaha! as if women want the weird pressure of a man they have no romantic interest in treating them like a love interest for years of their life!)

Please note at this point that he has both 1. said it *isn't* romantic and 2. admitted it *is* romantic, but he was *only being nice*. He knows damn well what it is, and tried to convince you that it was in your head.


He says 'goodbye'. Here is where **he expects you to be shocked and drop to your knees begging and apologize.**
You just say 'bye!' because you're relieved to stop dealing with this shit, and also pretty rightfully offended.


So then he starts to freak out.


He tries to portray himself as such a nice, supportive guy. Because he loves you so much. And he'll wait until you're comfortable and come running back. Your friendship is so important to him! All you need to do is tell him he didn't royally fuck up!
And now you're not replying, making it clear he did, in fact, royally fuck up.


So now he's panicking *more*. He's begging and begging, and even lying to you by inventing a person out of whole cloth.


You need to block him. Don't try to explain what he did wrong, because he already realizes he fucked up. BLOCK HIM. On EVERYTHING. Every single platform you think he knows, from your e-mail to your battle.net account to that old Gaia account if you ever log into it. Warn friends and family that he may try to contact them and spin some kind of story about how he's super worried about you or you're being a jerk and he really just desperately needs to talk to you once more.

You have given him more than enough second chances from the sound of it. I have talked to men like this - compulsive liars who pretend to be sensitive men but actually are incredibly self-centered, vampiring off the kindness and goodwill of their female friends. It isn't going to change. I'm honestly surprised you've weathered this much shit. I would have dumped him back at the elaborate lying part.

If he is suicidal, that is, unfortunately, not your problem at this junction. He knows other people, he will find others who will support him. You are not responsible for the health of someone who has such a fundamental lack of respect for you."
"You seem to have a one-way street kind of mindset. You're unwilling to see that OP is also a young person who's life has essentially been put on pause for his younger brother since he was 16. None of this has been fair to him and he's already turned down his dream job once, now he has another chance and he should most definitely take it. Yes it's his brother but he's not ""abandoning"" him by moving countries while still making sure his brother gets the care he needs. He also said that his brother can come back to live with them at 16 if he grows up. It may actually be a good thing for his brother who may see that he can't just be dependent on his brother for his entire life."
"yeah, Jay-Z may look like a 57-yr-old aunt, but he's really only 48 years old."
"I could be out of line, but these ""goals"" seem to be crossing the line between silly and unhealthy. Some are awesome, like the short stories and only drinking water, but some seem to be telling of some kind of other issue. Not knowing him, he sounds like a pretty manic person. Something. It is the overly outlandish nature of some of these tasks that I would worry about. "
"This is madness. So many reasons to not be together. Huge, huge, huge issues that you barely even discuss - but then again these Issues  HAVE no resolution"
"Once I only drank energy drinks for about a year. You need way more sugar for diabetes, like drinking juice or coke for years. "
"It's not just earning potential, though. It's quality of life potential. It's the ability to take vacations and have a nice home and buy stuff that you need an want with your hard-earned money. It's the ability to insulate yourself from life disasters, like if you or one of your kids get sick in the hellish medical minefield that is the current U.S. It's the ability to provide your kids with the resources they need to be successful in life... like a college tuition. OP's kids will be riddled in student loan debt, for sure. And that's fine, and he's doing good work, and being a teacher IS incredibly important. But so is being a priest, and plenty of people would never marry one because of the poverty.

Money is important, too. "
"no, it's a classic case of cheating. "
"I have no idea what people are talking about in these comments. Yes, not everyone is a good gift-giver, but like you said, it's the EFFORT and THOUGHT that counts. When I didn't have much money in the past, I would make things by hand. Even if she's not crafty, she could have gotten a card. What's more, OP you are absolutely entitled to feeling disappointed and not liking the gifts she got. You should communicate that to her gently. Then give her a chance to respond. Like maybe she thought for a long time about what to get you and this really was the best she could do. Maybe she thought because you had many belts of that color already, you really liked them! At the very least, ask her about the used clipper set, because that is just weird. 

Really, you should be able to communicate this to her without hurting her feelings. 
"
"No one deserves to be cheated on, and that applies to both you and your husband. This marriage has a lot of baggage and you have to consider the very real possibility that it is over. I advise you contact a lawyer just so you know where you stand in case a divorce does eventuate.

This next piece of advice may cause me some backlash but I feel it needs to be said. You're 29 years old, you have four children, but you have nothing that resembles stability in your life. You need to start putting your children first, and think very carefully about what you do in the future. Cheating on someone who is your children's financial provider, and then having more children after cheating on him, is recklessly irresponsible. I feel incredibly sad for your children and I hope that you don't scar your children anymore than you have already."
"Even if she does love OP, she doesn't respect OP for shit. He shouldn't stay in a marriage with someone who doesn't respect him. He deserves better than that. "
"Stop trying to ""fix"" her bad moods. It's not your responsibility to do so. Accept that your gf isn't going to be happy all the time and that it's ok that she's not happy. Trust her to figure her shit out on her own and reach out for your support if she needs it. But stop trying to fix problems that aren't yours. "

"Blueballs is a thing insofar as it exists, but it's pretty quickly cured with your own hands."
"No. You are absolutely wrong. First of all, you posted here looking for real world advice. You are now an adult now and there are lessons you should learn. You will be treated as an adult here too as you would want to be if you see University Housing. Not some *teenage girl* that needs kiddie gloves. 

I didn't tell you whether you should be offended or not and I suggest you read closely. What I've learned through my experiences is about picking your battles. In my opinion for you to go this far is foolish. You are so willing to cancel your housing contract for a security guard who made a comment you found to be insensitive. Your comments are childish and the tantrum you've thrown is childish too. Grow up. "
"And, if Reddit has taught me anything, most likely “nuzzelz 0w0”, as well. "
"He doesn’t want to put his parents out on the street. I see his side but they’re adults, they should be capable of taking care of themselves. "
I just want to tell you (like everyone else has been already) that this is a shit show and you need to divorce this thing you call a wife
"I think looking at this as “who is wrong vs who is right” isn’t the best way to frame things. My guess is your wife didn’t actually want a particular thing, rather what she wanted was to feel special for a day. Y’all are at an age where things are in a swift transition, friendships start to drift, people have new priorities, big decisions have to be made and that can sometimes leave a person feeling forgotten about. It sounds like she took the day off in an effort to feel special and then wound up feeling lonely/sad. She was probably thinking that at least you would remember her. And while your intentions were good to her it looks like you forgot about her birthday and were just trying to cover it up to stall for more time. 
  I don’t know how much this is about you (do you have a history of forgetting/down playing gift giving days?) vs her just having a bad day and taking it out on you. Let her cool down, actually go through with your planned birthday gift (dinner, flowers, etc.) and then have a talk about setting expectations. What does “I don’t want anything” actually mean to her and what the phrase means to you. Try not to sound accusing, the conversation shouldn’t be about what happened but rather to prevent repeating it. Do do something sweet for vday (if you are in a country that recognizes it). Gifts don’t always have to cost much, love notes, letters, random texts &amp; memes throughout the day, cleaning the house, coffee/breakfast when she awakens, etc. 
  The other takeaway is that your preferences are not the same nor better than your wife’s preferences, birthdays or gifts do matter to your wife, next year remember this."
Because most of us don't know most members of the opposite sex and basing the interests of the opposite sex off of stereotypes is sexist and idiotic?? Lol how do you not get it? 
She would be the victim if he murdered her.
"His wife was probably one of those monsters who left doing the dishes until the next day. No wonder he had to prey on a child.

*Sarcasm, obviously.*"
"Sorry, no one goes from “I’m buying your used panties” to “oh yeah, just friends, nothing sexual.” "
She didn't throw a tantrum at all

End it and go no contact. She’s a manipulative liar. “Depression” is the lamest excuse ever.
"First of all, congrats on stepping up and taking control of your mental health situation, and congrats on your new, less stressful life.

As you mentioned, you can't stop Ellie from moving to your town BUT you can take preventive measures so you don't get sucked back in... keeping in mind that she most likely isn't going to respond well and she MAY cut you out again. If that happens, too bad. Your sanity comes first.

How likely do you think it is that she'll actually move? I would stall and be slow on getting back to her with recommendations on apartments and so on. Then, if she does actually move, you'll just have to make it more and more uncomfortable and difficult for her to hang out with you. Try including your BF in your hangouts. Hang out during the day and do not go out drinking with her. Be ""busy"" when she calls. You can't keep her happy AND simultaneously maintain your equilibrium, so don't even feel like you have to try. It's OK to fade out on her."
"I'm sorry you're dealing with this but you've only been with him for a few months and he's already acting like this. There are nice, respectful guys out there who won't bug you for dirty pictures. "
"I just want to add that I think this is the best comment I have seen in this thread.

If someone cheats, chances are pretty good that it wasn't the first or the last time. Evidence tends to come to the surface eventually.

Right now the only ""evidence"" is an account by an untrustworthy witness who has motivation to lie and has managed to make his intentions unknown to OP up to this point."
"This... this would be glorious.

If you're gonna burn a bridge, and it's because the guy she's dating is a child rapist, NAPALM that fucker."
"&gt;The event should be about the bride and groom and their marriage, any other drama should be put on hold.

But this has nothing to do with the bride or groom. Real life doesn't get put on hold just because someone else is getting married. This had actual potentially long term or health risking consequences in terms of waiting to tell OP.

OP goes and confronts cheating boyfriend quietly, if he was actually cheating, he goes and gets a different hotel room (maybe even at a different hotel), and they go to the wedding separately. None of this has to ever come up to the bride or groom or be known to them. There's no actual good reason to have delayed telling OP, and a lot of wrong reasons.

If OP and boyfriend were breaking up for any other reason, do you think they would have to wait until after the wedding? Life just doesn't work that way."

"They're not your boobs. She wants to get her nipples pierced and go braless, so what. I wish my boobs were small and perky enough to go without a bra *and* I was confident enough to get my nipples pierced. You really don't have a dog in this fight OP.
 "
"So, because you've met her coworkers briefly, you think you know how to diffuse the situation better than she does? I really hope this is not how you come across when you're actually talking to your wife, because it's coming across as very paternalistic. 

I've actually found it WAY more common for men to have issues with people they work with. In fact, here I am, a woman who's never had issues with women in the workplace. It's such a sexist assumption to believe that drama is inherent with women. 

And, judging men and women differently based on some preconceived notion of how you believe the two groups operate is, pretty much by definition, sexist. Your wife's behavior does sound frustrating, but I think you need to take a serious look at yourself and your own hubris. You seem to believe you, and you alone, have the correct answer to every problem. "

"I (also Asian) went through something *very* similar. My parents genuinely wanted to help out me and my SO and save us money by buying us a townhouse. We pay them around 1/3 of what rent would typically be in the area. It’s awesome being able to save the majority of our paychecks. 

My parents understand boundaries though and have never dropped by unannounced and tbh rarely visit us. We’re only 15 minutes away from them (but I guess it helps that we try to make time to visit them). We have talked about the future, that eventually we would want to buy a house of our own and they are okay with the possibility of finding new tenants. Also, maybe I’m just lucky, but my dad is an amazing landlord. If we have any issues with appliances or just general maintenance, he handles it almost immediately and he has never given us any “rules”.

So I guess it depends, you know how your parents are. If you think they will hold this over your head and be overbearing, then maybe it won’t be the best idea... but in our situation, it has helped us in so many ways and we are extremely grateful to my parents that this was even an option. We have been able to save so much towards our future goals (and also to splurge on fun things like traveling) and honestly, it is the best-case scenario for us for the time being. "
"First off stop being passive aggressive. The whole expecting him to read your mind based off your tone and pouting is annoying and going to cause massive communication issues if they aren't already. It just sounds like he felt the request was weird and unnecessary but in the split second decided he would do it regardless. Being upset about minor things like tone and stuff are a great way to torpedo a good relationship, especially while long distance.

 Focus on actions rather than feelings. Sure he sighed but he said he would do it immediately and even reminded you about it after the time had passed, apologized afterwards, and kept giving you reasons as to why he said it that way which you are dismissing and considering fake. You cannot just dismiss someone's answer to a question just because you do not like what they said. You need to trust him more.

Ideally, what you should have done is go ""Could you tell me you will be home soon, there is a group of guys outside my apartment and I feel unsafe."" When he said ""Yeahhh, okay, whatever, I guess."" You should have then said ""Thank you, I know it may sound silly to you but this will really help reassure me."" Then walked by, issued the cue, and continued on with your day happily. You just picked a fight over tone. That's like a parent picking a fight with a teenager over having ""attitude"" because they didn't say something the way they liked. It's going to cause resentment in the relationship."
Plan a separate thing with your brother on another night. 
"Me too, but I've had the same thing happen to me over and over and over. Now I'm stone cold with most male colleagues until I've seen that they behave normally with friendly women.

Maybe it's not that they think they are special, maybe they just think you are accessible and they can take a chance. 

I also had the same thing happen on long distance bus or train rides, until finally I had to dress like the Unabomer in dark sunglasses, hat, hoodie, large headphones, and a scowl or I wouldn't be left alone by creepers. "

"Thanks for the reply!! It really helps to have an Asian perspective and appreciate your response. That's exactly why I had to mention we are Asian and seems like some posters may have glossed by it. 

Edit to add: I asked another commentor too but - do you know if your friends and their parents have official lease terms written out? I think it would be helpful but my parents aren't too happy at that idea so far since we're family. I also don't know if it affects how much they can charge me rent but that's for us to look into if this does happen. "

"Oh, the bean counters. You know, it's not avoiding monitoring and score keeping when the other person is monitoring themselves. It's the monitoring part that's bullshit, not who does the monitoring part.

So, is soda the only thing he keeps a mental Excel spreadsheet on, or is there other stuff? Splitting every little goddamn thing 50/50 is actually ridiculous. What if one person likes soda more than the other? What if one person is hungrier on a particular day and wants more pizza than the other? Is the guy above you seriously going to subtract a piece of pizza from his girlfriend's share if one night she eats more than him?

It's entirely possible that marriage counseling will help. I mean, he doesn't want to live with you bc you drank one more cup of soda than he did. That's ridiculous.

If he shoots the idea down, I suggest you tell him that you are going to drink every soda in the house and not leave him any until he goes with you."

"I’ve never had this issue. My husband never “joked” = said mean things to me that he knew I had an insecurity about, or even mean things in general. I tell him I don’t like my nose, he says he loves it. I tell him I don’t like my stomach, he says he loves it. This is too big, this is too small, I don’t like this or that, he says he loves me. 

I can’t imagine choosing to stay in a relationship with a jerk. 

My husband has scars on his chest from a surgery when he was a kid. He told me that he has always been shy about taking his shirt off around people because of it. I can’t imagine ever looking at him and telling him “look, now I have ugly scars like yours”. 
Or ever repeatedly doing that when I know it hurts him.

His scars aren’t ugly. They’re a part of him, and I love him. 

It’s sad that you’ve been with him for four years and this is how he treats you."
I know that you aren't considering divorce over this but I caution you that your wife may not cut the other man out of her life unless she knows that divorce is the result. 
"I think he was pretty much completely wrong for demanding he be invited to work related happy hours, and should have had the sense to meet them in a social outing.

After work happy hours with your coworkers always revolve around the job.  That's obvious.  I've gone to plenty with my SO's coworkers and I know enough to bring something to keep myself occupied, and that they won't be paying much attention to me, aside from a random conversation here or there.  She warned him.  He was too bullheaded and wrapped up in some fantasy idea of what's going on to listen.  

The joke at his expense was a low blow, but she dealt with it appropriately.  I'm sure she has to deal with a lot of idiotic chauvenistic attitudes and remarks at her male dominated workplace (and does so in such a way that they back down and respect her).  She doesn't need to get it from her SO who apparently thinks so little of her that she can't possibly be strong enough to resist the lure of other males just because they exist.

this response is fucking stupid.

I completely  agree with this reply. When you picture your wife do you imagine a bad person? Someone who lies and hurts others to benefit herself in inconsequential ways? Do you see yourself as someone who associates with bad people? 
It’s not uncommon. What is uncommon is you running your mouth to friends about what he does. How would you feel if he started asking around about whether your masturbation technique is normal? Violated. That’s how. 
"That is just misleading. It worked out for you and that is great, but that is not the case for everyone. Women's fertility actually takes a nosedive at 30, a fact I learned in medical school, not randomly on the internet. Some women are more lucky thank others and are able to conceive and carry pregnancies later in their 30s, but the risk to the mother and child increases every year. In fact, pregnancies after 35 are called ""geriatric pregnancies"" which is admittedly offensive but serves a purpose. 

For example, the risk of having a child with down syndrome at 25 is 1 in 1,100 births. The risk of having a child with down syndrome at 35 is 1 in 350 births. At 40 it's 1 in 100 births. Some people are okay with that, others are not. But the reality is things change for women between 30 and 40 and saying that there is ""plenty of time"" is simply misleading. "
What was wrong with the other five? 
"It’s great you came to that realization. This is going to help you moving forward in setting appropriate boundaries with your mother so that you can live your best life. 

It’s hard to fathom that some parents simply don’t have their children’s best interests at heart. It could be mental illness or she could just be an awful person. But please know that’s a reflection on her and not on you. "

"The only thing that sounds like a psychopath is the getting someone fired. You mentioned the guy was horrible, the one who got fired, so maybe she justified it to herself that way. A psychopath wouldn't need to justify it to themselves, they would have no problem getting the sweetest single mother of 4 fired if it suited their own interests. Do you think your GF would do that? Do you think she would do something like that to you? If not, I doubt she's a psychopath.

The rest of the stuff just sounds like gaming the system and yeah being a bit dishonest and sneaky to get ahead but not actually ruining people's lives or taking pleasure from controlling or hurting others."
"&gt;she is not the type of person I want to spend my life with

Just stop making assumptions about her or her intentions."
"She's never been a decent person at all. She has always been pretty horrible to everyone and struggled from obvious mental health issues my entire childhood. She started treating me a little better the past few years, but just started acting like this again the middle of last year.

She would tell me she needed the money for gas or food, even though she makes enough money to live comfortably herself. I guess that is pretty weird."
"&gt; I used our conflict code word and he told me to go fuck myself.

&gt;He told me outright (as he has in the past) that he doesn't care about my feelings.

Girl....I am so, so confused. SO confused. You must really think very little of yourself to stay.

&gt; I know it's easy to just tell me I should leave him but I'm really not ready to give up on this.

It takes two to make a relationship, and he gave up a long time ago. So it doesn't really matter what you want this relationship to be; he'll never put in the effort. 

Mourn the imaginary relationship that you wish this was, and cut it loose like the cancer it is."
"Not only is he an asshole (regardless of developmental diagnosis), but he's also 7 years older and dating a 22-year-old.  It makes me wonder if it's just because only someone much younger and less experienced will tolerate that sort of behaviors from someone who is almost 30."

"I think God really dropped the ball by not giving men then ability to breastfeed. 

If you go the breastfeeding route then by nature mom is going to end up spending more time with the baby. Which makes mom more experienced with the baby and the baby more experienced with mom. Which kind of leaves the dad out a little. Then it becomes a pattern or habit where mom knows more so does more and baby seems to prefer mom and it's just easier for mom to keep doing things or take over. Then it's a lot of work to get dad fully integrated, but worth it, but still seems like more work then keeping the status quo.  "
"I really don't think there's anything necessarily abnormal about not wanting to leave a six week old with a sitter- I'm by no means an overprotective or clingy mom, and I wouldn't. My daughter was about 3 months old the first time I left her with my parents for a few hours. But I *also* didn't drag her to places that were completely inappropriate to bring a baby to. IMO, that's the larger issue here. I spent plenty of time with my family in those 3 months at their houses, or mine, or out for lunch or coffee at places that were relatively quiet and peaceful. You can keep a new baby close *and* not miss out on going out and doing things- it just looks much different. Someone needs to sit OP's sister down and explain that matter-of-factly."
"He works 6 days a week, trying to establish his career, and wants to spend his precious free time doing stuff he enjoys which doesn't seem to include spending time with you.

Break up. "
"I think you should sleep in different beds until this gets sorted out- I understanding being close but you don’t want to get hurt and he’s going to keep feeling worse and worse because he’s hurting you when he doesn’t know how to stop.

This doesn’t have to be permanent- maybe yo could even sleep in the same room and cuddle before you go to your respective beds?"
"&gt; but I don't really know them very well,

You've been with her for three years and you don't know her friends well enough to suggest anything. Do you think this is because you've spent three years actively avoiding them? Don't you think this could make your girlfriend also feel like you don't really want to be involved in her life? 


It honestly sounds like maybe you two just aren't as compatible as it originally seemed. "
"Pretty much every point your boyfriend made in your post is ignorant and incorrect.

The real issue here is control.  Honestly I'm surprised he even lets you plan meals. The way that anything that you do is incorrect strikes me as narcissism. Does /r/raisedbynarcissists match your boyfriend's behavior ? By the way, this would be a personality disorder. I notice a trend that whenever you do something unexpected, or something unplanned comes up, chaos follows; it's almost as if that's the bigger issue to him and your being involved in the issue just makes you an easy target.

&gt; He just thinks if you skip a meal, even if you're fine with calories and not suffering, it's intrinsically wrong.

This seems to point to an issue that he has with food.

&gt; How can I get him to be less rigid?

You need to capitalize on your sanity and take some steps to be able to deal with his behavior more constructively. Read up on dealing with problem people, narcissists, and people with anger managment to find tips to minimize the amount of energy you spend uselessly towards nothing, and get towards a real resolution on the issue at hand.

Secondly, my advice would be to toss the meal calendar, stop buying groceries for him, and for you each to just do your own thing regarding food. I think the he has become so far removed from how much food costs and takes time to calendar and prepare than the is adopting some needless obsessive traits. I think that with him paying for and preparing his own food he will be too busy with what he is doing to bug you about silly things. It also makes it harder for him to spot your ""food transgressions"" as you're eating separately. Lastly, this should save you a lot of sanity over, frankly, needless absurdity, as now he is taking care of his own business instead of being nit-picky about all the hard work that you do _**for**_ him and that he obviously doesn't appreciate like he should.

She’s being a shitty mother by exposing her baby to illnesses that could KILL him because SHE feels alone. They’ve offered to visit and spend time! That IS an event planned around her. 

But the damn world doesn’t revolve around her. She can pass on six months of shit without falling apart while taking care of the NEW LIVING CREATURE SHE CHOSE TO HAVE. I’m sorry but guess what??

It’s not at all a violent reaction to want to protect your kid. Especially at two, where they’re tiny and so vulnerable. Even a small dog could do serious damage to a toddler. And in that quick moment of “holy fuck, my child is in danger!” a kick isn’t a shocking move.

I doubt he meant to kill the dog or even meant to kick it in the neck, he probably just kicked at it and it’s all very unfortunate the dog died as a result. I’d feel horrible about the dog but I wouldn’t regret protecting my child from a dangerous situation."
"I don't know how to salvage this either because this would get you dumped by a lot of women. I'm guessing what's holding this together is you've been together 3 years so she doesn't want to drop you quite yet but if she was posting on reddit she'd be getting hundreds of comments telling her to dump you.

I think all you can do is have a serious conversation where you apologize again and say it was a stupid joke that you didn't think through and absolutely not reflective of what you really believe, that you're happy with your sex life and should never have compared her to her friend - who you have no interest in. Ask her to forgive you and then ask if she can see her way to still going on the trip, with no pressure for sex whilst on it (Even though it was a romantic getaway, you might have a while to go to get the trust back as she's going to be remembering this comment next time you're intimate). 

And then never, ever, ever, ever, ever compare your gf to anyone else in bed, and for the love of god never insult her or your sex life in public or in front of anyone else at all."
"eh I think he should tell Mom because it's not healthy for her to have this unfounded hatred towards him because he was adopted, especially if it was early on and he was always part of this family.

I am willing to bet this hatred has something to do with her relationship with her mother. "
Don't worry about what is normal. Worry about getting on the same page as your partner. Do you share the same goals? Do you have a plan to achieve those goals? The fact that bringing up the topic makes him angry is a horrible sign.
"I want to know where tf you live exactly that these conditions are all simultaneously:

- Making $130K

- Trailer lot rent is only $100

- But your apartment costs $2000/month???

- Your girlfriend's parents only make $80K but their house somehow costs $800K???

That salary and apartment bit screams LA or maybe Chicago but this combined with land being cheap enough nearby to have lot rent for $100 isn't adding up at all."
"I feel that you are allowing fear of absolute loss to drive your decision making. 

You are a data scientist, so look at this is terms of risk analysis - in a quadrant of high impact, high probability/ high impact low probability; low impact, high probability and low impact, low probability - where does you buying a house and then losing your job and your girlfriend, and then ending up homeless sit in this quadrant ?? 

* If your gf leaves, can you get a housemate in ? 

* Can you get unemployment insurance to hedge the risk of buying a house ? 

* Can you buy that $500k house now, sell it in 2 years and then buy the $1million house you're looking at for the future ?

Your current decision model looks irrational to a lot of us, because we haven't been driven to homelessness. But at the same time, you are basing your decisions off the worry that you might, at any time, and for no reason, lose everything, with no recourse to gain it back. And so you are settling for an obviously sub-par solution, because *any* security, no matter how crap, is better than none.

&gt; I have money for maybe 5 months with the mortgage so if I dont find a new job I'm sleeping in a walmart parking lot. This is the way I approach life. 

But this is **not true**. You now have an education and work experience under your belt. You have invested in a skill set which will keep you afloat. What decision would you make if you knew that no matter what happened to you financially, you would *never* end up sleeping in your car again. That you had the skills and experience to get and keep a new job, straight away ?

I suspect your GF will simply refuse to live in a trailer park. She simply cannot work in Real Estate and live in a trailer park - her colleagues will know where she lives and snigger at her. RE is incredibly competetive and this information will be used against her by her rivals in the office. I'd imagine she gets asked where *she* lives fairly often by clients, and of course she'll have to lie. Who wants a RE agent who lives in a trailer selling their $5 million home ? In a business which works on projecting an image of prestige and luxury, you're asking her to have to lie about her home, or go backwards in her job for two years...

What about the option to buy a smart condo to be going on with ? I watch House Hunters :) I'm pretty sure $500k will buy you a really nice condo almost anywhere, and on a 30 year loan at 4% you're not paying much more to buy than you currently are to rent.

Also, if you're planning to move in with and marry this woman, you need to sit down with her and make a plan. She can't simply continue to spend money like water. You and she need to sit down, work out a financial plan that you're both happy with which includes retirement savings, an emergency fund, renovations fund, discretionary spending etc etc, and set up a joint bank account where your agreed upon amounts go into to pay for bills and outgoings. If she rips through her discretionary spending money *that's it* until next pay. 

If you and she *can't* sit down and thrash out a financial plan together, you should not be moving in together, let alone getting married. Likewise, you cannot make a fiat decision about where the two of you will be living together for the next two years. You *have* to take her needs into account. Writing her concerns off as being ""spoilt"" is deeply condescending. 

If you two are to be living together, then both of your desires, concerns and ideas should have equal weight. And more than that, both of you should be contributing equally to the housing. If you get a mortgage on a condo worth, say, $2500 a month, then both of you should be paying $1,250 and splitting the costs of utilities and other outgoings. Frankly, I think that both of you should contribute to the deposit and both of you should have your names on the mortgage, as well. 

And if your GF cannot save enough money over 6 months or so to make a deposit, esecially as she's living at home with her parents, then once again, why would you marry her ? Why couple yourself to someone who cannot pull their weight ? Dave Ramsay has some very helpful advice for couples if you get stuck; but basically, if you can't trust her to come up with a deposit, take responsibility for meeting her expenses and be a joint owner for your home together, why are you moving in with her ? And if you ARE moving in with her, then she gets a say in where she wants to live."
"I can't think of anyone who makes $130k per year and thinks living in a trailer park is a reasonable option.  Get a grip, man."
"Ohhhhh my God. Do you always tie your conversations up in knots like this?  Instead of considering their point, you immediately fire back with your own, as if you play this perpetual game of ""no, YOU are."" Maybe you don't realize this, but the way you appear to argue seems to be perpetually moving the goal posts, so neither party can actually reach a resolution. Also, someone being in a relationship that was abusive does not mean their perspective is invalid. Did you come here for total validation of your feelings/behavior, or to get some actual real world perspectives - which by their very nature will be different than your own, or messy.


Consider taking the other posters words to heart and actually reviewing the nights events with the new perspective. Maybe consider the radical choice of presenting this perspective to your partner and seeing what she thinks."
"Your wife sounds like an immature little brat. Which, at 22, can be par for the course. 

&gt;We have went to counseling in the past,but not for this issue. We went primarily to focus on our communication. 

Well, it sounds like you need to go back. Because this is part and parcel of the communication issue. 

&gt;My question is: does anyone have resources to show this is bad for a relationship ?

The fact that it bothers you and it's making you feel ostracized should be the only source you need. If she doesn't respect that this is something you're uncomfortable with, that's a serious red flag. 
"
"You said no, she continued. Getting a boner is not a “yes”, and not knowing how to react and not leaving the room is not a “yes” either. She manipulated you to turn a no into a sort-of-yes. 

I agree with the others. She is not a friend."
That’s the cycle. They’re super apologetic and they create moments that you later remember when you tell yourself “it’s not always bad.” 
"Getting turned on actually made me feel even worse, tbh. "
"&gt;Bullshit. She absolutely can change the locks. She can change them right now if she wanted and would most likely be okay. The worst that would happen to OP is she would be ordered to let him back in and that would only happen if the ex actually took the time to file a complaint and convinced the police to get involved in a civil matter. 99% of the time, the person won't bother. They'll just find another place to stay. Unless she refused to let him back in at that point, she wouldn't have any legal repurcussions.

&gt;And like I said, that is if she did it right now. If she waits the 30 days, yes, she will still have to file the eviction but she can change the locks at the same time. She doesn't have to wait. He would really have to jump through a lot of hoops to prove he was wrongly evicted. I've worked in property management for the better part of two decades. She'd be fine.


Your advice is fucking horrible. You are telling her to do something totally illegal. Not only that, but why the fuck does this guy deserve to be homeless just because his girlfriend broke up with him? Your only point is that hopefully he will be too poor and **too homeless** to have the resources, time, and money to fight her through the courts. Do you have any idea how unethical that is? 

He’s not abusive. She does not feel unsafe living there. It’s been 6 years, he has tenent rights. 

The fact that you work in property management makes your advice even more appaling. Like how many poor people have you fucked over because they don’t have the money to fight your shady ass, illegal tactics. 

If she wants him out they need to come to a mutual agreement or she needs to go through the proper channels. Period."

"I disagree with you.  Our development and view of the world makes dramatic changes between our teen years and mid 20’s.  Yes, many people many at 19 but doing so doesn’t make it automatically ok for everyone.  If we are going to use personal anecdotes as evidence for making a generalization, I married my wife when she was 22 and a college graduate.

"Yes, that would be entirely appropriate. It may have been his mistake in the first place, but he could have easily been dishonest and decided not to fix it. He is obviously a man of integrity, and has worked hard for your family.  

Also, if you have to have work done in the future, you may want to hire him again. Trustworthy contractors can be difficult to find. A token of appreciation for his hard work and dedication on this job ensures he'll remember you as good clients. "

"I don't really care if people sleep with their cousins, but it would be hard for me to get over if I had to see my partner's former long-term FWB at family gatherings for the rest of my life.  Honestly though if the relationship was good otherwise I'd probably just suck it up and try not to think about it."
"I think it's good that you are being cautious about getting back together with him; I would be concerned that he was so quick to change his thinking too. It sounds like you guys have a lot to discuss, and i'd make it a point to ask him about a timeline of reaching those other goals in your relationship should you get back together (moving in together, getting married, etc) and share your own thoughts on that. 


As an anecdotal note, my sister went through this with her now-husband. He hesitated to take every single milestone step in their relationship. They didn't move in together for 5 years and only after about 2 years of convincing. It took him 10 years to propose (with 5 years of him being unsure), and another 3 years to get pregnant. I'm not trying to convince you that your relationship with your boyfriend will work out, just that some people are extremely hesitant/afraid to make big commitments, but they may eventually come around and genuinely want those things. It's just a matter of deciding if you're willing to wait or not."
"What principle are you standing up for exactly here? It seems like a pretty easy request from a partner to honor. 

Using the word ‘cunt’ isn’t really part of your identity or anything you think makes you special in some way, is it?"
"If his parents are that old school, he's likely not going to be happy with this. His family thinks he's a virgin and you're pregnant out of wedlock?  I'm worried about his reaction to this."
"It's almost as offensive as the n-word. It's a last-nuke-in-your-arsenal swear. It's a deal breaker word. It's the kind of word that you can hear centuries of baseless anger towards women echoing around in there. 

That said, it's still my favorite swear."
"It's odd isn't it that we can have such empathy for others and not for ourselves because my heart just broke thinking of you like that as a little child being treated like you were untouchable. But I still think I must have been a bad or difficult kid for my parents to treat me like that...

I really really hope this is your BF was nervous of GF and meeting family thing and he acted like an idiot and will apologise and calm down. I mean I know some people just get really tense about puke or poop but are fundamentally good people.

But if you guys don't live together can I suggest you tell him about the pregnancy in a public place? Even if it's just grabbing a drink in a diner or coffee shop. Make sure you have other ways of leaving apart from being dependent on him giving you a ride home. I just don't have a good feeling about how he might react.

One thing I'd also say is when you grew up like you and I did, your 'normal meter' gets broken and sometimes we see things as ok that other people would consider the reddest flag in town. Do you have anyone in real life too that you could run your thoughts past to help you see how your instincts play out?

I know your guts just feel queasy at the moment with pregnancy sickness but perhaps role playing telling him about the pregnancy with a trusted friend will give you a neutral way to trust how your gut feels emotionally? If you feel any doubts or fear or sense of having done something wrong or need to justify your feelings, listen to that. 

Don't assume it will sort itself out and get better magically. Relationships take work even when they are good and no one ever changed for the better just because someone else wished they would.

Best of luck. Please do a post update if and when you can!

I've always tried to demonstrate my understanding of this by giving him as much space as possible when he talks to his best friend, and so admitting that I stayed and eavesdropped while he talked about me would hurt my boyfriend. "
"Your husband sounds much more rational and responsible than you are. You're a mother of two, you should not be doing ecstasy and going to raves. You exited that phase of your life as soon as you gave birth to your first child. It sounds like your husband is a good man and trusts you, and I think you know that sitting on another man's lap and hanging out with someone who has explicitly told you they want to pursue a relationship with you isn't okay. It sounds like you are in denial a little bit and making excuses for you behaviour. Do you need to hear it from someone else? It's not ok, what you're doing isn't cool. Get your shit together. "

"I don't think you've done anything wrong either. I think this girl has either caught feelings or has a different perspective over what her role as a FWB is. 

Have you all talked about seeing other people? Was this plan with your ex-coworker an actual date or is it just two people hanging out. I mean if you decided to go on a date while you were hooking up with someone and didn't really establish those boundaries, I think it would be a sticky situation.  "
"I'm sorry. What you say is 100% true. You're playing the dating game on ""hard mode"" ...fortunately people become more mature as they progress into their 20s, so there's hope for you yet.  Keep putting yourself out there... Keep finding new ways to meet people. Keep trying to date because when it rains, it pours.

[Edit] Really, go to any ""young professionals"" events, go to theology on tap events, go to trivia and movie nights.... Get out there and meet people. There are SO MANY educated single women out there that have given up on internet dating because of the horrendous and explicit messages"

"What is it with this sentence:   ""we are too passive"" to ask them to leave ?  Your wife had just given birth and you expected her to stand up to your parents? !   

Your wife doesn't just have an in-law problem she has a husband problem.   Whether they mean to her or not, they are overwhelming her and *you're not listening to your wife*.  You need to start doing your job and helping your wife with the boundaries she wants to set because whatever you haven't been doing has culminated in your wife not wanting them at your son's birthday party and that is not good for anyone in your family.

"Because she won't be coming at counselling in the same open, genuine way as you. You want to genuinely figure out your mutual issues. She wants to control you. What she says in counselling will be disingenuous and towards that end.

Emotional abuse: 

- making you cut off a friend for no legitimate reason

- making you limit contact with friends and family with no legitimate reason

- she controls your time an unreasonable amount even when you're not with her

- she makes you feel guilty for not spending time with her or for having your own life (again, the abuse element here is the unreasonableness - should a partner expect relatively regular contact from an SO? Yes. Should a partner need you to text them constantly and not have any of your own hobbies? No.)

- verbal abuse.

"Concubinage. I’m from a very Catholic country where marriage is sacred. No divorce here, only annulment. She could go into my workplace, complain about me and have me fired. That kind. I’m afraid he’ll just use the kid and the kindness he offers to manipulate me into staying with him. :("
"My advice to you is to take maybe five whole seconds to think about how your actions impact other people, because you sound like a complete narcissist. "

"I apologize if I sound rude, but this is something that has always bothered me since I grew up very religious. May I ask if having sex before marriage is against your boyfriend's religion?

I am *not* shaming you, or him. I just always noticed the hypocritical practices of my friends and family in my religion. They would fixate on a handful of things that *need* to be so because religion! While intentionally ignoring other sins cause convenience! 

I just don't see the how it could hurt the situation to open up a honest, loving discussion why some cultural lifestyle beliefs are more important than others if religion is that important. "

Why, OP? Why are you doing this? This marriage has been a trainwreck for years, and to be quite frank, you started it. Your wife was wrong to cheat on you, but expecting loyalty from someone you yourself have already betrayed is...to put it diplomatically, *rich*. 

I have no idea why she’s still with you, as this marriage is clearly irreparable, but she’s not here and you are. Start calling divorce lawyers and put this relationship out of its misery. Clearly you’re both more than able to find other partners that interest you, so free yourself and your wife up to do that without causing further angst. "

"&gt; Tell your girlfriend about your cheating on her all the time, and that should probably solve your inability to break up with her.

Actually, no. Every time he's cheated, the poor and desperate girl begs him to stay. She obviously has her own issues. 

Just break up with her! You must not want to break up if you keep allowing her to talk you into staying. If someone *really* wants to do something, they do it.

The Office had a joke exactly like this. 

Pam was so disappointed to not get a gift from Roy.

"Two years? Two weeks ago. And all she wanted was an ""I'm sorry I can't take off our first wedding anniversary."" And it's not just Valentines, it's her first wedding anniversary, and he didn't even acknowledge it after giving her flowers every year up until this point. That's fair. "
"The only part that makes you a bad person is continually stringing her along. Stop it. Tell her you are done and move on.

"So you stayed out later than planned without contacting your wife, found a sloppy girl (so skeevy of you), texted your wife and when she didn't respond you took that as a cue to take the girl home anyway???  And then when ALL the planned stuff (candle, etc) were put away, you still woke up your wife and basically said ""hey, so I know you're half asleep, I didn't communicate, and you clearly weren't into this because you put everything away...but I brought a drunk stranger home anyway!!!"" and when she mumbled out a happy valentine's day which I can gauranfuckingtee you was NOT permission to go fuck the stranger in the living room...you did just that anyway.

&gt;  I had no idea how much this would hurt her and as you all can see I thought she was on board for everything.

No you didn't think that...you just WANTED to think that, so you shoved your head up your ass and ignored all the obvious signs that she WAS NOT into this.  Even if you're dumb enough to think she was still into the threesome, YOU DIDN'T HAVE A THREESOME!!!  You slept with another girl.  You cheated on your wife in the NEXT ROOM.

&gt; She said it was all okay so I don't really get how she gets to act like this now.

She said ok, until  you didn't call, didn't come home on time, didn't get her permission, didn't read the signs that she was no longer into it, and fucked a girl with her in the next room.

Dude...you are horrible.  You treated your wife like crap and you have no sense of decency, care or concern and clearly have zero ability to read people.

Prepare for divorce, because that's what you deserve."
"This sounds like a great start!

This was an all-around shitty situation, made worse because both of you are victims here. All I can say is that for your brother to still be SO SCARED (I can't begin to imagine what it was that went on that you didn't know about) and yet he's still trying to come back for you...he must love you so much.

I hope you guys continue to work things out."
"This would be great from my girlfriend.

I think that couples find each others cues so it doesn't have to be a new thing everyday but you also don't want it to be exactly the same all the time either (maybe ruins the fun?)

I would say come up with 4 or 5 cues that are pretty straight forward that you can mix and match. It seems more like you won't have to ""seduce"" him so much as indicate interest. (Assuming gender roles a bit)

Some suggestions:

**Flirty touching** - touching his thigh or arm or butt unneccessarily while yall are doing something else

**Getting comfortably undressed** - having some very skimpy, attractive pajamas that you get into earlier than necessary might show him you are interested in certain bed-time activities happening before bed.

**Just be honest** - in a playful way, e.g. ""I need your help with something"" ""what?"" ""You see, I'm really turned on by you right now an..."" as you are swept off of your feet.

Mostly I think you will realize that it mostly doesn't matter what you do. Just being confident enough to ask for the things you need/want in a relationship is sexy and he will be excited that you have."
Ah... that explains a lot. At first I was like holy crap how could a guy be upset that his gf ‘only’ brings home 70k... but if he’s paying for everything then I can see how his 200k doesn’t go as far as it should be going. I bet if you contributed more to the household you’d feel less pressure from him. 
"I feel like a failure in this regard. I have literally one credit *left that I need to graduate. It's an internship credit. I have interned previously but not for credit. At some point halfway through school, things suddenly got so hard. This is around when I was diagnosed. Before, I was just kind of on autopilot and never allowed myself to think much about things and then just hit a wall at some point where I couldn't. I didn't make more a single friend in the five years I was in school and couldn't go to career fairs without being irrationally terrified and panicking. There isn't enough time to do an unpaid internship and work as much as I need to, so I'm stuck in a bad place. I'm just venting. It's hard to feel like a failure this way. Not to mention, I've got zero interest in what I actually studied :/"
"I feel like all people (mostly women) everywhere need a public service announcement: do not date people who whine like little kids about doing dishes. Able bodied adults do dishes without complaining about them or putting them off. Anyone who won't do the dishes is not ready to be in an adult relationship, period. 

Also, it's clear to me that the reason you lost it and started crying was because it was the straw that broke the camel's back. He was being a jerk to you all evening, he mocked you for having trouble opening a wine bottle, and then I don't know how he managed to slosh the wine everywhere unless he did it on purpose to be passive aggressive. But who knows, maybe it really was an accident. I have to say that being kind to your partner when they spill something by accident is something I think is very important. So you should apologize for that specific aspect of your behavior, but honestly, he says you ruined the day? What was left to be ruined?"

"I'm honestly wondering if you're a white guy (or woman) from your comments, because his concerns aren't unfounded. 


There's always the issue of if a women will have problems introducing him to her family because of race, doubly so depending on what part of the US she's from. A lot of people's parents or grandparents are still pretty racist when it comes to who might be in their own family. Sticking his head in the sand over that, or trying to act like it isn't an issue would be silly. 

I went to a predominately white engineering school and the issues my non-white friends had with dating and social interactions pretty much all stemmed from racism and stereotypes. Acknowledging that it's an obstacle doesn't mean they're categorizing people.

"Actually, it is a form of sexual assault. I was flashed when I was six years old and out for a bike ride with my cousin (who was 16). We had stopped to push our bikes through an underwalk and he was there, saw us and got it out and started masturbating. It was an awful experience and although I didn't fully understand the feelings I felt at the time, I do now. I was terrified and felt assualted. So please don't minimise what he did to OP. It may not have been a ""physical"" assault but it was an assault none the less."
"I feel like we're getting a very one-sided view of her reaction and what's going on. OP wasn't even forthcoming about what he did until pressed on it.

If you can't count on your spouse to provide for your family because they get *fired from their job for lying*, I think it *is* enough to divorce over. In this circumstance it might just be getting fired, but depending on the nature of what he did, it could be fraud. This isn't a case of someone losing their job because of a tough economy, or because they honestly screwed up. They deceived their employer."
"Yeah...there's some sort of tone here that rubbed me the wrong way, as someone who's autistic myself. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but your comment helped me figure out why it bothered me a little."
"First of all thank you for taking the time responding and the write up. I really value any advice and welcome criticism.

In my description of the problem I might have said things that were influenced by other issues we have between us, but in the interest of brevity I decided to not go into much details.

Let me explain. Me saying I am an engineer is influenced by the fact that she comes from a wealthy family who lived overseas and had maids. She never had to pick up a glass of water or wash a dish. Her view of life is to spend as much of your money because ""life is short"". She welcomes gifting anyone in her family (or mine) expensive gifts without even considering long term financial goals (like buying a house, or our daughters college).

For the first 5 years I was the only one worked from 8am till 6pm. She was a stay home mom, or should I say a stay home social media monitor. She had a bachelor degree and wanted to do her masters but couldn't be committed enough to study and prepare for the exams (GRE/GMAT). 

Me saying an engineer is influenced by all these facts that I am the one who usually plan things financially because leaving things to her means a disaster.

And lets go back to the point where I should have her interests as a goal....sure, but please tell me, how would you feel like putting any effort or be motivated getting your client a better service if you are ""always"" reminded by how bad of a performer you are and how great other companies are ...ALL the time.  Not just that, but when you even do a good job not even remembered for it as if it was never done.

Lets go back to the flowers, she went back home (over seas) a couple of years ago and on valentines day I made sure to order online a nice set even though that countries has very little experience in online orders and deliveries...but I searched for days to find a reliable provider and she was thrilled and appreciative of then thought.....but after that and on every Valentines day she says things as if I am the most inconsiderate human who ""NEVER"" think of getting flowers....So unconsciously..in the back of my mind, knowing that whatever I did for her will be gone and forgotten the next day takes so much from the enthusiasm and ambition to do a better job. Don't you think?

She even admitted to me when I told her she never remembers anything I do for her from the past, and she says: yes, but still, you should try to make me happy even for the night....
Really?"
"She's telling another man she loves him, and apparently she's told him some horrible stuff about you.

Ride out the vacation, or cut it short. Get home, get a lawyer, and end it. Think about the kids? They'll be better off without a damaged marriage raising them."
"So you agree with that poster when they say you'd be hard pressed to find a monogamous person that would be OK with it, then in  the next breath claim your gf should trust you enough to be ok with it?

She's not superhuman.  I trust my husband 100% but if he were to suddenly start downloading hookup apps and messaging random women on there we'd have a HUGE issue.  

It's rude, it's disrespectful, and it's suspicious.  Why a hookup app?  You know those chicks are looking for someone to fuck.  You're making lame excuses.  You're looking for validation from other women and you know it."
"Came here to say this,  PTSD is surprisingly more common than people think and all it takes is one trauma to flip your brain into a high alert mode that it can't switch off.

Maybe boyfriend should be educated on PTSD to help him put it in perspective. "
Have you cut contact with this crush? Being honest is good but you need to follow through with action if you are serious about saving your relationship. 
"It sounds like he is no longer eligible. Like someone else said, you can only get financial aid a certain amount of times. He may not meet the requirements like minimum GPA or degree completion time. It's usually 3 years for a 2 year degree and 6 years for a 4 year degree. That varies depending on if he took summer or winter courses. 

OP, why exactly don't you receive financial aid? I've been in this situation before and may have some advice. "
"&gt;I thought that having a budget for gifts in a loving relationship was normal

Sure, I'd say normal enough

&gt;and that having it violated was a reason to be upset.

Hmm, I don't get this and it seems to be the crux of the problem.  Why does it have to be such a heinous violation to go over budget and why does the reaction have to swing from ""thanks I love it"" to ""take it back, how dare you"" purely based on how much money was spent?  We get that you have a budget, and like I said it's understandable, but for it to be so strict with no wiggle room and dire consequences if it's ""violated"" with your only reason being ""because I said so"" just doesn't make sense.

I feel like intent matters, and he didn't do this to piss you off, he did it to do something nice.  Now obviously in overriding your strict budget he ended up doing both, but you're only acting like he did the former even though you know better.  It just feels like you're doubling down and trying as hard as you can to be the victim so you can avoid swallowing your pride here even though that's what would probably be the best thing for you and your partner."
"They're saying that while you're asking for advice, you don't seem to be taking any of it. You just seem to read the advice and dismiss it/defend your actions. "

"Your sister is most likely the way she is BECAUSE of how horrible your mother treats her, not the other way around. Please listen to everyone here telling you that your mother is abusive.  I know it can be hard to hear, because you want to believe your own mother can do no wrong, but she's not the person you want her to be."
"I don't understand why you think he should call her? She's his ex, if he doesn't want to call her, he shouldn't. For what it's worth, I agree with your husband. I don't see a point in dragging out a relationship that's barely even there, with an ex no less."
"&gt; Who the fuck does that.

Abusive shitheads. The guy I refer to as ""my shitty emotionally abusive ex"" pinched my side and told me not to gain anymore weight a few months after we started dating. I was 110 pounds. I wish I had dumped him then, because that was only the beginning. "

"If my friend's husband violated me by peeping, and she didn't immediately divorce him and stand up for me, I would be devastated. If you want to let him treat you like shit, that's your prerogative.

How do you think this will play out in a few years once your daughters are teens and they start bringing their friends over?"
"&gt; Get a pint of goat's milk ice cream and chill out.

That tickled me."
"Clearly you have never met someone who grew up in a disfunctionsal family so you don't know how that can completely fuck you over. I'm not saying that is the case with this guy but if he says his family is weird it would explain a lot. If you really like him give him a chance, there are no major red flags from what you have described.  "
"Please don't do this,  it's just participating further in the soap opera.  Untangle yourself, be cordial and polite when you see them but never engage with this drama again. "
But he DOES want to hurt your fiancee's feelings.
"I agree with the other commentators, he needs to be shutting her comments down. What she is saying is ridiculously mean and disrespectful to you. It sounds like he loves the attention she gives him and doesn't want to lose it so he's putting her feelings ahead of yours. He is being a huge asshole."
It's very very possible her mind changed after childbirth. Very possible.
"He got verbally violent with someone who asked him to turn down the TV at 3am. If he can't sort out his feelings in this instance, how would he handle rejection? I'm not buying the whole ""someone got shot,"" bit. My boyfriend had a coworker die in a very gruesome way and he came home and cried. He didn't cuss me out and act aggressive. Everyone reacts differently, but nobody is allowed to be abusive.

A lot of women have horror stories of rejecting a guy, only to have that person attack them. The bigger the guy, the more damage he could do."
"Yeah, he could pull this back a bit by taking the digital frame back for one that does match the decor and then telling his wife that while he appreciates she likes hanging framed photos, he’d like to take photos of her and the baby together for the digital frame so she can see how he sees his family.

And buy her an orchid or some kind of beautiful flowering plant that lasts and matches the decor to show that he is making the effort to blossom and not just grab gas station flowers on the day.

Then do the life admin the other comments have suggested here because lists are a great solution to an ‘adulting’ gap. 

Gifts are something I find easy but I use lists in Notes and Evernote and the reminders app on my phone to get basic life stuff done because my memory makes goldfish looklike brain training champs. No shame in helping yourself if something is lacking."
"THIS. My love language is gifts as well, but they don't have to be expensive, just thoughtful. My boyfriend bought me duct tape with a galaxy print on it the other day because he knows I love space shit. For valentine's day it was nothing expensive, just a box of my favorite chocolates. We just started dating and I mentioned that I like them in passing a while ago, I was touched he remembered. But the best part of the night was when we got into the car, Billie Holiday was playing and that's my favorite. Small tokens to show you think of her, and you're listening, and she is on your mind.

Also, if your wife has a pinterest STALK THAT SHIT, this goes for every male reading this. It's literally full of shit your wife/gf likes, in list form with LINKS. Could not make your life any easier if we tried."
"I feel a bit like a crow, but if my husband came home and said ""I found this soda tab/rock/twig and it's shaped like a heart and I thought of you,"" I would be pretty pleased. (My husband is pretty great with the gifting of sweet tokens.)"
I'd rather be dead
"I would be really offended if my SO called one of my friends “a total skank.” I also think her telling you you’re a guy and thus she knows how you think is quite antiquated and sexist. I’ve been to many parties like the one you describe and it’s not a big deal for people to get naked. 

Perhaps she was shocked and it brought out her insecurities. You could tell her that you’re sorry she felt uncomfortable, and reassure her that you only have eyes for her. But then you should tell her that what she said offended you and tell her why. You’re owed an apology here and she needs to re-examine her biases. "
"You don't want that, even without money it's a nightmare sometimes, usually because the parents don't have boundaries and she will always side with them."
Cool. He'll totally be there when your new wife applies to have your marriage annulled. Good bro time.
"I mean, I lean in your direction, but there's also a big difference between a forever SAHM, and a mom/parent staying home while breastfeeding or even until the kids are in school. Most people don't remember much before school aged, so it's not like you can't have the best of both worlds and still see your parents as independent humans."
"I went out with brunch with my mom for my first mother’s day because my husband told me he didn’t want to go. Turns out he had bought me a purse I had eye on (but probably would never spend the money on myself) and write me a really lovely note about appreciating me as his wife, and mother of his child. Definitely make this Mother’s Day special! Even just google some heartfelt gifts for first Mothers Days!"
Go for it! Be free and don't look back!
"I actually disagree with the poster above.  It's probable that she's not getting a proper conversation at home or at school, so I think she could use an adult.  Maybe get together some low cost information on resources in your area (planned parenthood or the equivalent, for birth control) and provide her with a website link so she can look into things on her own.  I'm sure there must be some teen-centered sex positive/sex ed site out there.  Please be very kind and don't shame her!  Pregnancy hormones and abortions are no joke, so she definitely isn't going to feel her best.  It seems like they both need to know never to have sex without proper birth control, and never to have sex without a condom (unless they have their partner's recent STD tests in hand, which probably won't be a thing while they're so young)."
"Don't lecture either of them in the car on the way there or home. This abortion may be extremely traumatizing to one or both of them. Have a discussion privately, with your brother later.

"What?! Just whipped out his phone to video (you say pics, but guaranteed, it was video too, if he had more than 2 seconds) you sucking his dick?

If you stay with him, just be prepared for things like this to happen regularly."
"Staying with her isn't helping her. It's just letting her continue her same pattern of behavior uninterrupted. It's possible that she could behave differently with help, but that would have to come from her, not you. She'd be the one doing the hard, ongoing work of examining her actions, accepting how much she's hurt you, and learning new ways of coping with her anger and insecurity. 

Do you think you could say to her, ""I hate the way you treat me, you hurt me all the time, and I need you to accept that you've been abusing me and get anger management counseling to learn how to express when you're angry without hitting or belittling me""? What do you think she would say to that? Because I'm going to guess that she's not ready to hear it, and she'd lash out again. Or she'd make it all about her and you'd end up comforting and reassuring her. "
"Yeah, give the poor woman a chance to get her money back on some of this shit."

Gross... She may cause herself a bacterial infection if she keeps that up.  
Now you know why he's dating you. His situation sucks but being a single parent is the risk you take when you have kids. Don't let him take advantage of you. He sounds like he can't actually handle his kids and he needs to cut back at work. 
"My LDR boyfriend ordered flowers to be delivered and it was the sweetest thing anyone’s done for me! I told my ex multiple times that I’d always wanted flowers from an SO (no one had ever gotten them for me before) and he never gave me any, I’ve never said anything to my current boyfriend so it was an amazing surprise! "
"Try loosening your grammar rules and simplifying the way you speak. Use more emojis, shorten your sentences, don't always capitalize. DO NOT USE SEMICOLONS.

😂 this! If my husband ever asked to see my phone I would assume it was for some techie thing.
"The fact that the mom made that call was one of the biggest red flags to me. I feel like if I put my mom in that position, she'd smack me upside the head and tell me that I was an adult and to figure it out for myself."
"Yes, the entire family actually gets accustomed to the lifestyle of having a parent at home.  It's taken a year since I returned to work and my husband is finally getting into a habit of doing more of the household chores without being asked.

There are days my husband works from home and the first words out of his mouth when I get home are, ""What's for dinner?"" and I tell him, ""You're kidding, right?""

I've also had to tell my youngest that she can't do some of the extracurricular activities she wants because I'm not home to play chauffeur any more.

I was super fortunate to find a job in my field as quickly as I did.  I'm not making much more than kids straight out of college, though."
"Depends on your organizational culture, but bringing this up could be viewed as unprofessional because it's not relevant to your work.

"Definitely super immature and you have every right to feel uncomfortable, especially considering the nature of their conversations. "
"&gt; I wouldn't worry about him ""spazzing out"". The only other time he spazzed out was literally the day he saw a dude get shot at work. Like, of course he reacted poorly.

I get that it was a stress thing, but his job is regularly stressful, and seeing people get shot - while rare - isn't something that will never happen again. I've just had bad experiences with men who are sexually attracted to me taking out their stress and rejection in weird ways. I'm worried about a ""worst case scenario"" where he comes home stressed again, I happen to be in a common space, and I somehow become a target or outlet. Or I catch him in the wrong mood and he gets aggressive with me. I really can't overstate how much our size difference freaks me out, this guy weighs almost three times as much as I do and even him raising his voice at the TV during a football game makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. "
There was a post here not so long ago where a younger woman did have a friendship with an older man that ended up being a tad bit inappropriate since they seemed to be spending too much 1 on 1 time together. The man ended up dialing back on the relationship when everyone was suspecting the 2 of having an affair even though she claimed it was strictly platonic as you claim you want this friendship to be. It may be best here to just keep things professional.

"I'll tell you the mantra I recite to myself when thinking of buying a gift for my fiancé. Before people go spare about me generalising, that is exactly what this is, a generalisation. 

So anyway, the mantra is - ""don't make it practical, make it thoughtful"". For many years I made the mistake of getting ex's practical gifts and it took me a while to twig that girls just don't want practical things. Even I just get my fiancé flowers, she appreciates it so much more than me buying her a new bike helmet, for example. She likes knowing that I've thought about doing something nice for her, that isn't necessary, she doesn't want a personal buyer! 

So to conclude, think about something your wife needs and absolutely still get her that, but make sure it's not her main present. Think thoughtful thoughts! "
"You can't deny that ultimately her life situation is a result of personal choice. Of course there are a multitude of societal influences which affect our abilities to make choices: but none of these are powerful enough to compel someone to have 3 different kids by 3 different men.

It's ironic that you're attempting to defend women whilst at the same time denying them the ability to make choices. I couldn't imagine anything more disempowering. "
"You can't save a drowning man if you refuse to save yourself from drowning first.  Both you and the drowning man will drown if you don't put on your own life vest or get in that life raft first.

Your wife needs to realize that she has to show herself the same love that she shows others.  If she keeps ignoring her own basic needs for food, health, and warmth then eventually she will not be around to help all these other people that she wants to help.  If you can't take care of yourself then you certainly can't properly take care of others.

Self love is the hardest lesson for some people to learn and realize that they too deserve all the good things that they also want for others.

Also she needs to realize that while helping people is admirable, not all people want to be helped.  People have free will.  I have seen people over the years be given chance after chance to improve their tough life situation and yet continue to chose the path that is most painful.  You can't run other people's lives for them.  People have to sometimes learn their lessons the hard way.  It doesn't mean you can't be kind to them however she is not responsible for saving the world.

"Yelling is a form of emotional abuse and it is meant to shut down arguments, instill fear and cause the other person to avoid arguing by giving in. There is no room for yelling in a healthy relationship. 

Raising your voice can be a habit that seems benign, but even when it seems harmless, it has an effect on others.  It is the mark of a lazy communicator and someone who believes that no one else's opinions matter. "
"That doesn't even make sense, how is saying, ""Lol you make more money than your boyfriend!"" making fun of *you*?"
"Maybe I won't have a popular opinion over here, but you're not blood related, met later in life, and if she feels the same way I don't see why this should be an issue. It's no different to me than having feelings for your roommate or a close friend you moved in with.

How would your parents react do you think? Do you both have good relationships with both of them? If she wasn't your SS, would you get the feeling that she maybe is into you also? If yes, I'd try talking to her about it in a not so serious way in case it goes south. If no, take some space. Don't sleep in each others bed anymore, don't text all day, try dating around or spending less time at home and more time socializing with other girls. Act as you would if you had been interested in someone and found out they weren't interested in you.

I don't think it's too wrong to date a step sibling, and even less so to date one you didn't exactly grow up with. Your relationship to her is no different than if you made a friend in high school and remained best friends still. Obviously it depends on the nature of your relationship. If you're both consenting, then the only thing you'd have to worry about is your parents. But I think you'd have a solid argument to be made if they view it negatively.

Anyways, good luck! Hopefully you can define that gray area before you get hurt."
"Oh absolutely, he would not be on his own right now (or in 3 months when we leave...) . He'd live with a close friend for 4 months until he is either old enough to start emancipation process or he shapes up and moves with us at that point after we're established and have shown our employers we are solid employees.

We work several times a week with a couple mental health providers we've developed good relationships with over the years so he would not be on his own or left without resources. There is even a program here he could be part of, I've tried every semester to get him in it, that pays his for good grades and helps with job placement, provides low cost food, medical, and clothing and bus passes and all he needs to do is turn in paperwork and maintain a C or above grade average but he refuses to take advantage of it because he expects me to bail him out when he fails. Maybe he actually would of he had to without me. He has a good contact at his school and through the mental health providers he could reach out to. "
"My ex was like that. When we started dating, he had his own place and a job. As soon as I moved in, he started slacking off. His job had layoffs and he wouldn't even look for a new one at first. He would do odd jobs here and there.

Eventually, I had to pay his car insurance for him, otherwise he couldn't drive it and he'd really make no money. He would rarely have rent. His half was like $500 by the end (after moving into smaller and cheaper places over the years) and I'd be lucky to get $200 for *all* bills at the end of the month from him.

Cutting him loose was the smartest financial decision I ever made. I didn't even realize how much money I was wasting on the entitled slob."
"This is super harsh but if you really, really wanted to be with her and really loved her you would have changed before. You knew you were hurting her and just kept doing it because it is what was easiest for you. Now that she is fed up and ready to leave for good you want a do over? The fact that you are only willing to change once you might face some consequences is telling. Get some help and be a better partner in your next relationship. "
"No. It does not sound like OP is an adoptive parent. He's a guardian. That means he doesn't have any absolute inalienable rights to this child and he doesn't have any ability to make the kid come overseas. People are overlooking the fact that the boy actively and overtly doesn't want to live with OP, and at his age, OP actually can't take him by legal or physical force. In that case OP would effectively have to sign over guardianship to whoever cares for displaced children, probably the state, otherwise the boy will be in limbo. 

I get that he's a traumatised kid, but he is not lacking all ability to make choices that are in his own interests. He's 15, not 5. He's choosing to actively try to hurt the people who have opened their home to him, and there are natural consequences to that, including that they may exercise their right to stop opening their home. He does not get an endless free pass because he had a shitty thing happen to him. Lots of us did, and most of us didn't do what this kid is doing."
"A legal guardian is not the same as an adoptive parent. OP was not looking for a child to adopt. OP was presented with a pre-existing crisis and extended help as a charitable act. He wasn't obliged to do it then and he isn't obliged now. It is no longer sustainable. He isn't obliged to keep doing it now, while his wife is being assaulted and the words used make clear it was a calculated and malicious choice and not just a loss of control. And frankly many people would absolutely tell a parent whose child was assaulting them, to put their child into foster care. OP's home is not emotionally or physically safe, at this point, for anyone, and he's not obliged to keep propping it up."
"You know how sometimes, you can't tell why someone is single, and other times, you can definitely tell why? 

This is one of those times. "
He really needs to understand that you can't forgo your job duties for him or he needs a dumping. 
"Yeah that’s just a massive asshole way to insult someone, that’s not a joke, not funny or remotely trying to be, straight up saying something to someone you barely know to make them feel inadequate and put them down.

Assholes like that get off on making themselves feel superior to others, OP shouldn’t be defending that behaviour "
"Uuuuum. Even in an open relationship, I feel like having sex with immediate relatives is kind of weird, don't you? "
"Your co-workers were assholes him. I think you’re really disregarding your boyfriends feelings. :/


Was he pissed because you didn’t stand up for him or tell your coworkers they’re being inappropriate?


What if your boyfriend had a successful career with mostly women in the workplace? And he didn’t want you to come along to their social outings? What if your boyfriend FINALLY caved in to let you, only for you to go and be shit on by the other women there?


Please. You’d feel so uncomfortable. Is your boyfriend even remotely important to you? Because I get the sense you’re sort of shitty to him.



It seems like you and your coworkers have something in common; you both look down on your boyfriend."
I'm sure giving people dirty looks over his drink helped dissuade them otherwise.
Except he's not her father.
"&gt;She constantly posts comments or whatever threatening to shoot people that ""wronged her"" with her gun. She is unemployable because she has a record of threatening violence to coworkers (on her social media, no surprise).

This is enough to institutionalize her against her will. Which is what your parents should do."
"&gt; I know they are both assholes and Layla probably hit's him too because I know who she is and I know she probably antagonizes him on the regular because she is brutal and mean and manipulative.

I don't know if it's your intention here, but you basically sound like you're blaming her for being abused. ""She's an asshole, so she probably antagonizes him until she gets hit, so it's her fault"" or implying that her shitty behavior directly means she beats her boyfriend (someone can be a fucked up person without being a physical abuser). Chances are if she broke down and told your mother, she recognizes on some level this is fucked up and wrong, and is legitimately in an abusive relationship she can't get out of.

You should also know that people in the same upbringing can handle it differently depending on their personality and mental illness (which it sounds like she was dealt a hand of through bipolar, which is somewhat genetic). A loveless marriage with distant parents can absolutely do psychological damage to a child. Just because you weren't affected doesn't mean she wasn't.

However, that being said, yes, you do have a right to resent your sister and not want to have anything to do with her, because she is unrepetantly causing serious harm (stealing from others, selling illegal drugs, doing drugs in general, etcetera). And you do have a right to not want to invite someone who has modeled dangerous, destructive behavior. I mean, what if she shows up high at your wedding or otherwise makes a scene?

You should know that there is something called a cycle of abuse. It basically goes like this:

1. Tensions building, victim is anxious, wants to placate the abuser.
2. Incident - this can be an emotional outburst, physical outburst, any kind of abuse against the victim.
3. Reconciliation - Abuser apologizes, lovebombs the victim, tells them they're so great and beautiful and I'll never ever ever hurt them again, I was so wrong to do that to you!
4. Calm honeymoon period where no abuse takes place, victim is convinced into thinking the abuser cares about their wellbeing.

Then go back to 1.

Does this sound familiar? Your sister is around the 3 or 4 mark. Sadly, when someone is in an abusive relationship, the psychological conditioning is such that they can't *see* they're in an abusive relationship. All she sees is an amazing boyfriend.

If you interact with her again, DO NOT guilt her further, because it will make her push you away even more. Look up ""how to help a friend who is in an abusive relationship"". All you can do is be understanding, gentle, perhaps point out his prior abuses (WITHOUT getting angry) and express concern for her. (""I'm just a little worried... He hurt you before... I'm afraid he could do it again. People who do that usually don't do it only once and stop."") That doesn't mean take no shit - if she gets angry at you, yes, you can respond to that. But she's going to be defensive about it no matter what, probably.

You unfortunately can't do a lot unless you witness the abuse happen in front of you. You can call the police to do a welfare check on her to help continue the paper trail of ""this woman is being physically abused"" and potentially catch him in the act of abusing her. And then you hope for the best."
"If you really are best friends then you need to be honest, otherwise you aren’t a real friend.

My best friend slept with his cousins fiancé when they were going through a rough patch some 10 years ago, after a while him and the cousin started talking again and are good friends again, it wasn’t easy, but you’ve gotta be a man and be honest, otherwise not only is this girl cheating on him, but his supposed best friend is a liar too."
For real. I also studied animation and honestly getting critiques is the only way to improve. My pet peeve is people who ask for critiques and then cant handle when they get them. She literally asked for them! Her behaviour is beyond childish.
"At age 26, she’s not a girl. She’s a grown woman. "
"I think that's a very fair-minded summary of how things might look from my GF's pov, and I am fully aware that her views might run along these lines. But at least two problems remain: (1) if I know she can deceive John (even if she has pretty good reasons to), then I know she can deceive me or anyone, which sows doubts instead of trust and relationships are built on trust. (2) She can't perpetrate this deception alone. I have to play my part by staying away. I don't want to be complicit in her mind games. 
Another thought: the longer you maintain a lie, the harder it is to sustain and the worse it looks when the truth comes out. So if '4 months' is a bit too soon to come clean, when IS the right time? The longer she persists with the lie, the more she'll be able to cling to the line that, ""Well, it would be super awkward to tell him now..."".

"Being disgusted by your brother's homosexuality is still being disgusted by homosexuality and yeah, that means you're homophobic."
"I think that's different. If OP was complaining  that her boyfriend won't have sex with her for a medical reason or because he was exhausted at work or something the comments here would be very different. Since it's almost a joke, the comments are more supporting OP, I think that would be the case regardless of gender."
"Good God.  What in the actual fuck.  I think it would be best for both you and GF if you distance yourselves from these fucking weirdos.  This is one of the creepiest stories I've read on here.

EDIT: actually, distance yourself from the husband but be there for the sister. I totally overlooked the part about her crying and am wondering if she's being abused."
"""My house is perfect in every way, other than being on fire.""

Kinda"
Woosh! Right over your head.
"Yes, but if he does something like this without asking her he’s still being selfish. One thing to decide not be in the mood, another to purposefully withhold as some kind of joke."
"I am a mom of kids in their early 20s and this is one of the worst things about parenting adult children. Having to face that they don't miss you as much as you miss them. 

I think you should make time to visit your  mom when it can be just the two of you maybe one day a month if you can. Or every other month. Then just don't tell her when you are with your girlfriend. It takes a while for some of us to realize we don't have a claim on our kids' time anymore. "
"&gt;my parents help with tuition and some bills

record scratch.

If your parents are paying your tuition bills, you don't have ""your own money"". It's pretty rude of you to book this trip without talking to them first about it, considering that.

However, gently keep talking to them about it, explain about your depressive episode, explain about your dreams about the trip, show them all the research you did about solo travel and how you picked the safest European city. Ask what reasonable thing you could do to make them feel happier about the trip.

Good luck! I hope you get to go, and if you don't get to go this time, just plan your next time. This is not the only chance you will ever have."
Where's the lawyer and gym?
Divorces are hard on kids. 
I almost can't fathom how anyone in a 4 year relationship could be this oblivious to how much it really looked like she was cheating. 
"&gt; All my friends want whenever they see him is to hear the voices of characters. I'm jealous because he's more successful than I am.

If it's any consolation, within a couple years he will be *much* sicker of that than you are. Look, I had some moderate success as a former child actor and my brother didn't, so I'm not unfamiliar with the dynamics at play here. 

Most people don't experience any kind of meaningful professional success as minors, and most voice actors (like screen actors) don't do it for very long-- don't let this interesting detour in his life story make you feel like you're somehow behind schedule. 

Be happy for his success, and chase your own. You have no idea where life will take you. My brother ended up starting a clothing business and I work in accounting now. We both couldn't be happier. 

"
"Trust me when I say that I understand valuing her happiness over yours.

Here is where I don't think you are understanding. By allowing their friendship to continue, you are allowing her to continue to deepen her feelings for him. This is a danger to your marriage.

I'm sure he is more happy than you. He doesn't have the responsibilities of family, wife, and house that you do. You have more bills. You have more worries. Not to mention the stress that this situation has put you in. He is happy getting fucked and making friends with a beautiful woman and you are losing your relationship with your wife and your life partner is picking someone else to be intimate with. It's no wonder that he is happier. He is more chatty because he is getting to know your wife and she is getting to know him. You've had thousands and thousands more conversations with your wife than they have had together.

She is in a brain fog of new relationship brain chemicals.  This is scientifically proven stuff. Our brains produce lots of feel good chemicals when we are falling in love with someone. Our brains produce lots of feel good chemicals when we are intimate with someone new. These chemicals and hormones are wonderful. They bond us to our partners. That is why it's very dangerous to have sex with others outside of marriage. That is why open relationships take lots of work and communication.  

Unfortunately these hormones and chemicals decrease over time with the same person. That is why commitment and loyalty are important to a marriage. You won't ever be able to get her brain to produce as much as he can. That is another reason they can't be in contact.

Those chemicals and hormones are like a really good drug. She is addicted to him. The only way to continue to go no contact with him. An alcoholic can't just have a beer or two. The danger of going into a drinking binge is too great. She can't be friends with him and talk to him. There is too great a danger of her falling completely for him.

She is stealing your happiness. You can make her happy. You aren't stealing her happiness. You are taking your marriage back.

They broke the rules and faced no consequences. It's time you stopped letting her get her way while you are being hurt. "
"I think it was kind of presumptuous of your friend to basically invite herself along on your trip because it would be “great for her.” But she did, &amp; you gave the impression that you’d enjoy having her along, so here we are. 

“Hey, Leigh, I’m really sorry I didn’t make this clear earlier, but I actually planned my trip to X as a solo thing. I’d be happy to share my research if you also want to plan a trip!”

It’s going to be awkward. There’s no way around that except for just letting her come in the trip because you’d rather give up your solo vacation than correct your earlier blunder. "
"I’m going to give an opinion that might be unpopular. You say you had a baby last year, and that these feelings starting arising in October. Could this be perhaps some PPD of your own? Postpartum depression does happen in fathers as well as mothers. Either way I would start with therapy, even if you think it won’t help. "
"&gt; but I don't really feel like I really deserved his anger.

 Really? If he didn't cheat, he just got accused of cheating and the only evidence came from the least credible person present at the event. A person about whom you have willfully blinded yourself to their lack of credibility.

We have had multiple posts here from people in your BF's situation where some of the highly up voted advice was to break up because of the lack of trust from their partner.

 Indeed, if RK came here looking for advice, I would advise him to break up.

There are only two possible scenarios here. Either RK cheated, or he did not.

If RK did cheat, well then, surely you should break up with him.

If RK didn't cheat, then you've been hanging out with someone so obviously into you that your entire friend group knows. And you are believing JJ's lie over RK's truth. So in this scenario, RK should break up with you.

 I don't see how your relationship survives this. You have my condolences.


BTW, the reason JJ is the least credible person at the event because he is the only one with a vested interest in seeing you break up with RK. Furthermore, if RK did cheat, he probably did it with someone there for the wedding. So why can't RK identify her? There are wedding photos, aren't there?

It is also telling that supposedly what RK did was so obvious that JJ saw it, but no one else did. In my book, JJ doesn't come close to passing the smell test.

“Think jim and Pam from the office” and remember how they were both with other people and having emotional affairs with each other? So your example is super spot on
"My feeling on it is that any place we get is going to be a half hour away from us, and this particular property is very close to both her parents and my parents, which would be convenient (currently for deer hunting season we will stay overnight at my parent's or her's while we are hunting, we'd be able to do the same with this property)."
"Yeah lol. It's a cultural thing. Buying houses for your kids is super normal for Asians. Everybody is very eager to jump on the ""your parents are evil manipulators and will bulldoze you down at every chance if you don't stomp your foot and bellow about boundaries"" bandwagon."
"It sounds terrible, but I'm pretty sure it was a typo. The title said he bit himself.

It’s interesting that you would come to us saying “I feel like my wife pulled a bait and switch” and yet you haven’t said that to your wife. 
"She’s not a flake. Stop putting her down. A flake is someone you make plans with only to have them dip out at the last minute, or constantly change them. 

You never had any plans with her. She didn’t do anything to “flake out” of — she just doesn’t text you back as frequently as you want. 

Strangers don’t owe you their time or attention. Maybe she had to work a double shift and was tired. Maybe *you* creeped her out and she’s having second thoughts. 

Your behavior and entitlement regarding this girl is a huge red flag. The fact that a stranger not texting you back sends you spiraling into a depression comes across as deeply needy and insecure, and she probably picked up on this. Instead of self-reflecting on your approach, you’ve created a narrative in which she’s self-centered and flaky which I find extremely rude on your part."
"Hmmm interesting. When I was in the honeymoon stage with my BF, you couldn't pry us away from each other. 

Sounds like she is in the honeymoon stage, but you are just casually dating her. Are you two on the same page at all? How does she spend the night, do you ask her?"

Instead of trying to win an argument here or prove to her how wrong she is for her hurt feelings, forget all the nonsense &amp; show your wife she IS special to you.

Maybe you find birthdays silly or what have you, maybe she’s being “childish,” maybe you’re tired - I understand it all, but this is clearly important to your partner, &amp; I imagine your marriage is important to *you*! You can totally turn this around."
"Only child here. I get the way this person is feeling, definitely. It's hard growing up as a single child. I was a pretty socially active person, but I honestly do feel like there's a hole in my life of a missing sibling (I have/had a step brother, but it's not the same as growing with someone). My exs family was huge, 5 siblings, all three years apart. I know how much they fought and the issues they had (both growing up, and as adults) but now I can see they're each others best friend, and have gone through some really trying times and still stuck together and I'm sad I wasn't able to grow *with* someone, if that makes any sense. 

They may be romanticizing sibling life, but you can still feel like something is missing. "

"What is keeping you in this relationship?!

Your girlfriend is setting herself up for a lifetime of dependence on her parents, and if you continue the relationship, then she's going to become *your* dependent. As of now, she's not going to finish school. She's not going to get a job. She's not going to learn to drive. Hopefully she'll have a breakthrough and start working toward those things someday, but how much longer do you want to hang around and wait for something that may never happen?"
No need to see her again at all tbh
"Figure out your escape plan. If he has untreated NPD, you're signing yourself up for a lifetime of hell and your kid up for psychological problems of his/her own. You need to figure out an escape plan and get out, whether that means taking on loans to go to school, moving back home, or whatever else you have to do.

If you have to do things in secret, do them in secret. Just get the fuck out of there. I don't know why you're wasting time posting about him faking sick when he's abusing you and preventing you from working."
"Ultimately you fell in love with the person your boyfriend presented as, and if him changing externally is a dealbreaker for you, it would probably be best to end it. Gender is extremely complicated and there really isn’t any scenario where an influence like this would be good for him.

The only “mental help” I would recommend is a therapist specializing in LGBT (specifically trans) patients, really."
"You act like John was OP's friend from childhood. Where it's OK to grab drinks throughout the week and text late at night. It wasn't. 

It's insane that you even feel that it was appropriate for OP to go out for drinks with a married man with a family 1-2x a week and text late at night when they're not together. That's fucking insane. 

And stop bringing up sex. If OP was bisexual then it would matter if the other person was female. But she isn't now is she? Stop assuming shit. 

The facts are there and the fact is that OP was inconsiderate throughout the entire situation and disregarded her BF's insecurity/feelings to maintain the ""friendship"" she had with John. That's bullshit. "
"Exactly. 

But that just proves that her bf wasn't the only one seeing something was off with their relationship. She's trying to paint the picture that her bf is crazy and insecure and ruining her professional life. In reality she is ruining her image all on her own."
I feel like this comment is a joke.
I grew up in farming country and I know way more dead farmers or farmers missing arms/hards/fingers than I do old farmers. I don't think it's a good bet for retirement.
"Agree.

I'd probably take the opportunity to teach my kid about money.  
Take those coins down to a lolly shop, pick out some sweets - and establish what we're getting out of the exchange. Use some more examples for buying food which is temporary, or a toy which is material and last a long time to give more enjoyment. Ask the child to compare these experiences to the unicorns.

If my kid is still going to spend money on an experience rather than sugar, given the choice, I'm getting a hundjy in folding and going to that school to buy me some unicorns, coz they must be amazing.
