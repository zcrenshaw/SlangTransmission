"As a happily married man with an active sex life, I can tell you that even the SAME vagina doesn't feel the same all the time.  "
"I quit my job middle of December that I loved and put a lot of time into progressing up the business in order to move 60 miles north to move in with her. I had my bags packed and was going up to propose on Christmas Day. On the day before Christmas Eve she broke up with me for some dude at work. 

Happy Ending though.. First thing I did was cry and get drunk. Whilst pissed. I rang my old boss and said “I’m not going anymore” through snot and tears and he said “see you after Christmas, business as usual. Have a good one” 

I had another great year at that company and left for career rather a lass.


Edited: for clarity "
"Happy cake day! Let me tell you a bit of a story from my life.

In 2010, I met a girl. We fell in love quickly, she moved in quickly, we got engaged quickly. Between the engagement and the wedding (at which point we had known each other 13 whole months),  I quit a job out of severe depression, my car got repossessed, her engine went unaffordably unrepairable, we got evicted, and we had to move in with a horrible roommate in a temporary house that was being sold and we were basically just paying utilities to watch the place.

We got married and within weeks, had to move again because they sold the house so we moved in with the elderly mother of a mutual friend. Turns out she was bipolar and she took us in during a manic phase. The depressive phase kicked in and she subsequently hated us but refused to say anything, so she just decided not to turn on air conditioning anymore which mean the house never got under 80 even at night. Not the best conditions for trying to find a new job which, at that point, I had been in and out of minimum wage retail hell jobs for months and my wife was working a part-time deli position at a grocery store.

One night, we have a huge fight with her and she tells us to get out. We are now legitimately homeless and facing the prospect of living out of the car we were borrowing from a friend. We have no family within miles and we can't afford to leave the city because we can't give up their car nor the little income we have. Two other friends take us into their already tiny house where their twins share a bedroom and they sleep in the living room. They give us a futon mattress in their storage room.

One week after that, the wife of the friend couple breaks her leg so we extend our stay to help take care of her. A couple of weeks after that, my wife falls and breaks her elbow (no insurance, of course) which means her job is gone. It takes about a month but I find a new part-time job, she recovers enough to get her part-time job back, and we move into a craphole extended stay motel. A couple of weeks there and bedbugs send us to a slightly better but still extended stay hotel.

Over the next year, we discover just how poor you can be and still have a roof and a bed. Food stamps only go so far and my church pantry helped. We live in 200 square feet and grow to hate each other. We didn't have sex the last nine months we were together. My job is getting better, more hours, a couple of raises, a promotion. She quits job after job because she's undependable and inconsiderate.

The last straw is a story I've told here before, that we bought two pizzas from Aldi (one supreme and one pepperoni). I had a hard day at work and was desperately looking forward to eating that pizza as I'd mostly been living off ramen and chef boyardee. And I get home (to the hotel) and she's eaten my pizza. Not because there wasn't other crappy food in the house but because she wanted it.

A few weeks later, I told her we don't work as a couple and we need to go our separate ways. She agrees but she can't move out because of the cost, so we, separated, continue to live together for a couple of months. Eventually I just let her know she needs to find another place to live because I'm paying the majority of the hotel bill and I'm tired of supporting her. She moves out. I spend the rest of that year coming home to an empty hotel room. Depression is a bitch.

I meet someone. We are dating for a few months and we move in together (her lease was up and she took pity on me, a TLC-style scrub). The next two years are okay. Some really fantastic moments. Some really awful ones. We break up (and stay roommates), she goes back to her emotionally abusive ex. He lays on yet another last straw and they break up. We get back together. We break up again (and stay roommates) and she goes back to him.

During this time, my job is getting better and better. I've gotten several promotions, I'm making good money (not great but enough). And then I get the job that changes my life.

In 2015, I apply for and get a position in Baltimore with a software company. It's the most money I've ever made in my life. It's a paid relocation so I have the chance for a fully fresh start. I move. It's really hard the first month but I meet someone. We start dating. About 11 months after we started dating, I move in with her. One year later, I get a car for the first time in seven years. My job is amazing. My girl is amazing and we're getting married next year. My home is amazing. My car, simple and featureless as it may be, is amazing. MY LIFE is amazing.

I am astounded every day when I think of living in that sweltering bedroom in that old woman's house, when I think of my ex-wife screaming at me for just trying to help her bathe with a broken arm, when I think of scrambling to move out of a bedbug infested shithole hotel room, when I think of walking around my old city like a zombie because my depression wouldn't let me see anything but gray.

My rough patch lasted anywhere from two to five years depending on when one considers I came out of it. And now, at nearly 33 years of age, I am happier than I have ever been in my life and there's only up from here.

I don't know how rough your rough patch is right now. I can tell you, when I got locked out of my hotel room because the card key wouldn't work and I had to climb in the window on Thanksgiving night, you couldn't have convinced me of anything other than ""my life sucks."" And I don't know what's in your future. You might have a marvelous turnaround like I did or your life might just keep sucking indefinitely. But I can tell you this: I appreciate every last ounce of my happiness now, infinitely more than I ever could have had I not had the life I've had. Short of living on the street itself, I know what homelessness is. Short of going more than a day or two without food, I know what hunger is. And I most assuredly know what depression is.

And I know that all of these things *can* end. I can't say they will, but I know that they can. And I hope you end up a few years from how looking back on whatever now is and marveling at how far you've come. I won't even tell you to not give up. Go ahead and give up if you feel you need to. Resign yourself to the suck you're dealing with and get through it. Push through, hating every minute of it. And ignore any trite ""it's always darkest before the dawn"" crap that others shove at you because that doesn't help you now. All you need to do right now is make it another day, and then another, and then another, and *that* I believe you *can* do.

And I earnestly hope one day you get to the other side of this with a smile. Good luck, brother.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold! Since this is picking up traction, let me give a quick bit of advice from a comment I posted below.

Hindsight would have told me to do a couple of things:

* Go see a therapist / counselor / psychiatrist. If you have a job that has the Employee Assistance Program available to it you can get six free sessions per year with a therapist. I took advantage of it only after a panic attack ripped me apart, but I should have went in earlier. If you don't have that as an option, there are some chat / webcam options for relatively cheap.
* Take all that extra depressive time and channel it into something useful. Go take free online classes, go learn a language, go learn to code. Anything that puts you on the other side of it a better person.
* Make some friends. This is damn near impossible, but post on your local city's subreddit to see if any trivia team needs an extra body. It's a great, generally free ( or food-cost only) way to get social and make friends. My trivia team here saved me from insanity when I first moved to Baltimore."
As a guy with no friends... I wouldn’t give a shit
"Because the consequences of us fucking up are higher than they've ever been.

Edit: Thanks for the gold, duder!"
"I'm Scottish and on rare occasions I'll wear a kilt.

If you go drinking in the centre of town woman will just lift it up to see. Can you imagine the other way around."
"To my neighbor. She has the same name as this girl I was chatting up and one drunken night I started texting. Nothing sexual or offensive, just a compliment here and there, some personal questions, and asking her out for coffee. The responses I was getting seemed weird and I didn't realize until after she said ""Ok I'm going to bed now.""  
I went over the next day to explain everything and her and her husband almost died laughing. They admitted that they really thought I was hitting on her and were a bit pissed but luckily they believed me right away. To this day my neighbor makes comments about me hitting on his wife. "
"I’m in the Navy, and women frequently tell me I have incredible blue eyes. Once my coworker stopped mid sentence, hummed to herself, and said “I wouldn’t mind a deployment in those oceans”.

Inappropriate? Totes. It also made my week.

**E:** Some folks asked to see this [guy's eyes](https://i.imgur.com/rBaoW4z.jpg). Please ignore the four days of 'stache, but I promise it's Bollywood worthy when it's fully developed."
"This thread has made me realize I've done a lot of stupid shit for a lot of girls.

This is not the dumbest thing, but it's the first thing to come to mind:

I was 18ish. Friday night, I was home playing video games, and this girl I was crushing on hard calls me because her friends ditched her at a night club.

""Come pick me up."" she said crying... Sure. I get dressed, I get into my car, and I drive there. I arrive to see her standing with two of her friends. One I knew, and one I didn't. I ask her what happened, to which she answers the GUY she was with ditched them. FUCK.

I'm here, I can't exactly ditch them. So I knew where the two girls lived, but not the third. I drop off the first girl, and it's just me, the girl I like and unknown girl. She gives me directions which lead me from Montreal to the US border. She has no ID on her that has her address, this predates GPS. Her dad calls her at 3:30am and she's like ""I'm scared, I don't know where I am!"" Bitch, this wouldn't happen if you knew where the fuck you lived.

I ask to speak with him, and he starts by yelling at me thinking I'm the douche who ditched them. I yell at him back and tell him ""Listen, I'm the one who got dragged out of bed to come pick up your daughter who got ditched downtown. She doesn't know where the fuck she lives and I've been driving for 1hr following HER directions, keep yelling at me and I'll drop her off wherever the fuck I am lost and she can walk home. How's that? Now! tell me how to get to your place!""

She had been giving me directions the wrong way the whole time. I went through a full tank of gas. I couldn't ask for directions because she had no idea where she lived!

I got home by 5am that night. I barely got a thanks."
"I've been straight up told I'm ''fuckable'', ''the only hot guy'', and actually groped at work. Nobody really cared or thought there was anything wrong with it. "
I close out of an app and immediately enter the same app
"They vary just like dicks vary.  

When you find someone that's a good fit and you have physical chemistry, even vanilla sex can be mind blowing.  "
If they're 17 it probably isn't the first time
"I used to work at a restaurant in the downtown part of the city.  I parked about a quarter mile away on a side street in order to avoid paying for parking or getting a ticket for an expired meter.  One night I was walking back to my car and this girl was about 20 feet ahead of me.  I wasn't paying much attention to her at first because a) I wasn't doing anything wrong and b) I was tired after a long shift.  Eventually I began to notice that she was walking faster and faster, and turned on to a couple of side streets, which I also turned on to because that's where my car was.  By the time she turned on to the second side street, she looked over her shoulder to see me still there and began full on running to her house, which happened to be right next to where I had parked my car.  "
"Not me but a guy i knew passed up a good uni to stay close to his girl, she broke up with him in the second year."
My life is dope and I do dope shit.
Now that's a good boss. 
"Back in high school I worked as a bagger at a grocery store. I was 17, and she was a cashier and 30, married. One day, a week before my 18th birthday, she said to me, “if I was 12 years younger and not married, I’d let you show me a good time” with a wink. 

In retrospect, kind of creepy. But, I was a 17 year old guy and thought like a 17 year old guy. So yeah, a comment like that was quite the ego boost as she was actually pretty cute. "
"I work for a female chef. Kitchens are a bit proudly anti-PC. I was grilled on my position toward morning sex (my stance being let me brush my teeth first) and told at the end by my boss, ""No offense, but I would never fuck you."" I'm engaged so I didn't take offense, but if I ever grilled a female coworker on her sexual preferences and then dropped a rude truth when they didn't meet my standards, I'd probably be regarded as a jerk. I love my job and my boss, but I think the bluntness took me off guard and would have come off very 1950's coming out of a man's mouth."
"no. lots of things can be different:

"I think it's generally disrespectful to your SO. Even if they trust you and you trust them, feelings can't be controlled and old ones hide. 

Edit: shit people really don't understand the word ""generally"""
"I was a part of a team of loggers/cabin builders, and our manager was a woman. She would casually stroll into our communal shower room to debrief us on the next-day's tasks, because according to her, this was the only moment when we were all in the same room at the same time."
"Speaking as the girlfriend of a guy with a low libido, what I wish he would do is just amp up the other types of sexual affirmations. Compliments, touching, kissing. It doesn't have to be sex - just make her feel *wanted* and attractive. And tell her that you're tired. Don't try to force yourself into having sex you're not up for, but compensate with other displays of intimacy.

I think it's a common response to distance your self a bit when the other person wants to have sex and you don't, and that kind of behavior and that indirect form of rejection tends to build.  "
"I put my hand on the lower back of my girlfriend at a work Christmas party. She looked up at me, shocked. I looked back at her, smile quickly turning to terror. It was the wife of my boss. To be fair, my gf and my boss's wife were wearing pretty similar outfits and look pretty similar from behind. I turned beet red."
"I work as an electrician in a hospital and this place is overflowing with sexual tension.

One girl calls me her baby daddy even though I've never really talked to her yet alone fucked her.

What I wanted to say: ""I have a roommate and I've spent the last two weeks with people, so I hope there won't be a ton of people""

What she head: ...yeah, you can guess.

She instantly deleted me off snapchat, I don't even blame her."

"Years ago, when I waited tables, I had only been working at this restaurant for about a week.  A female coworker reached between my legs and grabbed my crotch.  Saying immediately after, ""oops, I thought you were someone else"".  
I immediately responded with, ""So whose dick did you think you were grabbing?""  She just started laughing along with a few other coworkers that were hanging out in the kitchen.  "
I wouldn't mind it as long as you're not super clingy and I was still able to go do my own thing occasionally.
Holy shit reading this made me angry
"Actually, happened just yesterday at work.

We’re eating lunch in the break room and I pull out a Ziploc^TM full of nuts. She looks at that and goes “damn Neo, you have a huge nutsack”. I found it chuckle-worthy.

But imagine if she brought out a chicken breast and I said “damn Kelsey, that’s a nice big breast you have”. If she didn’t get me fired, someone else would have"
"Vaginas are looser or tighter depending on her level of arousal. I cringe when a guy tells me how tight some girl was, all I can think was how it's actually because she wasn't that turned on by him."
"Had a good girl but broke up with her to be with an even better one. After I did that I regretted it to the point I couldn’t enjoy the new girl ether. Ended up just breaking up with the new one as well to try to get the old one back.

Didn’t get the old one back.

I still laugh at what a dumbass i was 5 years later."
"During finals week my freshman year of college I sat in the cafeteria completely destroyed by the DiffEq test I had just taken. I sat there staring into space thinking, ""Man, I totally bombed that one"". After about five minutes I came to I realized I was starting at this pretty good looking blonde sitting next to her bf. She had noticed me and I assume was seeing how long it took me to realized I was staring directly at her (~10 feet away). I became noticeably embarrassed and laughed and she waved at me. It turns out that the bf and I would later become great friends through something unrelated. I'm even going to be one of his groomsmen in their wedding this July!

"Dude...depending on where you live, hit up the outlet stores...or stores like Marshall’s, Ross, Winners, etc.  

A lot of brand name stuff at very good prices.  My college roommate used to have to the nicest shit.  Found out he would hit the thrift store...and apparently they even have brand new stuff that people donate and never wore.  Which makes complete sense, because I would donate things I bought and never wore after it was in my closet for a long time.  Impulse buys....

You got options.  "
"If it was someone who was a long time friend before you started dating, and you resumed a normal friendship afterwards, I'd find it acceptable.

Pretty much every other scenario, a deal breaker.

Every woman experiences discharge lol. "
"Another married, sexually active man here.  Really really.  "
"In college, hanging out with a girl. She wants to go home so I offer to walk her home. She's the type to avoid any help like door holding or anything she might consider patronizing. I walk her to the door and watch where she walks, she's going to cut through the woods. That doesn't seem safe. She's had a few drinks and might trip or something. I'll hang back and just follow discreetly to make sure she's ok. Keep back at a leisurely pace and make sure she gets back to her dorm about a mile away. See she has her id and gets in ok and I make my way back.

I feel good, thinking I did the right, gentlemanly thing without being over bearing. Never mention it again. We hang out for the rest of our years at school and eventually lose touch after graduation and real world jobs kick in.

Flash forward 10+ years later, she's posting on facebook about the scariest night of her life where she was taking a shortcut back to her dorm and was being followed and feared for her life.

"My girl convinced me to buy her some jewelry that I couldn't really afford but she managed to convince me I could make ends meet anyway.

A few months later, when I (fucking surprise) couldn't make ends meet, I missed a school payment, was dropped from my classes, and therefore lost my scholarship money. I went from owing only a few hundred dollars to the school to over $2,000.

"I was painting the walls in a children’s play area in a hospital waiting room. It was all taped off and clearly said closed but an American lady and a kid were hovering which usually means they’re waiting for my attention.

“Can he play in there?” She said
“Err no, we’re painting in here and as you can see it’s full of signs saying closed”

Lady walks off.

After the kid repeatedly ignores her after telling him the play area is closed, he’s still trying to get in there and generally being a bit of a spoilt brat trying to push past her and slide through her legs to get into the area which is clearly occupied my me, tool boxes, the apprentice and various other bits of equipment.

The lady came over and asked if I could let him in there for 10 minutes...definitely no. She then asks if I can tell the kid to stop trying to get in there. I was a bit shocked to be honest as I didn’t feel it was my job to parent a naughty child or parents anyone’s children come to think of it.

My mouth and head obviously weren’t working together as I blurted out “I’m sorry I’m not allowed to talk to children”  when I meant to say it’s not my job to talk to children and tell them what they can and can’t do.

Her jaw dropped in disbelief and she repeated what I said very loudly into the waiting room “your not allowed to talk to children!!!?”

Obviously thinking I’m a makeshift
Paedophile she scarpered off with her brat in tow and left me standing there trying to explain what I really meant to say whilst a waiting room full of people all seemed to simultaneously give me this look of shame.

Edit 1: this is my 2nd most rated comment, I’m not sure if I’m proud or concerned 

Edit 2: genuinely expected there to be a police officer waiting for me the next day working there. "
You should have warned her about the dangers of drowning. ;)
"&gt;So the friend zone does exist?
&gt;

*In a way*. What women dislike about the common characterisation of ""the friend zone"" is the implication (or explicit expression) by a lot of ""nice guy"" type guys that being emotionally supportive entitles them to sex. That women leach emotional support off of them. That it's rooted in misogyny (which to be fair it often is)

I take a slightly more compassionate and I think nuanced view of that whole can of worms. I think its due to a lot of guys (and girls) not understanding the difference between how girl friendships work vs guy friendships, which itself is ultimately due to the unhealthy way boys are taught to socialize and the unhealthy societal expectations placed upon them

Friendships for girls and women inherently involve emotional support. That's one of the main points of having friends. So when a girl is friends with you and is complaining about her jerk boyfriend it's not because ""oh girls only like jerks"", or that their boyfriends are actually jerks, it's because they're looking for emotional support for something that's stressing them. 

The reason some guys misconstrue that is because the way we are taught to socialize from a very young age is that we're not *supposed* to seek emotional support, we're not *allowed* to cry or show vulnerability to basically anyone other than our mom's and our significant others. Emotional intimacy between guys is still very much discouraged and shamed. Displays of affection have to be wrapped in things like teasing (not that teasing between buds is wrong, it's not), displays of emotional support usually come in the form of offering help to self-medicate and self-support ie having a drink with them. Because those are the unhealthy ways we learn to support our selves emotionally. Physical affection is still very much infamnia*.

Point being I think that's why some guys get the wrong message when females friends show them emotional intimacy. Because guys only ever experience emotionally intimacy in romantic relationships and that's culturally indoctrinated (I'm not using indoctrination with the value judgement that's colloquially placed on it, rather just the sociological term) even for guys who have never been in a relationship.

**But I digress**. The ""friendzone"" as it's oft portrayed is not a thing. That idea is the result of lack of understanding between the sexes due to some unhealthy social mores, as well as more than a little misogyny on the part of those specific guys.

*But* the idea that you need to make your intentions known early on is absolutely a thing. Because if the girl doesn't think you're interested in anything but friendship they'll invest in the friendship. And here's where the other misunderstanding comes into play; ""I don't want to ruin our friendship"". The reason that is a worry for girls but seems not to be for guys most of the time is due to the aforementioned. For girls who say that, there's value in your friendship beyond just being a person you like to hang out with. For guys, because we've not invested that emotional support system (because frankly we've never been taught *how*) there's no real risk that comes from ""ruining the friendship"" because what's gained from the relationship beyond the obvious is the emotional support structure *that's already present for the girl*. For the guy the risk of losing a friend is worth gaining a lover because there's more value for them emotionally in a relationship than a friendship. That's not to say women don't find emotional value in an SO that doesn't exist with friends, of course not, it just means for them losing a friend usually has more weight emotionally 

Hence the ""friend zone""

TL;DR make you're intentions known early on because if you don't she'll develop immense value in you as a friend that she's often not willing to lose. Don't downplay your importance to girls as a friend. Also we need to acknowledge the unhealthy gender pressures placed on men because that shits why guys kill themselves 3 times as often as women





*incidentally this is part of my pet theory as to why it's more common for girls to experiment with bisexuality than for guys, not due to any biological cause but rather to lack of early exposure to physical affection between the same sex. I think it's supported by the long standing tradition in the English boarding school system of guys first sexual experiences often being with other guys, when there are no other options those supposed biological differences breakdown pretty damn quick. But that's another discussion  "

"Im not overweight but I have a friend who is (very overweight), and he does very well with women.

He is just extremely charismatic and exudes confidence to a whole new level. Its surprising how many physically attractive women out of his league go for him or atleast hook-up with him.

Just goes to show that personality means more than looks."
"I joined a penpal program at my university because I wanted to ask out one of the organisers. She would turn me down, as she was seeing someone, but I felt morally obligated to stay with the program anyways. SO... I spent that year exchanging letters with grade school kiddos in my city.  
 
My story is so tame compared to others I wasn't even sure if it was worth posting haha. 
 
Edit: a word"
"Masculinity (manifested as competitiveness, risky exploration, energetic expression etc) has been pathologised because it is not compatible with the rote learning methods of modern schools which require children to be docile, submissive and quiet. On top of that, male behaviour has never been under the level of scrutiny that it is now and not without some good reasons. The moral culture of the Western middle class places harmlessness as its highest moral virtue.

The result; greater numbers of insecure, underconfident, anxious, awkward, poorly socialised and shy young men, with absolutely no guarantee that women and society will be any safer from the actions of the minority of men who are uncivilised and violent.

It would be easy to point the finger at ""muh feminism"" as many might be tempted, but to to that would be intellectually dishonest and superficial, and I don't do it. There are far greater cultural forces at play here, all of which are contributing to the stunted psychological, emotional and intellectual growth of many boys and young men.

I am fortunate in that I didn't have the traits that make me the person I am successfully beaten out of me as a child. I had good parents, and many good teachers. But I feel very sad for men who were defanged, constantly scolded and medicated, and robbed of their rightful place in society as honourable, disciplined and productive men."

"
It was about 10PM. She texted me telling me she’s home alone and wants me to come over. Now if that didn’t mean sex I don’t know what the fuck. So I drove to the store to buy condoms. I haven’t had sex so I just grabbed anything from the shelf and bought it. I then drove to the address she gave me (what I thought was her house). It wasn’t. It was her friends place. And they were both sitting outside having drinks. I pulled up and we talk for 5-10 minutes. Awkward as fuck because they’re both drunk as shit. She then asks if I can take her home and being the nigga I am I say sure. So she hops in my car and we drive to her house which feels like an hour drive. And she barely says anything to me. I sorta lean over and see who she’s texting and it’s some other guy. I drop her off and drive back home. I got played by the pussy.
"Not me but my dad. 

He had popped into a shop to grab something really quickly while my Mum parked and waited. He came running out, quickly opened the door and jumped in the passenger side of the car, slapped the dashboard and went “OK! DRIVE!” only to be deafened by the screams of a middle aged woman sitting in the drivers seat of a car that looked like my parent’s car. "
I would be pleasantly surprised. 
What a depressing upvote
"It’s pretty good, no complaints.

I’m very shy and come off awkward, but as long as I’m not making an ass out of myself I think it can be endearing. 

Wish my conversation skills were better, I’m just not much of a talker. Interestingly enough I love women who are outgoing and plain-spoken."
"My boss closed the door and told me about her rape in college.  I just sat there dumbfounded while she told me about being cornered in her dorm room by some guy who broke in to steal shit and getting forced to have sex.  It wasn't even part of the conversation, so didn't really understand why she just peeled back her soul to show me.  Later, I began to understand she hated men.  It was like a pre apology for how she'd be treating me in the future.  "
"No, because it’s not my fault I don’t experience the same feelings towards her. "

"Some are tight and some are just snug. I’ve never encountered a loose vagina. Some are slightly shorter than others. Every single one has felt really great. 

The biggest variation I’ve found is that some take longer to get wet enough for penetration, and some feel tighter during those first few thrusts. But they mostly even out after that. 
"
"&gt; I just don't like excessively dischargy vaginas.

All vaginas are dischargy, mate. That's my point. You're never going to find a vagina that doesn't have discharge. 

In fact, if for some reason a woman isn't experiencing discharge, then her vagina isn't cleaning itself and its a sign something is medically wrong with it. "

"She was pretty chill about it, actually, and just raised her eyebrows at me. I was the one that basically leaped away from her in fright. My girlfriend saw the whole thing and to her credit understood almost immediately what had occurred."
I would hope you would give my friends a chance and then you would have some to.  Not going to think less of you for being an introvert.
A girl's smile when she's completely into a conversation is incredible to me.
"We're told on the daily (in various ways) that you need to ask permission to do literally anything with a woman (or else it's actual rape), but why can't men just take a hint/why was he so unaware of my obvious flirting, but then just yesterday there was an askwomen thread about being annoyed when men take polite gestures as a sign of romantic interest.  "
"What?

No fuck that a rough patch isn’t going to make me give up like that!  I’m so much stronger than that. 

I’ve been going through a multitude of rough patches related to health and finances, since 2015 that led to my divorce. 

That doesn’t mean it’s not temporary. I’m not going to be here any longer than I have to. I’m going to make my life better one step at a time until it’s better. 

It may have started with “I feel miserable, but at least I made my bed and showered today”, but eventually you add more and more positives until you dig yourself out of the hole. "

"I was walking home from town after a few drinks once around 2 in the morning. This girl was walking maybe 200m in front of me, and we were the only people on the path.

At one point she stops up and starts looking at her cell phone, completely oblivious about everything that’s going on around her. I keep on walking and am eventually about to pass her when she apparently notices me and looks up.

And she screams. She screams so loudly she must have woken the entire neighborhood. And not just for a moment. It keeps on going for seconds. It wad completely surreal. And the only thing I do is stop up and say:

«Don’t worry, I’m not here to rape or mug you.»

To which she responds «oh» while looking completely perplexed. I just shrug with my eyebrows and walk on. She promptly looks down at her phone again.

Still not sure that even really happened."
"Still has nothing to do with cleanliness or the wipes she was using. If at some point she was dripping like glue, it was coming from her vagina, which wipes wouldn't have been able to reach anyway.

"Earlier this morning i had to get something from a locked storeroom, the key of which is held by our boss' secretary. She escorted me to the storeroom and unlocked it for me while joking that we better not tell anyone what kind of things she and i do in this dark little room.          

I chuckled and took the joke at face value but i just realized that if i had made that comment to a female coworker i'd probably get in shit tons of trouble with HR.           

Now that i think about it, last December i informed this same coworker i was unable to make it to the company's Christmas dinner and she jokingly acted all sad, pretending she had set aside a table for two just for us, away from the others.               

I'd like to add she's in a committed relationship and i know her well enough she's not seriously flirting with me so i do not get uncomfortable about it, but i would never dare make such comments to a female coworker, especially when in this #metoo era a simple accusation is enough to get you in serious trouble.

From their perspective, what reason do they have to put themselves out there? Its seems like a lot of risk. They will probably receive a lot of rejection if they tried. 

Edit: OP, the girl who asked this question: What are you doing to help men who are shy and isolated? do you approach them and show them kindness? do you try to get to know them? do you introduce them to other people? do you invite them out to things? do you help them meet women and help them get laid? if you don't do anything, then you have your answer about why there are so many shy, isolated men who are not comfortable with the public. nobody puts in an effort to include them or help them, including you."

"I was at my bar talking to a woman.  A super attractive lady, but married.  I had my hand resting on the corner of this high table in the middle of the floor for people to rest their drinks when it's standing room only.  I guess she thought she was leaning against the table edge, but that was my hand.  She effectively parked her pussy right on top of my knuckles.  I could feel the warmth of it through her jeans.  

I froze, completely unprepared for how to handle this scenario.  Our conversation was still going on.  I was horrified... but also, ya know... pussy on my hand.  Did I mention she was really hot?  And that her husband was standing about four feet away with his back turned to us?  And she was still talking.  By the time I got over the shock a little bit, it occurred to me that her pussy had been parked on my knuckles, and I hadn't said anything, that the window had passed - it was lose-lose at this point: if I said something at this point, I still look like a perv.  If I don't say anything and she (or her husband, or anyone else) notices my hand is half-buried in her crotch, I look like a perv.  My only hope is that she will move off before she or anyone else notices.  Which is what happened, but only after three or four excruciating minutes.  

Afterwards, and I'm conflicted about whether to be proud or ashamed of this, as soon as I could get away I went to the restroom to wash my hand off vigorously with scalding hot water and all the soap.  Because I knew if I didn't it was only a matter of time before I caved to curiosity and huffed her pussy smell off my paw."
"She was 18, moved in with some guy who was 36 a few months later. She got pissed at me when I said he’s a cradle robber.

The next day I removed my back seats. I was the only friend with a car, and people kept doing that to me."
"Back in high school I was in theatre and I asked my stage manager if she wanted to go out and get some coffee sometime. She called me a suck up and I figured she didn't understand my intention. 

So I doubled down and got some flowers (I was too scared to get real flowers for some reason so I got dandelions) and I got most of the high school band to play the song hey baby while I sang it to her during lunch. It turns out she had a boyfriend and we were all just unaware... It was so cringe worthy.

I'm honestly not sure if I regret it though..."
My high school girlfriend didn't want me to go to college because she was afraid I'd meet someone and jump ship. So I didn't go. She cheated on me a year later. (She had no drive to better herself and flat out told me she'd be okay with working at Wendy's for the rest of her life.)

"Probably best not to put yourself in that situation. 50% of trust is trusting the other person won't put themselves in shitty situations, if they're forever hanging out 1 on 1 with exes or going to parties and getting incredibly drunk alone its hard to trust them when their actions aren't trustworthy.

"http://jishirofinney.com/index.php/2018/02/17/533/

Our society blames men, for *everything*. You're assumed guilty of causing all the world's problems just for having been born. No credit is ever given to men. To state ""men built that-"" and to point at a bridge is to be sexist or something.

That cultural mindset is going to make anyone start to retreat inwards- to start wanting to do less, if it's assumed that all you can do is wrong. They'll seek ""harmless"" hobbies like video gaming, to their own spaces. They might not even contribute to society or feel bitter towards it; after all, what's it ever done for them except heap scorn and blame?"

"A girl I'm in a relationship with more or less had no friends when I first met her. I mean, she had ""work friends"" and ""bus friends"", but I don't really think that's quite the same thing (although she might disagree with that).

As for the ""why"", I'd say that's probably due to a combination of factors. She moved here for work a few years ago. She's asexual, which I think people sometimes don't really understand and it's undoubtedly led to awkward situations for her. And she was the victim of abuse in her past, and I'm sure this added to that social awkwardness.

She is one of the most amazing people I have ever met, and I love her more than I think words can describe. I see in her an amazing kindness, intelligence, humor, generosity, and she is just an absolutely beautiful person inside and out.

Her not having many friends when we met didn't make me think she was a ""loser"". If anything, I worried for her and hoped that she wasn't too lonely, but she seemed pretty satisfied with her social situation, so I figured, ""well, not my place to judge - if she's happy, she's happy"".

In the time since we met, she's gotten multiple circles of friends that share some of her interests, and at least grown acquainted with my circle of friends. She's still a little awkward in some social situations, but I'm sure I'm awkward in some social situations too. And if she hadn't gotten more friends, I'm sure that would have been fine, so long as she was happy.

OP, don't worry yourself too much about it. Any guy worth your time is going to appreciate you for you and not hold you up to some expectation for who and what you surround yourself with.

And to my girl, who I know sneaks a peek at my Reddit posts on occasion - I love you so very much. Just thinking about you makes me smile, just imagining your laugh makes my tears well up with joy, and just picturing the next time you're in my arms again fills me with happiness."
"My brother is very overweight (6'2"", about 120kg). He's muscular as he is a tradie but has a big gut.

He's recently single after a 10 year relationship and is dating attractive women all the time and I can only put it down to how confident he is as he doesn't have the looks! "

"In the spring of '05 I was a junior in highschool and my older sister was going to college and taking the car we were sharing. My parents gave me $5000 and told me to buy a car, but I had to do all the research and find one myself. In one of my boldest and most idiotic moves I hopped on eBay and bought a junked out 1976 corvette stingrays. Car and shipping from Alabama to Louisiana was just under $4000. My mom flipped her shit but my dad was surprisingly cool about it. Neither of us knew anything about cars, but we spent all summer researching and restoring it as much as we could. 13 years later and a lot more money later, I still have it, but I am trying to sell it now. 10/10 would do it again.

"I read this from some guy on this subreddit but there are basically two types of guys when it comes to flirting.

Those who assume interest until disproven and those who assume no interest until disproven. Usually it’s the former that has more success because they are more willing to push boundaries and declare through their actions want they want. Whereas the latter usually waits for a green light and often times it’s too late.

As a kid I used to think that romantic relationships formed once you got to become close friends because you both would eventually start having feelings from how amazing the friendship is. I never understood why those who were extra pushy would be so successful.

Turns out if you don’t declare what you want from the start then she will never know where the relationship is going. If you say from the get go you are interested in getting to know her better, then she knows how to steer conversations with flirtatious moments. Subsequently if you just strike up small talk trying to get to know her she won’t know whether or not you’re being friendly or trying to hit on her.

As for the smooth part it’s just something that comes with experience and willingness to look like an idiot sometimes. In my experience, a lot of times if you put a girl on blast they will start to become more comfortable with you because you’re breaking the “teasing” barrier. 

For example, say there is a girl who comes up to you after class and is like “hey if I give you $25, can you put my name on your group activity worksheet because I’m not going to be on campus that day.”  You know from the start this is bullshit because it’s week 7 into the quarter and she has her own group so you know she’s trying to get your number next. If you can catch on, saying something like “$25 is a lot of money for my number” could make her laugh and then you both would then mutually exchange numbers and already have a good start to the relationship.

"Don't get me wrong, in the heat of it I love all the mess, the smell, the sin of it.

"When I was a teenager, I had a 1987 Jeep Cherokee. It had a great area in the back wherein you could fold the seat down, and it made a perfect sized area for two people to sleep, or get busy.

Being teenagers, my girlfriend and I would park behind an abandoned mall and do the deed in the Jeep.

One time one of us must have knocked out of gear as we climbed to the back, or maybe I just forgot to apply the brake or didn't pull it up hard enough.

When things got more intense, the jeep started rolling backwards down a slight grade. I didn't quite notice at first but then she started screaming because we were moving pretty fast. I tried to get back into the drivers seat but we were tangled up in half-removed clothes and a couple blankets, and we rolled over a bank at the end of a parking lot, and down into a ditch. 

The truck came to a hard enough stop when it hit that the rear bumper got smashed, and the tailgate popped open. Both of us were thrown, naked, from the back of the truck into swampy ditch water.

We sat there stunned for a bit and then both burst out laughing, I think we were both in a bit of shock.  

My father asked me why the back of my truck was messed up and I told him that my buddies and I were off roading and slid backwards into a bank while trying to climb it. He believed me and we got a new bumper. I eventually admitted to him what actually happened maybe 10 years later.

My poor girlfriend at the time was tiny and fragile, had some bad bruises the next day and had to take a few days off of work. Sorry Jessica."
"As a swinger I have had my fare share of experiences.  Vaginas vary quite a bit but mostly in subtle ways.  

* There are internal texture differences. Some can be quite smooth internally while others can have almost a ribbed quality (similar to the top / roof of some people's mouths).  

* Wetness varies quite a bit from dry (almost feels like it would be painful for her) to very very sloppy wet.  

* ""Tightness"" can vary but gets changed by a combination of wetness, muscle control and actual physical smallness of the vaginal canal.

Take those 3 things and juggle them around and you can get some pretty unique combinations.  Most are generally an average mix of all though and may have an extreme aspect of one or the other (my SO for instance produces more lubrication and is a squirter) so She gets more and more ""slippery"" as she gets more aroused.  Whereas a partner I was with felt quite tight but also didn't produce that much lubrication so there was much more friction.  You would think this is good but too much friction and too little lubrication can feel uncomfortable."

I proceeded to apologize profusely. Not creepy but just weird"
"There was an ELI5 about this a while ago. When I looked, the top answer was that your brain basically sends test signals throughout your body all day long, like maintenance checks. These signals cause the muscles to do a small tremor in response so the brain knows they're working. 

Because of cell phones, we've become more aware of vibrations near where we keep our phones. So sometimes if your phone doesn't go off, or if you don't even have your phone in your pocket, you feel a ""vibration"" of the muscles responding to a checkup by your brain, not your phone."

I responded asking her why she never told me and I never got a response. She blocked me the next day and I couldn't figure out a way to contact her. The next couple years of my life it totally haunted me, I would just sit up and night wondering what the babe was doing, if it looked like me, if I would ever get to meet it and what it would be like, I fucking loved that child without ever meeting it. She ended up finding me on Facebook and told me she was just 'playing a joke' and that she was never even pregnant. That shit tore me apart, I felt like I lost a child I never had.

That sounds like exactly the type of shit we say at my place.  Lucky for me we are pretty laid back here and you know who can take a joke and who can't.

"Occasionally, but usually overweight 40 year old women.

You really asked for it bro. You basically enticed everyone who doesn't fit into that situation to explain why they are special lol
"Completely seconding this, having been in a relationship where difference in sex drive was a major issue. 

It also helps to let her know you’re not in the mood early on. It stings a lot more when you’re both half naked and you say “I’m not in the mood right now,” compared to kissing a bit and saying “hey, I’m really tired but do you want a back rub/to cuddle and chat in bed/(whatever you guys like)?”"
She might have just been embarrassed to have been seen skipping

"&gt;On top of that, male behavior has never been under the level of scrutiny that it is now and not without some good reasons.

This is true, but the worst part is that men are also punished for deviating from typical classic male behavior too, so they essentially have no where to turn, so they turn inward."

"This. Imagine saying you're tired, sorry babe, rolling over and falling asleep.

"That's actually my ideal situation, finding a guy I vibe with who is willing to introduce me to his social circle.

"I was subscribed to  a local mom group on facebook for a while.  At one point there was a pretty alright looking mailman. I mean as far as mailmen go, he was definitely the best looking one I'd ever seen (no offense mailmen) but he was a pretty average looking guy. 

Women around town started taking creepshots of him and sharing with the group where he was last seen. Then women started following him around, showing up where he was expected to be. One woman works at a local business and tells the others she's expecting a package from him, so they all show up. 

It got so bad he had to issue a public message on facebook asking them to stop or he would have to take legal action. I think he quit shortly after that because I stopped seeing him around town. "
"Not exactly 'can't stand' but more of 'you people need to relax about this.'

"I work with professional models all the time, and trust me, the answer is *fucking all of them*. Even the most beautiful women who are paid thousands of dollars a day to stand in front of a camera have the weirdest insecurities.

Frequent inappropriately sexual comments have been the norm in ever kitchen I have ever worked in. 
That's a boss move.
"I worked at a hospital, and one of the nurses snap chatted me and other coworkers a picture of me from behind and goes “hate you see you go but love to watch you leave” with my butt circled. In addition to this I would get the occasional booty slap and one time a nurse took my shirt collar and looked down to see if I had any chest hair. All harmless and I wasn’t phased by it, but it does make me wonder if the roles were reversed."

"I like stability, I need progression in my relationships, and I appriciate honesty. A girl who's off and on is likely to send mixed messages and lose out to someone with a more stable personality who is at least consistent. Too many bad conversations in the early stages of a relationship would drive me away."
"I've had my ass slapped, received plenty of comments about my ""sexy"" butt, been kissed on the cheek out of the blue, and a few other things besides, all by different older women at my office (I'm in my mid 20s, they're in their 30s and 40s)

Despite the fact that I didn't flirt / reciprocate / instigate any of these, it doesn't bother me. It's flattering, if anything. But I imagine it might be pretty terrifying for a woman if the genders were swapped"
"I'm 6'7 and my voice is usually deep, sometimes REALLY deep. I was walking home from the library and saw a girl in front  of me drop something. 

I didn't want to scream on the street at 10pm, so I jogged up to the ID, picked it up, and jogged to catch up with her. When I said excuse me, it came out a lot deeper than I intended and she must have seen my size from the corner of her eye and pretty much screamed and started running. I said ""You dropped your ID, didn't mean to scare you"" and this broad was straight up Usain Bolting it down the street. 

I just kinda stood there like wtf?? Was gonna toss it in the garbage cause I was kind of offended by her reaction but after thinking about it I just walked back to the library and gave it to the lost and found. "
Bingo. I've had girls after the fact say they're interested and listed the signs they showed me. And I've followed where I saw those signs with other girls to be told I was creepy for trying to hit on them because she was just being friendly. 
"Just let a pause in the conversation go on really long and then say ""Listen, it's been nice meeting you, I'm going to (insert polite half-lie: 'get back to my friends', etc.)""

The internet can also make those fuck ups permanent or seen by others. It also allows gossip to spread quickly and discreetly. 
"I'm gonna take you places. mountains, ski slopes, seasides, dinners, concerts... And it'll be fun as hell every time."
"When I was a teenager, I waited five years to tell a girl that I liked her. When I finnaly told her and she (obviously) said she wasn't interested, I realized how dumb the whole situation was.

They say that your body is a temple. But allow me to expand on that for a moment. It's a temple dedicated to YOU.

"Well, first off, I was really shit faced drunk, so i'll recall as best I can.

Just for reference, my country, you could get across by train in about a 3-4 hours, so 45 or even 30 minutes would be murder.

I believe this must've been either late evening, or at night, in the weekends, I jump on the train and while there are empty seating, I decide to sit across from a woman. That's mistake numero uno.

Being drunk off my ass I wanted to reassure the lady that I was not in fact some creepy drunk weirdo, so I started up a conversation, about what I cannot recall, but I know I used the phrase ""i'm not a creepy drunk weirdo"" several times (albeit in my native language).

I don't recall a lot of details but I'm fairly certain I spent upwards of 30 -45 minutes shooting the shit with this woman, near constantly reassuring her that I wasen't one of those drunk creeps talking to random women on public transport, meanwhile utterly oblivious to the fact that I was being a random creep talking to a random woman, while being utterly shitblasted."

Physicality was not that common, but I do remember that my sisters would take swings with bags etc when they were annoyed, or say very nasty things and my parents would just laugh- the other way around was faux-pas. I couldnt even defend myself.

"My dad was married just before the fall of Saigon (Vietnam). He's super traditional and the marriage was consummated - the only attempt at conception. My dad was then forced to escape Vietnam as his family held assets and were not loyal to the communist government. His wife at the time refused to flee Vietnam with him. She also refused family sponsorship once he had settled. With nearly an entire life still ahead of him, he didn't really have any choice but to bury the past.

I am 21. A few years ago, my dad spontaneously told me that I have an older half-brother in Vietnam and explained this story to me. Based on my limited knowledge of his private life, he has tried to reach out but his ex-wife refuses any contact. Had they not refused contact, I'm certain my dad would provide financial support and visit."
Boring answer...not much difference. I’m about six minutes older than my sister. Today also happens to be her birthday 😉 The only difference would appear to be that she and my mom have a closer relationship. Those six minutes made me the middle child of the family. My brother and my father have a lot in common so I ended up as the classical “middle child”
You gay? I'm not either but I can pretend for a week on the slopes.

"I've been online dating since long before you had an app on your phone to call a stranger from the internet to come drive you around.  Back in the late 90s, meeting someone ""from the internet"" basically meant you were about to become a victim of a serial killer.

Anyway.. meet a girl through Yahoo Personals, which was the Tinder/OkCupid of its day, and we decide to meet up and go out.  Bring broke and young, I figured I would take her to this cool spot I know that is on a private beach right near a big, beautiful bridge with a bottle of wine and we could sit and chill and talk.

Only thing is that to get to this beach, you need to park on the side of a road in the middle of nowhere and walk about 1/2 mile through the woods on this path before it comes out near the base of the bridge.

So, there we are... first date with a complete stranger I'd met from the internet and I'm leading her through the woods to this spot... I hadn't been there in a while, so I'm a little fuzzy on *exactly* when you get to the beach and I keep saying stuff like ""Just around this bend in the path"" and it turns out that wasn't the right bend.,, just more woods ahead.

After a couple of those, she says, jokingly, ""Look.. if you're going to kill me, just know I don't want to die a virgin."" and I replied with ""Oh don't worry.. you won't die a virgin"", which I intended to be flirty, but she told me later on that she was mentally preparing herself to be raped and murdered.

I did end up taking her virginity a few weeks later in a much less creepy manner.  Still friends on FB today, some 20 years later."

My wife is very well endowed. She says they filled in very quickly as well. As a result she has some stretch marks. She's very self conscious about the way they look.

"Once I was walking with a group of friends, about 3 of us, back from a club or something in college. I heard something behind us, so I turned and saw a girl about our age behind us. She was walking pretty quickly and probably planning to pass us. It was a very well lit area. 

In a really loud whisper, I said to my friends ""There's someone following us!"" and then decided to look back a few times in a really exaggerated way, before exclaiming ""It's a small girl! RUN!!!"" and then panic walking quickly away.

Random anecdote, but your comment reminded me. Thankfully they found it funny so I didn't just look crazy. "

People joke about Straight White Males being the default assumption and that they have no struggles etc, so other groups should be praised, but it leads to SWMs feeling expendable. They feel boring and forgettable. A blank sheet of paper. Vanilla ice-cream.  Especially in the US where they have the dominant culture, so people try to find solace in the culture of their ancestors, such as Italians, Irish, Polish etc.

People say that being a SWM is easy because they don't face any troubles of other marginalised groups, but it also means that they feel forgotten. Troubles are laughed away and it causes them to internalise problems. A mother or young woman killed is a tragedy, a single man killed is just a statistic. A black man killed by police is proof of racism, a white male killed by police is ignored.

There's also the fact that they are the ""bad guy"" for most other groups. Feminists talk about ""The Patriarchy"" and how men have an advantage and put women down, but the everyday male isn't going to see any benefit from this. There's no clear *""Press here to receive privilege""* whereas they will often hear about how good they have it, how others were persecuted in the past (and still are) and they will see many of the ""reparations"" for these past issues as very clear advantages before their eyes. Being blamed for things by others that share only the same race/gender/sexuality. The fact that prejudice against white people, straight people, and males, isn't seen as true prejudice because they are ""the oppressors"".

SWMs don't see the advantage of growing up without the threat of racism, but they do see ""affirmative action"" meaning somebody else gets a grant you are ineligible for because of your race. They don't see women treated badly for their gender, but they do see ""Women only"" clubs, or benefits given for women in certain industries (STEM for example).

Then all men (Not just SWM) hear about other issues with the gender, such as being seen as predators, having their sexuality and desires called ""toxic"" for even small things, having fewer rights to children as a father, and stories of people being falsely accused of crimes such as rape or sexual harassment. They also see claims of being victims of those same crimes laughed at, told to ""man up"" etc.

This leads to a life of nihlism and other issues people have when life feels meaningless.

**I want to clarify that I don't think being straight, white, or male is easier or harder than other groups, I just mean to say some of the problems that can be faced by having an ""easier"" life.**"
"&gt; I cringe when a guy tells me how tight some girl was, all I can think was how it's actually because she wasn't that turned on by him.


... or maybe she was actually just tight? Not all vaginas turn into gaping caverns when the girl gets aroused."
"I volunteer at a women's shelter for victims of domestic abuse and I can go ahead and tell you, most people don't do anything. They know, but they have a ""what happens in that household/between them stays in that household/between them.""

I would recommend calling the police and actually backing the abused (despite whatever route they choose to take), but that doesn't typically happen. Just keep in mind that even if you call the police the abused may play dumb or choose to not file charges. "
"Holy shit that sounds so bad. I feel bad for laughing at that.
"
"Feelings can't be controlled, but actions can."
"A pretty pebble, like a penguin. Just go up to him, look at him dead in the eyes, silently place the pebble at his feet, stand back up, and just gently push it towards him a bit more with your foot, and take 2-3 waddle-y steps back, nervously anticipating his response in silence."
"I am fully aware that I just checked the refrigerator for something to eat a couple minutes ago, found absolutely nothing, and that nothing new is likely to have materialized in it for me, but *goddammit maybe I'll see something new 
 this time*."
"Treating them like they're children, regardless of age, just because the woman in question happens to have had children of her own. 
 Usually involves taking over or micro-managing on a simple task, passive aggressive comments about how men are ""just big babies"" or ""it's so cute when they think they can _____"". I'm thinking of calling it momsplaining. 

Comparisons to other, more successful or more attractive men. Bonus points if it's to other family members.

Assumptions and then disappointment when a guy can't perform some kind of maintenance or fix, as men are somehow born with that knowledge, and not knowing makes them lesser.

It's a Scottish name for it. No idea what the etymology of it is
"Yeah, exactly. Cause it's *his* sexual affirmation you want. I see a lot of this idea that women get so much sexual attention from men that it's like this never ending well of stored confidence, and I'm not going to deny that - no problem, I could for sure get sexual affirmations from other dudes. But that's not the sexual affirmation *I want*. I want to feel wanted *by my partner*. He's the one I'm spending my life with - the other guys are irrelevant. 

And that's why rejection or neglect from your partner hurts more. Because they're the ones that are *supposed* to want you. They signed up for it volountarily. "

"I don’t talk to my ex’s and I don’t ever try to keep up or check on them even if we ended on good terms. That ship has sailed and it’s disrespectful to future partners to maintain a relationship with someone I used to be intimate with. I expect the same attitude from my partners as well and don’t do any of the “ex drama”.  If you’re friends with your ex’s then cool, but it’s not going to work. "

"We moved to a new office that had a bit of an odd kitchen layout. On the first day in the new office I was making a cup of tea and this woman who i never met before was having a mini rant at the kitchen layout and said to me ""I bet this stupid layout was designed by a MAN"". 

I actually laughed, but I wonder if the other way round to the average modern woman would have worked so well."

Hey don't tell me how to manage my bodies.
"Some background: my safe word is ""bananas."" But I used to just agree with women that any fruit would be a safe word (because of all things, you never need to say the name of a fruit during sex). Also note, I do a lot of cnc and roleplay. Anyway, this girl yelled ""tomato"" (she is fine, just wanted some water), and I am thinking to myself, ""Oh hell... is that a fruit or a vegetable?""  My dick decided I needed Google more than sex at that moment. I mean Wtf is with the mixed messages here?"
"I was meeting with a sales rep and her boss, finalizing an agreement for my office to rent some copy machines. 

Boss guy was a bit of a dick, liked insulting people. Normal ""alpha"" male behavior, so it didn't bother me. He was middle aged and for some reason I make a lot of guys like that a little insecure. I've learned not to react because it just makes things more difficult.

Anyway, he insulted my appearance, and she turned to him and, while pointing at me, said in a very serious tone of voice, ""I would climb that man like a tree."" Then she blushed.

Not gonna lie, it made my day."
you can be fit with really weak pelvic floor muscles. Those muscles don't necessarily grow stronger on their own unless she does specific kegel exercises.
"Haha, thanks. Though she probably was on the verge of punching me if I hadn't immediately let her go."
"Didn't break up with her.

She was great but I was depressed and unhappy and had fallen out of love with her.  But my dumb brain thought ""oh no, you're just being picky/sad/weird, just wait it out and it'll get good again!"".  NOOOPE!

Luckily, dragging my feet for so long before ending it actually put her in the place and time to meet her now-husband, who AFAIK she's still happily married to, so I don't feel *too* guilty about it.

Learned my lesson though!"
"Good to hear you are gone from there. Sounds like a shitty place to work at. I would never date or have sex with coworkers though. ""Don't shit where you eat"" is good advice."
Really really. My wife has been doing kegel exercises with weights and thia past weekend she Vulcan death gripped my dick and I lost all control because it was definitely a new feeling and move.

"I had known this lady at my workplace for a number of years, and always found her to be unfriendly and indifferent, sometimes bordering on rude and impatient.

One day, I was expecting her call.  The phone rang and I could see her name on the display.  I greeted her when I answered the phone (as in ""Hi Katie"").  

She got extremely angry and told me that I was being creepy for greeting her on the phone like that."
"I would say this is completely true. The more time you spend in close physical contact, i.e. fucking or snuggling the more frequent the releases of oxytocin, the chemical responsible for 'love'. "
"&gt; It may have started with “I feel miserable, but at least I made my bed and showered today”, but eventually you add more and more positives until you dig yourself out of the hole.

This is 100% how you do it. Take responsibility, try to be good, try to bring a little order to your life so that even if you aren't happy immediately, you have a few shreds of self respect to build a better life on over time.

"&gt; I read an adage somewhere that all one has to do to make a man feel stripped of his masculinity is take him out to dinner in a restaurant, ask him everything he’s planning to order, then order it for him.

--------------

Anyway, *some* women misread the sort of banter men have with friends as a general ""any insult is fine"", and that's not the case.

The point of banter is to pick on them about the things they aren't actually insecure about. The better you know them, the better you know where that line lies. I know there are things that my friend won't appreciate me poking at and I don't touch those topics with them. If you screw that up, someone winds up feeling hurt/offended/emasculated/whatever."
"Ahhhhhh, the classic ""I can poke fun at you but you better not dish it back"" routine. "

"Husband tattooed my name on the underside of his bicep. He did this without consulting me, before we were married. I love it. I told him it made us ""white trash married."" Partially because of this tattoo, I work extra hard to keep our marriage happy and loving, and work through any conflicts or problems thoroughly. I never want him to regret getting that tattoo.

So I guess it worked out for him."
What did the dad say?
"When I was in high school, my SO at the time was really into politics and was a member of a Young Democrats group. At one point there was this kinda big trip to a big gathering of democratic politicians and asked me to come along. I didn't really know much about that scene but hey, I wanted to impress the girl I liked. So I agreed.

So the day comes and *she actually bails out at the last minute.*

And here I am, in a car with the government teacher and two other kids I didn't know, going downtown to this huge event *I knew nothing about.* because I only agreed to go on the idea she would be there too. I could have bailed out too, but like I said. I wanted to impress her.

The actual event was really awkward and I didn't know who anybody was. And all these people kept swarming me and the two other kids with questions and praise for ""Young people getting involved""

.....I found a quiet corner and started doodling cartoons of all these weird fat old politicians and I was majority praised for ""taking notes."" (Which thankfully nobody checked)

In the end, SO at the time didn't care that I went and was even less interested in hearing about it, so it was all kinda for nothing "
"I think this is pretty cute, I hope you at least enjoyed being a pen pal just a little bit! "
"Yeah I want to know as well. What happened to the crush girl? What happened afterwards? 

I have many questions."
Women with kids in my experience don't really get invested in a whole lot besides their kids. You can try to date them or be their friend but you're always pretty low on their priority list.
"~~One of~~ The biggest regret in my 35 years being alive is the last time I talked to my god brother. He helped raise me, I spent countless hours with him growing up. Once I was in my 20s I drifted apart from him. I was busy you know, had a gf who had two kids I was helping raise, I had a demanding job that took up a lot of my time. He called me just to chat, but I was too busy. The conversation was only 2 minutes and I was distracted most of the time. I ended it saying I had to go real quick, think I was cooking or some boring dumb shit. Just said ""got to go man, hit me up"" and hung up.

I never spoke to him again. He killed himself the next week. 

I always tell my friends I love them, and we hug it out. Always. 

Fuck, just typing this made me fucking cry again. Had to go to the bathroom at work to cry.

Never hold back, tell them what they mean to you. You never know when it'll be the last time."
My friend gave up a full ride to go to the local University and stay with his high school girlfriend that then left him to move to California. 
"I was about to go on a date with a girl that I had met on tinder and decided to stop and get a coffee and a little bite to eat before I went and met her at the restaurant. She texts me and goes, ""How do you know where I live?"" this took me completely off guard and I was confused. Turns out the coffee shop was outside her apartment and that she noticed through snap chats friends locator that I was right outside. 

Safe to say we didn't make it to the date...
"
"In middle School I had a crush on some girl. I never talked to her because I was ridiculously shy. I frequently spotted her in the hallway between classes, just by chance because our classes were regularly near each other.  

one day I was leaving school and walking to my bus and she was walking a few feet in front of me, I have noticed for whatever reason, but it was a pretty dense crowd of kids. Suddenly she stops dead in her tracks and turns around and sternly says ""could you stop?"" I was extremely confused because I was a super shy kid with his crush surprising me and talking to me, obviously upset with me, and I had no idea what she was talking about. I just manage a ""what?"" While probably looking like a deer ok headlights. She snaps back with ""stop following me all the time!"" I very honestly tell her ""I'm just going to my bus..."" And immediately walk past her, feeling like a wreck.  

I guess she noticed we were always crossing paths in the halls and assumed I was following her on purpose.  
I was devastated, so I did the only thing that made sense to me: avoid her completely. I did that for the rest of the year and actively avoided any girls I liked for a few years after that."
"Support them.  Tell them they're your parents and you're their son and nothing will change that.  

Divorce is a *good thing*.  People in happy marriages don't get divorced.  "
"No. Being honest and not leading them on when you're not into them is far less cruel. They'll feel bad about being rejected but move on after a few days to a week, getting used and finding out the person you're with is only with you because they are too much of a coward to say how they feel would really hurt.

The gay agenda

"Gotta pick your battles, next thing ya know he starts getting shitty shifts and she’s over critical of his work because his quick wit made the kitchen laugh at her... and that’s why she should stfu!"
"Personally I find that the biggest variance comes from position and angle rather than any inherent tightness.

Guys, try a prone bone with your lady friend, but stick a couple of pillows under her hips so she is angled up at you. Should feel great for both of you, especially taller guys where normal sex is just cramping and pain!"

My PC I guess. It was around $1500 and has earned me way more than that through my work.

"I used to work for a small construction company a few years ago which each year did a secret Santa for anyone who would like to take part.  The company was split in two - the construction side all male and the design/sales all female. There was great morale about the company and most people would socialise outside of work from time to time. 

The secret Santa presents were to be handed out at the Xmas party and opened in front of the party.  The whole company was attending - including those who would bring their spouses.  

One of the design team bought the company owner (female) a vibrator which she opened in front of the whole company.  Her reaction was one of bemusement however she was clearly mortified inside. 

The girl that was responsible for the purchase confessed reasonably quickly and it was laughed off however all the male construction side thought that it would have been a very different story had it come from one of them. 

Later on once everyone had eaten and enjoyed a few drinks the girl who bought the gift decided it would be funny to go around the party dunking the vibrator in people’s drinks... This did not go down well however there was no reprimand handed down.

"Sadly not yet, was 19 at the time. I tend to get tunnel vision when dealing with my goals. Buuuuut I ended up meeting a wonderful woman, proposed. Got married, and we are both busting ass to pay off the rest of her student loans. (She is 26.) I am 22 now, so it's not like it's too late.

The closest I've ever gotten was completing all the steps to get in, but when it came to setting up a schedule and getting back in contact with the advisor, I just told them this would have to wait. We had a nice chunk of bills to pay for the wedding, and this year we hope to handle all preceding debt. Hands down, this is a better life than I could've hoped for at 22. We both have nice jobs that pay decent. A nice 2 bedroom place, and retirement funds set up. 

On the other hand, my ex got married to a soldier (respect) a week after I proposed to my wife. But later said it was so she would get his G.I. Bills if he were to die in battle. She lives in a trailer, and still has no drive."

I do not want a ""race to the bottom"" where we tattle on every slightly inappropriate joke or bad sense or humor a female coworker displays in the same way many (not all) women run to HR when a man does that. I'd prefer it if men were able to make those same kind of jokes without getting in trouble. "
Obviously not getting turned on. Whoopsie daisies
"It's usually a gradual thing. It starts with stares that linger a bit too much, half joking remarks, and long hugs. Things you could brush aside as awkwardness or innocent flirting . As you get older the short stares turn into something long and uncomfortable, the remarks turn crude and the overall tone of things makes you feel humiliated. That's why it's usually hard to pinpoint when was the first harassment. 

I remember walking down the street one night at 17 and a person yelled at me from a taxi window that he would rape me. At the time I thought he must be joking and laughed. "

I had a pretty good relationship with my dad. I was basically his clone with how much I resembled him. He died this morning.
"This question popped in my head when I thought about this time my past girlfriend and I were having sex on my shitty mattress on the floor. (I couldn't afford a bedframe) I was charging my phone at the time and the outlet is crammed between the head of the mattress and the wall. 

So after 5 minutes, we changed positions to me on top and I started to thrust really hard that the mattress was shifting quite a bit. Now, I started to hear that ""bleep"" or ""badoop"" noise when you plug your phone into a charger. So every thrust, the mattress would shift and turn the charger off and on.

We both stop because I'm laughing really hard. I looked directly at her and I say, ""I feel like Mario hitting those coin blocks"" she looked at my slightly confused. So I start thrusting again when we are both quiet and we both start laughing uncontrollably.

"
That's crazy.  I mean on the surface it seems innocent enough. But the more you think about it the more creepy it sounds.

"Not a co-worker, per se, but works in the coffee shop at my workplace, is subject to the same conduct standards. She regularly refers to me and other men, as ""sweety"", ""honey"", ""handsome"", etc.

"Well, woman might be taught more self worth, but they are also taught since since they are kids that this worth is based on how they look. 

I have a lot of relatives that would scold me and my sister because we were not put toguether, that a woman's job is to take care of herself and look as pretty as she can, that we wouldn't find a husband otherwise (as if that was the only goal that mattered) .

So I guess the education for both genders has still a long way to go."
