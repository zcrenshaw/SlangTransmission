break down and cry infront of everyone
I wouldn't be surprised if it correlates with high rates of obesity.
"1) that mindset, the idea of ""them or me"" is toxic as hell and will bite you in the ass.

2) you made a commitment to that dog and you should live up to it. the girlfriend you're still deciding on."
Anyone making you choose between things like this in initial stages of a relationship/getting back together isn’t worth your time or energy. Keep the dog if it’s making you happy.
"Honestly,it wouldn't matter what she was cooking, just the fact that she cared enough about me to cook for me would be good enough for me to feel special!"
"You have a few options:

1) ""NO. You stay here. I'll get it.""

2) ""Gimme your card. What's the PIN?""

3) Just stack your stuff on the conveyor. Stand there like an idiot until your mother returns. Let her do the apologising."
"My ex didn't let me see my daughter for a long time. My GF and I were talking about her one night, and I just broke. She pulled my head down onto her lap, stroked my hair and just let me cry it out.

It was the first time in my adult life that anyone had ever made me feel like it was ok to cry, and that I didn't have to be tough all the time"
"In short: Focus on yourself, your heath, your schooling, your self-improvement. The grief is real, but it will evaporate over time. Trust me.

You are very, very young and, if I can say so, too young to be getting married. I know everyone has different views on this, but your brain isn't even fully formed. At 36, I am completely different human than I was at 21. You have a metric shit ton of growing to do. In time, you will likely look back on this as a blessing in disguise. Mourn, and then embrace your freedom."
I used to date a girl that would snuggle up to me at night and couldn't stop fidgeting until i cuddled her. Then she would smile and quickly fall asleep. It was heartwarming.
"I read a story on Reddit once of some super successful guy who broke a 200k$+ piece of equipment. His boss called him into his office and he profusely apologized and asked if he was going to be fired. His boss replied ""fuck no, I just spent a LOT of money teaching you a valuable lesson. I can't afford to let you go now.""


Own it. Sincerely apologize once. Grow and learn from the experience."
"Every day she doesn't work she comes to my work for lunch and we go for a walk hand in hand.

It's nice."
Stress fart
"A steaming pot of self-sufficiency, mental-stability, and high libido. "
"Being able to talk straightforward.
Not just for girls that are acting ""hard to get"" but just in general the ones that try to talk around the actual subject.

Either tell me what you actually want to tell me, or just don't.
If you can, I respect and value you a lot more than those who don't. "
Without reading anything I would guess our progressively sedentary lifestyle isn't helping.
"I'm not an overly insecure person but I think I'd rather be left for a woman than another dude

If she leaves me for a woman so be it. I can't compete with that. If she left me for a man it would be harder not to wonder in what ways he was better than me.

"
My tapeworm said this to me once
"My now wife once said while we were dating that ""You feel like home""."
My GF and I were at the Las Vegas Route 91 festival shooting and she swears I saved her life even though to me I feel like I had 1 job and that was to get us out safe. I remember just taking over and being her guardian that night thinking one of us would for sure get shot and die. When we were finally safe we looked at eachother off and on and we just had these special moments where in our head we kept saying I love you. Very strange I know but it is hard to describe. 
It 100 percent does. Obesity causes the body to convert testosterone into estrogen.
"This, dump the one that gives you ultimatums and keep the one that loves you unconditionally."
"Wife and I started dating in high school (16). Moved in together and engaged when i was 20. Married at 23 Bought first house at 24. Expecting first child just before 28. 

All the motions just felt right. We grew from teenagers into young adults into actual adults together. No relationship is easy mode all the time, takes work etc. But we always work together for each other, never against. Compromise is key. She's allowed me space throughout the entire relationship to pursue anything I want too, And I the same for her.  

In short, it's going great. Love her dearly and lucky to have found her early."
"Nah man, I kept that shit on lockdown. I didn't trust my dad making a damn fool of me."
"When my wife says I'm a good father. My dad walked out on my two sisters and I when I was only two years old, so I'm trying my hardest to be the best father I can be. "
"When I saw her insides on a steel plate during the c-section of our first child (smart enough not to look on child#2). At that moment, I knew she was a stronger person than I. "
"Generally when someone says that, there might still be lingering feelings of that crush left. So if someone were to tell me that, and we were both single, then LET'S. GET. IT. ON."
"Just talks to me like she gives a shit.

I'm not after anything huge. It's big enough to know she's on my side."
"Nighttime scuba diving. There’s a point on most night dives where you get far away enough from the boat that you can no longer see the light that they hang underneath it. At that point it feels like whole universe is just the two of you, and whatever you illuminate with your dive lights. "
I work as a chef. Anything cooked for me that isn't fish I'll eat. And enjoy it. It's nice to not have to cook food myself. 
"One time a lady in a store in an airport told me I had beautiful eyes. It was in the middle of a bad trip home from a holiday (I got food poisoning, not fun on a plane). It is the only time in my life I've ever received a compliment from a stranger and I couldn't believe how amazing it made me feel."
Ask her to leave the card with you
"&gt;The decline in testosterone levels is almost certainly linked to higher rates of obesity 

&gt;Young men are far less likely to hold jobs in manual labor, so they don’t have to be as physically strong as previous generations.

There's your answer. Everything else in the article is just conjecture or probably only has a minor effect.

The western World is suffering a health crisis and this is just one of the effects."
I have a pull-up bar at home. Sometimes she makes me do pull-ups completely naked and she just watches and giggles. 
"If she's giving ultimatums like that, do you want to get back together? I get how she feels because I'm also a drama queen sometimes, but at the end of the day you probably didn't adopt it to spite her, but rather fill the void she left. Now you have a puppy you love and it would be cruel of her to ask you to rehome him (serious sadness for the puppy) just because she thinks you adopted him out of spite now. You have a puppy now, she can take it or leave it."
"Self accountability. I don't care what race she is, how attractive, how smart, how rich or poor, etc etc. All I ask is that they admit their own faults and don't deflect blame to everyone else but themselves. It's a surprisingly rare quality. "
"A few years ago, before I proposed to my wife, we were on a date. We had gone to dinner and seen a movie. It was cold out and we were in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. That saturday night we decided to take a walk in a place called Market Street. We got our coffees and just walked. It was decorated for Christmas and lights were on, but for some reason no on was out there. We were all alone. As we walked, we talked about the possibilities of our future together, if we wanted children, where we wanted to live. It was a very sincere and intimate moment that was magnified by the presence of no one else. We discovered that we had the same plans for each other. Career, marriage, children, life. Everything was just right. So the next year I took her to the spot where we first met and I proposed. "
"It's only been 4 months but I just received the first ""I miss you!"" text from her. My heart melted. Otherwise she'll sometimes wrap her arm around me while we're walking or grab my hand and guide me onto the dance floor with her. She's my first girlfriend and I love her very much"
I strongly respect women who are genuine and and straightforward. It’s nice when you don’t have to worry about being deceived with games.
"You take ownership of your mistake, learn how to not do it again, and become the topic of the July safety meeting every year for the next 15 years. "
"If she makes a mean lasagna, it's game ovaries my dude."
ITT: no meal recommendations whatsoever. 
I respect people that say what they mean and mean what they say. Any coyness or playing of head games is going to lose my respect very quickly.
A friend my group pulled me aside and said I’m a really genuine person and that she appreciates me. 
Let people pass you. 
"Been together 23 years. We lived together for the first six then got married. I wish everybody had the chance to know what deep, long term love feels like. I still look at her like I did way back then. We’re a good match and time is flying by"
"Everybody used to have mustaches. The T power was always in the mustache. After the 80's, all the cops, construction workers, and factory workers shaved off their majestic mustaches and the seismic shift in power cursed the male testicle. Nowadays it's man buns and lattes. If we all grow beautiful, thick horseshoe mustaches, it will be like the Spirit Bomb, all men bringing their energy together to right the wrongs of nature."
We’re still a virgin at 22 sorry mate.
"Abandon the cart and food, abandon your mom and seek out a new life with a new family."
"Puppy, that dog will love you until the end of time and will be your best friend.  

What does she have against the dog? Is she deathly allergic to dogs? Did she get attacked when she was young?  Or does she just not want to take care of it? 

You can tell a lot about a person with how they view and treat animals."
You are complex without being complicated.
"Certain moments of cuddling.

Trying to articulate the true depth of our feelings for each other, with lots of non-sexual touch at the same time.

Talking about her depth-psychological fears and needs and the why and how.

Talking about mine."
"Are you fucking kidding? Adopting a puppy is not something you get to just decide to undo. You've adopted that puppy, it is yours for the next 8+ years of its life until it dies. "
The absolute size of these good vibes
"My wife has stood by me for decades now, but I think the biggest things have always been her supporting my career.

When I wanted to study and work abroad? Go for it. 

When I wanted to take my time finding a GOOD job after grad school, so we ate lean for a few months? Go for it. 

When I wanted to move to the Bay Area to take a better role? Go for it. 

She’s always supported me in my career, and I’ve done the same for her (we moved twice for her career as well). 

Also she likes to just curl up together and veg out to One Piece or something silly after putting the kids to sleep. Love it. "
while assuming the fetal position. Obviously. 
"Beautiful, but *fucking terrifying*. "
"I fat-fingered a command and brought down a piece of nationally critical infrastructure for six or seven hours. I believe that resulted in my employer paying a five or six figure penalty.  Not my best day.

Edit: I have another one that is even worse. My brother went to law school with a girl. Let's call her Jen. After graduation, Jen got a job with a company that manages horse tracks and horse races. On her first day on the job, she scratched the wrong horse from a race. (Scratching, for you non-gamblers, means that the horse has dropped out and will not be racing that day. No one is allowed to bet on a scratched horse.). The horse that Jen mistakenly scratched won. This triggered an FBI investigation of her company. Did I mention this was her first day on the job?"
"Uniqueness.  Before I started dating my current girlfriend, everyone told me she was weird.   Didn’t discourage me from trying.  Apparently, her parents split up when she was young.  Her dad had custody of her.  He ran some big construction company and took her with him to work.  Let’s just say there is nothing around my house that she doesn’t know how to fix.  Even electronics.  

Most recent example, my car battery died at work, and I didn’t have jumper cables.   She drives her car to the parking lot.  Immediately takes control of attempting to start my car.  I’m just standing there like a little helpless child.  She connects her car battery to mine.  It doesn’t work.   So, she walks across the street to a gas station, gets a coke, and pours it on my battery.  Ten minutes later, my car starts,  I never felt more emasculated in my life.  Yet, I also never felt happier.  I was dating this badass who just fixed my car.  

Edit: changed “little helpless girl” to “little helpless child.” "
I'd question her taste in men. 
How she treats other people.
No I never told my parents anything like that. Even as a college student now I don’t discuss my dating life with parents 
Pupper loves you no matter what. 
"There’s a good chance we really aren’t listening.

Let’s be honest I understood the point of your story after the second sentence, but I’ll politely nod and smile whether I care or not."
"Crying in front of her, for any reason. "
"Been there, done that.

For me it was 7 years though.

Shit was tough. After that we became good friends and I started dating one of her friends. We've been together now for 6 years and I've never been happier. 

In the end all is well. 10/10 would get dumped again. 

Edit: if you wanna talk you can pm me."
So does that mean Obese men are dragging the average T level down while the rest of us are relatively unaffected? Or are they just MORE affected than the rest of us?
"Dating is the least of your worries.

Learn from this relationship, and grow. Go get a gym membership today and begin working on that 'fat and out of shape' part of yourself. Worry less about women and more about yourself.  You're 21, get in shape, take care of yourself and enjoy your early 20's. "
"She has trouble sleeping due to anxiety, she will be very fidgety and breath quickly, but as soon as I put all my weight on her she wraps her arms around me, let's out a sigh of relief and her breathing returns to normal. "
Holds me close and says “mine” in a cute voice. 
They leave hair everywhere. I found hair on my nutsack and it was hers. 
"Why did I enter this thread? Fuck, I'm lonely."
"sleep with girls in your dorm, fuck the advice you get from youtubers, SLEEP WITH THE GIRLS IN YOUR DORM YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE FRIENDS WITH THEM ANYWAY, RUNNING IN TO THEM IS GOING TO BE AWKWARD ANYWAY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE WITH THREE OF THEM YOU FUCKING PUSSY.

and then i would tell myself their names and that they liked me because i treated them like i treat everyone else and they were horny"
"I've been complimented for being hard-working, successful, smart, and things like that. It's always nice, but I don't consider those things praise-worthy, because I didn't do a whole lot to deserve them. It's who I am. I am not ugly, but also not attractive. As a guy, I've been used my whole life to not receiving any compliments about my looks or anything physical. Put all this together, and I used to think that I'm above compliments. They really don't matter much.

That's until the other day, when my wife asked me to open a jar. It was a particularly hard one, and I was shirtless. So I put all my strength into it, making my muscles pop out. I opened the jar and she said ""wow... that was kinda hot...""

The only real compliment I ever got for anything physical, so rare at a rate of 1 in 50 years, that I will always remember it."
"Stalling medical issues. Pretty much every guy I know needs to be on death's door before they'll see a doctor, myself included, and we have socialised healthcare."
"Oh man, my wife made me look over during her c\-section.

Her organs sat in a bowl next to her... they were pulling out our younger son, and he just looked so fucking angry about the whole thing."
"Hit on women, you're hot. "
"I would expect diets that are increasingly unhealthy have something to do with it. The average BMI of an adult male has increased spectacularly over the same time period, as has the obesity rate. Being overweight and overfat isn't good for your testosterone. "
"""You're aiming way too low with the tongue. The fun part's near the top."""
Being honest with her about something I didn’t want her to know. Knowing she knew my darkest secret made me feel closer to her than I ever did before. 
"If I'm chilling with someone I watch how they interact with other people. If they're nice to random peeps my respect for them goes up, if they're rude it goes down. "
I was there too! So glad you guys made it out. Hope the last 8 months have been kind to you both. 
"You used the term ""cishet"" in a post asking why people think you're gay? That's brilliant."
Is that hentai? Not on my Christian subreddit. 
"Her initiating physical intimacy, whether sexual or non-sexual.

Her putting in effort to look her best for me.

Compliments and non-verbal attention.

Those quirky little things she does when she acts like I'm catnip to her.
"
"I did. Once. Never made that mistake again.

Shudder."
"If we're talking about romantic desire as opposed to sexual, then that's pretty top notch wifing right there. Lucky guy!"
"Grab my butt.

It's a minor thing, but I really appreciate it! :)"
"Holy crap. 

I've never had that. Hell, I've never even *heard* of any man I know having that.

That's amazing."
some old guy at the racetrack said he liked my car.
"So, two days ago,  my 4 month old was sick and having stomach issues, which was making him wake up screaming constantly. My wife has been having trouble sleeping and of course this was the night she was able to fall asleep. So I went downstairs and my night/ morning consisted of alternating 30ish minutes of sleep with 30ish minutes of comforting and cleaning up sick baby. At some point I stopped being fully awake or fully asleep ay any point and I  remember it in a haze. My wife comes down at 6am wondering where I am, to find me and the baby,  mostly asleep on the couch,  while rubbing his belly and making comforting sounds. 

I wake up to her sobbing and when she's coherent enough to sorta speak she says ""you have no right being this good of a dad after what you went through"" and hugs me. Luckily i knew what she meant and my chest still puffs with pride over that one (my dad died when i was 14 and a mother with undiagnosed schizophrenia eventually leading up to early onset Alzheimer's. She was nuts. Three days after my father died, Instead of having a rational conversation, Mom kicked me out to ""teach me a lesson and force me to come crawling back to live under her rules instead of my father's"". I never went back and that led to a whole slew of horrible experiences). "
"I usually do the cooking when I’m dating someone, so anything she made would be fine by me. Good southern comfort foods are always a win. "
She'll probably keep pushing it till you say 'yes it's because you're fat' and then she'll try and make you look like a dick for saying that and conveniently forget all the other reasons you gave. Just shut the conversation down because there's no way it ends well 
when you’re hitting it from the back give that clit some love with one of your hands. 
This. My girl can do this and I often take it for granted. Then I have a conversation with her sister and I can't wait for it to end because it's all just circuitous bullshit or doublespeak.
"If you were forcefully taken out of a warm, dark, cradled place that let you sleep, and be fed all the time, and pulled into a world with way too much light and impending responsibilities, would you be happy?

This is why babies cry and/or look so pissed off when they’re born because fuckkkk this man."
"C’mon man, why you gotta ruin it for everybody? 
I was having fun blaming the government and gay frogs for this."
"Yeah, they tell you not to look over the curtain, but it's too damned tempting. "
"The same reaction I've always had when someone says this, no matter when I met them: ""Oh. You should have said something"""
"Thank you for the advice. If I'm being completely honest, the relationship moved too fast due to our immaturity and naivety. We were both 19,and had both just gotten out of absolutely awful relationships. Both of us had been abused physically, mentally, emotionally, and we were just two broken people who found solace in each other. We fell hard and fast, said ""I love you"" after two weeks, and were engaged within 3 months. I've spent the last 77 weeks preparing for her to get home (MMI is only a 66 week program.), and she wasn't even in town for 24 hours before she told me she'd accepted a job in Florida, was leaving, and I wasn't part of the plan. I just feel hurt, and used. Like I was just an emotional and financial crutch while she was in AZ, and now she doesn't need me anymore. Like I served my purpose. 

I'm sorry if I'm rambling. I'm definitely going to be taking lots of advice from this thread. Going to the gym, finishing school, eating healthier, focusing on myself, etc. I know life is full of meeting and partings. I know people come and go like changing seasons, but fuck man. This hurts. Bad. "
"From his OP, she doesn't like the puppy because she feels he adopted it ""out of spite"" when they broke up.

Dumbest reason I have ever heard. "
Poor diet and lack of exercise.
"That's really silly, funny and cute at the same time. "
"My relationship stayed very easy the whole way through. We only broke up (very amicably) after nine years because our long-term plans no longer aligned and no compromise was possible. It was very sad, but I don't regret a single day. 

My current relationship feels equally easy. This experience is a great sign that you are with the right kind of person. Some people thrive on challenges and and are obsessed with ""working through"" things, but this is what I need.

Not sure that this is what you had in mind, though."
Thanks for being a good person u/dickboard
"I have 'off' periods where I grow distant, need my own space and just don't really feel like talking to you or anyone else, really. It doesn't mean I've lost interest in you, either - it's just that sometimes having my shield emotional invulnerability down for so long in the presence of you drains me.

That is a 100% on me and is ridiculous, but I know that in the context of a relationship, this bizarre hot and cold behaviour is maddening enough to want you to walk away and I wouldn't blame you. "
Refusing to show emotion in fear of looking weak. 
Initiates sex often and eagerly.
I work in stock trading. Mishandled a trade which cost about $36k. Kind of a perfect storm of events... basically just admit your mistake and learn from it. Things happen. 
"Births and deaths. The births of our children. that was months of emotional intimacy between us as we worked together on our family.

"Correlate does not mean it is the only factor,  they are just saying it definitely is one of the factors"
"If you tell us a problem, we are going to try to solve it. "
A nice bowl of not being in a rush to get married and/or have kids can also be nice
"Admitting your error and genuinely apologizing like a grown up really goes a LONG way. You may have to work your butt off to help fix it, but people will respect you more in the end.



...unless you keep making the exact same error over and over. Treat all of them, big or small, as a learning experience so you don't have that problem."

This thread makes me feel so much better about my break up.
It's almost worse to be in a relationship and not associate with anything being posted here. 
"I have to wonder what she saw in me. I’m the most average person and for some reason she actually likes being with me. Others have questioned it as well, like “how the hell did he land her of all people?”"
"The upper body strength of ""the average person"" would be significantly lower than the ""the average man"", as a slim majority of people are women. 

And ""the average man"" should still be weaker than "" the average man in his prime"" as you include elderly and disabled men in there. Depending on your definition of ""man"", you might include children as well.

This is why we have the phrase ""lies, damned lies, and statistics""."
I read it as “talks to me when she takes a shit” and I was pretty confused for a second
"My mom asks my dad to open all her jars and anything hard not because she can’t open it, but because she gets to say my big strong man every time and every time he gets a goofy happy look. It’s been 22 years and it’s the same thing. "
"The exact worst case scenario. She told everyone who would listen and another 150+ people who didn't want to listen but don't know how to shut her up once she gets going. By the next day the entire school knew and made my life a living hell until some other poor unfortunate soul made a small error and became the new school laughingstock.

Elementary school students may have short attention spans, but I have never forgotten."
"Can't believe nobody's said this yet:

**DON'T STICK YOUR DICK IN CRAZY.**

Also - After you come, instead of immediately rolling over,  hold her and cuddle for as long as you think she needs it. Then keep doing it for at least another 5 minutes. "
They never want to choose the place to eat but they will provide judgment on your choice. 
"I just experienced this with my girlfriend this past weekend and it was eye-opening since I've never really had someone who is unafraid to admit to their faults. I did something stupid which affected her (unintentionally), she was a bit rude to me for a day but then she apologised to me for being short and felt really bad about it, saying it was unnecessary and unfair to me. She promised she'd work on her attitude in the future.

10/10, would recommend dating women like this."
"Her: ""Just so you know, I had a crush on you in high school""

Me: ""The fuck is wrong with you, woman?"""
"Haha, last jokes on you dad. I became so anxious about talking to girls that I haven't had the courage to ever ask a girl out and your lineage ends with me."
"In the early days of working in a lab I delivered a ""96 well-block"" (a brick containing samples from 96 different mice in a drug study) to a scientist. It was frozen.

The scientist wasn't around so I put it at their spot. I left it upside down.  When it melted all the samples melted and ran out onto the bench.

You'd think ""96 drops of mouse blood? NBD, right?""

No. BFD. These were samples late in multi-month study, and after my cock up they had to start the whole thing over again. 

New mice, new lots of the drug they were testing. More months of work from a team of employees across 3 different companies.  100k maybe, at least.

All the rework done on my company's dime.  I think I should have been fired, but they were very cool about it.  I ended up working that job for 7 years.

I think it helped that I owned the mistake.  I personally wrote an email apologizing to all parties, and put myself in front of the issue. 

Taking responsibility is is exactly that. Maybe people get mad, but they no longer have to carry the burden of fault.  They like that, and they may just appreciate you for it."
"Constant barrage of other dudes hitting on her, often right in front of me.

Insecurity that she could *easily* leave and do objectively better than me."
Has testosterone been decreasing all over the world or just in the US and other high obesity countries?

"After finding out my then girlfriend was cheating on me i was obviously very bummed out. A couple weeks into the self deprecating process a female friend of mine dropped maybe the weirdest (this was in public, we're just friends) compliment I've ever received. ""You're hot, you got a big dick, you're nice, you'll do just fine without her"". That was probably the day my feelings about that situation turned from horrible despair to a light in the tunnel. "

"So I was working in a hospital surrounder by nurses and all women staff. I was the only guy there, and the youngest person in the whole hospital. Some coworkers (specially from the night shift) were really nice to me, and there was this one woman, in her early to mid 30s (let's call her Penny), who was like really, REALLY friendly. She was married with a son, so she was not hitting on me (I was 20 BTW). She was always going on about how handsome and smart and nice and hot I was.

Admitedly, I am a bit odd. I don't like to go out, partying and all that, I'm more of a book or movie at home guy. These people had the idea that guys of my age only think about sex and parties and alcohol, and I have drank like half a beer in my life, so they were like ""What are you"" (in a good way).

Anyway, one night I was working in a different floor than Penny. We had just gotter the next month's shifts, I was, again, in the night shift, and Penny had mornings. I'm in the nurses station, and the phone rings, I pick up and it's Penny. She asks me if I can switch shifts with her, because her baby boy was like 6 months and night shift allowed her husband to take care of him by night and she could do that during the day. Night shift was awesome, the pay was better, the coworkers were younger and friendlier and there was less work, but I didn't have a good reason like her to want night shift, so I say ""yeah, sure"". She tells me ""come here right now"".

I go to her floor and she just gives me the biggest hug and starts going on a rant about how generous I am, how I am the best coworker and the best friend ever and I will be the best boyfriend and the best husband and the best father ever. I was dumbfounded, it was not that big of a deal to me, but she went on for like five minutes, while all the other girls laughed.

I guess it's because, even though it was not a big deal to me, she was complimenting me on something I had done (although she complimented every single thing she could about me, the being generous was the main theme) for her."

"The way she looks at me. She’s not exactly a romantic, and I’m usually the one doing all the corny, “cringey”romance stuff, but the way she can use her eyes, especially in a situation where it’d be entirely inappropriate if someone was watching our gaze, to make me know I’m the one person that matters.

I’m also a writer, and use words to convey literally everything. She doesn’t need words in times like that, I’m kind of in awe of it. "
"So, this may not be the exact answer but the second time my SO and I hung out I invited him over and I was going to cook food.

I made double stuffed fried pork chop with all the fixing. I just love cooking and I thought it’d be a nice gesture. 

this was in August, a couple weeks ago, he told me that’s when he knew I was more serious about this than all the other ladies on tinder. 

At first I took offense to it like “wow I had to do something domestic to make you think I was serious” but he told me it was because 1) I had listened to what his fav food was that first time and basically killed it when I made it 2) I actually put forth effort into something  3) I did it without a second thought. 

I love cooking and that’s when he figured out I’m like Boyle from 99. "
"I took a theater class like 2-3yrs ago. And there was this one girl who i would talk to after class. As in like i would walk her to her car. No real reason I’m just friendly and talkative dude. She was super cute though (not that that’s relevant). So one day the teacher holds me back after class for like 10min to talk to me about one of my monologue performances. I see everyone left so I’m kinda bummed I wouldn’t get to talk to the girl. Lord n behold she waited outside for me. I was legitimately shocked and asked her why, she said something like “you’re interesting and i like talking to you”

As someone who regularly gets told they’re really talkative and annoying; it was great to actually meet someone who appreciated conversing. "

"I always thought this too! I’m a female, and so I worried it would come off condescending or sketchy. But one time when I was like 15 I walked up to this girl in the mall and told her I loved her makeup (it was an avant-garde look before Instagram made those more common), and her whole face lit up. She worked at one of the cosmetic counters in Macy’s, and I started visiting her every time I went into the mall. We just chatted, and she always looked beautiful. After talking with her I started giving people little compliments every time something came to mind, even if it was something like “I really love your nail polish color”, they always seemed to appreciate it. One day I was coming home from a really long day and I went into Target to grab some random thing, and at the checkout counter this woman was ringing me up. She stopped me right before I left and said “Don’t think this is weird, but I really love your smile!” and I damn near almost cried. It made me week. Honestly, if you notice something, compliment it. I never realized how much it stays with people, but it can really change their whole day or week."

"Only tangentially grooming, but wash your sheets, towels and curtains, ya filthy animals. Sheets weekly, towels twice-weekly, curtains every 6 months or so. If you can throw your couch cushion covers in the machine, try doing that once a year and giving the frame a vacuum. Spring for a steam cleaner for the carpet every year.

There's no point in having clean clothes if the textiles you lie on or in smell jank. Unclean sheets and pillow cases can exacerbate skin issues, curtains can trap dust and allergens (and if near a window facing a main road, environmental pollutants), and the fucken sheilas will gag for a man who doesn't sleep on a bare mattress protector. 

Also, nobody is getting clean in a dirty, mildewy shower using a dirty, mildewy towel. Especially if you're in a draughty bathroom where the filthy, mildewy shower curtain keeps blowing against you and clinging to you in the shower. Keep them clean with bleach (1 x month) and mildly abrasive cream cleanser (1 x month) and wash the curtain, you degenerate. "

"This happened to me at my 10 year reunion. A girl I went out with a couple times told me how she was surprised I asked her out at all when so many girls were after me. I had no clue what she was talking about, but she listed off 8 or 9 names of girls that she knew has crushes on me at that time. I was popular enough, but I just figured it was because I played sports and tried to be friendly. Turns out that a lot of the drama girls liked me (she was in all the plays/musicals in school) and they gave her shit because they were jealous of her.

4. She routinely calls me on her lunch break to tell me she loves me and misses me.

"My girl-friend (not girlfriend) invited me out to an late night event with her, and her sister. 

I was desperate for sex and she said “Just come hangout with us. trust me. And play your cards right” we’d already made out and messed around (not sex) before so I took it as a hint.

We go to the event and hangout having fun. The friend dropped hints like crazy when the sister wasn’t looking. After awhile of the event we drive back.

On the drive back we split ways in a parking lot. The friend takes her sisters car because the sister couldn’t drive, she forgot her license and felt bad for driving without one. My friend was mad that her sister couldn’t drive but in the end went with it. So I take her sister back.

The fucking sister starts making out with me HARD as soon as my friend drove away. I’m confused, was this what my friend meant by “play your cards right?”.

The sister tells me to drive to the beach. Now. 

I’m still in a bit of shock but go with the flow. Car parked. Lights off. Heavy breathing. I’m in over drive mode, I take my seat belt off and jump on top of her. Lean her seat back, and let things unfold naturally. 

My friend found out. She was not happy.

"Not a man but figured I’d share. Mine was probably the moment after I told my boyfriend I had just been sexually assaulted. We had broken up for about 4 months and planned on getting back together. I drove to Gainesville to tell him (as I wanted to in person). 

After I told him (and after many tears) we showered together and he held me close to him for a very long time. It was our first time “touching” each other since we broke up, and the heavy weight of emotions that I had kept inside for the prior week were finally lifted and I felt safe and that he would take care of me. 

He was so gentle with everything that night, to removing my shoes, to drying me off, pulling the covers over me, fixing me dinner, holding me as we silently cried together...idk. It was a “had to be there” type thing as it probably dosnt sound too intimate but it was. "
"I don't see any other alternative, to be honest. "
"There are a couple that come to mind. We were watching a really stupid chick flick and I was just barely tolerating it when I look over at her and she's on the edge of her seat gazing up at the screen with a stupid grin on her face. I couldn't help but smile cause she looked so beautiful and she caught me looking at her and she got a little shy about it and just collapsed to cuddling position with me. Other times were when we fell asleep together either watching a movie or just to take a nap. As soon as she woke up she'd turn to face me and kiss me. In those moments it was like we were just melded together and we loved being where we were. I never felt more wanted, loved and accepted than in those moments. 

These are memories that I had buried a long time ago and exposure to a bunch of stress force them out. I wound up spending 3 days in a mental hospital because of a broken heart.  Anyways after I remembered these moments I realized that it was these moments that I had been looking for in relationships ever since, but it was never the same. No one else ever felt right and there was always a little resistance in me whenever other girls tried to show me the same affection. "

She saves me a bunch of money cause we never go out to eat, which so nice because I don't have a lot of money. She never interupts me either, if I'm watching a show and she's hungry, she just pulls down my pants and grabs her fork and knive and away she goes. She'll add pepper and mayonnaise - she said I'm scrumptious, in such an adorable way. I work part time, and I do find it harder and harder to walk to work, but I'm looking into Uber. 

I did confront her about it recently, now that my ass bone is completely visible, she said I'm looking sexier, which made feel really good since that's my biggest insecurity. 

Lately she said she wants to try something new ""you're looking D- Lucious!"", and she's been trying to convince me that I don't want kids.

"Jack Welch, former CEO of GE.


&gt;My biggest mistake was explosive -- literally. In 1963, three years into my GE career, I was a chemical engineer, eager and ambitious and trying like hell to build a plastics business in an electrical company. In the process, my pilot plant blew up. Yes, blew up -- roof collapsed, windows shattered, clouds of smoke, the works. I thank God no one was hurt, to this day. But I was certain my career was over, especially when my boss in Pittsfield suddenly didn't know me, and I got a call to go see the big boss in New York. His name was Charlie Reed, and I didn't know him at all. What I did know was that I was terrified -- I was sure I was going to be yelled at, humiliated and then unceremoniously fired. After all, it was my plant and my fault. 


&gt;But Charlie Reed taught me a huge lesson about leadership and life that day. He was calm. He was kind. He was thoughtful. He spent several hours with me, employing the Socratic method of questioning, to help me understand why the explosion occurred and what I could have -- and should have -- done differently. And then, after it was all over, he gave me a second chance.
I learned to never kick someone when they're down. Everyone makes mistakes, and some are real whoppers. But that makes them whopping opportunities, too -- for growth. In the years after my encounter with Charlie, I followed his example with my own employees, and saw it help more people for the better. I also learned that the time to ""kick"" people -- and by kick I mean ""challenge"" -- is when they're on the way up, to remind them that when you're growing, make sure your head isn't swelling, too!

"A lot of these are about people in general, but certainly when looking at women as prospective partners this is my kind of mental checklist.

1. Honesty and straight forwardness... don't try and give me hints and then complain that you didn't get what you wanted... I can't read minds, so whilst that's still the case i really appreciate it when girls don't act like i can.
2. Focus on making themselves better... i don't care what your socioeconomic situation is, but i have a hell of a lot more respect for those who are unemployed trying to make a better life for themselves through self improvement compared to those who've been lucky and been able to coast all their life.
3. Not being afraid to ask for help when they really need it... takes a lot of courage to overcome the ego and ask for help
4. Having their own hobbies and interest.... couldn't care less what they are, just so long as there is something in there that isn't following the mainstream crowd... ""eating"" and ""watching reality TV"" \(two i've seen listed multiple times on dating sites\) don't count as hobbies.
5. The ability to empathise, or put themselves in someone else shoes."

"Ok I guess I'll answer...

A 3 foot tall dwarf I met on OkCupid. All her photos were just head shots and she had a normal 28 year old Asian girl's face, but her profile said 3' tall. I asked if that was a typo and she said no, and that 3' was the minimum height she could enter on the app. I don't know why, but we ended up meeting up at a brewery and holy shit, she was the smallest adult human I have ever seen in my life. She had her full grown doberman with her and I swear that thing could pull her around on a little chariot. Anyways, we just bullshitted about whatever and she informed me that she considered standing me up because I ""look like a douchebag"" and wasn't really her type (she was kind of a bitch). I don't know why, but right before I hit the ol' dusty trail I said ""you're welcome to stop by my place if you like"". Big mistake. 

We ended up drinking more and even though she was literally 50 pounds, she could knock back a few IPAs like a champ. It wasn't long before her little pants were on my floor and I was jabbing her lungs with my wiener. 

The next morning, I was startled when I woke up and she was curled up on the pillow next to me. My mom was coming over that day to help me with my garden, so I politely hinted that she should hit the road. But instead she cracks open another beer and starts getting drunk again! It was 9am on a Sunday morning, my mom was coming over and I had a drunk, naked Chinese midget standing in my kitchen who refused to leave. Eventually my patience wore off and I told her that if she didn't leave that I would pick her up and place her out on the sidewalk. She eventually agreed to go but only if I fucked her again.... :(

This was one of those encounters where you can't even look at yourself in the mirror for three days because you're so disgusted. But my thoughts were ""what was I supposed to do? I can't just *not* fuck a midget"". And none of my friends have let me live it down since. It's been a great ice breaker story though. "

Met my wife in HS when I was a senior and she was a sophomore.  Dated her for 17 years before we got married.  One year after that we had our first child.  Been together for 20 years now.  Being a parent is exhausting but being with my wife is easy and completely enjoyable.  For the record I’m Asian and she’s white and culturally we use to have our differences but our value system and ethics align quite well.

I don't think that is ridiculous. To bench more you need to train bench. Most people do not do gym. If you are kind of lighter weight but in good fitness (like running and body weight exercises) there is a good chance you wont bench 135.

"Sure.

"About 20 years ago after about 25 years of marriage, I told my wife about my complete hopelessness and lost self worth.  I told her I couldn't go on facing my job environment or life in general, I was so tired of struggling to keep up appearances.  As part of my illness, I wasn't sure how she would react, I truly didn't feel she loved me anymore. I had always been the rock in our relationship.  She was very supportive, talked me into going for a mental health exam and eventually medication.  The meds made a huge difference and I realized that the love was always there but in my depression I couldn't see or feel it.  "

"I'm also not a braggart (and honestly, while I'm above average, I'm not huge), but when I was younger i was also a shy introvert. My gf when I was 14 in high school broke up with me because she said my dick was too big and didn't cum quick enough (actually she was just tiny and so hot that I was too nervous to cum quick because I thought she was outof my league). Now, she didn't say that to me, she just dumped me with ""we're not compatible"", she told all her friends the ""real"" reason. Never has a girl done me a bigger favor. Suddenly I was getting all sorts of attention from the fairer sex. It cured my shyness for sure. If I ran into her today, 20 years later,  I'd give her heartfelt thanks. "

After reading I was reminded of: The birth of our second son, the umbilical cord got wrapped around his neck. It was touch and go for about 3-4 hours until he was pulled out, blue and unresponsive. Luckily that only lasted about 2 minutes. He is 15 now. 

Also, about 12 hours after my daughter was born. She threw up bile. They thought she might have a twisted intestine, which would require immediate surgery. She was rushed to a neighboring hospital and spent 2 weeks in the ICU before they were fully confident. She hadn't dropped her meconium plug. She is now 13.

"I've posted on one of the GW subs a couple times. It was probably ladybonersgw or something (I forget). They were shirtless pics (not dick pics). I also used an alt-account, so they aren't in my post history.

I did not get off to the comments. Most of the comments seemed to be from gay guys. (I'm straight.)

Honestly, I did it because I'm a good-looking guy in good-shape, but women rarely give me much attention. I get more comments and attention from random gay men at bars or at the gym than I do from women. Meanwhile, I have female friends who routinely post selfies and get 300 likes or whatever on instagram. It generally feels super-needy, unmasculine, and attention-begging to post pictures of myself on instagram like my female friends do. It's easier to do it anonymously. And I generally feel like women see themselves as attention-getters, but never want to be attention-givers (at least not to men; they'll praise their female friends endlessly, though). Honestly, I posted because I feel like I'm in very good shape and I've worked hard on my body, but there's a huge gap between the amount of attention I actually get from women versus the amount of attention I feel like I should be getting. I generally feel like women are mostly indifferent towards men's bodies, or are too shy to show interest, or are trying to play some kind of mind-game where men will be more interested in them if they act indifferent. It's nice to feel like I'm not invisible.

Weirdly enough, in the last week, I've had several women mention to my face about how attractive I am. I think it's due to rarely getting much attention earlier in life, but I'm still not entirely comfortable handling the attention, either."

"

If OP is admitting that he has certain less attractive traits (ie: being overweight) while saying he’s amazingly lucky to have a gorgeous wife, then I find it curious he wouldn’t strive to improve his own changeable appearance in order to better match his wife (because while she may very well adore him, he’d likely be more attractive to her if his physical body was in better shape.)

"My girlfriend has had a troubled past since she was young.  Her mom killed herself when she was very young and her dad's wife beat her and her sisters  up quite a bit when they were growing up.  

Because of that my girlfriend very rarely (if ever) talks about her past.   One day we took an 8 hour road trip.  We were talking about my  life growing up and then she just opened up to me.  Told me all her experiences, the pain of her mom's death, dealing with an abusive step parent.  She talked and I listened.  

I felt her opening up to me and letting me in her past was a turning point for us and was probably one of the most intimate moments we ever shared."

This doesn’t apply to all, but it’s more common with beautiful girls than it is with average/below-average looking girls. 

You find that once you get to know them, there isn’t much to them, and tend to be fairly shallow"
"It’s perfectly safe. Night dives are almost always shallow, so if you truly do get lost you can surface and look for the brightly illuminated boat. It won’t be more than a few dozen feet away."
"I can't believe this guy is considering giving up man's best friend. That dog will love you more than she will, If she's got negative feelings towards the dog that's her problem and she needs to grow up."
"There is a huge shortage of men in our communities. And so many places where you can help out on a limited basis. Coaching sporting teams, reading programs at libraries, big brother programs.


And the parts of you that aren't what you want can be fixed, counseling, therapy, support groups, courses, meditation.

I used to be the maintenance person for a school. Kids would follow me around and seek me out because I was, in some cases, the only male they ever had a chance to see who was pleased to see them. "
"I drank soy for a week and my nips started to hurt. I reverted to whole milk, one that comes out of grass-fed, free range, pasture raised four-legged cows and I now deadlift 450 pounds without a belt on an average day."
"I can't tell if I feel women are generally are not great judges of character or if they just deal with manipulative BS way more than guys have to.

Like I can't tell if my judge of character is just never tested because I don't have women coming up to me with cheap pick up lines, but I feel like I can sniff that shit out instantly when I watch it play out from afar."
In awe at the size of this love!
Obesity lowers test. What we have is a food and exercise problem. Our food is shit and kids are on electronics all the time.

"She sounds great, is she single?"
Are you guys ok 
"Dude... maybe she just wanted to complain about it, and here you go, offering a solution :P"
"""It's a thyroid condition.""

""I cheated on him because he neglected me.""

""She told me she was on the pill.""

"I think it's pretty natural to look at someone who is physically developed and find them physically attractive. I think the issue is really finding features of an underdeveloped body attractive.  

I'm 31 so really anyone under 24 or 25 isn't something I'm interested in persuing."
"We're getting married in 39 days. How do I know this? She tells me EVERY DAY how many days until the wedding. She has been doing this for months. If I'm away from her, she will text me as soon as she wakes up. She is extremely excited to be marrying me, she's probably the happiest I've ever seen her."
When she reaches under my clothes to touch my body. Hot and desirable as fuck!

So she is a cat?
"""You mean so much to me""

""You really are so handsome""

""I miss you and I can't wait to see you again""

The girl I'm dating right now is very emotionally distant and it's kind of tearing me up."
"In any other context, it might be interpreted as bullying. "
"Had some girl walk across a bar and ask if I was Billy Currington, he was in town for a concert. I didn’t know who he was but he is some jacked up country star, so I will take it. "
"Things to add to my resume: participated in company sponsored $600,000 training program."
There are also quite a few male children I can out bench press.
No need to get teste.
"Dude honestly props to you for going through all that and still turning out to be a great dad. 

Not many people have the strength to do that and it says a lot about your character.

I hope you and your family have long and healthy lives with lots of love :)"
"I live in a very liberal, sex-positive area have been with a fair amount of women, maybe 20, and every single one of them so far was submissive, most of them being moderately or very submissive. A good friend of mine has slept with 100+ women and he says only one or two of them had any dominant tendencies. 

Pretty sad for us switches!"
That's why I said workout buddy. Not silent resenting bystander.
"you still are, you will realize this in 5 years from now."
"I am a bit of an artsy type. I've done theatre since middle school and majored in theatre in college before I dropped out due to financial stress (I'm 22 now, dropped out 2 years ago). I plan on returning but for a film degree instead. Aside from that my hobbies include watching movies, playing video games, drinking with friends, staying up to date on American and global politics. "
She was into you bro
His math was slightly off.
"Lots. I always run scenarios of what I would say if this happened or that happened

I usually never live up to the situation if it arises. "
"Just wanted to say this is like, the most wholesome thread I’ve seen on this sub. Y’all are a bunch a sweeties. "
"personally i hate showering with my gf, mostly because were both swapping back and forth to get soap and shampoo and who gets the water. I'd probably love it if we had one of those walk in showers though"
"Oh man, offices are goldmines for this stuff!

Same way with the need to show off physical prowess in any way possible...

I have seen otherwise sane, educated, middle aged desk jockeys attempt to leap over file cabinets or do pullups in the supply closet to ""show off"".  

Spoiler alert:  Karen from compliance is *not* going to be impressed that you managed to break your arm jumping down the office stairwell. And even if she was, you have a wife and five kids, Bob.  I think the Karen ship sailed awhile back."
Glock Fu.
"Tbh it would make me feel like she likes me for my career/money prospects instead of genuine attraction. 

I wouldn't instantly leave her or anything but there would be a huge doubt in my mind about the relationship."

It took me years to realize that non-attacking moves were worth a damn. I'd raise all my Pokemon to have 4 different types attacks for coverage but now I know better. 
I’m eating a sandwich in a hospital cafeteria right now while my sister is having a c-section. Hope my brother-in-law is doing ok. 
"After watching a customer walk around the pastries for 5 minutes , then he looks at his hand and sees he didn’t have enough money . He was about to walk out and I called him over . Handed him a turkey sandwich and said “ have a nice day.”  He looks at me and said “ you made my day. Thank you “ with the most sincere voice I have heard . "
"""You're retarded but you're my retard."""
Whazaaaaaaaaa!
Thats just what their tinder bio says

"&gt;what rookie mistakes did you do on your first serious job?

Thinking that the people in charge have the foggiest clue as to what they are doing."
"When I was on vacation in Mexico the restaurant of the hotel would provide free, bottomless pitchers of margaritas with every meal.  Automatically. 

I was eating lunch with a group of guys that I had met there and when the waitress placed the pitcher on the table I picked it up and asked if anyone wanted some.  NO, THAT'S A GIRLS DRINK! was the response from all of them.  Ok, fine more for me then - was my response.  

When they told me I could not have any either I just laughed.  They weren't joking around either.  They were seriously offended that I would dare to touch the stuff.

The waitress was still nearby so I asked her if they had any colorful girly drinks with flowers, umbrellas or fruit in the glass (they didn't).  I thought these guys were going to get physical at this point, but they just glared at me and refused to talk to me.   my drinking the margarita was unacceptable to them.  

The rest of the meal we just sat in unformfortable silence. 

Don't ever fucking get between me and free, unlimited tequila."
"&gt;She just got back yesterday, wasn't even in town for 24 hours, broke up with me, 

She made up her mind a looooong time ago"
