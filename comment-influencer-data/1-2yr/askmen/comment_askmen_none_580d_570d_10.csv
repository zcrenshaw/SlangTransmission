"Giving oral sex to a chick is the easiest thing in the world.

Find the clit, make circles with your tongue. Pay attention to her reactions in order to find the right speed and pressure and once you you find it do not change your pattern. It's easy to think that when she's on the edge to go harder and faster, but just keep the same pace.

"A bisexual female friend gave me the skinny and it changed everything.

Men and women are opposites in what we like.  Men like difference, variations, changes.  I assumed women did, but I'm wrong.  The best advice I can give anyone is 3-fold:

1. Pay attention, listen to her, listen to the noises she makes
2. When she reacts in a way you like, keep doing that.
3. The closer she gets, the LESS you change.  The worst thing you can do, when she's close, is ""bear down"" or change what you're doing.  If she's cumming, you're doing it right, just keep doing that."
"She's basically keeping you on the back burner in case things don't work out for her with someone else, in this particular case the other guy. She probably does value your friendship, but I'd drop any expectation that y'all will ever be a thing.

Start getting out there and seeing other women. When she tries to get possessive tell her that you're single and she needs to back off, or cut her out.

If the ""party"" would just be the four of you I wouldn't bother, unless her friend is cute and single."

"God. This is why I'm so against private sellers. People; if you want a sex doll ADOPT ONE FROM A SHELTER dammit. So many people go out to private dealers and buy one not realizing a sex doll is for life. They're not a whim thing. They require care, cleaning/grooming, attention and... cleaning. Dudes like OP just get one, enjoy them for a while then realize they didn't have the motivation or want to have one.  
  
OP, take it to a shelter. It'll be hard, and you'll probably cry and be silently judged by the shelter staff but my god, take some responsibility!"
Leave it in an alley posing as a homeless person. This will immediately render the doll undetectable to the human eye.

"&gt;It's easy to think that when she's on the edge to go harder and faster, but just keep the same pace.

This is the most important piece of advice. As men we tend to think ""harder and faster"" because that's what gets us off, but for women when they say ""just like that"" they seriously mean don't change anything, you found the rhythm now keep it steady. I know I ruined a few girls orgasms by trying harder and faster when they told me they were almost there. "
"It's difficult to know the exact level of risk, but there's three main options.

1. she says yes and you see where that goes.

2. she says no, things may be awkward for a bit, but friendship endures.

3. she freaks out and your friendship ends either immediately or after not very much time has passed.

Of course, after that three-pronged fork, there's other ways things can end, such as if she says no but things were going fine until she meets someone she does want to date and you can't handle it and have to distance yourself from her or cut off contact."

You're her emotional dildo. Drop her and find someone that'll use you as their full time dildo.
"Yes.

"It's all about building anticipation. 

Don't go for the clit directly. Your aim should be to make her feel multiple sensations at the same time. Basically overload her nervous system. I see it like a video game. The combo multiplier goes higher when you are touching her in multiple places at the same time.

I start by massaging her inner thighs, kissing and licking them. Once you have done that, try licking around the part called labia majora. I see my tongue as a paint brush working on a canvas. Be sure to 'paint' her there. It should swell a bit. Slowly move in towards the part called labia minora. Your nose is now closer to the clit. So exhale warm air near her clit through your nose while you lick her minoras. Add more sensations by massaging her inner thighs in different patterns while licking her majora and minora. Paint a landing strip all the way from her butthole to her clit. She should give you a response. 

Lick circles around the clit and occasionally suck it. It's time to introduce fingers. Start with one. Now introduce middle finger like a hook and try to stretch her hole vertically downwards towards her butthole without hurting her.    Use a hand to massage her thighs and the other to finger her while painting her with your tongue. 

Use the middle and ring finger to reach for her g-spot. Do it in a ""come here"" pattern. Adjust speed accordingly to how she likes it. If you are doing good she will look up and smile at you and rub your head. Be creative and try combinations  of the above. If she starts shaking like she is possessed, you have done a good job.

"I second this. Post it on Bumble and Tinder for a bit. Let them know you need a date for a sick wedding and maybe some drinks after, your treat. Women like weddings man. Who knows, maybe something for the future will come out of it. "
"Most attractive woman in the world. I love myself, but don't want to be my own best friend. "
"I'm split down the middle. On one hand, I'm a genuinely curious person, and my current relationship IS the woman I am meant to be with forever, and as such, I want to learn everything about her, all the things that make her who she is, what makes her tick, why she does the things she does. THAT side of me wants all the stories, all the crazy things, all the past experiences and such. So if we found a pair of sexy undies and she wanted to tell me about it, I'd be game.

The other side of me feels crappy inside when I hear about something she's done in her past, because I think I start to frame it differently in my head perhaps. I think about how the woman who I consider my best friend and soulmate has done all these other things with other men in her past, and that's tough for me to wrap my head around sometimes. I often think when I see a cute pair of undies on her, ""hmm, did she wear that or buy that for someone else?"" and then my brain goes into overdrive and starts to visualize what that must have looked like, and I don't like the feeling I get from that.

"Love is an action. That one came from a friend. Oddly she barely shows the love she says she feels for people. Still good advice though.

Also my dad taught me that if you want to make a relationship work you never fight each other. You fight the problem between you and a spouse. Every issue is ""our"" issue and working together to solve it makes for better understanding and a strong bond. "
"That‚Äôs their problem, not mine."
"She does a lot of things that makes me feel love and wanted, but my favorite thing she does (that I always mention in these types of threads) is when she reaches out to hold my hand or when she grabs onto my arm whenever we're out shopping or doing errands or whatever or whenever we're just at home watching TV on the couch.  I love seeing her hand reach back for me if she's walking ahead.  I love feeling her hands grab onto mine or her grabbing on to my arm if I'm walking ahead.  "
"See, I was going to ask if the dick counted as a trebuchet because of the balls, but I think since the the balls are at the end of the ""firing arm"" and not causing a rotation all the way around, they don't factor in and the penis can SOLELY be classified as a catapult. Unfortunately."
"I don't normally comment on posts, but this is one I have some experience with. I had a long period of time where I felt lost, for lack of a better word. I was constantly depressed and felt as though I had no one to have a conversation with, let alone someone I could open up to. Eventually, I just got fed up of feeling like this. 

I found a trivia night at a local pub and forced myself to go every week. I made a friend here and a friend there by asking if I could join a team. Eventually, I was being invited to do things with the people outside of the bar scene. Some of my best friends were made during trivia nights. 

Another way I have tackled these feelings is by educating myself in subjects that fascinate me. Can you go back to university? Do you have an old hobby that you want to get back into? Do you enjoy making things? The ability to start and finish a thing gives one a sense of fulfillment that greatly increases (in my experience) self-worth. 

However, if you are feeling depressed constantly, you should talk to your primary doctor. Ask them what their suggestions are and go from there. Mental health should not be overlooked. 

PS: I also find myself feeling down if I've dressed scrubby for several days in a row, haven't shaved, or need a fresh haircut. ""Look good, feel good"" works for me."

"Bro, I have two things to say.

1. You have no more than what God gave you.  You didn't do anything that effected the size of your equipment so there's no reason to feel that way.  It's like asking a woman with smaller breasts to be ashamed because she's smaller than average.  It's all garbage, dude.  If a woman can't acknowledge this, then she doesn't deserve the D. 

2. Maybe this is just my experience, but with the right technique, fingers and tongues can be more important than a penis to a woman.  Focus on the woman and what she is feeling, focus on foreplay, and get her engines really revving.  My girl tells me that she is more turned on by the fact that I really want to get her off than anything I got going on dick-wise, which is good because I'm totally average anyway. 

Also, I do know that lacking confidence is a turnoff and is probably affecting your dating.  Maybe not jump into bed quickly and learn each other first.  I'd  say take it as a challenge.   "

Reddit can only help so much here, my thoughts go out to you - but what you need is people who you trust that you can let all the hurt run it's course with. I would encourage you to go to her funeral, it will be one of the hardest things you will ever do - but if I were her parents and family, knowing that she meant so much to someone like you would bring some much needed comfort to the tragedy. I really hope you can find the strength to face it, and that you can find some kind of peace while time heals such a deep wound, even if it leaves a livid scar."

"I'm excited to create a really special childhood for my kids one day. I know that sounds like a ""well, duh"" kind of response but I've always loved how easily little kids are fascinated and captivated by simple things. Like, if it snows one day and your dad builds you a massive snow fort and a huge slide and all the neighborhood kids come over -- that's an amazing experience, you'll remember it for the rest of your life. I want to do stuff like that all the time. 

Whatever interest they have, I'm going to base it around that. I remember when my dad saw how interested I was in building little ""inventions"", he took one Sunday with me and we mounted a small lightbulb, a battery, and a switch to a wooden plank and wired it all up. When he flipped the switch and the light went on, my mind was blown, I couldn't believe it! I carried it with me to school for the next week to show all my friends. I'll never forget that.

So whatever interests they have, I want to build a really special experience around that. If she likes race-cars, we're going to build a dirt kart track in the back yard, if he wants to be a fashion model, we can set up a little ""fashion show"" or something. I'm really excited about all that one day."

I was completely in love with an older woman when I was 18. I lost my virginity to her. One day she tells me she's moving to Europe for work and likely not coming back. I told her not to go and threatened to kill myself if she did. She dumped me and blocked my number. I stole a ring from my mom's jewelry box and went to her apartment and proposed. she declined (duh) and threatened to call the cops because I didn't leave her apartment. And then she left for Europe and I got over her pretty quickly.

"November, 2003. I was 15 years old. 

Let me preface this by saying I was a *really* ugly kid. Red hair, skinny, terrible acne, played D&amp;D in the library, you get the picture... 

Puberty hit me like a freight train. Suddenly I had height, shoulders, something called a jawline, and my acne cleared up from taking Accutane. At the time I didn't think I looked much different, I had terrible self-esteem.

So I'm seeing my sister's school play, and during the intermission this girl (who I had crushed on for years) asked me to take a walk with her outside. As we're about to head back in, she blurts out, ""You got super hot, can I kiss you?"". Obviously I said yes, and that was my first kiss. 

I noticed the attention from then on. High school was much, much better than middle school for me. "

"There are more things that make two people compatible in a romantic relationship on top of the actual romantic/sexual attraction. These are surprisingly similar to what people look for in their friends. Their values, their behavior, their interests, their general likes and dislikes, their personality. Just because relationships end or fall apart, doesn't mean someone is necessarily to blame, and removing someone you value from your life when they have done nothing wrong, just because you are not romantically/sexually attracted to them anymore would in many cases make your life poorer."

Don't fall for the ""he's just a friend"" and let yourself get gaslighted.  Just leave. If your gut is telling you something is wrong, it probably is.  Not always, but it's feeling it for a reason.  Trust it, don't fight it.

Love will make you do idiotic things, like justifying staying because it means you don't cut your rental agreement short.  Just take the (if any) financial hit and get out.

It will ruin you if you stay.  Vast majority of days I'm fine, but some days I let it all out in solitude and genuinely believe I need therapy.  Being cheated on when you're so in love can be an unrecoverably-damaging blow mentally, as you question everything."

"Your question got me curious, so I did some Googling on the origin of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. While a lot of people apply the term to any beautiful, quirky chick, the original intent was to expose the inherent sexism that's baked into the archetype. 

The defining characteristic of the MPDG is that she doesn't exist for any purpose other than to develop the character of the male protagonist. She doesn't have any motivations of her own, unless they involve--you guessed it--helping the male protagonist. With that in mind, **if you were dating an MPDG, that probably says a lot more about you than it does about her**. While it's possible that she truly was an empty vessel, it's much more likely that she *did* have motivations of her own, but they just weren't important enough to you for you to have noticed them. 

And with *that* in mind, I'll say that yes, there were two girls from my past who fit the MPDG trope, from my perspective. Dating them was exciting. I loved the attention that I got for dating a hot chick, and they taught me that it's okay and lots of fun to break the rules! But looking back, I really have no idea about them or what they wanted out of our relationship, out of life, out of anything. I just knew I liked what they did to me and how they acted on me, never mind their needs. And I'm a little ashamed of that. "

Celibacy
"That's a terrible thing that happened to you and no-one deserves that. There is a special place in hell for those people believe me. As far as your body goes, we were all created differently and that's what makes us unique. Your penis size has nothing to do with who you are as a person and there are good women out there who will love you and want you the way you are. You just have to keep looking. I would say for your own sake, stay away from casual sex so you don't run into size queens or women who are disrespectful. Build a meaningful relationship with someone and get to know what kind of person she is and then let her know how you feel. Everyone has insecurities man, you're not alone. "
"Jesus Christ you fuckers are insecure. Just say ""nice shirt"" or ""nice shades"" if they got cool gear. People compliment my clothing all the time (mostly my shirts) and my sunglasses. i do this too. Its not fucking weird and people appreciate this. Just don't do it, if its something super generic (ex. like a basic white/black shirt, a polo, etc.) Only do it if its obviously very unique or out there. "

"I often feel like they want a ""right"" or ""correct"" answer. So whatever i say she will end upset, and invalidate my feelings. 

Like she is super upset about something but for whatever reason I'm not bothered? Saying that is the wrong answer.

Or that when she talks about her fears going forward and if my fears don't match her fears - again wrong answer.

Call me cynical, i don't mind talking about the deep stuff but when someone specifically asks me about it i always feel like they have an agenda or preferred outcome of that discussion. The best people are the ones who lets me open up when i feel like it, and respect my feelings without judging me."
"I think he's saying that sometimes you'll hate or dislike the person you're with and think of ending things, and that it will happen if you both don't work at making it work.

"I think I've dated more women than I would have without abs, to be honest. I changed my IG profile picture to [this dumb pic of me drinking beer in my underwear](https://i.imgur.com/ITWULA8.jpg) and apparently it was a good fucking decision, because it made my ""likes"" stand out and grabbed the attention of women I was trying to flirt with online. Several of them flat out said that my profile pic caught their attention and made them curious. 

On the other hand, some people think I am a total douche bag because I occasionally show off what I work hard for. 

With that said; maintaining abs is hard fucking work and more or less crucial for my chances in landing an attractive life partner because I make ~50k a year and drive a 16 year old 4Runner, so this is pretty much all I have to offer. "
"At the store... or if you're travelling with a bus or a tram to work - in the transport. I think a woman starting the conversation will be way more welcomed than a man trying to start a conversation with a random woman.

Basically we, single men, have the same problem with finding single girls. Especially if we're almost 30 and working 9-5.

And.... we like it if the woman gets the initiative. "
"I always tell women to use the word dude and compliment the guy as if you were also a guy

nothing feels less flirty to me than a woman using the word dude

*Dude...looking sharp today*

*Dude...what kind of cologne is that?  It smells awesome*

Also...high 5's


*You really nailed that presentation.  High 5 dude*


Also...before you compliment a guy, think to yourself how you would react if some dude you were definitely not interested in gave you a similar compliment.  

If getting a similar compliment would make you feel awkward or uncomfortable....keep it to yourself

For example *I just wanted to say you have the most gorgeous blue eyes*  old boy might legit have deep blue eyes.  But that is going to come across as flirty 9 times out of 10.

"There will almost certainly be a support group for the bereaved in your area - it's likely that you'll be the youngest by some margin, but they'll know what you're going through and even if your participation is minimal, at least you'll feel some solidarity. I don't know where you are but in the UK there are helplines like the Samaritans who are there to talk.

You must not bear this alone though, if you don't let it run its course and seek support in whatever way you can, it is extremely likely that you will become clinically depressed if you aren't already. You're young, you have much ahead if you - not dealing with this effectively could derail your entire youth, and I can't imagine your friend would have wanted that for you :(. Please look into some form of support, don't suffer in silence, alone. "
"You are not, this is a very typical experience. Another common one is to be asked to give an honest answer and then be attacked for giving an honest answer they clearly didn't agree with or like. Now as to whether this is a ""female"" thing or whether it's merely that most heterosexual men only encounter it in women because they only have that sort of relationship with women is neither here nor there but it's definitely a common experience."

Second, work on being happy with yourself for your own reasons, not because what others think about.  Confidence isn‚Äôt feeling like other people like you, it‚Äôs not giving a shit what other people think to begin with.


Lastly work on doing the things you know to be right, even when you are feeling lazy or selfish.  Nothing builds confidence like being true to your inner values.

By making me feel genuinely loved and sexually desired on a level I never even thought girls/women actually felt.

This thread was really painful to read. It made me realise what I am lacking in life. Not easy being a man.
 This doesn't sound like your mistake 
I spent over 7 years with my sons mother and the things that stick out from before she got sick was how she'd hold my hand randomly while driving(assuming safe weather conditions). I'd come home from busting my ass and sweating from installing servers all day and she'd hug and smell me because just the smell of me was comforting to her. I also have health issues that sometimes I needed a second person to help with and she never even hesitated to help. It wasn't always pleasant either and she would do it without even the smallest complaint. I miss what we had but schizophrenia is a bitch that ruins everything. I'm 30 now and doubt that I'll ever find another person I'm as comfortable with as her. She is still the only person I don't have to pretend around. I can be completely and totally 100% me and not have to hide anything.

"I would recommend everyone here get a good massage. I also am never touched by anyone, but I can pay someone to massage me and for what it's worth, it seems to satiate my need for intimate touch.

It in fact makes me quite sad. I'm constantly battling this idea impregnated by society that I am inherently predatory and my need for intimacy is seen by other people as dangerous, unwanted, and creepy. So naturally I have shied away from all forms of contact because I don't want to make people uncomfortable. The only time I will ever touch anyone is if they initiate.

It has gotten to the point where I've gone for so long without anything that it just feels routine. I love myself enough for it to not be much of a problem. It definitely hurts but that's just how it is and I can't change it. The moments where I've truly been *embraced* by someone fully and unapologetically can be counted on one hand, and I remember the emotions I felt with an exquisite lucidity. "

"I posted this before, but I like telling it.....

Let's see.....I knew her younger sister, who invited me to a Christmas party at their house. (I was 16). The older sister was a tiny, pretty little blonde......

Met her there, but she started going out with another friend. Three months later she dumped him.

We all hung out at a open house meant to keep we juvenile delinquents off the street. Myself and four or five of my friends were standing in a circlle outside, smoking.......and she stepped out of the Hall. One of the guys pulled her into the circle (she was pretty, remember?) and we started pushing her guy to guy to guy..........around the circle. (we were 16, remember? lol) When she got to me, she threw her arms around my neck, and wouldn't let go.

Even I can take that hint!

She was my first gf.

That was in 1971.

She is downstairs right now, drinking tea."

"""That's awesome! Don't fuck it up."" Said by my roommate after I got together with an extremely fun and gorgeous girl. Of course, I had no plans to fuck it up, but occasionally I had to remind myself of that advice, when I was in a bad mood, and at risk of acting out and infecting her with my mood. I mostly succeeded in this, but the relationship just ran its course after 2 years. I truly believe it would have been shorter had I not heeded this advice."

"I have a morning ritual that I need to share. I call it ""the terminator"". First I crouch down in the shower in the classic ""naked terminator traveling through time"" pose. With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg badass. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy."

"it‚Äôs a lot lol. it teaches you the anatomy of a female and how their nerves work down there and *where* their sensitive parts are aside from the clit. the nerves branch out to other parts that help increase their pleasure. 

then it breaks down step by step how to give a girl head and there‚Äôs a lot of good moves you can learn from it. before i read it girls said i was pretty good at it but you really can never learn too much. you come out with a better understanding on how a girl gets off which is different from men. i learned new things to do with my tongue and my hands and a lot of them are incredibly useful and effective. 

my strongest selling point that i tell a lot of people on reddit is that the girl i‚Äôm currently sexually active with had never gotten an orgasm from solely oral. she said she‚Äôd practically given up and lost hope for it and if any guy could do it she would cry tears of joy. i read that book in two days and that night i tried everything i read on her and got her to orgasm in 10 minutes. she literally screamed ‚ÄúYou did it!‚Äù gave me a huge hug and started crying lmao. 

what i like about the book is that if you need to go back and refer to it there are bullet point summaries of it at each chapter. seriously consider reading it! you‚Äôll definitely learn something from it 

edit: holy shit i got gold lmao. Instead of gilding me though use your money to buy [*She Comes First* by Ian Kerner](https://www.amazon.com/Ian-Kerner-Comes-Thinking-Pleasuring/dp/B0080SS0WO)! It‚Äôll make your lady extremely happy."

In general, most people have less time for their friends when they get into a romantic relationship.  So things just fall by the wayside.

Maybe they just don't feel comfortable having male friends while they're in a relationship.

Maybe the secretly like you, and don't want to talk to or spend time around someone they have feelings for while they're in a relationship with someone else.

Maybe they think that you're not respectful of their relationship so they don't like being friends with you while they're dating someone else.

Maybe they just like the attention you give them and feel like they don't need it when they're dating someone."

"After ejaculation, men secrete the hormone prolactin - which we have far more of than women do - which is associated with sleepiness; and vasopressin which also encourages sleep.  Both genders secrete oxytocin, which makes women cuddly, promotes bonding, and makes them feel ""lovey"", but causes primarily relaxation in men.

Hormonal variations are responsible for the crash of sleepiness most men get after sex.

"well i try to lay off sex as long as possible when im dating. it usually happens by the third date which is much sooner than what i'd want. however even though those girls really really insinuate about having sex (saying how close my place is, mentioning that they are tired and that its a long way home, or if we could stop by her place because she forgot something) i have no choice but to comply. the last time i ""rejected"" a girl by trying whatever way to avoid sex she thought i didnt find her attractive and another one just turned absolutely vile on me by calling me a faggot. 

the thing that i have issues with is i always fear that face that they make when they see the reveal. its like watching the brightness and eagerness from her face just dim to an absolute low. the sex just feels so forced and other times ive had women make up an excuse to leave during the middle. 

these experiences plus the sexual assault just make me feel nervous naked even when alone. as soon as my pants come off i feel like i am less than a human being at times. "

Don't treat them as 'too attractive'. You'd be surprised how far you can get by treating someone like that the same as you would anyone else. It's entirely possible they'll be impressed with your confidence and appreciate that you didn't treat them different or approach in an especially needy or submissive way. 
"In high school I went through phases of both anorexia and bulimia. No one really noticed because I was honestly never able to go below 10% body fat and I was anorexic in that I ate 1000 calories a day while taking a lot of vitamins and caffeine mixed with ephedra. I would basically not eat all week then eat like shit on the weekends to excess then throw it all up. It fucking sucked, I was hungry/dizzy/nauseous/tired all the time and in my mind I was still too fat. I remember once I ate some pizza and felt like a fatass so I grabbed a bucket and ran on my treadmill for an hour while throwing up into the bucket."
