"I did before. I won't do it again. 

And while everyone else is saying the costs, the smell, health issues, what really did it for me was that we couldn't even watch a damn movie at home without her having to go outside to smoke.

Take a flight somewhere, first thing she had to do was smoke. Road trip and ran out, had to stop to buy more. Out on the town and left them at home, her having to constantly bum one. Go to the amusement park, having to always find or the designated smoking area and walk halfway across the park. 

It was really being with someone who was a slave to their addiction. Like smoking took precedence over everything else. No matter what we were doing, it would have to stop so she could have a smoke.

"The Book.

We had a senior in high school write a 7\-page satirical book making fun of the how terrible the school administration was. ""The Book,"" as it was called, harmlessly poked fun at the administrators, joked some were hooking up, brought up some curious points on racial segregation amongst students, and generally pointed out some hypocrisies in how totalitarian they were towards us in a comical way. He let a couple friends read it first, but soon it spread around the whole school via PDF. Come the end of the week, he was expelled and *arrested.*

Soon, a huge freedom of speech controversy exploded and the local news was all over it saying you can't expel and arrest a student for simply not liking what they said about you. The school ended up saying they did not expel him for what he said, but the fact he printed it out one time on school paper and left school with it, so actually expelled him for *theft of government property.*

I believe they settled that he was in fact expelled, but it would not show up on his record as such."

"In high school I was taking some Introduction to Programming class that was taught by one of the math teachers with no background in software.  The thing was, I loved it.  It was the only class I cared about.  I was leaps and bounds ahead of the teacher, which is fine, he was a smart guy, he just didn't care about computers.

I was a great student.  All of my assignments were way, way over the top and hilarious, but also met whatever requirements they had.  I even set it up so I could work on my assignments in the library before school/during lunch - they'd made us 'admins' over our individual network folder and I granted everyone access (the library computers were logged in as LIBRARY_1 - I couldn't log in as myself).

So all year long, I'm getting A++++s and I'm helping out other students, like straight up, the best I've ever been in school.  At the end of the year - like two weeks away from the end, I get called down to the principal.  She was at her desk, looking pissed off, the head of IT for the entire district was in her office too.

They started asking me all sorts of questions about what I'd been doing on the network.  They also called in other students that I was friends with/had helped the most in the class.  I didn't understand it at all.  They were flipping out over things that made no sense.  For example, this was a programming class in VB6 (I'm old).  I wrote a few lines of code using WIN32 API to change the resolution because we were in 640x480 and not 800x600.  It didn't persist or affect anyone else, but it made it easier for me to code.  The principal asked me what exactly I did - I tried to explain - she asked me what increasing the resolution 'did'.  I also tried to explain, 'Well, it gives you more pixels, more space to work with...'

She paused, looked more angry, and finally said, 'SO YOU WERE ABLE TO SEE PARTS OF THE SCREEN YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE!?!'

I straight up didn't understand any of it.  I didn't do anything wrong, I mean, I loved that class, it was my favorite class.  And here I was getting yelled at for the most trivial, ridiculous stuff.  I was threatened with expulsion and told they were filing a report with the police.  I still didn't get it.

Officially, my 'crimes' were that I shared my personal folder (that they gave me permissions to) with everyone in the district.  In practice, all of about five kids knew how to browse the network and all of my assignments were SO over the top, anyone who didn't know how to do the homework wasn't going to be helped.  They had us sign some 'appropriate use' document and if you really took it out of context, _maybe_ I was in violation of it.  They said I was helping other people cheat, and that was a violation of the agreement.

They were 'investigating' and during this time, I was told I might be expelled or dropped from the class - but they kept bringing in people I was friends with or that I helped in class.  They also banned me from touching any of the schools computers (I was a junior, this restriction carried over as a senior).  Oh, and they called my parents and made it sound like was some crazy hacker.  Thanks guys.

The rumors were crazy.  Everyone assumed I did some horrible, terrible hacking thing.  I mean, word traveled fast, and when I tried to tell people who ridiculous the staff were being, everyone just assumed I was lying.  My close friends in particular, they were like, 'No, seriously man, you can tell us...'

The worst part of it was, I stupidly, thought I had earned some respect with my teacher.  Before this happened, I was basically his teacher's aid.  I helped him with the class, I helped other students....I thought for sure, he'd explain that I was a good student, that I wouldn't cheat.  But nah, he became a straight up dick to me, immediately.  

All week long, instead of going to my programming class, I had to go sit in the office while they 'investigated'.  And everyone was saying I was going to be expelled.  Most people believed that I was changing either my grades or other students, but obviously, I didn't.  Friday came and they still were 'investigating'.

Now it's the weekend and I'm flipping out.  I'm also an immature teenager.  So I do what any idiot kid would do....I downloaded a clone of the school's website, photoshopped a nazi logo over the building, and made a very nice looking 'underground' version of the site.  I mean, it looked good, but the content was crap.  I tried to make it look quazi-official, ya know?  So that it wouldn't be obvious that it was me.  I wrote a few articles just about the things students complained most about, some perv teacher that was always hitting on girls, there was also some weird addition thing that was built the previous year that cost a ton of money and everyone hated.  I think I bitched about how our lunch card system was a scam.  But, clearly, the main focus was how unfairly they had treated some poor kid - me.

I figured that, once people heard the truth, everyone would be like, 'Wow, the school sucks!'.  As it turns out, most people assume that if you are accused of doing something wrong, you are guilty.  I posted the URL all over, trying to get traffic to it.  I don't really know why, it just seemed like the thing to do.  Overwhelmingly, everyone was convinced that the kid was guilty.  Their reasoning really pissed me off.  I remember this one best:

&gt;  So this kid who 'didn't do anything wrong' hasn't even been expelled?  Clearly, he's guilty because, only a guilty person would be afraid of being punished

No.  Having four adults in a room threaten you with being expelled, told never to touch a computer owned by the school again, having your parents called and told you're facing expulsion and _best case_ scenario, you'll get an F in the class....is pretty terrifying, especially as a teenager who was tricked into thinking high school was important.

Whatever.  As the negative responses started flooding in, I got worried.  Maybe I'd made a mistake.  Maybe I should take it down?  I waited until Monday, I passed the link around to kids at school too.  As 'anonymously' as I could.  Reactions were slightly better with actual students.  The truth is most people didn't really care, and I don't blame them.  Most still figured I was guilty, but ya know, everyone was just waiting for the shit to hit the fan - a swastika over the image of our high school was going to get a reaction.

In the office that day, nobody said a word to me.  I just sat there not learning.  At the end of the day I went home.  And my phone rang, my Mom answered, and then she called me over.  It was literally the superintendent.  Seemed like a super nice guy....asked me how things were going (naturally I was terrified by the call).  We chatted for like 20 minutes, I sort of told him my story and oddly enough, it felt like he was the only one who MAYBE believed me.  He brought up the website, I lied and said I didn't make it, but he didn't mind and wasn't accusing.  Just real friendly like he said, 'It doesn't matter who made it, but I thought you might have an idea of who did.  And if you did, maybe you could ask them to take it down; just wait and see how things turn out first.'

I don't know if that was the only reason he was being nice, or if maybe it was genuine and he thought it was in my best interest.  Who knows?  I took the site down, and the next day in the office they told me I wasn't going to be expelled, but that I'd get an F in the class and I still couldn't touch computers owned by the district again.

To this day, I still have no idea what the fuck was wrong with those people.  I can only assume that someone did something really bad on the network, and they had no clue who did it or how, so they looked for ANYTHING unusual and saw my shared folder.  Then they figured, 'Well, it was probably him'.

In the end, it was totally worth it though.  During senior year, whenever my English class went to the lab to write a paper or whatever, they'd sit me in the back, not with a computer and the legend of my super elite hacking skills just grew.  At least a dozen people asked me to change their grades that year.  Also, everyone knew who I was.  'The hacker kid' (who didn't actually hack anything).

"Smokers don‚Äôt smoke because they enjoy it in a lot of cases, or it makes them feel good. They smoke to not feel really shitty.

It‚Äôs amazing to someone who isn‚Äôt hooked but as a former smoker the decline happens pretty quickly, and after a few hours it‚Äôs all you can think about."
"When you don't smoke, the smell of cigarettes is like the smell of a chemical fire. Its smell is nearly as offensive as shit. "
"This actually happened to me in college. Girl I dated was really into butt play. Her words: ‚ÄúP in V is fore play to me‚Äù. Nothing really awkward about it. Girl just liked it in the rear. I learned a lot about the do‚Äôs and donts and prep work that has to go into anal play from dating her. Good times.

Edit: Since people asked I‚Äôll add some best practices that I learned.

Do‚Äôs:

- Use lots of lube. Think that‚Äôs enough? Add more.

- Have some bedding/linens between you and anything you don‚Äôt want body fluids to get on. 

- Have her do a pre game anal douche. Usually no sooner than an hour before game time. Not a good idea to do this too late though, as sometimes, not all of the liquid will vacate and you can end up with a leaky mess on your hands (and floor, and bed, etc)

- Eat high fiber meals starting 24 hours before.. This was one I learned from her. She said that fiber makes your poops more solid, thus minimizing the likelihood of ‚Äúexcess‚Äù sitting right inside the back door.

Dont‚Äôs:

- Shove it in right away. Allow the sphincter to loosen. Use your fingers and some lube at first. Best position to start is the spooning position. Slide in slowly, and only go about 1/4 to 1/2 shaft for the first few minutes. Let her give you directions. If she wants it fast and hard, she will tell you.

- Be scared of poop. Accidents happen, and if you engage enough in anal play, there will be some. Just have wipes ready. If it‚Äôs only a little, learn to wipe it up and keep going.

- Eat dairy or anything that‚Äôs not going to sit well on the stomach 24 hours before. I think this one is self explanatory.

- Be a prick. Your going to see poop, she‚Äôs probably going to fart at some point. Don‚Äôt make her feel anymore self concious than she already feels, especially if it‚Äôs her first time. Be supportive, and help with the clean up effort. 

This is all I can think of right now. I‚Äôll add more if anything else comes to mind."
"Not my SO, but...

Having a short temper. A queue irritates her. Risk of losing a train and having to wait 10 mins for another one makes her lose it, mildly swearing making a scene. Same when she's driving and other people are on her way.

"I'm loved by every cat I met so far. No exact number, but it's +30."
"I am a woman crashing ask men - reading this hurts my heart. My fianc√© was like your roommate - he went to an all boys high school and majored in engineering in college where most of his peers were male. It really turned into where he didn‚Äôt date anyone and then it snowballed into feeling awkward about it the older he got which resulted in avoiding dating all together. We met when we were in our mid-20s (were now just shy of 30). 

We were set up through a mutual friend. If you‚Äôre looking to help your friend - just keep including him in plans that involve groups of people that have some singles involved. Go out of your way to have social gatherings - both low key hangouts at someone‚Äôs house and actual activities he‚Äôs interested in. Let him know who is coming that is single - but don‚Äôt specifically set him up with someone, let him do the legwork. If they don‚Äôt hit it off it gets awkward. Everyone can sense desperation and most of the time it‚Äôs a huge turn off. 

Keep encouraging him - the right person won‚Äôt care about his past (or lack thereof). If he‚Äôs not creepy, weird, a perv or anything negative like that he will meet someone. Don‚Äôt let him become bitter or desperate.  Speaking from experience, college girls suck. It‚Äôs after college many women figure out they need a decent guy in thier life - his time will come. Just be a good friend in the meantime. "

"I cut into my own dick with a scissor.

So I was preparing for a date after a long dry spell and was about to cut the bush so the tree would look bigger. Before I could use the razor I was using a scissor to cut the hairs shorter. Meanwhile my good friend was in the living room, watching tv. All of a sudden she bursts into the bathroom screaming ""PERO_DERO THERE'S A HUGE SPIDER IN THE ROOM"" and SNIP.. I didn't just cut the hairs, but a large gash in my willy. 

That was a very awkward car ride to the hospital. My friend in utter shock after watching her best friend cut his own dong with a scissor and me on the verge of crying because I thought I was losing so much blood that I was going to lose my wang. "

"Absolutely a deal breaker yes. In no particular order, the reasons:

* The smell
* The taste when kissing
* The effect on her teeth and mouth - most smokers who have been at it a while have a very yellow/black color that never goes away.
* The cost
* Health issues (to her, to me, to our kids)
* The fact that kids are much more likely to become smokers if their parents smoke
* Smoke getting into the surrounding environment and staining walls and furniture.

I'm sure I could come up with more if I put more thought into it. It's just such a repulsive habit. If someone wants to do it then power to them, but I'm not forming any sort of permanent living arrangement with that person.

"Hello! I'm a woman with enough emotional issues for my boyfriend to sort through for an eternity. Things that help:

* When he holds me tightly and just listens. He'll kiss my forehead and run his hands along my body, just pressing his body against mine, making me feel loved and cared for.

* This may just be me, so be careful with this tip, but it helps me when my boyfriend pushes the subject when something is obviously bothering me. Like when I'm obviously upset and I'm trying to just let it go, he'll insist we talk about it and let my emotions out instead of keeping them in. This helps me SO MUCH because otherwise I'll be hesitant to discuss it with him.

* Show her through actions that her life is very different than it used to be, and you're there for her through it. You'll know best what that looks like, depending on her needs.

* Make sure she knows it's okay to be open with you. Like, *really* drill it into her. She may not want to ""burden"" you with the same issues she's having day after day, but let her know it's perfectly okay. She's not a burden, her problems are your problems, etc. Make sure she knows this."

"My ex never really had friends. She was in college and not having a good time. I wanted to show her a good time and we ended up being together. I didn't want her to drop out of college so I helped out. Ended paying $1200 for rent, cloths her and paid for any trips we went on.

She got a job to help out which I admired. She ended making friends at work also which was also good. Slowly ""help"" money became having fun money. She'd started to leave early for work and ended coming back from work late to hang out with friends. I talked to her about this and she said waitresses had to stay until the customer leaves, which I understood. But leaving for work 2 hours early, she had no excuse for. I rarely saw her anymore and it was taking a toll on our relationship. I asked her why we never had time for each other, I worked a lot on the weekdays to pay for literally everything but the weekends she was always at work and then going to the bars after.

She came up with some bullshit excuse that she was working a lot because next semester she'd be hammered with classes and wouldn't have much hours to work. So I took the high road and just decided to let her do her thing. Last semester came, she still worked the same hours while attending more classes. Nothing changed. I brought it up to her and she finally pulled the ""I'm depressed"" card. Telling me she wanted to hang with her friends because she never had any. I told her it must be easy to come home to a warm bed never having to worry about bills and what not. I asked her if it was worth being with her friends more at the expense of losing me. I've been there for everything and helped her at her worst. After three years together she walked out and told me she needed to be single to think things out. This was right after our trip to New York in March for her birthday and 2 months out from her graduating college.

2 weeks after she left. She jumped into another relationship. We were literally at a party which I got totally wasted at. Woke up to find her cuddling with the guy in front of me. A year passed by and I hear from mutual friends that she's been with a numerous guys with the relationship not lasting very long. Her new bf is our mutual friend who I confided to when we broke up. Which is strange because she owed him money before they started dating.

I make no effort to talk to her and ignore her whenever she tries to say something. She loves showing off what she has and has no remorse for others if it means she gets what she wants. She's tried numerous times to climb on guys in front of me to get me going, and I lost my shit once. After some therapy, I decided I would never let that happen again. So far so good. Reddit has done wonders for me.

"This is correct. You‚Äôre going to get comments that say, ‚ÄúI did X.‚Äù But they and their relationships are not the same as yours. Just like Love cultivates differently for different people, it also falls apart differently. Don‚Äôt *try* to get over it. Try to live a great life. In the meantime, let the pain bring meaning into your life. And if it doesn‚Äôt mean anything, then make it mean something because pain without meaning is suffering. And suffering is worse than death. "

2. Because our English teacher couldn't English for shit, they imported a young  and *very* American yankee doodle called Matt with a bright stupid face, total ""square"", to teach as an assistant. Then he wrote a pupil some of his fantasies about her in her homework book... well, she told her dad, and then Matt was fired and went ~~to heaven on a surfboard made of bibles~~ back to the US of A.

3. Art teacher got surprised  by the headmaste whilst wanking in the supply closetr...and all the school knew about it a day later thanks to teacher not being natural gossips whatsoever.

4. Our PE teacher, a retired Company Sergeant Major with a glass eye, permanent camo pants and ""I HEART EDINBURGH MILITARY HIGH SCHOOL"" t shirt made us crawl through snow naked in winter ""to prepare for world war 3"" and while playing squash with his wife got so agitated by losing that he tried to intentionally hit her with the ball...but hit himself in the face breaking his own nose.

As a women who smokes. None of you have to worry most smokers don't want to date non-smokers. When I was single I never pursued men who didn't smoke if a non-smoker was interested in me I was skeptical and never really let my guard down around them.

"I'm going to be completely open because you said this is for writing purposes. I like that, but my response might be long-winded (for research!)

I'm 30 and in a long-term relationship with a 22 year old woman. We plan to marry and spend our lives together, etc... it's that serious.

At first glance, I was just out looking for a sexy time. She definitely fit that bill. Our first date she spent the night. I got a blowjob and we fell asleep cuddling. She said she felt safe with me. She's had a troubled past of partners. She was also seeing someone else casually, and about a month into our relationship she ended it with him because we confessed that we loved each other.

It was a quick thing. She moved in about three months later and we've been together ever since. She's my best friend. I feel like she keeps me young. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't have seen great movies like *Inside Out* or *Burlesque*. And in turn, I've shown her things like Weezer or Foo Fighters that she didn't know she enjoyed. We're complimentary.

We also have differing political opinions. She's changed my view on abortion and I've changed hers on gun ownership. It's a combination between us of emotion and logic, youthful optimism and grumpy realism. 

Most importantly, I think I treat her well. She's my princess. I cook for her, I listen, I care about her being her own person. But I also push her to grow into an adult, take command of her own life, etc... I'm her rock. I'm the stability and respect that she's never had. And that's not to brag, because she's my spark of light. She's the innocence I never had, the counter-weight to my bitterness who tells me to have hope. I know that I can carry on because I have her, and with her there will always be a place that's safe, loving, and home."
"Speaking as a 30 year old dude, I certainly don't experience the levels of oppression and sexism that I read about from other dudes.

"I once went on a date with a girl who was very attractive, very nice, and the date went extremely well. At the end of the date, she was the one who went in for the kiss goodnight (another plus), and as soon as our lips touched, I could literally taste the menthol mixed with whatever gum she tried to chew to hide the smell/taste. Turned me off so much I couldn't bring myself to go for a second date."

For someone to tell him that
"[allright buddy](https://i.imgur.com/6lQls0H.png) 

So a lot of people get this bright (hint: it's not) idea that with some kind of celebration being like a week away, usually mother's day, they'd make a post asking ""what did you get your mother for mother's day"", and hope people go OH SHIT I TOTALLY FORGOT or some shit.

There was probably 1 askreddit thread about this 10 years ago that really exploded, and it wasn't funny then, let alone now. And the amount of idiots who think this is 1.unique and 2.funny is just too fucking high. "

"He's seriously the nicest boss i've ever had, and I've worked since I was 14. They're really good people but the company is pretty disorganized, and today he happened to take it out on me, and a coworker. 

I can definitely find work somewhere else, but this is the first negative experience I've really had."
"One of the most important things I was ever asked:

""Do you miss her or are you just lonely?""

Chew on that."
"Well, my focus switches all the time from her \(*does she like what I'm doing? \- shall I tease her some more? \- holy shit this is awesome \- time for another kiss in the neck \- is she about to come?*\) to myself *\(hell yeah I'm having sex \- oh shit my boner is getting weaker \- I wanna suck them tiddies \- hm, I'm getting tired \-  oh yeah she's totally into what I'm doing tho \- no don't come yet \- oh fuck no don't lose that bone*r\).

 Luckily, recently I got a more 'in the moment'\-attitude, where I actually don't think at all, and instead I just feel everything."

It has nothing to do with trusting your girlfriend, is has to do with trusting other men. You can trust you girlfriend 100% and still be suspicious of men. There are some scum bags out there, but they're not all bad."
"Group of girls took a bunch of pictures of them drinking/smoking weed with two teachers during a basketball game at my school and posted them on facebook. When the school saw the pictures and word got around it was found out that both teachers were doing things like giving the girls answers to tests/giving them 100% on projects they didn't do and sending them sexually charged messages. Although one of the girls insisted nothing physical happened between them or anyone in the group.

Both teachers 'stepped down' and transferred to other schools while all the girls got 3 weeks of suspensions. Pretty sure the school ended up covering it up."
These are my exact feelings. Thanks for expressing them so nicely.
"Chemistry is when your interactions with the other person just work incredibly well and feel very natural. It is no longer exhausting at all to be with them. Chemistry also implies that both persons feel the same way. Usually, people around you start to notice as well."

Just smile when people mention it, don't look embarrassed and say something like ""well, you gotta do what you gotta do""."

"That she was the first girl I genuinely wanted to be with and love not because of looks or anything like that but because that she was truly an amazing person that I really wanted to have as my own. When I was around her I was genuinely happy with life no matter what we were talking about I was happy just with the fact that I was with her. I didn't take my shot so it's one of those regrets in life.  I still remember last day of my senior year of high school seeing her walk away and wanting to scream ""I love you"" in the most cheesiest teenage romance scene  type of ways. Oh well sadly onwards and upwards as they say. "
"in the same vein, when the person says a party/event/their day/whatever is ""ruined"" because of something small and frankly unimportant. like, for instance, someone broke a glass and ""now the party is ruined!"", and their mood is now irretrievably soured. god, just fucking chill, won't you?"

"This chick who had a reputation for being promiscuous (nude shower vid leaked of her earlier in the year) claimed the JROTC instructor sexually assaulted her. Everyone wrote her off as a liar. She was punished for the accusations (suspension) but he stayed in his position. I felt bad for her because maybe he really did, but no one cared to investigate because of her reputation. I sometimes wonder what came of her. "
Oh yeah. Last roommate I had was a slob and would call his girlfriend at 2 am and talk loud as fuck during these conversations. 
This one was just cute to me lol 
"Yup, my ex and I had such an intense relationship for how young we were (18/19) and we both just let it fall apart due to sheer stupidity. It's been seven years and I haven't been with anyone since we broke up and while I don't believe in soulmates or ""the one"", I often think I already met and fucked up my best chance of being with someone."
"I recently made a post on a different sub in which others make comments on the poster's appearance, but with negative feedback omitted. The comments that called me cute or handsome really did seem sincere (I don't think they were lying about their thoughts), and I really appreciated them, but this is so incongruent with the utter lack of attention I get in life and on online dating apps that I don't know how to rationalize this. So, to answer your question, I think it's because this is such an anomalous occurrence for that individual that suspicion and disbelief are the only logical responses. "

"Dentist doesn't have to tell me to floss. 
Have you ever smelled rotting meat or vegetables? This is what happens to food caught between your teeth.  Realize that we can't very well smell our own breath but turn and run when we smell someone else's?   If someone has a better way than flossing to remove rotting material between our teeth I want to hear about it please.

Amazing that some will spend hours grooming their crotches but won't floss?  Yikes."

"I think to make a partner feel loved you need to know how they interpret love. If you don‚Äôt know, try stuff until something stands out. But in no particular order:

* Do something nice like making him a drink or a sandwich he didn‚Äôt ask for

* Tell him something nice like, ‚ÄúI really enjoy spending time with you‚Äù or ‚ÄúI always feel safe when I‚Äôm with you‚Äù

* Randomly buy him something simple like his favorite snack

* Initiate physical intimacy whether that‚Äôs holding hands, cuddling, whatever. Doesn‚Äôt have to be sex, just be the initiator. 

* Invite him to do something with you like taking a walk or playing a game. 

You don‚Äôt have to do anything extravagant or expensive. Simple things will be greatly appreciated and he‚Äôll gloat to all his guy friends about them. "
"It sounds like he needs a therapist. I had a similar mentality. While I haven't found myself in a relationship since I've gotten help, I'm in a much better place and it doesn't seem impossible anymore. 

I'd recommend to ask him how he feels about getting some professional help. Even just to try a session or two and see how it makes him feel. It can't hurt"

"Yeah. Last time I got publicly approached by a woman was 6 years ago in college. A Korean girl came up to me and started asking about my day. Turns out she was recruiting for that weird Korean cult (Unification Church?)

Apart from that, nada. The only women who ever make eye contact or smile at me are

**1)** Old

**2)** Women hand-in-hand with their boyfriends (ie ""safe"" in the knowledge that even if they smile, no guy would interpret that as anything more than a smile)

In any other situation, women - especially single women - actively minimize contact with me. I guess because I'm so undesirable they try to create roadblocks during every interaction so I will not get the wrong signals and express interest towards them. As a result I have become very good at socializing with elderly and married ladies, but that's it. I don't remember the last time I had a social conversation with a single girl that didn't end with her walking away after 30 seconds or giving me flat one-liner answers.

So yeah. Just having a girl tolerate me is such a burden on my imagination that *having a girl compliment or approach me* is just silly and out of the question. Only way that would happen is if she's trying to draw me into some pyramid scheme or selling something."

Access to funding, knowledge and opportunity will really help your chances and cut out a lot of really very meaningless stress and suffering. "

"My girlfiend of three years was fairly ""innocent"" when we first started dating: Only one long-term boyfriend, Christian upbringing that brought along Christian guilt with things like pre-marital sex, pro-life, never had tried an illegal drug and actively despised them, and was not particularly political.

Now she has agnostic tendencies, is pro-choice, smokes weed occasionally, goes to raves and music festivals every month, takes LSD and MDMA with me several times a year, is fairly radical in her political beliefs, and our sex is about as non-vanilla as it gets. I dunno if you'd call that ""corruption,"" but I definitely always joke with her that I turned her into a degenerate like myself.

**Quick edit:** just wanted to add that the whole process has made me all the more attracted to her and in love with her. So yeah, ""corrupting the innocence"" is a great relationship builder in that regard.

**Edit 2**: it blows my mind how drugs are still so demonized -- even on this website. 
To everyone telling me I ruined her life by introducing her to LSD and MDMA -- believe it or not, there are millions of people across the world who take recreational drugs well within the realm of moderation and have a healthy and fulfilling relationship with them (especially psychedelics). You can look through my post history if you don't believe me, particularly in /r/MDMA where I used to be a very active member. The majority of my comments there advocate harm reduction and offer advice to people on how safely use MDMA.

**Edit#3** and because I'm getting accused of grooming her or turning her into a ""project,"" I just want to point out, in case it wasnt obvious, that has nevet or will ever be the case. I think because ""corrupt"" has such a negative conotation, I can see the way I worded everything could come across that way to some. All I'll say is that at the end of the day her and I have simply just grown as human beings together. "
"Breaking my dick, willfully. 

Growing up, I had multiple older siblings with a lot of older friends. At the time of the incident, I was 12. It was also in the same session where I discovered masturbation. Lots of dick exploration that night! 

Basically, I had heard many times that you couldn't bend a penis when it was hard, that it was like rock. Not that ""it didn't bend, it broke"", but rather that it might as well have been the strongest material in the universe. 

So, I started exploring myself, mimicked the motions I had seen used jokingly, I had an orgasm and nothing came out, it was weird but nice, so I did it again right after and this time it wasn't a dry run.

More misinformation abound, I had heard repeatedly that dudes can't go twice. So in this moment, I thought ""oh shit, I *can* go twice, but this horrible thing happens... my body.. I think I'm going to die."" I was so scared! Spoiler alert; I didn't die. But my dick was still hard, so now I was curious if the unbendable dick thing was true too. Determined to prove it wrong, I wrenched on that thing like it owed me money. 

Well, you can bend a hard dick, and then your dick gets all weird. For a long time, I could bend it at a right angle no problem, while erect, though my boners weren't what they were before. With time, the cartilage regrew. Boners are fine, it's like new. Except that now it curves up and to the side a bit; the direction I broke it in."

I'd have to think about it more to really answer this, but I hope you get the idea. When I see a shy woman, who is cute, dressed cute, quiet, passionately reading in a coffee shop window - I feel magnetism from them. "
Well that‚Äôs really unfortunate 
I love when people think they deserve more breaks at work because they smoke cigarettes 
What if you punched her in her sleep.  Break up.  The next time she might stab you.  My ex did.
"You're tearing me apart. I'm always thinking of you. I'm not emotional but I'm emotional right now. Everywhere I go would probably be a bit better when you're around. I've moved on 10 times already but i've never gotten over you. We have the same interests and it kills me. I don't know how you feel or if you feel the same way and i swear it kills me. I don't mind being friends but at the same time i cant shake the feeling that we could be something more but i can't tell its like you're so close yet so far. I'm sorry im a little distant im just afraid of getting hurt all the time. I'm not the confident guy you think I am.  I just want to watch anime or those horror movies you like so much and we could cuddle into the night and not think about anything else for once.

But if you don't like me back i don't mind and i cherish the experience of feeling that i could love\(?\) again and it makes me hopeful to meet girls/women like you in the future."
I floss at least twice a day. Always do good on my dental chekups. 
Sucks when you come home and are faced with someone also coming back home.
"It's weird.

I find I have more FUN with female roommates, but living with another guy or a few guys is easier and cleaner.  Messiest roommates I've ever had have all been women.

The sink doesn't clean stuff, you have to do it manually.  Oh and your bedroom floor is not a wardrobe [edit - how you keep your room is indicative of how you do or will keep the rest of  the place].  And the bathroom is not the makeup room, get out, I need to shower and go to work."
"Yeeeep, as a dude who smokes, I'll avoid non\-smokers. I enjoy smoking, I am well aware of the dangers, and I will quit at my pace. Preaching really doesn't help, and in fact makes me want to smoke twice as much out of spite."
"School: Sophomore girl teamed up with a retired teacher to create a small prostitution ring in which she supplied the girls. They both got caught and she ended up going to jail/juvie (guy went to jail). I still remember the principals reprimanding anyone who talked about to the news reporters outside the school that week.


College: At one of my old colleges, a kid tried to commit suicide by diving head-first off the top floor in the tallest building (looked like [this](https://i0.wp.com/www.guggenheim.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/architecture-srgm-interior-low-angle-rotunda-16-9.jpg?w=870)). He miraculously survived and the campus instantly tried to make it not look like a suicide attempt. They said he simply tripped and fell over the 5-foot tall railing even though witnesses said he had a running start and people who knew him said he was stressed out from class. No news, no classes canceled that day, just stretchered him out and time went on.


Job: I used to do research at one of my old colleges and this girl apart of the project I was working with got kicked out for pretty much throwing away half of the samples we had spent hours collecting. Everyone in the project was assigned certain days to come in and do measurements n junk and she decides that she doesn't want to do it, so just fucking throws away the samples in the trash then leaves. Research leader gets pissed, kicks the girl out of the project, and coming to find out, she was just in the project to count it as job experience."
Used to love it.... :'( 
"&gt; I also dislike seeing some redditors use the word feminism as a pejorative

Yes agreed.

The way they talk about feminists, you'd swear their only exposure to feminism was from other out-of-touch men complaining exaggeratively on the internet.

Oh wait..."
"I have a small penis, so you never have to worry about your cervix getting bruised!"
Sunk cost fallacy is something you should look up.
Woah there cowboy save some tail for the rest of us.
"This exchange, right here, is why I love you, Reddit."
"I love this type of innocence. The ""I know very little about how the world actually works and I'm unsure in the bedroom"" type of innocence, not so much"
"I'd prefer not, but I wouldn't call it a dealbreaker. I smoke cigars every once in a while, so my stance on tobacco is not as harsh as it used to be."
"Other sex when I don't already have a refreshing female presence in my life.

Same sex otherwise."
I mean that‚Äôs more like shooting yourself in the foot too.
But we have no time :/
"No, but college is unique in that there‚Äôs probably the most amount of people you could meet/hang out with of similar age at one point in time. Plus, the freedom of being out of your parents‚Äô house, and fewer responsibilities like mortgages, full time jobs, kids, etc. means that there‚Äôs more time for exploring interpersonal relationships"
"""look how awful men have it in x department of life"", usually dating. 

I mean, yeah, usually the people aren't wrong (though exaggerating in usual internet fashion), but it's always the same old shit again and again. "

"I feel like this is a category that is heavily dominated by men... 

Because the only thing that‚Äôs actually attractive about them is their fame.

I even tried to google this to find an ‚Äúunconventionally attractive‚Äù female and the top result was Anna Kendrick... 

If she‚Äôs considered unconventionally attractive, who isn‚Äôt?


Edit: I feel like I need to clarify... I‚Äôm not Saying other Hollywood actresses aren‚Äôt more attractive... I‚Äôm saying that Anna meets all the ‚Äòconventions‚Äô for what is deemed attractive.

On the flip side there are actors who no woman would say is attractive if it wasn‚Äôt for the fact they were famous, for example benedict cumberbatch.

That‚Äôs how I was interpreting this question when it asked about unconventionally attractive people."
With the furrrr
Honestly it's not something I'm that interested in. I'd certainly try it for her but I think it might end up being a deal-breaker for me.

"I‚Äôd venture to guess that you‚Äôre coming across nervous and a little closed off due to preconceived notions about how your virginity will be received. 

I have a female friend in her 20s who is also a virgin. And despite being pretty and seemingly compatible on paper, she has no luck dating as well (even with men unaware of her virginity status.) She has a habit of coming across kind of cold, and tends to wall off men the second they become sexual for fear they‚Äôre *only* interested in sex, when the reality is that they‚Äôre interested in sex because it‚Äôs commonplace in dating these days, but they‚Äôd likely be open to waiting if they had communication about it. "
"My wife has this problem too. Experience was the best thing for her. So I guess I‚Äôm saying in time you won‚Äôt be caught off guard and cry because you‚Äôll know what to expect, will understand what you owned regarding the decisions and issues that were made and came about, and can defend the decisions through logic versus breaking down. 

My wife summed it up as perspective. "
"Not necessarily in an immature way, I guess just inexperience when it comes to sex and what not. "
"I was with a girl who did kegels and I'll be damned if I could tell _in flagrante delicto_ what the difference was.

I was also with a girl who did no exercises of any kind on her pelvic floor but was just naturally built with a vagina that contracted during orgasm in a way that I could best describe as doing to my dick what a milkmaid does to a cow, with the same net result of white liquid coming out quickly. Once she started climaxing, it was all over and I was guaranteed to come along for the ride myself."
"Rejection, holds me back so much"
Did it occur to you different people are responding to different posts with different comments? We're not a hive mind.
"""I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still that I become invisible to the eye. Watch."""
"Yes.  My ex's would just starfish and if I didn't initiate we wouldn't have any,  yet she would nag and shame me.  Move on."
"She farted in my face once while I was eating her out.

I thought it was hilarious, but she was fucking *mortified*."
"This happened to me as recently as a couple months ago. If an authority shouted at me, especially someone who's validation I sought, I used to feel so crestfallen because the possible loss of their approval just...broke me.           
        
I used to feel like a kid chastised by my dad.       

However, over the last two months I have constantly been validating myself and I know what value I bring. (literally telling myself you are good, you are awesome, etc.)           
Notice all the good stuff you do and all the good things the company gains because of your work - honest, incontrovertible evidence (worked for me).      

The prospect of someone shouting at me sort of starts to shift into rage. I might be quiet if I intend to take responsbility and fix it, but if it's unfair, it will probably shift into anger. "
"In my example the girl is asking a question with an obvious answer for karma whoring. Theres also the humble brag ones where they disclose that they suck their mans dick every day and they love it. 

No one fuckin cares  but its guaranteed  to hit #1 on the sub and it‚Äôll be full of the same responses. Hence circle jerk"
"More like an ongoing culture than just an advice expressed here and then, but it was made clear to me that women aren't much into sex and are more putting up with it out of love for their partner (when it's not worse.)

Oh my fucking God every time I think back about it I want to punch them."
"No youre not being weird. And good for you man, standing up for your values is a super admirable trait. just tell them to fuck off already, it's not your thing and you arent pushing any lifestyle choices on them"
My guy likes it because it‚Äôs my juices. Ha!
I‚Äôve never had it off. Don‚Äôt think I could get it off. 
"I used to live on an island.

On said island, I was 100&amp;#37; without question the best photographer, and I was the one making the most money.

Moved to Madrid 2 years ago for a masters degree in fashion photography. Here 95&amp;#37; of my classmates are better than any photographer back home, and I'd say at least 3 or 4 are world class and shouldn't even be taking this program to begin with."

"Dude... 2 pieces of bread, and BAM! SUB"
"We were eating out at a very expensive restaurant.

The food was terrible.

I was of a mind to just let it slide, never return, tell all my friends how bad it was.  She was of the opinion that if we sacrificed our money and time to eat there, we should be well-served and asked to speak to the manager. He started arguing that it's ""supposed to be like that"" (pasta so hard and brittle you could use it as mikado sticks, lukewarm drinks, etc).

She's one of those animals that lock jaws when they bite, and so she wasn't letting it go. I just sat there quietly uncomfortable through the whole thing."
"Yes, I'm funny, intelligent, sensitive, handsome and in good shape. I'm the best and only me there is. "
"""NEVER date coworkers"" 

Sometimes you shouldn't, sometimes it's fine. It's always people who have no experience with it telling you not to.

Doesn‚Äôt sound like the very best relationship there pal

"The stupid comments about how girls are too subtle blah blah blah we can't take any hints.

What a bunch of clueless nerds on this site."
"Any girl asking if guys like X 

90% of the time it‚Äôs about sex.
And 100% of the answer is yes"

"Except, you‚Äôre not single. üòë"
"Personally I think Reddit really overrates Anna Kendrick's attractiveness because she seems non-threatening as she's not uber hot and would be the kind of girl that many guys would think might be 'in their league' so to speak. Again, that's just my opinion, what's attractive is subjective. "
"In my small town, the ex-mayor and wife of the high school's principal, Linda Lusk, sent nudes and had sexual contact with her daughter's boyfriend who was 14. Their house was the place to hang out since they had a pool, so she was always around a bunch of high schoolers. She got caught when he bragged to the local football team about it.

She was only sentenced for like a couple months in jail and blamed her actions on her disabled son passing away a couple years before. What a fucking double standard.

"Cuz, im my case, it pretty much never happens. Never I was led to believe I deserve a woman in my life, so when one would show interest in me, there *must* be an ulterior motive and it is certainly not me."
