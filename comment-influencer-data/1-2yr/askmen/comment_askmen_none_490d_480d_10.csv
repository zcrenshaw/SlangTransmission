Because you're basically announcing that you have a small penis by doing that.

Time to break it off and let him know why. He's a grown ass man and should know better. Although the lack of awareness that a lot of women and men have in regards to their hygiene is astounding."

"""When all the new wears off, you don't have butterflies every time they call or text or you know you're going to see them, you're not getting all giddy about ""firsts"" in your relationship, you're no longer both on your best behavior, you can see their faults and let them see yours, you've survived a few disagreements, you're not boning every time you catch some alone time, the sex isn't mind blowing every single time. And after all that, they're still your favorite person. They still think the sun shines out your ass. you still do things for each other, for the simple joy of making them happy. The absence of the rose colored glasses of new lust hasn't been replaced with resentment, it has evolved into comfort, stability, and security with that person.""

"I think what u/TheBeardedSingleMalt is saying is that the shaming hasn't been stopped because only those who have a small penis are going to care, so by advocating for it to stop, you're admitting you have one, which is something to be ashamed of due to all the shaming, so no one wants to admit they have one, so no one advocates for it to stop.

Small breasts are a little different because we wear those front and center - it's not a secret who has small boobs so the victim isn't ""nobody"".

It's not (yet, I hope) frowned upon because there hasn't been enough of a fight against it. Attitudes are changed by changed attitudes, and no one wants to admit to a changed attitude about small penises.

Even I'm at times weary of advocating for not mocking penis size because I'm worried it will reflect on guys I've been with. It's bullshit, but social pressures are real and tangled and messy."

"I cut out the woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

I was with a girl that was basically everything that I ever wanted, and I was extremely happy. She had raven hair, stormy black eyes, flawless pale skin, and she was the most beautiful woman I had ever known in my life. I used to love things like the sound of her laugh, and the small smile at the corner of her lips when I would run my fingers through her hair, which was soft like blackened silk. The way her nose wrinkled when she laughed, the way she would blush when you complimented her, and the fact that she hated her knees. She was so delicate and goddamned *beautiful* to look at and talk to, and she had this kindness, gentleness, and wonderful honest innocence that you don't find often. Things were good for a long time, and we had an extremely passionate and fun relationship. The kind of shit you see in movies before it all goes to hell.

She had major walls that took me years to get through, despite our happiness. See, I was a thousand percent smitten, and she just wasn't where I was emotionally. However, I was so patient I could have won a damn award, because every fiber of my being told me that she was what I wanted. Things like her scent and the taste of kissing her was like a magnetic attraction that I'd never felt with anybody else. I don't believe in soulmates or any of that shit, but it honestly felt just about as close to having somebody made for you biologically that you can feel, and I understand why people believe in the concept. I literally put my heart and soul into that relationship, but after a while I started to realize that I wasn't receiving back what I was putting in emotionally. When we would have issues, she would push me away physically and emotionally, and it would cause me the most bitter pain in my heart. I think she always had one foot out the door with me, and she felt like our relationship had an expiration date. She would go through the motions, but I could see something in her eyes that told me she wasn't as happy as I was, and it wasn't necessarily something I could fix. I persisted forward, with the hopes that we could overcome that. I knew that she loved me in her own way, but I couldn't shake the feeling that she didn't see the future the way I saw it, and it felt like I was swimming against a tidal wave.

After a while, I started to become emotionally exhausted. My heart hurt all the time, and I started to feel bitter towards her. I had put in *so* much work, and I felt like I was getting so little in return. We never talked about the future, we never talked about our plans. Everything was in the moment, and nothing more. She would plead with me to just be happy with the present and not think about the future, and I hated hearing those words. I really tried to not be selfish, and to remember that these kinds of things can happen in relationships. I tried to communicate my honest feelings to her, but she would tell me that she was trying the best that she could and asked me not to push her for more. Part of me actually believed her, which made it even worse knowing that somebody's best efforts at loving you made you feel like shit. I mean, I wasn't asking a lot in return. I just wanted to feel like she wasn't thinking of leaving me eventually, because it hung over our relationship like a cloud even though she never said the words.

She started delaying her Master's Degree applications in order to stay near me while I finished school, and I could tell it was hard on her. She started to feel depressed, and useless. It strained our relationship even more, and I felt like maybe she blamed me for not being able to move forward with her education. She had strict goals for herself and would sacrifice just about anything to get there. She started sleeping less and less, and she would cry often. I would take her in my arms, but after a while it started to feel like there wasn't anybody there, even though I could feel her.

Finally one day I knew that I had to end it. It was the absolute hardest decision of my life, but I knew that things weren't going to get better. *I was ruining her life, but she couldn't let me go.* We both clearly wanted different things, and several years of trying my best really didn't do much. I ended it, and I cut her out completely. She tried to come back and fix things once she realized that I was seriously through, but I had kind of reached a point of no return. I drank a lot over the next year, but I ended up moving forward with my life and finding a great career. She taught me a lot about how to succeed, and I've never forgotten it. She showed me how to be fiercely independent, and how to get my shit together and focus on important things in life.

That was years ago. The story above was long, and I didn't really do it justice due not wanting to write a wall of text. I still think about her sometimes, but the sound of her voice has faded and I don't remember every single feature on her face like I used to. The smell of coffee reminds me of her, and honeysuckle. I think that I still carry a lot of her with me today, but I think everyone carries a part of their exes with them, whether it's a taste for certain foods or even the way you look at the world. She taught me how to see the world as a beautiful place. Still, sometimes she comes to me in dreams and I wake up with a feeling of sadness. She was the one that got away, and I was the one that released her.

I saw a picture of her a while back, and she looked happier than I had ever seen her. Her hair still falls across her face in the same way, her eyes are still stormy, and I remember when once that smile was just for me. She finished that Masters and has a great job, or at least I hope it's great. I know that her family is probably so proud of her, and she's on the right track. I think that I made the right decision, as much as I fucking hate it.

Cutting her out let me keep the memories that we had together without ruining them completely. I got her for a while, but I guess she just wasn't mine to keep. I know it seems like I'm insane and I haven't moved on, but I honestly have. I just had to leave a piece of me behind all those years ago and adapt to it not being there, and those kinds of things stay with you. If you read this, thanks. I haven't really talked about this for a long time, and it felt good to write it out.

"I am 24yo and I used to have one friend from college, but we had a falling out last year and I became friendless. At first I was okay with not having friends, then it got a little bit depressing.

So my birthday was coming up and I decided to throw a small party for the family and invited 2 old friends from school with whom I had not talked in years and it went great. I have since been talking and hanging out with one of them, so I have one friend now. And we will meet up with another one in a few days, so maybe that will make 2 of them."

"We were at a bar talking about my surname. There's a bit of a story to how my family got the name, which is:

My grandfather was a Jewish German who was sent to live with a foster family in Wales during the Nazi regime in order to keep him safe. When he went to enlist in the British Army during the war, the military told him he would have to change his surname, as they thought a soldier with a heavily German surname could be used as propaganda if he were captured. He took the foster family's surname, and that's how everyone in the family now has that surname.

After I told this story to the girl I was dating, her response was, ""Oh wow! Which war was that?"""

"&gt; What does it feel like for a man if a woman tightens her vaginal muscles during sex?

Depending on the tightness, which can notably vary depending on a wide array of factors (position, monthly cycle, ...)  like the world's silkiest hug, or like my glans is being almost being crushed.

&gt; So, can you tell when your partner is tensing up during sex?  

Definitely.

&gt; Do you like it, or does it help tightness at all on your end? 

It feels lovely, very pleasurable, intimate and sometimes playfully-funny (e.g. when she squeezes me in response to my penis throbbing involuntarily) when done rhythmically. I like it.

But it's not a make or break thing when it comes to enjoyable sex. 

&gt; It’s not a huge issue, my man still cums and has never said anything about it but I’m aware I’m not as tight as some women are. 

Personally I think you're overthinking it.

I vastly prefer the 90% of times where she's very tented, relaxed, ""loose"" and consequently her vagina feels like a silken, drooling, gentle, magically soft paradise over those 10% of times at the height of her period cycle where her vagina randomly bites down and it just feels tight and all the other sensations are drowned out by that tightness. Because I have a sensitive penis between my legs, not an iron steam piston."

"Almost dated a girl who took horoscopes VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. She would read them every day and base her decisions, from trivial ones to life decisions on horoscopes.

Not taking care of one’s self is a common marker of mental health issues. He goes to the gym and works out, so he is aware of the concept of taking care of yourself in some ways, so he can’t plead ignorance here. But yet, despite taking pride in his fitness or body or muscles, he takes no pride in basic cleaning routines for his body? That’s bizarre. 

And his seemingly deep-seated sexual issues to equate properly wiping himself with dirty (in his mind) sexual contact? He’s basically saying the concept or sensation of a man’s hand (even his own) in his private places calls to mind such vivid sexuality which he finds so viscerally wrong and dirty, that it actually trumps how wrong and dirty it is to leave feces straight-up caked on his ass?

He’s a whole big stew of issues.

I’m not a licensed mental health professional (just an amateur one, with some of my experiences, apparently), but... He’s got mental health stuff going on for sure. 

And it sounds like part of it is deeply rooted in sexual touching that he is deathly afraid of."

What man tells anyone they have a small penis 
[deleted]
"OP isn't saying that, he's asking why the body shaming of those who DO have a small penis is considered acceptable. Why it's not frowned upon. If you shame a woman for having small breasts or some other part of their body that they can't control, you're a shitty person, but shaming a dude for having a small dick? Totally ok. Hell, just look at the flair given to OP. Most of the comments in this thread are garbage, and it sucks. "
He figured he shouldn't neuter his dog because his dog knew better than to start a family.
"I always say I have a small penis (at least before I was married). Keeps expectations low, and if they don't think it's small they get a decent surprise. Unless they were getting with me because I have a small penis, but you can't please everyone. Especially not with my penis"

"Dating a girl in college that I had my eye on for 2 years. Finally got with her. About 4 months into the relationship we both finished college. Both finance majors, and I was really in to her, and we talked about moving in together after college.

She had no job during school, nor one lined up for after. She was a horse nut, and envied my BMW. So of course, she goes out and buys a CPO BMW, at 9% interest with no money down for 7 years, and of course buys a horse because why not? Boards it at a ranch super far away but lavish, so board ain’t cheap, and needs to buy more shit to saddle it and feed...

She comes to me and explains that she can’t afford all this, and needs me to chip in “cuz I’ll get to ride the horse and drive the car sometimes”... she comes up with the brilliant idea to have ME pay for all of our potential fixes expenses (rent, car, horse, cell, utilities, etc), and HER money will pay for fun stuff... fun stuff at her discretion of course.

Dumped that chick that night. Went home, informed those who might be affected, took sleeping pill and earplugs and passed the F out. That next morning I had ~200 calls and texts from her, about 30 voicemails, 5 more voicemails from her MOTHER, and a call from the leasing office telling me she had been there between 1-4 AM screaming my name and banging on my door... glad I parked my car elsewhere otherwise I’m sure it would have been trashed.

Edit: I’ve answered some questions below. And yes, Horse chicks are crazy... and crazy hot. As another fun fact, she admitted to me that she always got horny during equestrian training..."
"A big part of it is what the purpose of sex is to you. 

People who stay in 50 year relationships banging the whole way through dont view sex the same as someone who has had 50 exciting partners.

Typically  LTR that involve regular, lustful sex uses sex as a tool to reaffirm love/trust/acceptance/forgiveness and other squishy feelings.

Exciting sex with new people is a celebration of just how sexy and charismatic you both are by engaging in the greatest feeling in the world. As the hormones and new relationship energy dies away, the need to celebrate this is lessened.

That's my view anyways."
"The same moment that I realized she was *never* the one to initiate interesting or intellectual conversations.

I had this strange thought:  ""She lives her life the same way that my dog lives his -- in the immediate moment, and in the immediate surroundings, *only*.""  There was no imagination, no thirst for knowledge, no yearning for answers to life's deeper questions.  Just existing and reacting.

I broke it off that day."

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the supporting messages guys! I feel like I got a big virtual hug (which I kinda needd)! :) "
It takes guys with big dicks and some actual spine to stick up for anyone insecure. Making fun of someone for this is just as petty as it gets and usually tells anyone with an ounce of self respect that you aren't happy with your own body. Respect your fellow man.

"I don't know your situation but, if you two only went out for 2 months, have you maybe considered that this might not be about her? Maybe you are fixating on her to avoid facing other issues you are dealing with. Also, the last line sounds like depression; talking to a therapist might be really helpful for you. Good luck dude!"
"You probably attract more women than you think but might be too shy to put yourself out there. Your description sounds a lot like what I'm like but what really got me moving along was not being scared of rejection.

Yo I’m getting married TODAY. It’s very hard to put into words how I feel about her but I feel a connection that I can’t describe. It’s a connection that makes me know exactly what she’s feeling at any given second and I know she knows how I feel. I would sacrifice everything for her and I know she feels the same way. Love just can’t really be described imho but I know I’m in it.

"this was 20 years ago. So me and some friends all went out for a group movie, sort of a low key date for several of us who were interested in each other

this was common back then and this time we let a girl i was sort of interested in pick the movie (we took turns picking). For some reason none of us could understand, she picked the Chuck Norris movie ""Top Dog"". If you are unfamiliar, the poster for this movie is Chuck Norris, a police badge, and a dog, nothing else. Very clean and simple

So we all show up for the movie, some of us ask why she picked such a dumbshit choice, and the previews play, Top Dog starts, the first scene is Chuck Norris and a dog, and this girl says ""there's a dog in this?"" in an incredulous tone. 

Less than 5 min later she gets her purse and leaves the movie. Since all of us were only there because she picked it, we all left too.

However, someone in a completely unrelated department whom my mom rarely ever had to deal with slighted her and the company didn’t do enough in her opinion. So she quit and took at a part-time job as a receptionist for a mechanic shop. 

I later learned that my mom was actually partly responsible for the whole situation because this lady heard my mom talk shit about her. So she returned in kind. The job was a big deal and she would have been making just as much as my stepdad on a good year. I don’t think he really ever forgot that. "

I’m driving her home and ask her where she lives off the highway. She tells me to get off the highway at the exit for a certain road. I explained to her that that road doesn’t cross this highway and she must be thinking of the adjacent highway. Nope, it’s this one, and she’s sure of it. So I say ok and keep driving. I kept asking her where the exit was and she said it was coming up. I drove ya to the next state before finally telling her she was fucking wrong and we passed her exit on the other highway half an hour ago. So now I’m pissed, turn around and get her to her house.

This is common when you have a LOT of shit on your mind or work in a highly technical field. Mental exhaustion is a thing and sometimes it's really subtle.

"Saw this from OP:

&gt;Rachael. Never gotten over you, and possibly never will. It's been almost 5 and a half months since we last spoke but you have lived on in my mind in a daily, almost minute-by-minute basis. I knew you for 2 months, but no one I ever knew in my entire life, moved my very existence, my very purpose for being like you have. And it hurts knowing I caused all of this.

&gt;When you texted me happy birthday in March, it was the happiest I've been since December. But since, this perpetual state of depression I've been in has fractured my friendships with my best friends, they don't understand why I can't move on and I've pushed them away, stripped all motivation for anything in life, just go to work, come home, sit alone, think of you, go to sleep, repeat, I've probably finished 30 gallons of vodka since I last seen you, don't really eat much over 1000 cals, so I lost like 40 pounds since, i guess one upside, but I don't want to tell you these things. You just have so much on your plate: grad school, your life, church, volunteering, your family. And so, maybe I knew I wasn't good enough all along, but when you were there, I pushed my life in a direction much better just to have the satisfaction knowing I could feel worthy of you. But now.... I see no point to this, really.

To OP and any other guy out there who is feeling like this:

You pushed your friends away? Give them a call and go hang out with them. If they don't answer on the first call, give them a day to come to their senses.

You mentioned all of the things she has going on in her life: get something going on in your life."
Them don't go to bars. Go do what you enjoy. Stop trying to get laid and start trying to live a life you want to live. Women will come and go but hopefully your passion and hobbies will stick around.

"Long, long, sad story.


My oldest friend is a guy I have known since we were in preschool Sunday school together. We were best buddies from day one. We didn't go to the same school, but we went to the same church and basically lived at each other's houses every weekend and all through Summer vacation.


He is/was a geeky, nerdy guy and never managed to have success in the dating scene, but he got good grades and a good job right out of college.


A few years later, I got married and that's when the trouble started. He became depressed and obsessed with his lack of ability to ""get a girl,"" and would call me *every day* complaining about it. (Pre-cell-phone era.)   




These phone conversations were frustrating and awkward for me because he would not change the subject and nothing I could say was good enough.   
I would try to buck him up by reminding him that he's healthy, has a good job he likes, has money in the bank and lives in a great apartment. He would come back with, ""Yeah. I'm sitting here in my 'great apartment'...all alone.""   
If I so much as even mentioned my wife, he would go into a spiral. Anything I said, even if I complained about her, he would reply, ""Must be nice to have *your* problems!""


He figured out the exact time I got home from work each night, and many times the phone would be ringing as I was walking in the door. Eventually my wife had to start lying to him that I wasn't home yet so I could at least get something to eat before returning his call. (Sometimes, when I picked up the phone to call him back, it felt like it weighed a hundred pounds.)    
I stuck it out. He was my oldest and closest friend. He would have done the same for me.


Then came the day when he finally ""got a girl."" I met her once or twice and she was a real piece of work. She was not charming or intelligent, and she reminded me of a stripper in a really low-class dive bar. She wore a lot of makeup and overdressed in a tramp way--tight skirts and stiletto heels and stuff like that. She was one of those women who look super-hot from a couple of blocks away, until you get up close and go, ""Ugh.""


Our daily phone calls then revolved around the subject of his attempts to get her to sleep with him. He spent tons of money on her, and she would make promises and back out. This sounded really unhealthy to me and I tried to get him to see reason, but he just kept it up.


Finally, she agreed to have sex with him *once* if he took her on a 7-night Caribbean cruise. And he agreed.   
I was pulling my hair out, ""Dude, just get a prostitute if you want to get laid! This is not a healthy relationship!"" But he was beyond reason. 


When they got back from their cruise, he asked her to marry him. She said she would marry him if he bought her a big house in the country with a barn so she could have horses. He bought the big house (going *deep* into debt) and they set a wedding date. 


He asked me to be his best man. I agreed because he was my oldest friend, and it was a miserable experience. My wedding toast to the bride and groom was...unenthusiastic. What could I say? I tried my best. The whole atmosphere of the wedding was just plain weird. (Guess who paid for the wedding.)


After that, I was just broken. I actively started avoiding him and not returning his calls. I helped him move and visited him exactly once, then we drifted apart.



Seven or eight years go by. Then, out of the blue, he calls me and asks if we can meet for lunch. At lunch he explains that he's getting a divorce because his wife has been cheating on him.  
 She had decided to go to college and picked a school in another town about fifty miles away. He paid her tuition for six years and she never finished her degree. To ""make things easier"" he had rented her a nice apartment in her college town. So she spent six years blowing off classes and partying with any number of guys while he paid for all of it. He *finally* figured out what was happening.


So now he's going through a divorce and so deep in debt that he's declared bankruptcy. Bad times for my old friend. I pretty much cleared my schedule, had lunch with him several times a week, and hung out with him as often as possible while he went through it. 



This lasted for about a month. Then he met a girl online who lived 300 miles away in another state. He drove over and had a date with her. They chatted for a week. The next weekend, he drove back to see her and asked her to marry him and she agreed.


This was just insane. I, again, tried to talk some sense into him. No dice. He asked me to be his best man again, but this time I said no. I regret that I didn't have the courage to tell him honestly why I was refusing. Instead I lied and made an excuse about being too busy to travel 300 miles for a wedding that day. If I had been honest and told him I thought he was making a foolish mistake, I don't think it would have done any good.



This second wedding happened about five years ago. I haven't talked to him since that time.   
 Maybe his new wife is a great girl. Maybe they're incredibly happy together. I honestly hope so. I still wish him the best, but for now I am done with it.

When I don't know a woman very well but she feels really exciting and the most important person on earth, that's really just lust and infatuation in my experience. I don't think I could really love someone with having spent a lot of time with them and gone through shared experiences. "

"It's extremely lonely.  I find myself alright living on my own and surviving within my own individual means.  I also have many ways to keep myself entertained, but I miss the spontaneity of sharing adventures with people.  I have a concert coming up on the 27th and got 2 tickets back when I was with my ex. We broke up 1 month ago and I found myself with no one in mind to take with me to the concert.  Never have I felt so lonely, being unable to share good moments with some like minded individuals. As a result, I come on to reddit and read through comments religiously to satisfy my need to socialize.  "
"To be honest, that's a totally valid question if you don't know the US. "
"She said I love you. I said it back because I ""had to"", despite planning to break up with her. It's almost 2 years ago now, and I still hate myself for that."

"Yes - no matter what anyone says, no one is going to question you for wearing a suit to any type of business/Office environment job. Hell my first job out of college had an interview over Skype and I wore a suit.

"Yeah, that's pretty much how these predatory dealerships offering ""No Credit/Bad Credit OK!"" work, and it was the fact that she even went into one of these dealerships that indicated to me that she had some basic financial stupidity. When she said it was the only place that would finance her, I knew I didn't want to date her anymore. No biggie tho...we only went on 2 dates and were not that serious. But I was done with her after that. "
"I was dating a woman that I shouldn't have, because I'm an idiot.  IT came about that she'd slept with my oldest friend and most of my other friends knew.  I had been working under the assumption that this had happened, off a gut feeling.  It just made sense.

It took six months for her to fess up, which was good of her I suppose.  I cut 95% of the friends I had out of my life, and not long after, her as well.

I tried not to shame anyone, I tried not to make a whole huge deal out of it.  I did confront that friend directly and made him talk to me privately and just fucking tell me the truth, I did not yell, I just wanted what should have happened to happen.

It's worked out well, I talk to almost none of them, and that's fine.  It was a good point for me to grow up into someone I'd rather be, and I'm better off now for it.

Also, don't hold people to impossible standards.  And don't lust after someone that does not want you back.  It is not healthy.  Spend time on yourself and attract someone who really is interested in you, and give them the time of day.  That is some advice I could have used 20 years ago."
"I got a great deal, its like 23% interest. They said that was pretty much the highest you could get."
"I tried to ask her out with a Ouija board and she started screaming about Satan.

He is 60 now, and takes classes every few months in woodworking or gardening because he still loves to learn.

Mentioned I had a roomba and it keeps the floor pretty clean. One girl started freaking out and saying there was no way she'd allow a roomba in the apartment. She asked why we all weren't scared of the roomba coming to life and harming us in our sleep.

One of the other roommates asked how she could fear the roomba but not suspect her smart phone of gaining sentience and killing everyone. This idea scared her more and she actually freaked out. She was literally screaming. "
"I work in HR for a very casual tech company. I still always tell (and expect) candidates to wear business attire to an interview.

You're selling yourself to us and if you show up looking sloppy and lazy, I'm going to assume you don't care about this interview enough to put on some damn khakis."

"I take myself on dates.

Just this weekend, on Friday I walked downtown to see an all-female Led Zeppelin cover band with a couple guy friends then went for some food cart munchies and drinks. On Saturday I had tickets to a symphony performance so I dressed up in my nice suit and headed to the concert hall. Grabbed a couple cocktails afterward and enjoyed a nice walk back home looking fly.

Taking yourself on dates is great! You can do whatever you want, there's no tension, and you always get laid at the end."
"Went to some chain restaurant, can't remember which, but something like a Chili's, or Applebee's.  The menu had quips on some of the items, like, ""Mom's meatloaf was never this good!"" Or, ""This burger is more than a mouthful!""

So next to the loaded nachos, it says, ""Caution, Heavy Lifting may be required!""

She asks me what that means and I tell her that they must have a lot of toppings.

She asks the server, ""Excuse me, but what does heavy lifting may be required mean?""

The server kinda smirks for a second thinking that there's a joke there somewhere, but then gets a look of dread when she realizes that my date was deadly serious. "

I used to idolize him as a child and even though I was constantly disappointed, because I lived with my mother and only got to see him occasionally I always forgave him.

As I grew up my image changed a lot and once I moved out of my mothers house and across the country struggling to make it on my own, he called me one day asking to borrow 700 dollars to pay his old tickets to get his license reinstated so he could drive to his new job and would pay me back so I did.
Never called me again.
If he had been a man and said thank you and told me that he couldn’t pay me back, no big deal that’s family, I’ve helped other family members besides him, but to take a cowards way out irked me, 
Then he had a tax lien placed against him and even though he hadn’t lived in the house my parents bought 20 years before in 10 years,

"I'm a 30 year old man who is with the gal I'm going to marry. She's what I would consider my fourth ""relationship"" and I've probably asked out or at least flirted with a couple hundred girls.

"* Taking male interest for granted. With online dating in particular, girls can give off the impression they're just there for the attention rather than the guy. Guys who have standards will have limited patience for this.

* Giving up their agency. Sure, you can wait to be asked out...but you're heavily restricting your dating pool. I've seen an eery pattern of relationships that end around mid-twenties: The woman suddenly notices she only ended up with the guy because he was the only one who seemed seriously interested in her five years ago and **she's not actually attracted to him**. 

* Buying into the whole sex as a good/commodity thing. It overcomplicates things. I get the fear of being used for sex and dropped. But treating sex as a good that you have to get equal value for doesn't solve this. Looking out for a partner who's interested in your welfare does. And IMO, that kind of partner will not think of sex as a commodity to be traded either. So be on the lookout for *that* and make it a hard deal-breaker.

* Overinterpreting things: ""This is what I want, but it might give off this impression or look like that and how do I do this? And what does he *really* mean when he says X?"" I don't think at all that women are *that* more complex creatures than men or that men always say what they mean. We can obfuscate, lie and pretend just as well as the girls...but I think men learn to take things at face-value more than women because it brings a certain kind of stoic peace-of-mind.

I think it was Bad Moms but I couldn't find the clip, although that led me to another clip where they are talking about how disgusting uncircumcised dicks are. Again, double standard.

"If you dated someone for two months and now you can’t imagine life without her, that means your own personal life is so deficient that the difference between now and before was extremely palpable and your brain is latching on to the girl as being the factor, not a change in your lifestyle.

You need to get a hobby. I mean that seriously. Establishing a base for yourself and your own life without a relationship will keep you happy when single and make your romantic relationships more stable and productive. Put together an idea of what your life consists of, and go around getting an idea from happy people of what their life consists of. Essentialize it as much as possible. If someone tells you they rock climb and that makes them happy, that doesn’t mean rock climbing will make *you* happy, but it does mean that exercise will. Exercise that is consistent and productive is an enormous factor in mental and emotional health.

"He's fantasized about your attractive friends, sister(s), . . . mom (?).

How long it took him to muster up the courage to ask you out.

How many rejections he's had before landing a date. How many times he's had girls ghost him.

How many women have questioned his sexual orientation when he rejected *them.*

He compliments your cooking/fashion/interior decorating even when he doesn't like it (or your friend's). He's just trying to be supportive.

He hates that one close female friend of yours who's a bad influence, complains about men and tries to sabotage your relationship. 

He's suspicious that male co-worker or close male friend you talk to a lot is interested in you, but stays quiet because he doesn't want to seem jealous or insecure.

He's haunted by that time an ex-girlfriend spread malicious rumors about him after the breakup so she'd be the victim and him be the bad guy.  

He doesn't share emotions because he's worried you'll lose attraction for him.

How much it annoys him when you try to analyze what he said, as if there's a hidden subtext. Like he's saying something but he means something else.  There is nothing else, he says what he means and means what he says.

How much it hurts him when he tries to compliment you, tell you how beautiful he thinks you are, but you don't believe his compliments due to low self-esteem. Worse, if you seem more cheered up by compliments from a stranger rather than him, your SO.

If it’s been a while, he’s worried about sex life dwindling but doesn't know how to rekindle it and doesn't want to pressure you.

He doesn't tell you certain things because he thinks you'll tell all your friends. Men think their personal lives are private by default. Some women share everything with their best friend(s) by default.  His fears and doubts, sexual performance, financial standing, etc.

"1) Cut my hair. I loved my long hair but it was ugly af, made me look shabby and I don't miss it one bit.

2) Started talking to women with more than the sole intention of getting with them. Turns out women are just as fun and interesting to speak to as men so cut the 'game', cut the 'seduction', have an actual conversation with a human being and you might be surprised how easily it drifts to flirting if the mutual attraction is there. If it doesn't, well congratulations you made a new friend. 

3) Started to back myself and view myself as someone women want. Self-confidence is hard to acquire on your own but when someone gives you a little, focus on it, fight negative influences and that confidence will grow."

"Had a friend. He used to work for my dad, he is 10 years older than me. He taught me the trade I'm in now. We were like brothers and he moulded my early adult life more than my actual brother.

We would drink together, recreationaly take drugs together, I would stay at his house with his Mrs and have a laugh.

Over the years he changed, Tight with money, erratic behaviour. He would buy products related to our trade off my father then not pay him back for a long time, even though he had been paid, even though my father had treated him like a son. 

He left my dads business after 8 years and things changed for good. He would only get in touch when he needed something or support, never for a catch up or a beer or anything.

The final breaking point came after he ordered goods totalling £380 off my father, then disappeared for a month (more fool my father) so I gave the man who was an usher at my wedding and a godfather to my child and ultimatum. Pay the bill by the Monday or I would pay and he would be dead to me.

He never paid and I learnt a lesson. I've never told anyone this before and it feels good to vent. I blocked him off all social media, blocked his number. We have mutual friends and he still try's to get through to me through them.

Fuck that guy"

"Just speaking from my experience at that age, the “men are trash” mindset comes from women who think too much with their vagina instead of their brain when dating someone. Note this isn’t unique to younger women, guys this age do the same thing (with their dick).

What I mean by that is they choose partners almost solely on strong physical attraction. So when their personalities inevitably clash, things end badly. This repeats until they become jaded.

Do you need physical attraction in a relationship? Absolutely. Do you need emotional attraction and compatibility as well? Hell yes, and that’s what many younger people forget when dating. Many live and learn and snap out of it, but some don’t."

"If you open up tinder and swipe right until you run out of swipes, on average, how many matches would you get?

For most guys that number is 0, with the occasional 1.  After a week let's say, those 1s accumulate you now you have maybe 4 in your queue.  So you look at their pics, their bio, try to think of something witty to say to them, something that comes off as fun, isn't creepy, isn't boring, and hasn't been said by 100 other guys before.  So you carefully do that, and you get  1, maybe 2 to respond.  You know they damn well won't message you first. 

So the you try to get a conversation going. You try to be flirty and fun, not creepy, and interesting   You think about each message before you send it, and you get one word responses back.  You know this isn't going anywhere, but you figure your going to shoot your shot anyway.  You ask them to meet up, and most of the time, you get radio silence.  You better have a time and place ready too, even if you have no idea what's in their area, because if they have to think about it, they won't respond. So get good at googling. If you're lucky, they'll shoot you down with an excuse, without suggesting an alternative. 

So you do this for about a month, and you finally get a girl to agree! If you live far though, get ready to do most of the driving.  If it isn't within 10 minutes of her, it ain't happening, even if it's an hour for you. Make sure you budget for it, cause you're paying too. You meet up, and have a good time. However, you know she could decide to ditch you at any moment.  Maybe a better dude comes along. Maybe she just wanted a free dinner.  Maybe she wants an emotional tampon.  Maybe she's a great girl but has severe psychological issues and you don't want to be up until 3 in the morning every few weeks convincing her not to kill her self.  So you keep swiping, because you know it's going to take you a month to get another date, so you figure might as well start putting the work in now. You also are still probably talking to last months girl. 

Edit to say thanks for the gold! First gold ever! Who knew my frustration would pay off "
"Unrealistic expectations is huge for young, inexperienced women (and men in a different way). 

Many young women see the sensationalized romance in film, TV, social media, etc. and get this expectation that if their relationship isn't constantly escalating in excitement and new experiences, then it's not worth sticking through it and they must sift through the sea of guys for their Prince Charming. Eventually they figure out that that kind of life only exists for the financially affluent, and is really only a one-dimensionally-falsified depiction of those lifestyles, but the notion seems to plague them until they date around more.

Young women often seek hyper-confident ""bad boys"" because of how attractive they are and how the adrenaline makes them feel, or alternatively they seek ""safe guys"" so they can maintain control over the relationship without feeling mentally threatened. Both almost always cause distress in the relationship if those guys don't have the ability top keep things constantly fresh (not very often). 

These expectations only exist because a lot of parents don't exert a visibly healthy romance, so children turn to the media in order to understand it. Obviously they know that some of it is fiction, but given how culturally women are raised to think about relationships and their roles, it's a recipe for disaster."

And there was a lot of forearm exercise in between."

"Okay so some people may disagree with me but I do not believe that love is a single feeling that you hold on too. Love is a bond and a connection that can have so many different feelings, mostly good ones, sometimes bad ones, sometimes no feelings. The important thing is that forgiveness and respect rule your relationship from \_both\_ sides. You should feel needed and wanted, and so should they. Not at *all times*, you're allowed to have rough spots. In fact having a level of healthy discourse Is a good reminder that you both are still human beings trying their best. A lot of relationships and marriages get stale when one partner finally just decides that they are going to roll over for good and let the other do everything.

Though I don't consider myself one anymore, I was raised a Christian. Out of the whole bible there is one thing I believe 100&amp;#37; and always will. That is the way Paul defined love to the Corinthian church:

&gt;1 Corinthians 13:4\-74  
&gt;  
&gt;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self\-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."

"Generally: Complimenting a woman on something physical has the potential to be taken poorly. If you want to give compliments its better to compliment something she has control over, like “Your dress looks nice” vs “Wow you look great in that dress” (former complimenting the dress, latter complimenting the body.) 


That said, im a woman and if some random guy complimented my eyes I’d feel complimented and be on my way. Yeah, I’d probably assume they’re attracted to me, but I’m not going to automatically assume they’re expressly trying to pick me up unless they persist with me. Different people will take interaction with strangers differently of course. 


Tips for success:

* In a non social setting where you’re approaching a random stranger, compliment a woman with the intention to compliment her and then go on your way. If you compliment here and then kinda stand around waiting for her to “reward” you for giving the compliment with conversation, it won’t seem sincere. You need to be able to read her cues well to gauge whether she actually wants to talk or not, but chances are she’s got shit to do if you’ve approached her randomly in public (errands, work, has to meet someone) and doesn’t have time for you interjecting into her schedule. 

* In a more social setting (party, bar, etc) then you could use a compliment as a cold opener. The compliment would likely sound more sincere (and less pick up line-y) if you just have some casual conversation first and then drop the “You know I just have to tell you that you’ve got crazy nice eyes.” 


* Being “creepy” means something different to everyone, just like all the other adjectives in the world. But it has less to do with what you’re actually saying and more to do with an inability to appropriately gauge social interaction (Ex: persisting when she’s not eager to talk to you, asking too personal of questions, leaning in too close or touching when you barely know her.)"
"I actually don't think she's an idiot at all for this. I don't know her personally, but I know a few people who wouldn't take that deal. It must be stressful as fuck and the hours a slog. Depending at what age she was at, she might have wanted to start a family instead as well.

More responsibility and more hours doesn't necessarily make you any happier, regardless of how much you'd get paid. Some people are more than satisfied in a quiet job for less pay.

"I see you mentioning bars, which I have never had much success with *unless* I was there with friends. I could enjoy myself, talk to a girl, and if it didn't go well fall back to my friends. 

Speaking of which, making friends who like to do active, social things is a really effective way to meet girls. 

When you are actually talking to a girl you should make your intentions to make this something more than a friendship clear. Not necessarily verbally, more so by your actions. Think of not making it clear you are attracted to her as being dishonest. 

Keep plugging away at it. It may take months to start really seeing much of a difference in how well you attract girls. After a couple years of making a point to be more social and ""put myself out there"" meeting girls was hardly on my mind anymore because it came so naturally. It became more of an issue of me liking them than them liking me."

"This is not true. I'm a fat guy. I know I'm fat. I've known I was fat since middle school. Every day the world reminds you that you are fat, whether it's disapproving looks at fast food joints, the constant barrage of gym and weight loss product advertisements, the obvious disparity between the latest Bachelor or Bachelorette with their shirt off and you with yours off, squeezing into a tiny airplane seat, your ""helpful"" friends and family saying ""well, if you would only ___ you'd lose weight.""

There is no such thing as a fat person that isn't fully cognizant of their weight all day every day. The difference is, the ""fat acceptance"" movement that has sprung up is a massive pendulum shift overreaction to the notion that America is pretty darn obese. We've gone from jokes about Howard's mother on Big Bang Theory to ""Fuck you, I'm 5'2"" and 400 lbs and I'm BEAUTIFUL!""

And the reaction has happened *because* of America's obsession with obesity. The Biggest Loser, every third commercial on daytime and primetime TV, the chubby best friend that never gets the girl, it's constant. So *of course* fat people are going to shut down and wall up and say ""fuck you"" to the whole thing.

Obesity is a disease. Life-threatening. Treatable. Often (but not always) voluntary at least to start. Over the past few decades, we've slowed or stopped the use of mental health, alcoholism, HIV, and dysphoria as punchlines, and yet obesity continues, so some of us fatties are digging in our heels on it.

Is it an overreaction? Hell yes. It's ridiculous to say that someone with the proportions of Violet Beauregard post-gum is absolutely perfect just the way they are. That's a horrifyingly dangerous disregard for anatomical science. But these people don't need to be mocked or shamed. Fat people don't need to be a punchline or a clickbait headline. We need to have friends and family and a culture that supports us in positive, constructive ways that lead toward weight loss and overall improvement in health.

If that 400 lb person shooting Instagram videos hashtag sexyaf and bigisbeautiful could take a pill be 200 lbs tomorrow, they'd hypocrite the fuck out of that pill in two seconds flat. But they're afraid of what their weight is doing to their arteries and joints. They're afraid of dying in their sleep from apnea or a heart attack. And diet and exercise are goddamned hard no matter what Jenny Craig or Planet Fitness want you to believe. And they're lashing out with a self-delusion that only embeds deeper and deeper the more the world lashes out at them.

I've lost nearly 40 lbs this year and I've got another 32 to go before I get under 200 for the first time since literally freshman year of high school. I know that I'm obese. The world reminds me every day and the scale reminds me every morning."
Do you have any female friends? I fricking love taking my guy friends shopping. All the fun without spending my own money AND I feel like I'm helping a friend out!
"True! I was just thinking about a quote from Avatar: ""Pride is not the opposite of shame, but its source. True humility is the only antidote to shame."""
"Excessive anger. Like don't get me wrong now, I certainly think a girl is fine to stand up for herself and not take shit from nobody, but I can't stand women who are constantly just bitching and airing their dirty laundry on social media or shit talking their exes."
"Because whenever a man tries to point out anything negative directed towards men he’s met with scorn and ridicule. 

Women’s issues are serious and need to be dealt with. Men’s issues don’t matter much to anyone except maybe as a punch line. 

Like when a woman cut off a man’s penis and threw it in the garbage disposal - and a handful of women sat on national television and joked about it.

"A woman who always expects you to text first or make plans, who expects you get jealous of her male friends, stuff like that.

Anything that isn't being an active and enthusiastic participant."

"Girls get brought out under the guise of making money, get stranded when they don't get said money, and then get offered a job camming or doing porn so they can afford a plane ticket home.

"If you like being chased, don't be surprised if someone's behavior changes when they ""catch"" you."

It's not that I hate my job, but I'm forced to talk about work all day, so I'd prefer to talk about other things when I have the chance."
"Female here. I'm obsessed with skincare. There are quite a few skincare subs with great recommendations and weekly 'ask anything' threads for beginners, but they can still be pretty overwhelming.

I'd start with the basics: exfoliate, cleanse and moisturize. Find a moisturizer with an SPF. A simple cleanser will do. Kiehls has a good range of products for men and you can get samples of any of their products, just ask. Also, don't be afraid to go to Sephora, you can also get samples of just about anything there and they have a large selection of different brands at varying price points. Cerave, Neutrogena and Cetaphil are all drugstore brands that have pretty good reputations and are very inexpensive. Hell, even Trader Joes has some great skincare products for next to nothing.

Eye creams aren't necessary but I use them anyway (I have a ton of samples I'm trying to get through). Masks are a nice way to relax and the peel off ones are pretty fun, my SO even likes them. 

Drink lots of water, get a lot of sleep, wash your pillow cases often and wash your face every night. "

Sex for hours with the girl keeping it going like there's no tomorrow. It was the highlight of 2017 for me.
"I hate to say this, especially on reddit...

But if you have decent conversation, are genuine, and make women feel comfortable around you... you will be successful. 

Beyond that, you can do and say almost anything. Be direct and dont try to friendship your way into sex. Learn to take an L. 

Lots of people will tell you different on reddit... but in the real world out there... most guys are a bad combo of thirsty, misogynistic, and/or self sabotaging. The rest are too shy to speak. Find your place in the middle. Talk to people, dont be too aggressive, when you ask for numbers or for a date be interested but nonchalant and casual. That exudes confidence. 

I never go to bars. Strictly tinder and people i interact with wherever. I have sex a 2-3 times a month depending. Unless im super busy. "
"I've noticed that not everyone thinks in terms of North south, etc. They have no idea where north, south etc are. They jus think of location and directions differently. In my experience these types are OK for getting around town but on any extended away trip their navigation becomes unreliable "
When I cut like a GROUP of friends out of my life they didn't care at the beginning as they were treating me shit and really asked me questions that made me sad in a hurtful way. Then like 8 months later one started texting me but I didn't reply and they tried talking nuce to me as they just wanted some help from me. I got fucked up for 3 months as I realized I wasted 8 years making friends that are fake and never cared for me. You won't believe hiw hard it was to overcome that. But then I travelled alittle and made friends abroad and when I returned I made new friends and life started smiling back and what's the most important is that they were the ones who lost something not me as my life now is better that ever thank God.

"With the amount of upvotes on this comment (including mine) I can reasonably conclude that I as well as other people haven't had the best of fathers one way or another.

One of the pitfalls of being raised by such a man is that we have a tendency to conclude that ALL of their personality attributes are negative, or in other words, we don't want to be anything like our fathers.

That's an incredibly dangerous assumption that I fell prey to.

My father was and still is a person with a dysfunctionally volatile, violent and bullying personality. One of the rather natural conclusions that I got growing up with him was that ALL forms of anger are bad, because I didn't want to grow up to be like my own father.

That in turn caused me to adopt a ""nice guy"" persona/mask who was effectively a pushover and harmless, unable to adequately defend myself against others. I remembered tricking myself into thinking that I'm happy to serve, happy to give good things and experiences to other people while getting little in return, and all the while I was growing more and more resentful of my own behavior and the behavior of the people who didn't treat me well.

It was only after I realized that there is tremendous value in being expressive (in a controlled manner) and assertive about my feelings, including my anger, that I started becoming truly honest with my emotions as well as what I want from myself and other people, and I've been much more fulfilled and am living a significantly more meaningful life since. "
Which just makes it that much better.

Had to reread the title to make sure I clicked the non-sexual thread.
"&gt; It's literally a numbers game for finding someone who will say yes

I feel like if you're not at least somewhat confident that they'll say yes then you're doing something fundamentally wrong. The idea of asking out hundreds of girls is weird to me. American dating culture in general is weird. "
"Yea I’m pretty bad at small talk with people I don’t know very well, especially if they are attractive.. but I feel like a lot of people have that problem too"
"it's your choice obviously and different things weigh differently for each person when it comes to relationships. but i don't think financial illiteracy indicates idiocy, she probably just grew up in an environment of similarly financially illiterate people. my bf was relatively financially backwards when we first met. he financed his car for 5 years at 24% interest rate at one of those predatory lenders because he had no credit and his family had no car after the previous one finally died. after getting to know him more i found out that his mom passed these habits onto him. she isn't good with money and barely thinks a step ahead.  
  
he's now much, much better and with my help, pulled his credit score above 760 and refinanced his car down to something like 4%. this is just to anyone else reading. if you're financially independent and have some patience, think twice before you pass up on someone great just because they're not financially educated. it really doesn't take that long to show them how to plan and spend correctly, though like everything else...it will take a bit of patience.  
  
that is assuming, of course, that the person you're dating is great otherwise and just a bit illiterate in finances. "
"Conversely; I stopped trying and now I spend my evenings after work alone watching Netflix and relaxing or working on my vehicles, and weekends with my guy friends. 

I very rarely meet new women and generally don't do social things. So YMMV, depending on your lifestyle. I like a lot of alone time, which doesn't help my chances at getting out there. I'm pretty sure I peaked in college both dating-wise and socially lol."
"Before he met my mother he was a hard drug addict, nearly overdosed a few times, would steal from shops to get drug money (this part I'm not so sure on, it seems like this from having found his name on old newspapers).  
 He eventually went to rehab and got clean and started living a good, if very poor life, and eventually became one of the two founders of a new rehab center in our area that is now full of people and very active in every social help field. The social area in the building is built to his name. He has helped and is remembered by an incredible amount of people all over the world.

When he died his funeral was PACKED. The church, the square in front of it, the streets leading to it, everything was completely filled up with people. We are in Europe and there were people from Australia. For years after his death we had an almost constant stream of people visiting, some from the town over and other literally from the other side of the world, wanting to help us as a thank you for how much my dad had helped them.

So yeah, I'm quite proud of my dad. "
"He didn't fake his own death. The artist you called Michael Jackson was abducted by aliens back in the 80's and replaced with a replicon from beyond the moon. He is currently performing every night for the Blood Emperor of Anaxis. It's a sold out show every time.

Unfortunately, the replication process was... flawed. Hence the little black guy turning into the little white guy and his erratic behaviour prior to his death.

The real Michael Jackson is out there, somewhere, moonwalking in the infinite sea. Will he return and teach us the dance skills he learned from the star spawned empire that spans entire galaxies? Who knows, but I hope so."
"I’m secure enough to recognize when another dude is handsome. I have friends that say shit like “I can only tell that (insert handsome celebrity here) is good looking because girls are into him, I couldn’t really tell you on my own”, which kinda makes me roll my eyes. Just sounds like a long-winded “no homo”."
This guy decks.
"She loves this- she'll lay on her back and stick her feet up. I'll grab onto them and pretend they're:

Edit: a word"
"My ex did too! 

The worst part is she didn't even know where Mexico is. We live four hours away from the bloody border. She vacationed in Mexico too.

I bought her a map for her birthday. She didn't find that funny. "
Breakups are the perfect time to pick up new hobbies! You get way more free time and it keeps you busy.
"Dump him, pronto."
I was. I’ve been in a relationship for a year and a half now. 
"We were playing board games, and she would continually drop the dice so high that they would roll off the table. I asked her if she could roll them softer, and she snapped at me (in front of my friends): ""I can't! No one taught me how to roll dice as a child!"".

After that moment, she would always roll them in a box and would preface starting a board game to everyone why she can only roll dice with a box. It's like she physically couldn't roll dice without dropping them, which to this day still puzzles me why I didn't end it right there and then."
lol this speaks to my thought process so hard I just have to laugh
"Woman here. Just FYI, some women actually prefer slightly below average. Big dongs can hurt. A lot. You sound like you're doing everything right, so don't worry about it too much.

The biggest dick I encountered was not at all the best sex, nor was it any kind of fantasy - it was just a dick, and dicks are always fun no matter how big they are. The rest is up to the partners and what we do for each other. (Big dick guy's problem was not giving a shit about me having an orgasm before or after he came.)"
"I tricked my ex into tasting ghost chili hot wings by employing both my spice tolerance and my ability to stay stone faced.

It was hilarious for a few minutes, but still rather mean."
"Had a friend who needed picking up from the police station super late at night on a week night.  Thought it was just something stupid like drunk driving, fights, etc.

I get to the police station to pick him up and the cops are looking at me funny.  They whisper to one another and it's clear something is wrong.

So, I grab my buddy and we get into the car, and he's eerily quiet.  So I ask him what happened, and he tells me he doesn't want to talk about it.  I've known the guy 20 years, so that shit's not going to cut it.  So, we're talking and driving along, and I press him further. Come to find out he was arrested for having thousands of pictures of child porn on his computer.

I pull over on the side of the freeway and tell him to get the fuck out of my car and never call me again.  I also told him I'm speaking as the group of our close friends and never call them either.  I called each friend and told them what happened, and they all cut him out of their lives too.

We're willing to be friendly with a guy who maybe smokes weed, got into a bar fight one night, got a DUI or 2, but crimes against children are absolutely unforgivable.  "
I admire other dudes' attractiveness all the time. I'm always wishing i was as dreamy as them.
It sucks but you learn to deal with it.

"Small breasts are also not as shameful as a small penis.  Contemporary pornography contains much content featuring women who look young and skinny.  In fact, the fashion industry has long cultivated the female beauty image as slim/underweight, and these models typically have very minimal bosoms.  Whereas the market for small dicks is basically confined to humiliation-based porn."
"well, it’s really quite simple. it’s kinda like:

Gonna find my baby, gonna hold her tight
Gonna grab some afternoon delight
My motto's always been 'when it's right, it's right'
Why wait until the middle of a cold dark night?
When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be there any way
Thinkin' of you's workin' up my appetite
Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbin' sticks and stones together makes the sparks ingite
And the thought of lovin' you is getting so exciting
Sky rockets in flight
Afternoon delight"

"Obviously I don't know the story or how the conversation came up, but tbh, it would be a red flag to me if someone asked me a weird and random ""skill testing question"" at a first meeting of their parents if it was just to prove a point or test me.

"How phenomenal were these tits, we need details "
"Obviously, I don't know you from Adam.  But in my experience, that's a sign that you're settling.

Just think about it.  In the same breath that you're saying these people weren't interesting to you, you're also identifying them as SOs.  Not just casual hookups, not just friends with benefits, but SOs.  In other words, you knew you didn't *really* want those people, but you developed relationships with them anyway.

Again, I don't know you, and only you can decide what the deal is after a little introspection, but I would submit that the most likely reasons you're setting are (1) you were only interested in sex, or the sex was good enough that you ignored the other shortcomings of those relationships; (2) you didn't have enough self-confidence to go after the kind of people you *really* wanted in the first place; or (3) you have significant anxiety about being single for some reason, so you kept jumping into relationships just for the comfort of them."
The problem is everyone who's broke from being irresponsible and making bad decisions thinks they are broke because of a string of circumstances and hardships.

I'm not very motivated myself, and my dream job would literally be a doggy day care lol so I'm not a hotshot but at least I'm working and trying to get a better job. My boyfriend now is SUPER smart and motivated; he inspires me and I want to do the same for him. EDIT: Oops I didn't realize this was /askmen and not /askreddit or /askwomen lol"

"Growth is painful. But don't fall into the trap of making decisions that you think he would be proud of or approve of. At the end of the day you've got a lot of life left in you, and there's nothing worse then living your life on someone else's terms.

This is the moment to decide what kind of man you want to be for the rest of your life. One thing that helped me was I flipped it around and considered: What kind of man do I need to be for my kids? I didn't have kids at the time, and wasn't really planning for them, but it puts your time on this planet into perspective, knowing that one day you'll be passing the torch to another generation. Now that I have a son, I'm constantly going back to that question, and making sure I'm on the right track. After all, we're all a work in progress.

She’s a redhead, nice, funny, goes to Stanford. She’s not really a party girl but she’s a blast to be around, and I absolutely adore her, even her little flaws. We used to be best friends in kindergarten but to be honest, once the years went on, i had no confidence, I gained weight, etc.

Now that we’re older I recently found out she’s been crushing on me, but I haven’t really seen or talked to her in a long time. We’ve been making plans to hangout next weekend though, so hopefully things go well!"

"I would say because as a general rule, guys don't even really think about ""body\-shaming"" that much when it comes to other guys.

Where it is brought up \(and I 100&amp;#37; agree with this\) is in calling out the hypocrisy among certain feminists who will talk endlessly about the horror of body\-shaming, and then turn around and tell some guy they are angry with that he has a small penis.

Edit:  Another thought is that \(assuming the guy is straight\) guys don't really care what others guys tell them about their appearance, but they do care what women say.  If I had 100 guys tell me a shirt was ugly, and Hope Beel told me I looked great in that shirt, I'm wearing that damn shirt.

This is also where the whole joke about bodybuilders being gay comes from, because they often care far more about getting compliments from other dudes than women."

"Whenever I've ended LTRs, I tend to notice a lingering sense of resentment towards the other person. That resentment manifests in several ways with different intensities too. It can be when I'm irrationally upset with her doing something benign, when I lose sexual interest, or when I simply catch myself day dreaming about a life without her.

In contrast, having the lust dissipate a bit is merely a transition in life. You stop prepping for dates and just show up as is. Sometimes you're not feeling it, whether because of the long day you had or something you ate. Obviously she's still attractive to you and you could work yourself up if you really tried, but some days just aren't prime days for sex."

"Same thing with the whole fat thing and they did it.

I kind of feel that this whole small penis shame isn't alive much any more in most parts of the world; in the Netherlands it seems to mostly be a comical stereotype that males are deeply invested in the size of their penis whilst otherwise in real life males are completely comfortable admitting that their penis isn't that large.

They tell me on the internets that you apparently should never call a penis cute because then you imply it's small and cause severe psychological trauma or something—never had any problems with that or telling people that others had larger ones."

So about 9 months ago I got married and me and my wife always show an appropriate amount of PDA. Just enough so that everyone knows ""She's mine and we're happy."" We hold hands everywhere we go, sometimes I've got my arm around her shoulders, sometimes we're locking arms. Etc. And I'll give a quick peck on the lips when we part.

Of course, when we're out with friends we almost pretend like one another doesn't exist. We'd hate for our friends to feel like a third wheel so we act more like... siblings? Constantly ragging on one another. It's a compliment to us that our friends feel the need to tell us that we're the one couple they can hang out with and it's not weird.

In college we could literally go from mushy mushy love birds walking hand in hand staring lovingly into each others eyes, to competitive for our friends attention enemies."
I have trust issues too. You're not alone!
When I'm in a relationship I think life with a girlfriend isn't that much different than without one.  When I'm single I tend to see the gap as bigger than what it really is.  
Are you me? ಠ_ಠ
That’s not really the type of cheap that hurts you though. It’s more like the type where your girl wants to go to dinner and a movie but you argue you can stream it and eat snacks at home to save money. When Christmas comes she gets a ten dollar necklace from Claire’s. Never going on vacation or doing activities if they cost money. That kind of thing lol
"Jeez...this has become my life. I just wanna relax and not have to stress about you or the kids or the bills or the fucking anything. It’s just easier to be single. I’ll admit sometimes I wish someone was about but, mostly, I like chilling in bed and getting take out and not having to share the covers. "
