"&gt;Take this car back, it's broken!

You seem to have welded all the doors shut. 

&gt;It's your fault I can't get into it! You sold me it! "
"We had a group of 3 kids come up and order one time, all got the large size sandwiches. Get to the end, they don't have enough to pay so they go to find their mom/whoever. 

Mom shows up, livid, yelling that her kids ordered small sandwiches, and how they had told her I made them large ones anyway.

Like, did you ever consider of you weren't the kind of person to scream ad a stranger at the top of your lungs in the middle of a mall that maybe your kids wouldn't feel the need to lie about a simple mistake to you?"
"I hate policies where you‚Äôre not supposed to tell people you‚Äôre closed.  I work in a retail/restaurant place and we had 2 guys one time finish their meal before close, but they stayed until midnight (we closed at 10) just sitting there drawing."
"&gt; Umm no I‚Äôm not. But since she wants to be petty and block the whole register and pout about it, I just made the return come around the other side to my register opening and hand me Her items. 

Thank you for this.  So many posts on here would have been, ""...so I rang up the rude woman to get her out of the store."""
Next time just ask to see the receipt...then highlight the name of the store he should go to.
That lady sounds like a bitch but you really need to tell her you are closing(customers will ignore even the most obvious signals)'
Tis the season for shoplifting. Sorry OP...hopefully management won't be jerks to you
That was really the only thing you could have done. Nice job.
"Coworker of mine watched a young girl (10ish?) run and jump on a bed. It happens often enough. She calls out that she can't jump on the beds like that, and she gets down and goes to talk to Dad.

Dad storms over demanding to know we were harassing his daughter for trying out the beds. Coworker tries to explain, and Dad cuts her off, informing us that he was going to buy her a bed and now we've lost his very important business. 

Some kids can do no wrong."
"Wrong. You are not useless. 

They are terrible at conveying what they desire. For some reason a good load of people seem to think that you can read their minds, or that the conversation in their heads was said aloud.

It's not your fault they're stupid, but you take the blame regardless.

I suppose your take away from this is to always demand a more concise explanation. If someone wants garbage bags and there are many different types, ask them specifically what kind they are after. Act like a robot that needs proper input."
I feel sorry for that kid if she always acts that way.
"It feels like almost every time a family lets their small children order their own food, immediately after the kid tells me what they want, the parents are like ""No no don't ring that up!  Absolutely not!""  And if they have multiple children, after going through that and telling me what the first ""really"" wants, they STILL let the next kid order their own food.  And repeat.  
  
Ugh.  I don't hate kids.  I hate their stupid parents."
"You can't fix stupid, even with a sign."
"If that guy was really in the military, then I'm sure his commanding officers would love to hear how he's treating civilians. "
"""What kind of garbage bags, compost? expandable? large? small? pink? with flowers?""

""... the hell are you talking about I just want garbage bags""

OR

""what kind of garbage bags?""

""... um, the ones you put garbage in""

Damned if you do damned if you don't."
"A verbal for something that happened off the clock?! First thing id do would be to get in touch with corporate HR and lodge a complaint/appeal, That's ludicrous."
That is insane. You don‚Äôt even ask them to leave at that point you TELL them
It‚Äôs rare to find a kid that has a higher maturity level than most adults you find out in public. Good on him for helping you out!
"I have people like that all the time where they think if they ask for a refund multiple times I‚Äôll have to eventually give it to them. I‚Äôm not gonna suddenly go ‚Äúyou know what, yeah lemme process that refund‚Äù on the 20th time they say it. 

My favorite was this guy who did that and then just left the device with us because ‚Äúif I leave it here you have to return it‚Äù. Nope, if you leave it here it‚Äôs still your property and if you don‚Äôt pick it up within 15 days it‚Äôs considered abandoned and becomes ours. He threatened to sue and I essentially said ‚Äúlmao go ahead‚Äù in retail speak"
I would travel back in time and give the coathanger to her mother.
"Boy, I hope you‚Äôve been keeping up with the lingo. "
Expecting the OP to allow someone to cut in line is bad customer service
Sucktomer in training. Basically she is teaching her kid to yell and abuse someone because they say something that she doesn't like. 
Do get in touch with HR. Ask them if you are required to help customers off the clock. Also ask how long after clocking out you have to work for free. Let them think you are contacting a lawyer.
"Several local retailers have self-serve photo printing kiosks. They work great except that they automatically throw a large preview up on the screen before printing. I noticed the other day that one retailer had a couple of kiosks turned in a way that they were facing a wall, preventing people from glancing over and seeing your pictures."
"""Cuckolding the hangars""... Now I've heard it all!

Also, want some of our hangers? We have to practically beg customers to take them, we have so many spare... And we get more with every clothes shipment..."
"""Do you have Battletoads for the Wii?"""
We think the lady was a sociopath. She had absolutely no emotion or remorse. Even when I was kind of rude to her she didn‚Äôt have any facial expression. But yeah we told her and I would‚Äôve been much more firm about it and I would‚Äôve gotten her out of there WAY faster but my mom makes it clear that she‚Äôs the boss and I have no say which I get but she still needs to learn how to take action and not let customers walk all over her. 
Tell them you will buy their house for how much they paid in the 70s and they can buy a new one
"""Hello there, I think I ordered the wrong tile, can I come in and trade it for the right one?""

"
I'm gradually leaving self-restraint. This was one of those trial by fire situations.
My phone knows me better than I do.
"Because nobody ever lies about being in the military for personal gain. Jeez OP, who would ever do that. /s

Seriously, the store's being nice enough to offer you a discount that they don't have to give. And with all the stories I've read about people who said they were of age or a member or something but weren't, just show your legal ID people. It's seriously not as big of a deal as 99.9% of these people make it. "
"I used to run a college bookstore.  At least once a semester, one student or another would snottily ask to use *my* discount on their books.  I always... **always**... said ""yes."" 

Me: Okay, and the total for your books is $221.77.  

Them: I'm not paying that.  Gimme your discount.

Me: Okay!  (pause)  Your total is $221.77.

Them: You said you were giving me your discount!

Me: I did.  We don't get discounts on textbooks.  $221.77, please."
"As the store policy mentioned not ‚Äútelling‚Äù the customers they are closed they need to be creative. 

Don‚Äôt ‚Äútell‚Äù but let the customer come to that conclusion by themselves. 

Turn off the lights and don‚Äôt say a word. They will either correctly infer you are closed or keep shopping like an idiot. "
"A few years ago I worked at a grocery store. Here in Germany if you are under 9 years you aren't able to legally buy something (gesch√§ftsunf√§hig). At my first week I had a young boy hand me the money for there mother and he was extremely proud. When I was younger I had done it too so as far as I know it's no uncommon situation.

Later that day the mother came back and tried to get her money back. Because her son had no permission to buy the Grocerys that means the purchase contract was inavail. It was a pain in the ass to get some eye witness and video evidence. Fortunately the case could be solved.

After that day we were not allowed to accept money form children."
"This happened to a woman at my store once. A guy brought in a competitor branded paint and was absolute furious as we apparently denied his wife a return earlier in the day. He ranted for about five minutes, refusing to let anyone get a word in about the oh so very obvious error. After the rant ended my colleague just pointed at the competitor brand written all over the can and said ‚Äúmight want to take it up with ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù sir. Guy was out of the store so dam fast üòÇ"
"""You're daughter is a liability and you're encouraging it. You are banned anyway from this store and our sister stores."""
Normally my manager just gives the customer what they want to stop the whining. so once they asked for the manager I was like goddamnit I hate this customer and now she‚Äôs about to get her way.  
"I would have shut down your POS terminal right when you closed, with a warning: ""we close in 5 minutes. After that the register is turning off and you won't be able to buy anything.""

Followed by ""we are officially closed! I'm sorry but we will need to ask you to leave now.""

I get that you were trying to be polite but subtle hints or even passive aggressive hints (""I'm so tired after such a long day!"") aren't going to appeal to a customer's sympathy if they have none (or if they're just that clueless)."
That's what I always do if they have the receipt. It's the fastest way to shut the conversation down and saves everyone time.
The manager that they talked to was like ‚Äúdoes she even know what cuckolding means? Once I heard that I made up my mind to not give her the hanger‚Äù 
"Imagine working in a concession stand over the summer. And this happening 10 times a day every single day. I‚Äôll give some interactions that just boiled my blood:

Exhibit A: Little girl comes up to get a lollipop. Her father is standing about 10 feet away, presumably to teach her how to order food and be polite. Understandable. I‚Äôll do the same when I‚Äôm a father. But right when she gives me her money, he yells to me ‚ÄúAnd I want some change!‚Äù. Yes, sir, I was planning to pocket your money directly in front of you. And at the same time get removed from the list of workers.

Exhibit B: It‚Äôs a dead shift. I‚Äôm standing there on my phone, and I see a guy and his 11 or so year old daughter come up. He says ‚ÄúMy daughter ordered X and only got Y change back, give me my fucking money‚Äù. Now whenever this happens and it‚Äôs anything less than a dollar, I usually just get it because I don‚Äôt want to deal with people. But two things here: I didn‚Äôt help the girl in the first place, and he was insisting she paid with a $20 instead of a $5. I had to call my shift manager over to ok me practically giving $15 away with no proof. The guy was insanely confused why we couldn‚Äôt believe him, and he just stormed away like I had nuked his house.

Exhibit C: This is more in line with the OP‚Äôs story. If you send a 4 year old up to order their own food, who has literally no concept of money other than its green, you‚Äôre asking for trouble. This happened, the kid walked away, and I put his change off to the side so when his parent comes back I‚Äôll have it there. In this case, I always passive aggressively blame the child, but really I‚Äôm blaming the adult. ‚ÄúForgot your change!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHey buddy, you left without your money!‚Äù in a friendly tone. Usually the parent cuts me off with ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you give them the change‚Äù. 


Listen, no worker is ever trying to pocket your money. They can get fired on the spot if they do. If they mess up your change, 99.9% of the time, they made a mistake. Nobody is out to get you."
"The karma here is amazing. In his attempt to cheat you out of money, he cheated himself out of the PS4! It's almost perfect and just what he deserved for his behavior!"
"The answer I'd have given in that situation probably would have gotten me fired.


I guess that's why I don't work in retail."
"what the actual fuck?

I'd have called police... Never had a customer getting violent but that is definitely a red line crossed."
"Fun fact: Applying inflation from 1970 to today, A $90 water heater would be about $570.

"
"As soon as someone threatens legal action, that's when you insist all future communication be done through the company's lawyers and refuse to speak to them further.

It covers your ass if they're serious (which they rarely are), and it shuts them down when they're bluffing."
Probably expects his car salesman to know how to fix his car too.
Reminds me of a story I read a long time back.  Young junior officer making an ass of himself in an off-base restaurant in a European country.  Long story short the base commander was there in his civvies having dinner with his family and the young officer left with his tail between his legs.
"Might be lucky, my parents have some rude habits (like 100% *refusing* to put their trash away in the mall) and I'm adamantly the opposite. Plus the kid maybe gets treated poorly too, so he might go the opposite way. "
You have to teach her not to be like that.
"Nah, just close down and count out all registers.  When she comes up apologize and state you were not aware she was still in the store so long after close.  Tell her you can hold her shopping for her if she would like to come back tomorrow to pay but the system will not let you open a register until fifteen minutes before scheduled opening time the next day.

Lather, rinse and repeat as long as necessary 'till she seeks company elsewhere."
Probably we have cameras everywhere. We have a no chase policy like most places so I couldn‚Äôt get a good look at his car but didn‚Äôt have a license plate
"&gt; never trust any customers... ever

Eeeyup. When customers get affronted when I have an iron-tight grip on an item I've just taken out of a locked case, I give them the whole ""it's policy and we do this for every customer"" spiel. It is true. It *is* policy. But even more than that, it's that I don't trust any customer, no matter how sweet or innocent they look or act. Sorry, this item isn't going into your hands until you've paid for it. &gt;:("
He knew what he was doing.
"Jealous much, crazy wife? Someone needs to tell her not every woman is after her husband. That marriage is not going to last if she's suspicious of something small like that."

And states now will verify your veteran status and add the word veteran to your driver's license. It now qualifies as a veteran ID. He was just being difficult.
"Wow, using her kid to try and con people.

That's low."

Bonus points for interrobang."
"""Mario has to be on the Ps4! My son played it at his friends house last week! Look, he even showed me a picture of the case! Are you calling my son a liar?!""

Lady, let me introduce you to the wonders of Photoshop."
"It might be fun to ""forget"" that she's in the store one night. Lock the doors, have almost everyone leave, then turn out all the lights, so she finds herself all alone in almost total darkness.


Of course you'd then have someone go back in under some pretext, like a security check, and be ""surprised"" to find her there, and let her out.


Of course you can't *actually* do that without getting into trouble. But it's fun to imagine."
"I find that tasteless and incredibly offensive.

Have an upvote."
"The amount of times I've heard ""the other store lets me do it"". Just because some stores do it wrong doesn't mean others won't do it right. "
"One woman and her husband let their three kids run around the part of the store I was cleaning and restocking at that was called Candy Town and had a large ring full of wrapped candies to pick from and buy; 15 pieces for $1; the kids ate at least $10 worth of candy gold coins and hersey kisses and smarties, leaving the wrappers on the ground. I gathered the wrappers and put them in my pocket (it was gross and there was so fucking many) and waited until the parents got their kids and went to check out, when it was their turn to pay, I went up to the cashier, who was my MOD (a nicer one than the bitch who hired me) and set the wrappers on the counter and told her, ‚ÄúThese too, their kids left them behind...by mistake.‚Äù As snooty as I could (I was annoyed cuz I just cleaned and organized all those damn things!)
My MOD was pissed, so was the mother, she didn‚Äôt want to pay $10 for candy her kids ate, claiming it‚Äôs not her fault we leave candy out for them to eat. MOD told her she should watch her children a bit more carefully and things like this wouldn‚Äôt happen. The kids looked ashamed and tried to claim they didn‚Äôt do it; they were all like 8-12 years old (I‚Äôm bad at ages); that was another thing the lady claimed. The father was like ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and set down two $5s and told his wife to let it go. She did not let it go.
I think about that as the only moment when I wasn‚Äôt timid and shy around strangers at my first job."
"It was honestly the cutest thing, and a big help too really! He got to show off his Pokemans and I got to my other customers as well, win win!"
Great response.
