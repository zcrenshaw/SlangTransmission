This is why you preheat your dutch oven
Reading stories of people fucked up more than they can handle is my favourite.
Do you want to get murdered? This is how you get murdered.
"&gt;And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.

That´s when I knew this story was going to be great. Hope your ride went well after dinner. 
Great read btw :)"
"Kicks over your trashcan. 

Destroys him entirely. 

Nice"
 The money was for experiences. This is a hell of an experience.
"You should read ""Fire and Fury"". 

Edit: Wow this blew up. Obligatory thx for the gold kind strangers. "
"Medic here, try not to beat yourself up over it too bad man. We understand that you weren't in the right state of mind. It amazes me how strong someone who isn't in the right state of mind can be. I've literally seen a 90 pound, 102 year old lady need 4 people just to restrain her. 

Also, from the sound of it, you got some Ativan in the but."
Could this be resolved with an apology?
"*“Thinking this was the end for me, then they’d rape my wife, and* **let my cat out into the cold winter night.**” 

Such *cruel cruel* men. "
You just ruined the hidden camera they were going to monetize.
"Dealing with in-laws while stoned is the wooooorst. 

I once ate half of a lemon drop while visiting my wife's uncle in CO. I'm just glad I didn't eat the whole damn thing. He liked to talk, so fortunately it wasn't too odd for me to just stare and nod. 

But hey, now you know. When it says half a cookie, it means half a cookie. "
"Can confirm, from Denver. This happens often to my out of town friends. I always suggest 'laying low'. 

Hahaha the part ""WTF, Denver"" had me thinking ""yeah don't fuck around, those instructions have been tested over and over"". Classic"
I think he may have confused his Dutch Oven with his Pressure Cooker
What I'm more surprised about is the fact that you ordered from two different places as opposed to the exact same place twice... 
"&gt;  spits the listerine into her hands and begins to give me a handjob

Holy shit."
"I feel that if you were female and the masseuse male, this would have had a very different reaction from people."
"Dont bring that logic round here boy. 
"
Dose is 1/2 a cookie. Eat 1/4 of a cookie and if you aren’t as high as you would like in an hour eat  half. Edibles are no joke. The dose between good time and “this sucks” is small. My personal experiences anyway. 
Never trust a fart.
"I would've asked for my money back and walked after hearing a $100 for a tip. Also, listerine for a handjob, for some reason that seems unpleasant.
"
"Listerine + sensitive junk = ???

Because Icy Hot medicated rub + sensitive junk = Fires of Hades.."
And now I shall be careful while eating pop-tarts.
"I ate one of those caramel edibles last year two days before Christmas and was so high I forgot what a candy cane was (while I was eating one), cried because dogs exist, and freaked out that my boyfriend was in a different dimension because his voice sounded both close and far away. 
We still laugh about it, but I do smaller doses now. 


Edit: ohhh gold, I’ve never had that before! Thank you!"
I love how OP starts eating pop tarts again after he fucking ate a stink bug.
And here i am making fart noises with my mouth outside the bathroom my wife is in...and i get yelled at.  I tip my hat to you.
"I'm from Australia so ""then they'd rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night"" sounds hilarious (is winter an issue for cats there?). 
Like ""These hooligans are gonna rape my wife... THEN LET MY CAT OUTTTT!!!!"" 

By far my favourite TIFU ever! 
So glad it worked out so well, given the circumstances."
I think it might have to do with not being able to decide between dominos and pizza hut the first time when I ordered lol
"&gt; I was hungry, tired, hungover and maybe a little **horny** . I thought pizza was the perfect answer to fill all my needs.

I'm still wondering how does a pizza satisfy your **sexual needs**"
"I think I got this. 

OP texts Jane’s roommate and convinces her to fuck him in Jane’s bed when Jane is sleeping. 

Jane will wake up, realize the OP feels just as embarrassed, and realize that he went through all this trouble for Jane. 

OP then engages in a threesome and it’s a win-win-win. "
"This is my favorite tifu ever. Thank you, ridiculous man."
Sounds like you scored him some drugs. No wonder he wanted to fuck you 
"If I was in your position,  I would've kicked him out when he told me to get him money from the ATM. No fucking way I'm giving him money. 

I'm a broke 22 years old college student and my abs proves it."
My 92 year old grandma kicked a nurse in the chest with a broken hip. 
"10 minutes build up,  15 seconds action. "
"You drove them to, and then paid for their drug deals. You've figured that out right?"
"&gt; cried because dogs exist 

Can't get a better example of high thoughts 
"
That’s some shitty foreplay. 
"&gt; listerine for a handjob, for some reason that seems unpleasant.

Right? I had sex with a lube containing menthol once.

Once ಠ_ಠ"
"You gave a tweaker a ride around looking for a score. You didnt even just drive for a drug deal. You drove around looking for a drug deal, AND YOU PAID FOR IT ALL."
"At first I thought all those people were assholes for asking a kind why he'd do that, kids are dumb. That's because I was thinking you were like 6 or 7. But yeah, at, 12 you're just a dumbass."
"I took a friend of mine to his first experience with dispensaries and he got a bunch of edibles. The budtender recommended starting with a half dose (5mg) to start since it had been ages since he'd gotten high.

He did a half. Waited like 5 minutes, said ""I don't feel anything!"" and popped two more pieces of chocolate in his mouth before I could stop him. ""Did I do something wrong?"" ""noooo I'm sure you'll be fine""

*Narrator: He was not fine*"
Looks like the cat’s out of the bag.

"I agree, this is getting heaps of fucked up comments. I can understand how difficult this situation is for somebody who is not assertive (like me) and who has had it drilled in to them from a young age not to be ""rude"". OP, you should practice saying no."
"&gt;I certainly wasn't going to chase her down to explain myself

Probably the best decision you made in the whole TIFU. 

Just imagine a naked man out in the snow chasing a little girl yelling :

"" I'M NOT A PERVERT LITTLE GIRL  JUST STOP SO WE CAN TALK """
"I apologize on behalf of all out of towners who balk at those instructions. One of my friends did it on on her trip there too. The temptation was too much. The difference with her is that her husband made her leave the restaurant because she was too fucked up. She was being loud and trying to bother people at other tables. 

OP's server deserves the fattest of fat tips for being so cool. "
"Brilliant stuff, definitely a solid fuck up. Well done, sir! This reminds me of the time I took 5 1/2 tabs of what turned out to be REALLY strong acid. For whatever reason, sometimes acid takes up to 2 hours to kick in, and I was used to about 45 minutes, so when it didn't happen that soon I took a couple more, then more again. 1 tab, 2 tabs, 3 tabs, 4, 5 1/2 tabs...fuck, where's the floor?!"
You sir are correct

"I worked as a firemen/medic in the worst part of metro atlanta. This happens WAY more than people think. More so due to low blood sugar emergencies but postictal patients would sometimes act this way. We always made sure we communicated with the police that these patience were not in their right mind and it was always handled well. Honestly, we tend to just start more fire trucks to the scene rather than the police. 
We actually had one patient we called “bear” that would regularly have blood sugar emergencies. We knew the address well and would immediately start another fire engine to help. When we would arrive the wife would meet us at the door with this “it’s happened again” look. He was a HUGE dude and if he found out we were there he would immediately go into fight mode. We would regularly have to fight him to the ground and administer d50 (sugar water) and within seconds he was apologizing and offering us all beers. We all came out of those fights like best friends that got into fist fights as kids but always hugged after. Good times. "
"6 cops in unison: ""I'm too old for this shit""."
"""I know I ordered from Dominos last time, whenever that was, so..."""
You’re an idiot. 
Listerine for a handy? Seems like it would both burn and not be a good lube. A single molecule of Listerine inside the one eyed wonder worm hole and you're talking fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen. 
Call her and tell her what happened. Apologize. I hope it works out for you buddy 
I feel your grandma had an unfair advantage if that nurses’s hip was broken

"Probably your fart noises aren’t legit enough. Put your ass against the door and actually fart. It’ll reverberate through the door and be super loud in the bathroom.  It’ll probably make your wife want to kill you, but it’ll be worth it. "

Sounds like more that she effed up by popping it with her face so close and yap open. Ewwww 
This is almost too stupid to be funny

Why did you not drive away when he left the car? You had like 10 chances to just leave. And he doesn't seem like a nice guy and a complete stranger...

My wife enjoys popping pimples on me as well. It’s an odd thing but glad she does it!
"Wow. This is the best written story I've ever read on here. I was laughing all the way through it. Well done OP, hope your wife's parents are cool about it. "
Faking a male orgasm.  That is some funny shit.  So did you just make orgasm noises and hope she would believe it without ya know....... Seeing your baby batter
"&gt; Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

How about this? I don't know what it is with wives, but they do tend to be wrong about these kinds of things before the facts, but right afterwards.

Edit: because I enjoyed reading OP's post... To all of you with wild/funny/weird trip stories, feel free to share them in /r/tripsgonewild (not to be confused with trapsgonewild)"
"Yeah... you shoulda driven off the first chance you got. I’d say it’s okay you weren’t to know, but after the 12th warning gigantic hazard sign, I feel compassion ended after the 2nd sign and stupidity took over"
"The whole time becoming unteathered bit is spot on.  Last batch of cookies I made I overshot the strength, and holy shit that was a strange evening.  Great story man, but you really should have seen that coming.  They don't F*** around with edibles in the legal states"
"I know a girl in California who sometimes sends me edibles. Years ago, she sent me this giant rice krispie treat with a total dosage of 80mg of THC. I decided to eat half and see what happens. Almost nothing. I didn't feel a damn thing. It actually wasn't quite half, probably more like 45%. So, a few days later, I eat the rest. again, damn near nothing happens.  As it turns out, I just can't get high off marshmallow based edibles for some reason. They just don't work very well on me. But I didn't know this then.

She sends me a 220mg chocolate bar a few weeks after that. I remember thinking that well, if roughly 50mg did almost nothing (I felt a tiny itsy bitsy bit of high) then I should eat the entire chocolate bar and maybe I'd get a decent high.

Oh my, was that a mistake.

As it turns out, chocolate based edibles are extra effective on me. Even now, when I have years of experience with edibles and decades of experience smoking weed (I started in 1992), 50mg of THC chocolate is usually too much for me. I'd just eaten 220mg. I remember saying at one point, ""I can actually feel myself getting higher every second. It's like I'm riding a weed elevator."" After about an two hours, I'm losing my shit and then I realize something. My kitchen is messy and the police are definitely on their way to arrest me for letting my kitchen get so messy. So I started freaking out and panic cleaning my kitchen. It's also 2am. So, imagine an insanely high person desperately cleaning his kitchen at 2am, positive the cops are about to break his door down any second and arrest him.

I eventually realize I have to work the next day and I really need to sleep. My shift started at 9am and it's already 2am. I slept for like 5-6 hours and actually woke up feeling completely fine. I don't remember the day at work at all, so I assume it was uneventful."
TIL 5 pizzas and a dessert can feed a village in Uganda.
Man up and give her a sincere apology
"I got pretty fucked up the other night when my brother gave me some brownies for New Year’s Eve. I’ve smoked weed many times and taken many edibles, so I figured 2 would be sufficient, what I failed to remember was the fact that I hadn’t done either of those things in about 2 years and no longer had a tolerance built up like I had in the past... needless to say, at about 4 in the morning my wife asked me why I was naked watching the credits of super high me and my reply was “I think this is my life now” and she left me there until 2 pm the next day. I called my brother and told him what happened and all he had to say was “did I forget to mention that you should probably only eat half of one at a time?” Yes, yes you did."
Or we'll have another story in which tifu by shitting on my door
He did say no. The lack of English presumably didn't help. What OP needs to do is work on walking out of a situation he didn't want to be in. Dude needed to be firm in the $50 and if that wasn't working then leave.

"One night, my dad woke up in a drunken daze and went to go munch on some pop tarts. He gets up and hazily opens the pop tart and takes a bite. He was disgusted at the taste and spit it out and went back to bed. In the morning, I woke to find an open un-microwaved brick of popcorn with a bite taken out of it. I will never let him live it down.

One night I was the guy at the table who was way too high. Only problem was I was the waiter. I had eaten brownies right before my shift and got WAY higher than anticipated. I was so stoned that I couldn't talk loud enough for my tables to hear me. They seemed irritated. Every time I looked in the mirror my eyes were a darker shade of red. I was overwhelmed with paranoia and certain I was going to get fired and i just kept getting higher. Rough night.
"I had to teach while accidentally being high a couple years back. 


I woke up hungover the night after a weekday party looking for something to eat (huge raptors fan after they beat Miami in game 7 last year). Could only find toast and two cookies before I left to work as a substitute teacher. After a 30 look car ride to work I start to realize those were not regular cookies. I'm losing my shit in the parking lot at the school, I'm thinking I should call in sick or some shit but the bell is about to ring in 10 min and I'm teaching PE. ""I've done it a million times I can handle it.""

Get to the school and realize PE teacher I'm covering for is painting lines for the upcoming track and field event (that's why they need me to cover). He tells me I'm there to inform each grade about the upcoming track and field day and all the ""do's and do not's"" before we get into whatever sport they were doing that week. The more he's telling me what I need to say to each grade the more I'm realizing just how fucked up I am off those cookies. ""They'll find out I'm high as fuck"" ""I'll never get a teaching position in this division."" I'm literally freaking out but trying to act how a ""not-high"" person would act. I smile and nod probably 45 times in that 5 min convo. Bell rings and I get the grade to have a seat in the middle of the gym. 50 grade 9 students looking up at their new stoned substitute at 8:40 AM as I'm trying to explain the track and field day. 


I somehow got through that day but still think back to it. That image of 100 eyeballs looking up at me while I'm the most fucked up I've ever been still overwhelmes me just to think about. "
I'm gonna be careful eating anything.

"I'm pretty sure what happened to OP was he picked up a dude at 11pm he didn't know. That dude was trying to feel out whether OP was just a nice idiot or was actually soliciting him.

OP proceeded to ferry dude around who was trying to get drugs. Whether the first dudes declined to front or just weren't around idk.

Eventually the dude realised he wasn't gonna be able to earn the money by blowing OP so just outright asked.

OP then drives him to place where he meets his connect (now w $40 to buy shit w). The dude doesn't have it on him so he says follow me.  They go back to dudes house.  The hitchhiker goes in and does deal. Then asks for a ride back closer to wherever he stays and tricks at. 

The hitchhiker makes one final attempt to get more money from OP by overtly suggesting sex was on the table. I guarantee if OP had gone for it he would have found out real quick this dude was gonna charge for the service (ie. Male prostitute). The timeline on OP story would have him picking this dude up on or after 11 fucking PM. Dude. You need to get some street smarts. 

Edit: obligatory ""my most upvoted comment"" is explaining to OP that he picked up a male prostitute and proceeded to obviously ferry him to and fund a drug deal. 

Also I just realized the dude gave his name as RANDY! Fucking RANDY! As in I'm feeling Randy, let's do some male on male dick sucking! Godamnit OP, you crazy, naive, lucky schmo!"

After the ending point in my story, things ironically became more rushed.  My wife's entire focus distilled down to the singular goal of getting me home before I threw-up on the table, so we went outside for some fresh air and then got our food to go.

"I once smoked and went to work. This was +20 years ago, when I was a kid and i worked at Burger King (briefly). Fortunately, the BK was literally in my backyard.

I was fine (hah) and thought someone had sold my boyfriend oregano (hah hah) so I went to work. I used to be a closer, which meant I would work for a few hours on grill, then the restaurant would close and we would clean shit until the wee hours of the night.

There was a woman named Bert who was both religious and developmentally delayed, in equal amounts. She would randomly shout out “PRAISE JESUS!” while mopping the bathrooms or collecting the trash. She was sweet, and waiting for what she would say next (and in front of whom) made a dull job a bit better.

I get to work and the weed kicks in. Hard. I have only smoked 6 or 8 times in my life, so this was probably the third time? I was HIGH.

And Bert starts PRAISING JESUS from the back of the kitchen. And I start PRAISING JESUS right along with her. And that time disconnect thing happens and I spent a week MAKING WHOPPIES, MAKING WHOPPIES FOR JESUS!!!!! that night.

I got sent home early.

Now I’m a total soccer mom, PTA secretary, business owning, mortgage paying agnostic grown up, but I still can’t drive past a BK without a little voice in my head yelling “MAKING WHOPPIES FOR JESUS!”"

"I put 2 chemical soaked contact into my eyes once by accident. It was terrifying to be blind for a week or two

Edit for clarity: I was at a friends house about ten years ago, and was getting ready for bed when I realized I hadn't a contact case for my lenses. Friends mother let me borrow hers (which I assume she must've tried to clean) and I used it. Next morning we were getting ready to head down to his local park and I went to put them back in and they began to sting. Slowly they began to hurt more and more until I could no longer stand it or even keep my eyes open. 

They panicked, I panicked and they rushed me to my eye doctor where the contacts could be safely removed because I would not let anyone but them touch my eyes. Ended up burning a layer off of my eyeballs and unable to open my eyes or see much other than shadows for a few weeks after. They got very swollen and turned grey for that time period, and my eyes are scarred from it. 

I do now where single use 1 a day contacts but didn't start using those until about a year ago. After the incident I began wearing contacts I could sleep in. 

I still don't know if someone tried cleaning the case with Chems, if the solution had something in it or if my friend or his brother tampered with it as a prank, but I now know to take my contact out right away if it's irritated for more than a minute after putting it in. 

Please don't let my story deter you from contacts, because it didn't for me and they are an essential part of my life. "

I got her a cat about a year ago and the neighbor told me that the cat is not allowed on “his” side of the road. Okay, whatever.

So neighbor takes the cat and drops it off at the animal shelter, pretending it’s his, and tells them to put it down. They refuse without the papers and she’s chipped. It’s a whole situation. On the day they moved in, my little sister made them brownies and took them over, knocked on the door and waited. They didn’t answer. So little sister wanders back across the road, and, when she gets to our front porch, looks back to watch the father look her dead in the eyes as he’s throwing the treats, plate and all, into the garbage. Other petty bullshit acts besides these,etc."
"You are in for a lifetime of ""my doctor doesn't hear me"" jokes. 
Side note. I have permanent hearing loss because my cute little baby decided to blow into my ear as I slept the same way that you would blow into a balloon. That was six years ago. Life still sucks ass on a daily because of it.  :("
I have a feeling his Jesuit Catholic Values may have blinded him from this realization.
Your roommate sucks.
"Australian here. 

Does the US not have 2 or 3 clean, legit, reasonably-priced massage places of different flavors (Thai etc) in Every. Single. Mall. ?

Cause we do.*

Not trying to be rude, genuinely surprised.

* I find it vaguely irritating because I hate massages and would rather the space was taken by something I care about."
"Fuck it, pizza in the morning, pizza in the evening, pizza at supper time for the next week!"
"Grooming of others is a common act in primates, perhaps this is similar."
Secret gay with 10 kids?! Thats hilarious!
"He's male, wouldn't be believed ""so I walked into a happy ending massage parlor with no sign, paid extra, made handjob motions at them, and didn't want a handjob so am filing a report."""
Sometimes I Dutch oven myself and pretend to try to escape
"Good piece of advice for you: when some random person is walking up to you in a parking lot at night, you're not going to like anything they have to say. Shut em down right away. Don't even let them get near you, get aggressive if needed.

Take the rose colored glasses off, this isn't trading spaces. Protect your god damn neck."
"I couldn’t stifle my laughter and just woke up my very pregnant, poorly and now very angry woman. Very good and funny read, very well written also. May you continue with a follow up of how things went from there? I really gotta know how this panned out in the end as I’m sure the rest of us do (especially about how your wife was with you in the end) 10/10!! "
"Also ""I don't get paid enough for this shit"".*

*Provided that this happened in America."
"Oh, nevermind then. Fuck that guy. "
"No offense taken, but I also have very mixed feelings about prostitution, like I think everyone assumes people working in it are forced into it when that's not necessarily the case and maybe (and this is entirely just my opinion) they're more coerced into it where yes they're getting screwed (no pun intended) but for them it's better to be over here than back wherever they came from. And I don't think it's my place to gamble that they don't want to be doing it for them. Which I understand is probably enabling shit that shouldn't fly but at a certain point I'm just some dude that doesn't like police to begin with and I think at a certain point I just need to accept that I can't fix everything and maybe in trying to do so I just fuck over a bunch of people making a living (illegally but not always immorally) "
"
The neighbors were a little reactive in calling the cops especially when the little girl was in your yard.

Unless the little girl said, ""that man took me and showed me his pee-pee"", then they should have just walked over and asked you why the little girl saw you neked. 

"
"yeah, I'm gonna need an expert's take on this"
Also he shit his pants.
"&gt;""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is nothing on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.

Nope, nope, no. This is the moment I fucking lost it.

I wish I could gild you but I'm broke. This story is glorious from start to finish, hope you're okay now and the parents...tolerate you? "
You can’t shart big time.  Sharting is where you fart and a little shit comes out. You just shit yourself.
You're Finnished
"“Oh well, I assume there’s no more stink bugs infested in this sealed package! Nomnomnom!!!”"

Mmmm moth toast!"
"It was unwanted sexual contact. It wasn't *forced or coerced* unwanted sexual contact. That's the distinction, that's the reason it wasn't rape. At no point was the authority to consent removed from you, nor was removal of authority to consent implied nor threatened. That's why people call it ""rapey"" and not rape, because they are uncomfortable with the situation and aren't sure what to do about that. The answer is to do what you did and what every non-consenting person should do when confronted with a situation they do not want to be a part of: exercise their authority to remove themselves from it.

However, you were definitely defrauded of your money, as the services were advertised fraudulently. That's what I would be pissed about.

It's like, yeah of course they tried to get you off, that's what they do there, it's the business they're in, and if you don't like it you are free to not partake, which is exactly what you did. But you know, couldn't they have told you that *before* you paid them for what you thought was a massage?"
"He really didn't force OP, OP was merely being a gigantic idiot."
Shit I’m sitting here thinking this guy would have taken one for the team doing that
The morman wanted mormen.
"I'm just amazed that she didn't start meowing. My cat is extremely vocal, and he would've made sure the whole restaurant knew he was there!"
Really pissed me off too.
"1) ""I've smoked before, this is no big deal.""

2) Only one? I want to actually feel it. 

3) This is taking forever, maybe just one or two more. 

4) Floor. "
I didn’t even read the bottom half.  Jeez this was so cringe.  I can’t believe some people’s decision making. 
seriously.  a true bro would've stayed incognito or noped out of the room like a ninja. 
This was the sentence that cracked me up.
"Jesus Christ, surely that's torture level shit? It seems absurd and abusive to inflict that on a child for having a fucking toy on them."

"One time I ate some ABV.  Did I measure? No. 

Having a good time. Ate a slice of sausage pizza while my dog was by me. I for a lack of a better term hallucinated, my pizza was made of my dog. 

Didn’t eat meat for 6 months. "
I'm now convinced that this TIFU was a ruse just to make this joke.
"Dude, go to the station to talk to their supervisor and thank them, and bring written thanks. That's a big deal for them, and they did goooood."
Thank goodness you're okay. Some advice my momma gave me and I live by is by all means NEVER let a stranger/hitchhiker into your car.  No matter what. Especially if you're alone. Please ladies for my sanity don't do it. Call the person a Lyft if you absolutely must but please please don't put yourself in that position.
"Meh, wouldn't worry too much.

In a vacuum, what you did seemed a lot more like a prank, whereas he seemed unapologetically malicious. Trying to get people's pets killed? Fuck that guy.

Also seemed like he had put a lot of work into having it coming. Last drop, camel's back and all that. Some people are just shit. Even if the outcome was more than you intended, he deserved worse for that cat thing alone imo.

Well done, well played, and high five."
"His ""buddy"" is code for drug dealer"
Can confirm
That was a drug deal. 
For a second there I thought the old lady was going to do the massage.
"Oh man. It goes from ""man this is fucking awesome, I'm never drinking again and edibles are so much cheaper!"" to ""I'm going to fucking die"" real fast."
Why is the standard dose half a cookie though? Its such an odd measure. Why not just dilute it by half and make one cookie the standard dose?
"You were driving, but he took you for a ride."
"And deserves it.

^^^^^for ^^^^^stupidity"
I think he assumed everyone knows what it's from and it was just a really bad joke
That boy met the devil
Every time I think I have poor social skills I read something like this and feel better about myself. Thanks OP! 
"I mean, for what it's worth, he had no way of knowing that the dude across the street had been caught fooling around behind his wife's back with other men before. If neighbor dude hadn't apparently been a skeevy fuck, then OP's prank would have been significantly more harmless. Sometimes the stars just align to fuck a person in the ass."
it's sad that a man cannot walk around nude on his own property. without being accused by trespassers of being a pedo.
"While this does necessitate an apology, I'm not sure it will be resolved in a way that leads to her still interested in him romantically. 

Any apology essentially amounts to ""I'm sorry. I knew my roommate was right there, but I was horny."" Because the thing is, this wasn't an embarrassing moment due to drunken negligence. He knew his roommate was there and let her keep going. That's a whole different thing and it makes him look a lot worse than if it was truly just an accident.

But by all means, she deserves an apology. With the cultural climate of sexual accusations these days, I would try and get well ahead of that curve if I were OP."
"I'm pretty sure none of ""NYC's top restaurants"" would sing ""Happy Birthday"" to people while making a cacophony of noise. Unless the best restaurant in New York actually *is* a TGI Friday's?"

"Someone needs to really get my husband to understand this. What’s worse is afterwards, I’m not right, he had “known all along, but still... “"

I think you should write your own In depth TIFU. I bet everyone here would want to read it! :D
It ended too soon. Looking forward to part 2
"took 4 tabs once, and half an eight of shrooms and legit forgot I existed."
"From what the cops said to me, that's pretty much exactly the story she told them. I don't know if she was worried about getting in trouble for being in someone else's yard or if she was genuinely that frightened and believed something more happened, but it sounded like she told quite a different story than ""the man walked outside with no clothes on."""
"EVERYTIME I make edibles I give the advice of “eat 1/4th and wait 45 minutes”.  


One friend ate one cookie, waited 15 and ate another, waited 15 and ate another.  She got fucking DESTROYED, like 30 hour high.  My then gf and I went to her room and knocked on the door.  She emerged, looked at us blankly and said, “Cookies.”  Then closed the door.  "
Welp my dick just inverted
Weaponized naïveté?
Girls are weird.
"I came across a scene where a guy had driven straight into oncoming traffic and then just stopped in the middle of the road and sat there. Everyone was a bit panicked by the near miss and no one had thought to take his keys so I grabbed them out of the ignition and tried to get his name but he was just like a zombie. It was dark but he had sunglasses on and was slurring his words, so we initially assumed he was drunk and we were pissed off. Cop arrived and got even less response so he had to physically drag this guy out of the car and throw him to the ground and cuff him. Luckily there was very little resistance. I stayed with him while the cop moved his car off the road, along with a couple of guys. It became clear that this was a low blood sugar problem, in part because of the lollies in his car. Once the ambulance turned up and gave him glucose he was able to explain what happened. He was driving home from work and felt a bit off, but being on insulin it hit really quickly. Turns out he had driven about 20km with no idea what he was doing and thankfully hit no one. Poor bloke was horrified. And I learnt a very valuable lesson about assumptions. "
"He robbed you of $40, and then got out of the car to talk to people, and begged you not to leave.  Drive off at that point and get far, far away.  Also, regardless of the area of the city, go into the 24hr liquor store and tell the clerk a guy is in your car and mugging you, ask them to call the police.  And that's that.

I'm very relieved you were not physically harmed in any way during this.  You can be a Jesuit Catholic and live by those values, but you don't have to be a willing crime victim and submit yourself to more."
Yeah Ativan and versed are kinda our go to. I'll typically use Ativan for IM use if they're too combative for me to get an IV
"I don’t know, you seem so clueless it’s almost unbelievable. I think most people’s reaction when confronted with an unlabeled shady establishment would’ve been “no thanks I think I’ll buy a six pack and go home”. And you paid $100 anyway might as well have splurged on a legit place! "
"American education system for ya. What can ya do?

At least now I have the patience of a zen monk, so there's that."
I'm American and for every sentence I read I just got more and more confused about how a dead man could write this. You're VERY lucky. 
"Yeah, if they didn't undertand the “no” part, then, to their understanding, OP was clearly asking for a handjob."
"I did the same thing. But it was because my husband was high in 30 minutes and I started getting paranoid I was maybe, I dunno, too fat to absorb the drug hahah. I was probably high when I thought that. I’m a control freak, so even when I get drunk or (when I used to) smoke pot at home, it’s just enough to get buzzed. I thought I was in control that night, so I even ordered a mojito with dinner.. after two sips it hit me, and I was high out of my mind at a restaurant in Vegas and also said everything out loud that I was thinking in my head. My husband said I was saying, “OK, keep it together. Don’t laugh. Don’t. Laugh,” right before I’d bust out laughing. 

I almost pissed my pants reading this story. I relate in all aspects other than the urinal experience, but I also had no sense of real time. My husband said I was also sitting at the table smacking my lips and sucking down water. I had THE WORST case of cotton mouth. 

Lord. I would do it all over again too. Hahaha. Never in front of my in laws though!! Lmao. "
"She already knows what happened, he realized they might not be alone and didn't say anything, pretty cut and dry. But she might forgive him on the basis that he was drunk and not thinking straight, everyone does dumb shit while drunk. "
Something similar happened to my buddy on acid and now he does absolutely no drugs whatsoever and is vegan
"IMHO-Sharting is defined by feeling the need to fart, going for it, and then that fart subsequently opening the floodgates to shit town. I don't think it matters how big the shit is- if you had to fart but didn't know you also had to shit, and the act of farting caused it- it's a shart.  

- Is a paragraph I definitely never thought I'd have to write."
"""I need to get in your car so you can follow my friend in his large SUV with plenty of space for multiple passengers to another location so that he can then give me a ride to my car.""

""Oh. Okay."""
I'm always wondering how idiots at the bar using the urinal can miss the target so badly and leave huge puddles on the floor that you have to try and avoid when taking a leak. Now I know I guess. 
"OP is definitely not a ""she"". My *very first thought* when OP didn't immediately go into fight-or-flight mode at a strange man approaching them in a parking lot at midnight was ""OP is definitely not female"". We already know about stranger danger. 

(That was before the ""ex-girlfriend"" was mentioned and the gay man started hitting on OP.)"
this is how people die
"I'm a guy and I've given strangers rides on numerous occasions, but Ive never let someone take $40 from me or tell me to drive them to numerous locations. I accept that I'm taking a risk when I pick someone up, but that doesnt mean I have to put myself in increasingly worse situations. There's compassion, then there's stupidity. "

"OP is male. 

It doesn't mean he wasn't in a scary or threatening situation, but just pointing it out. I assumed he was female for the first bit of the story, too. "
"My dad always says “Never trust a fart, and never waste an erection”"
"Am I the only one that thinks that after things calmed down shed probably be turned on as shit that even at his most basic of instincts her husband's first thought is ""save my family"" and he's willing to take on a whole fucking crew of dudes to try and protect her and did literally everything in his power (pretty damn successfully, might I add) to make that ""intruder's"" life harder. Shit, I'm a 6'4 straight man and I'd give OP at LEAST an unenthusiastic BJ for that..."
In future you should try not to give a shit. 
"My graduating class included a guy with a magnificent pot plantation. He was ""the old guy"" in the class. Everyone went to his house for a ""grad party"" There was every type of pot including edibles....everywhere... of questionable origin. People were chatting and gobbling. I brought a date so I didn't want to be F'd up otherwise I would have naiively tried a lot too. The next day everyone was horribly ruined mentally and some were barfing. Very different than one or two hoots from a skinny joint"

"They didn't at first. That's why I think she told them a much worse version of what actually happened. I showed them my yard and how private it was, the dog tie-out, etc. and spent the better part of an hour talking to them before they finally believed it wasn't intentional. "
