"Two things:

1. Spend as little money as possible from the time I had my first job as a janitor at a summer camp. I would save half of what I earned, no exception. By the time I had my first professional job, I'd save well over half. My parents let me (and encouraged me to) live with them rent-free until I was 30.

2. Invested the proceeds wisely in financial markets. For the past five years, I've averaged a return of 22%. Prior to that, I've had years where I doubled my money. All of this required countless spreadsheets, quite a bit of time, and certainly some luck."

"I was in your shoes at one time, split up with him and he went with a girl he was cheating on me with and I found out 2 weeks after he left that I was pregnant with his baby and then 6 weeks later lost my job and a few months after that my mom died (I get it).  I hung onto every chance I got to see him and lost my sense of self, so I totally understand.  You need to do a few things.  1.  Stop seeing him, you need to treat it as if the man you were/are in love with has died.  It is a death, a death of your relationship. The man you loved is gone, he has died, he is not the man you are having brunch with. 2.  You need to deal with your feelings and when you want to see him or you feel hurt or angry, write everything down to him in a letter.  I wrote so many letters and they were soaked with tears.  Pour your feeling out into those letters but DO NOT MAIL THEM.  You have to force yourself to be strong and realize your happiness doesn't lie in him, it is inside you, you will have to dig deep on this and trust me, writing these letters will really really help you.  DO NOT GIVE ALL YOUR POWER TO HIM.  He is very selfish if he is stringing you along and that is prolonging the inevitable.  I wish you the best and if you need to feel free to PM me. "

Well I texted my friend in my class and asked for help. He decided to leave me in the bathroom just to play with me.

As for my social life, it was never great. Most evenings consisted of pickup hockey, gaming, and studying.

I don't have any particular regrets off the top of my mind. Certainly there are things I would have done differently, but that's made me who I am today and I spend my time looking forward rather than backwards."
"Yeah, I've heard of her. I by no means intend offense to you but that lady is full of shit. RP and diet are not connected (heavily researched and backed by science) and it cannot be cured.

Some people experience very mild RP symptoms and may not have flair ups for many years but they cannot be cured.

I get really fired up about this because all of this BS Gweneth Paltrow Goop science is really dangerous. False medical information is abundant on the web. A lot of it is ""eat this way and shove jade up your vagina"" and it's insane.

Lets begin with my parents i guess?

&amp;nbsp;

My mom, just a normal individual living in Europe during her time. She lives and works in Europe as a nurse, born in the 1960's. At some point in her life (mid 20s), she was offered a job in a Saudi Arabian hospital, with increased pay, as well as a place to stay. She happily accepted the offer, as she had always wanted to visit other countries. Why Saudi Arabia? I do not know. (If I recall correctly, i'm not sure if it is still this way, most nurses in Saudi Arabian hospitals were foreigners, I think this still is the case)

&amp;nbsp;

After a year of working in Saudi Arabia,which my mom enjoyed, my now Aunt introduced my mother to my father. I'm not sure about the exact details of the meeting at that time, how it all occurred.

&amp;nbsp;

I will be visiting my mother this evening and will be more than glad to ask her how it went down if anyone's interested.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, fast forward a year later, they are both married. My mother told me that the day they married, my dad said, and I quote: ""I will regret this day for the rest of my life"". Why exactly, i'm not aware.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, knowing Saudi law, she is officially fucked. Your WIFE is not allowed to leave the country without your husband's consent and lets not even start talking about a female divorcing a male. 

&amp;nbsp;

My dad was a successful business man, he earned decent money. At some point in his life he had a porsche, rolls royce and a mercedes, a house, garden etc... While things started to go shape up financially, they decided to have a child. That child happens to be my brother. My Dad being semi-wealthy and all at some point and acquiring connections in Saudi Arabia, he somehow gets access to alcohol.

&amp;nbsp;

This is roughly around the time my Dad started beating my mother, this so far are from memories I cannot recollect as I have yet to be born. 

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, lets fast forward some more, let us fast forward to the time I was 6-7 years old, where I start recollecting things. I would wake up in the middle of the night to the screams of my mother being whipped by a belt. He would beat her for several hours a night, after enjoying half a bottle of black label whiskey. I would hear him yell at her, claiming she has fucked more than 50 men and that she is a slut. The saddest part about all of this, I at that time believed it, i honestly believed my mom is a fucking whore and that is why she is being beaten, which of course is not true.

&amp;nbsp;

Me and my sister shared a room at that time, my brother was just a door step away. When the beatings would begin, we would all end up lying together in one bed, worried, terrified, not knowing what to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

We would talk to each other, my brother, whom I didn't get along with very well back then (10 at that time) would try to calm us, although I would still see how terrified he is. Because the next person who would recieve one of the worst beatings after my mother, is my brother.

&amp;nbsp;

I will never forget this evening. I looked at my brother and my sister and told them, this has got to stop, i'm going to go out now and tell them to stop fighting. My brother warned me not to. I opened the door to the living room, to see my mother kneeling. My dad sitting on a chair, half full bottle of whiskey on the table and belt in his left hand. He looks at me, my mom looks at me, literally full of blue marks and beatings.

&amp;nbsp;

They both pause and don't say a word and I mutter:

&amp;nbsp;

""Why can't we be a happy family?"", something along those lines. 

&amp;nbsp;

Next thing you know, my dad says ""taha lahon..."". *SLAP*. Which translates to ""come here"" in arabic.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, that is just a small intro. Excuse my English should I have any mistakes, i grew up speaking 3 languages and I'm still not sure as to which language I should refer to as my main.

Im bipolar, and have shown traits of extreme emotional swings and distress since very early childhood. Because of the bipolar, I was a DIFFICULT kid. It's hard for me to look back and know what was a justified punishment, what was a punishment that went too far, and what was flat out cruelty. I was often slapped and shoved, pulled around around by my hair, etc by my dad when my mum wasn't there.

But the first instance that stands out to me as flat out abuse is this: I was around 7-8, was sent home from school for bad behaviour, something that happened pretty often. My dad was driving me home, he seemed oddly calm, told me to keep my seatbelt off, so I didn't put it on. As we were driving home, he suddenly slammed the breaks, making me slam into the seat in front of me, and bruise my jaw, eye socket, and gave me a bad nose bleed. He screamed at me, I don't remember exactly what he said, I was confused by the blow to my head. 

The physical abuse occurred maybe 4-5 times a year. Not enough to be a constant in my life, but enough to scare the shit out of me whenever my dad got angry. But the emotional and verbal abuse was every day. He'd call me names, humiliate me in front of people, and belittle me. 

A few months ago, we were in his car with two of his friends, about to get out and head into the house. One called me a bitch, and when I told him not to call me that, my dad locked the car and wouldn't let me leave until I had called MYSELF a bitch. That one killed my pride man.

Because of my bipolar, rape in my childhood and abuse from my dad, suicide attempts were a common theme in my teenage years. I was BIG into self harm too. I was almost always beaten when I got home from hospital, but he'd sometimes cry as he did it, telling me how angry he was that I'd do something like that . 

What lead to my running away was that I genuinely thought he was going to kill me. I thought I was going to die that day. He's a big dude, about 6'3 and STRONG, and while I'm not a short girl, I'm small enough that one hard punch from him could definitely kill me, that's what I was sure was going to happen 

We had been arguing for a few days over him doing something that put my pet parrot in a lot of danger. But the day before the incident, the argument was big, but we eventually calmed down and he agreed to stop putting my bird in so much danger. 

The morning of the incident, I came downstairs, and he had done the very thing he had promised he wouldn't do. I sighed, pretty defeated and calmly said ""Dude, we spoke about this yesterday."" That made him SNAP.

He grabbed my shirt and yanked me towards him, SCREAMING in my face about my attitude. I have to emphasize, this was beyond anything a sane person could do. He was grinning, while screeching at me, so close his spit was in my eyes. I've been in psych ward and have never seen anyone this angry. I tried to head upstairs and push him away, because I knew he was going to beat me, I had never seen ANYONE this angry. He was rabid.

I managed to lock myself in the bathroom. He screamed at me through the door, taunting me for over an hour. He told me he dares me to attempt suicide, he asked me if I wanted him to hit me, and he said he was going to choke me. And he told me he intended to kill my bird. I was hysteric, yanking at my hair and i couldn't screaming. I was terrified, I had never been this scared in my fucking life. 

I heard him go downstairs, so I ran for my room to check on my parrot. My dad heard me, and bolted upstairs, grabbed my arm before I could reach my room. I was slammed against the wall as he repeatedly asked me if I wanted him to hit me, and light mock-slaps were dished out against my cheek, obviously trying to distress me more . He held my chin so tight I thought he was trying to break my jaw. He mocked my rape, he mocked my mental illness, and just a whole lot of other horrid shit. Honestly it's hard to remember it all. The ordeal lasted so long and it was by far the most traumatic experience of my life, I was in a state of complete hysterics.

When he let go, I ran for the bathroom again, and managed to lock myself in. At some point my mum came home, and I heard her try to calm him while he tried to bust down the door.

I was convinced he was going to beat me to death. I was so scared and 100% sure I wouldn't be alive in 5 minutes, I relapsed in my self harm. In a horrid spiteful move, I wrote ""FAT CUNT"" on the bathroom wall with my own blood. HORRIBLE, manipulative and sick, I know. But I wanted to make a stab at him. One last fight. 

I realised I couldn't die there, I wouldn't, I wasn't going to be beaten to death on a bathroom floor and die by my dad's hands. My guts screamed that at me, that I SHOULD NOT die there. I got a burst of courage and determination that I would make it out.


My mum somehow managed to get my dad outside of the house. I attempted to pack a bag of essentials ( I say attempted cause I forgot my charger, my phone and my iPad lmao. All I really had in the bag was a few shirts, a pair of jeans, and a copy of the silmarillion.) 

I ran about three miles to my friends house. I slept on their sofa until I found my appartment. I should mention: my bipolar is bad enough that Im not allowed to work. I receive benefits but not enough to live on on my own, about £450 a month. I begged people to consider flat sharing with me,  cause there was Noooooo way I could afford a place on my own.

But I managed to find a studio apartment for £250 a month. It's tiny. It's smaller than my modest bedroom at my parents house. But it's 30 miles away from my dad, who still doesn't know where I am, it's got two locks on the door, and he's not fucking coming in. 

I still need to borrow money for food, I can pay all my own bills but have nearly nothing left after the bills. I can't afford any luxuries. I live on cheap vegetables, rice and pasta and tinned foods. I can't afford own brand coffee. 

But I'm fucking safe for once and my mental health is greatly improving. Im running several miles a day, I'm going to the local coffee shop to socialize ( as sad as it sounds, I have no friends now, and I had a breakdown in that coffee place when I first moved here, the staff were lovely to me and give me free coffee ).

My life should be 100x worse now . I have literally no money to spare, I have no friends or family for dozens of miles, I have left almost all my belongings.

But me and my ( very much alive ) parrot are happier than we've ever been. I got a bit emotional typing how happy I am here tbh lmao. 

I can't describe the weight that's been lifted.

Sorry for the long post but u asked for it!!"

Tired morning me didn't realize the sound was coming from the phone not the things in my ears. There were maybe 5 other passengers standing around me. After listening for about 10 mins, I realized. Hope they enjoyed the story"
Greatest gratitude my fellow redditor
"I just called my girlfriend 'bro' over text, what's the buy in on the game you've got going?"
"Conservative estiment: 3 

I'll have to verify with mom FB groups to be sure. "
"Why are you retiring?
"
"Well done for trying to quit!! 
What’s your least favourite type/shape of pasta?"
"Yes i call it a bag but yes I where a ""man purse"" $80 sunglasses scarfs and im not afraid of wearing ""girl cothles"" if i look good in it and I can't forget that i currently have neon blue hair "
"Agreed! Plenty of people with the same life circumstances waste their money.

But a lot of people who work hard and also have great financial discipline have to pay rent, utilities, car payments, medical bills, tuition, childcare, etc., and can't save or invest to this extent.

The problem isn't OP retiring young. It's people ignoring the fact that most people couldn't do the same by no fault of their own."
Yanny or Laurel?
"I sweat profusely on my lower back and armpits, then my whole body becomes tingly like all of my sweat pores has suddenly open and a single drop is being created from respective pores"

"I'm not aware of an abuse. But my psychologist says, I could have displaced it. I don't know the reason (yet)"
"I did. We filmed that in about 2 weeks after I turned 18. It was one of the times I was most sexually active in my life. Not just because of the porn. In that time (I'd say about 3 month) I really lost control and all I cared for was sex. 

For example, I had the second guy/girl scene on a Saturday at 2 pm. I had had sex in the night before with a guy I met at a club, spent the night with him, had sex with him again in the morning, went to the scene, had sex there, came home masturbated, called a friend gave him a blowjob and went to the club again in the evening, where I gave 2 blowjobs to strangers and had sex in the night. It was crazy. I couldn't really think clearly."
"As a father, take it from me. Your father wants to spend every second he can with you, but he has to do his best to keep your family going the only way he can. My heart breaks for all of you. Have you told your dad that you understand? I'm sure it would mean the world for him to hear that. "

"So I'm assuming your parents dont know yet. How do you think that will go? 

Also you got a tough road ahead i don't envy your struggle. Just keep in mind you aren't the first one nor the last one to go through troubles. There's always some one who's been through the same or similar struggles. There is always support some where. To many young gay men and women have ended their lives thinking things wont get better or that they are the only one. You're not alone. 

Not saying you feel that way just letting you know. "
"Or you could sneak into the teachers toilet and steal all their toilet paper.

Better idea is to bring a toilet roll to school, then you have something to trade people with. I guess it's like the zombie apocalypse when loo roll becomes more valuable than gold."

Do you maintain any contact at all with your dad? Do you want to?
"Do you still have sex or is that forbidden during the treatment?

"This happened to me once. It was during Halloween and I was playing Monster Mash on repeat in what was supposed to be a quiet university library. A kind, Asian man broke the news to me. 💀 Not a question, I guess, but I've been there, bud. "
