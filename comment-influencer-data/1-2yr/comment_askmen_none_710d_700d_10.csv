"Here are some tips.

As a general guideline:

* What's subtle to you is invisible to him.

* What's obvious to you is subtle to him.

* What's obvious to the point of embarrassing to you, is starting to be visible to him.

Not sure if girls plan it out or just do it naturally, but what works best on me is when girls have ""warmed me up"" a little first with casual conversation. So that when they do finally ask me out, it feels natural and it's easy for me to say yes.

The following may seem like a lot, but many women have gone through many of the steps in one conversation, and closed by asking for the date. Some girls are really smooth.

Here is the process:

* Bring up some excuse to talk to him: class, work, etc.  Then transition into talking about interests and your personal lives.

* Express interest.  Put away your phone, maintain eye contact, and be attentive. Lean in closer to him when he talks. Forget about playing hard to get--that just makes it easier for the guy to think you're not interested. Be engaged in the conversation. 

* Flirt. Girls who are flirty with me from the start will stay out of the female friend-zone.  Be careful with teasing though; some girls don't know the difference between light playful teasing and hurtful insults. When in doubt, err toward being *complimentary* rather than critical, e.g. ""Ooh, I think it's hot when a man [does X],"" not, ""You'll have to learn to [do X] if you ever want to get a girlfriend."" Breaking his balls is not sexy. Stroking his ego is.

* Compliment his appearance.  Guys hardly ever get appreciation, so you'll stand out immediately.  Seriously, I and my guy friends will puff out our chests for a week if we get a sincere compliment from a girl who isn't our mom or relative. **However, make sure to compliment *him,* not just his clothes** (this is a common mistake since clothes are how women compliment each other). Otherwise, he'll assume you like his clothes and shrug it off.  Lots of articles advise women to tell men, ""Hey, I like your shirt.""  Only to have the guy completely miss the hint she was into him. Compliment his face, body, skill (guys pride themselves on skill) etc. Women want to be more than a sex object; men want to be a sex prospect.

* Offer your phone number first before he asks.  That one is a blatant green light for me.  But get his number too, if it was an accidental meeting and you might never see him again.

* ""Direct approach"": Ask him out on a ""date.""  Actually say the word, ""Date.""  Hinting he should ask you out often does not work.  If you use subtlety, you'll complain to your girl friends later how he doesn't notice.  Use your words and you could be on a date with him tomorrow. Edit: this is more effective in person, not over text or e-mail or Facebook. Via technology, the guy might talk himself into thinking you're joking or you meant that for someone else you were chatting online with. 

* ""Self-invite"" date, e.g. when he talks about a cool bar/restaurant/whatever he discovered you say, ""I'd love to go there! Are you hitting it up later this week?""

* ""Reminder"" date, a good follow-up to the ""self-invite"" date: ""Hey, when are we going to that great bar you told me about?

* ""Student"" approach: you see a guy who's good at something, e.g. throwing darts. You introduce yourself and ask him to teach you. Commence flirting.

* Shy Girl's Stealth Strategy. The girl suggests cool upcoming events: new movie, concerts, shows, etc. Naturally weaves them into the conversation. Eventually one would catch my interest and I'd just react and say, ""Yeah, I'd love to go to that."" Then she says, ""Great! Let's go together on Friday. Meet me at seven."" So smooth that I'd only realize *hours* later she had set me up to ask me out.

* If you want him right now, try to get him alone. ""Hey, it's kinda loud in here, want to go outside for a bit?"" If you really want to go further, suggest splitting a taxi or inviting him back to your place. Or if you're going to his place, ask him to see his bedroom, and make a move on him then.

* Physical touching.  Guys are taught to keep their hands to themselves around women, so a guy will definitely notice if a girl breaks the touch barrier.  You don't have to grope him, but touch his arm in conversation when you're emphasizing a point or laughing at something he says.  

Here are some bolder moves, more suitable for a party/nightclub/bar situation.

Bold: put your hand on his thigh.  

Bolder: sit close to him and press your thigh against his thigh. Or if you're sitting across from him, rub your foot against his leg.
 
Boldest: sit on his lap and put his arm around you. Some girls ""trip"" and fall into guy's laps. Like a dumbass, I've helped girls stand up and sent them on their way, when they actually wanted to talk to me. The more persistent ones stuck around and talked to me anyway.

If you're dancing, dance closer. Grind your body against his.

Keep escalating unless he makes it clear your advances are not welcome. 

**Negative tactics**  

Some girls do these things to attract guys, but they actually repel guys. These should go without saying, but I'm including them for the sake of covering all bases.

* Try to make him jealous.  Flirting with other guys in front of him, talking about how you get asked out a lot, etc. Some girls do it thinking it lets her crush know she's ""in demand."" In most cases, the guy treats it as a sign of *disinterest,* e.g. ""Damn, she flirts with all those guys but never flirts with me."" Or he might actually be disgusted by it.  ""Jesus, no way would I want a girlfriend who flirts with every guy around her."" The problem is girls are turned on by competition in relationships, while most guys are turned off.  

* Complain about guys trying to physically escalate with you. Some girls do this to plant the idea he should make a move. Reverse psychology. This backfires, because the guy will assume the girl doesn't want *anyone* to make a move on her. He doesn't want to be labeled a ""creep"" like all those other guys, so he does nothing. Then he gets confused later if he hears from her (or through her friends), complaining how he never made a move. Disclaimer: not all girls do this.  

* Criticize any girl he's dating, e.g. ""Nah, she's no good for you"" (""Because I think *I'm* right for you!"").  Worse, be rude to the girl if he introduces her to you, e.g. ""Oh, so *you're* [name]"" (looks her up and down to size up the competition). 

* Open the conversation by insulting him.  house_robot explained this really well in another thread.  

Quote:
&gt; 
&gt; When a girl says, ""Oh you're a player aren't you?"" its similar to when they say shit like, ""Oh you want me to go home with you? You sure you don't have other girls there already?""
&gt; 
&gt; Its the female approach to giving a man a compliment: passive aggressively, and couched as an insult. Shes letting you know you have desirable qualities.
&gt; 
&gt; When girls say this type of nonsense to you, never confirm or deny it.

It took me a while to realize this was a thing. I'd meet a new girl, she'd break my balls, and I'd be turned off. Hear later she liked me. WTF?

The key thing is to make it obvious *you're treating him differently and better* compared to other guys.  Like if he sees you hugging every guy, then he'll second-guess your interest and think you're just being friendly if you hug him.  

I thought this was a good example from a past AskMen thread titled, *""Men who have had women make the first move on them, how did she do it?""*

The user deleted their account, but this story was still up. Might be too aggressive for some, but the girl's confidence was attractive.

&gt; My personal favorite: As I was randomly leaving a bar, a girl I'd never seen before grabbed my hand and said ""You can't leave! you're so cute!"" 

&gt;I told her she was very sweet and very cute herself but that I had to leave and that I had a girlfriend, and she goes ""Noooo! Can I at least give you a hug?"" I said of course and she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek during the hug and said ""Sorry, I had to! Your girlfriend is very lucky!""
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of the girlfriend (still my SO today) she was my good friend a solid year and change before we started dating. One night after some wine she asked why I never was into her, while swearing that she wasn't actually into me.
&gt; 
&gt; The next day when I brought up the conversation to her she said ""yeah well maybe I was lying about not being into you."" I told her that I think she's awesome but that I don't date my friends, and she replied ""We'll see.""
&gt; 
&gt; She spent the next month and a half just being super cute, sweet, thoughtful, and adorable towards me, even after I told her again I wasn't going to change my mind. Eventually, I did.
&gt; 
&gt; I later learned from a mutual friend that she confided that (paraphrasing), ""I know he's not going to change his mind, and I'm okay with that. But I still want to make him happy and be an awesome friend to him, even if it won't make him like me. He deserves it.""

The worst thing that can happen if a girl is too subtle in her flirting: [case study video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtsNbxgPngA). I'd watch it again without sound to see more of her signals she's interested.

Hope this helps. Good luck."

"My high school crush did the first 2 negative tactics literally constantly, I never asked her out because she seemed to have a ton of guys talking to her. Found out years later she liked me too from one of our friends. 

One conversation I had with her was:

""I literally can't handle x, y, z flirting with me all the time, it's just too much, and im way too stressed"" and then five minutes later she asked me if I liked her... I immediately said ""lol just as friends"" because I didn't wanna stress her out. "

"As someone who married a 9 but myself am somewhere around a 5.5 - fucking own it. At the end of the day who's bed is she coming home to? That's right, yours. At the end of the day which one of those bastards did she say she wanted to date? You.

If that doesn't give you all the confidence in the world you are looking at things the wrong way man."
"In my opinion, you should wait it out. 
If she said she wants to go on another date with you, take her at her word for it rather than overreact to a single days interactions. 

Confirm the date and plan it if you really like her. 
That being said, if she goes cold and doesn’t respond, move on and relish that you were right. "

"&gt; Furthermore, I'd like to remind all of you salty little turd nuggets that if you have a problem with the way any moderator of acting, please message the mod mail.

I sent the following message to the mod mail (as you suggested in this post):

&gt; I think you mods need to have a talk with ffreudiannipss

&gt; How on earth can you allow a mod to lock threads because she THINKS they will turn ""into whiny shit about women this and men that,"" and because she THINKS it will be ""a bunch of arguing and no productivity""?

&gt; So now any thread on /r/AskMen that goes against the female agenda will be locked by her for these bullshit reasons?

&gt; No offense, but she doesn't belong here as a mod if she can't leave her gender at the door.

&gt; I would have gladly responded to her comment I linked here instead of messaging you, but she locked THAT thread too. Like a child.

You responded by telling me to ""chill my tits.""

When I asked for a more mature response that actually addressed my concerns, you called my concerns ""retarded,"" said I should ""feel bad,"" and then you promptly muted me.

Here's complete proof of all of this: https://i.imgur.com/Jn2ZTs5.png

----------

&gt; Oh yeah and if any of you salty peanuts decide that you want to go whine in other subs to try and earn sympathy for acting like idiots, just be aware that we know you're doing it and we'll find out.

You are now threatening to basically take action against people for what they do outside of this subreddit, which is STRICTLY AGAINST Reddit's Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities (Effective April 17, 2017). 

I'd link it here, but there apparently is a rule against linking Reddit links in the comments of this subreddit, so feel free to google it yourself and see.

-------------

In short, I think you need to calm down, get off your power trip, and act like a mature moderator instead of an angry child.

I agree personal attacks and/or harassment against anyone is unacceptable, but everything else you said is absolutely absurd and you should really think about what you said.

EDIT: Obligatory thanks for the Reddit Gold, stranger! :)

EDIT 2: Thanks for the second Gold!!!"
"Half of attractiveness is the stuff you can control - hygiene, good fitting clothes, sense of style, good scents, haircut that compliments your head/face, confidence, posture, smiling, etc.

If you really think your face is unattractive and you want to do something about it, is there any small change you can make? Got an ugly mole? Talk to a dermatologist about removing it. Think your face looks weird because it's not symmetrical or something? What about adding an earring or nose ring or something? What if you cut or grow out your hair? Wear a silver chain?

I've seen few people in my life I'd classify as *ugly* - usually it was their scowling expression that make them look unattractive.

If you're being told you're ugly, you might also want to question if you're looking for love in the right places. Sometimes shallow people congregate in certain venues and they have a very gross, high school-like judgment system of people. If they're calling you ugly it's not because you're ugly - it's because they're insecure about something about themselves.

And, to be fair, if you don't exude that animal attractiveness off the bat, it means you're not going to be picking up a lot of sober girls. You'll do better getting to know women a bit first and developing an emotional or intellectual attraction with them first.  Ain't nothing wrong with that either."
"Thanks for sharing that story.

&gt;""I literally can't handle x, y, z flirting with me all the time, it's just too much, and im way too stressed"" and then five minutes later she asked me if I liked her... I immediately said ""lol just as friends"" because I didn't wanna stress her out. 

Perfect, that's exactly the kind of mixed signal that throws guys off."

"Mine was when I was telling a friend about an old coworker that I hadn't seen in probably 10 years and out of the blue I see that coworker at the exact same instant. Now, that doesn't sound that impressive until you realize I worked with that old coworker in Pennsylvania, and saw him in Iraq. 

EDIT: Holy crap this blew up. FYI there was literally (not figuratively) no possible way to randomly see this dude before hand. It all started as a conversation about previous things coworkers did in the car miles away. I was telling the story (which sorry, I wont repeat here its too personally identifiable) and the story finished up as I got to the building my former coworker was in. "

Just wanted to add that it’s important to consider what kind of guy you want.  I know a lot of girls who use some of the negative techniques (like playing hard to get. Making him jealous by flirting, or playing mind games) and then later wonder why their guy is so possessive, or jealous, or manipulative.

There are lots of fish in the sea, and lots of different bait will attract lots of different fish. So be cautious when selecting your bait.

In other words, if you are the type of person who responds well to verbal praise, try to catch a guy with verbal praise. The kid of guy who responds to that probably also provides that."

"In the 8th grade I experienced the great pain of having my friend move away from Ohio to Georgia. It was the first lost in little me's life.

Later, when I graduated I moved from Ohio to Colorado. 

I was working as a waitress and had a good conversation with this random guy working on his computer at one of my tables. He was cute and could hold conversation so I started flirting with him. 

During our conversation we started talking about our oldest friends and my long lost friend who left me for Georgia in the 8th grade came up. He mentioned he had graduated from Georgia... I said her name... he knew her!

Turned out she had been his best friend too! They went to high school together in Georgia after she left Ohio, and now, somehow, we were meeting in Colorado.

Not only did this guy and I happen to meet in a state totally unrelated to my friend, but he came in on my shift, my restaurant and SOMEHOW the one most random thing we had in common thousands of miles away came up in short conversation!

I got back in touch with my friend via fb and confirmed that they were friends. It was the strangest thing. Never went on that date, though."

"""Bitches want the dick.""  

You may think I'm just making a low-effort comment in failed attempt at humour, but in the context of that conversation, there was profound wisdom in that sentence and it took me years to fully understand it.  

The essence of it is that you shouldn't feel and thus subconsciously act like a snake oil salesman trying to trick a girl into giving you something she should not be giving you if she knew what's in her best interest, because if she isn't a waste of your time, she wants roughly the same thing to happen as you do and all she needs is an excuse, not persuading. There are multiple implications of that notion, some of which you're probably familiar with like ""always assume the sale"" and ""you can't talk your way into a girl's pants"", but I found it most useful simply as a reassuring mantra that it's not just on me to make things happen and I shouldn't sweat it too much, because the bitch wants the dick.

"A little off topic, but an illustrative real life example.  In 2003 I was stuck in an elevator between floors with the cute girl who worked in the office down the hall.

We made nervous conversation for a few minutes and she seemed to be really smiling a lot and asking questions about my job, which seemed weird when you’re stuck in an elevator. Maybe five minutes passed and I’m working up my courage to ask her out, when the car moves and the doors open to a lobby full of security and firefighters. I promptly lost my nerve and we went our separate ways. About 20 minutes later she walks into my office and takes a seat in the client chair. I’m a lawyer so I figure she’s fishing for free legal advice. “So how can I help you?” I ask in my most professional tone. “Well” she said, “I was wondering if you’d like to join me for a drink after work?”  I said yes, and we’ve been married 11 years.

"It's pretty awesome, though there can be some initial awkwardness if you're not used to a woman being so up front with you. First one night stand I ever had was with a girl I was kinda friends with. 

I was in college and she was an RN in town. I'd always run into her whenever I was out at bars or parties, which was pretty often because it's a very small but very active college town. 

One night, she calls me and invites me to a pool hall/bar type place - I get there and she immediately runs up and gives me a huge, full-body hug, legs wrapped around me and everything. We'd kinda sorta flirted with each other before when we've hung out, but that night she was happier than she's ever been to see me. I'm sure the few drinks she'd already had encouraged that.

We danced, drank, danced, drank more - at one point, we were sitting down and there was a lull in conversation, at which point she leaned in really closely. I thought she was trying to tell me something, so I turned my ear towards her and she goes, ""Is something wrong?"" 

Having no experience with this sort of thing, I immediately realize that she probably wanted me to kiss her. As they announced last call, she asked me, ""Can you give me a ride home? I want to fuck you.""

Probably the most ideal one night stand situation ever."
"I did this with my first girlfriend and it didn't last. I would advise against it as it's not a nice thing to do to someone. We all deserve someone who genuinely likes us and wants to be with us, so I think you should leave this woman alone and find a woman that you do like. "

What a sucker. Now she has a lifetime of free legal advice! I hope you got a retainer.
"We dated for 4 months. She went in to renew her depo shot, and was told ""guess what!"" By the staff.

So yeah, we got married. We've got an autistic first grader and a preteen step-daughter. She quit her job when she got pregnant, and hasn't gone back since. 

I have no money. I have practically no physical possessions except a base model Jeep Patriot, a rusted out propane grill, a Walmart toolbox full of tools, my work uniforms, a bunch of clothes I don't like because she basically picked them out for me, a couple fishing-rods I haven't used in years, and a dog. She hates my dog. She's been trying to make me get rid of my dog for five years now because the neighbors dog barks at our dog, and she's tired of having to let him outside every morning. He's a small dog. Part dachshund part chihauhau. He loves everyone, even her.

 I spend more time at work then home because I'm happy at work.  We don't argue, but that's mostly because I don't care about anything enough to raise my voice, much less get out of my chair.

Our 2 relatively new cars are both worthless because they've both been wrecked (by her) and repaired. We have 12K in credit card debt, and an empty house with nothing to show for it. Most people I know who are stupid with money have a bunch of crap they don't need. How the hell did we rack up 12K in debt and still only have an old tv, a cheap couch, and a closet full of Walmart clothes?  Not even a decent vacation to explain it. 12K worth of Walmart flip flops and Dunkin donuts coffee over 7 years? Is that what happened?  

The 12K in credit card debt doesn't phase her though . She's got 25K in defaulted student loans that she didn't tell me about until after we got married, and the collectors started calling me trying to find her. She never made a payment. Not one. She refuses to pay because her school lost its credentials, and her education is worthless, and her associates degree sucks, and she can't get a job, and her life is so unfair. 

But in the plus side;  my children love me, I'm gainfully employed, and I'm reasonably healthy. It could be worse."

I don’t get what his problem is.

 I grabbed her and got her head down with my arm under her and smacked her back hard a few times, nothing happened. OK, rotate and smack her front, then rotate and smack her back again. 

 Then on one smack this piece of fucking food flies out of her mouth and my daughter starts crying in big gasping cries. Best damn sound I ever heard in my life.

"Guys the story isn't really that crazy. So last year I flew back home to Mexico to celebrate my maternal grandmother's birthday. I stayed there for 10 days and during my time there, I was invited to a number of house parties.

At one particular house party, I drank more than my fair share of Modelo and Gran Centenario tequila, and got a little flirty with some girls. Now I was pretty wasted so all I really remember was that I got a blowjob from one of that group of girls. 

Outside of a mouth and my hands, my dick had *NOT* found outside inside anywhere the rest of my vacation. This I can guarantee you.

So fast forward to this past Wednesday evening, and my mother calls to inform me that a girl I had never met in my life with a 5 month old infant and her father had confronted my paternal granny, demanding that she and the entirety of our family recognize the baby as mine (and therefore heir to our family lands when I croak). The girl claims to have been at the party where I got my BJ (note: was was *NOT* one of the group of girls I had flirted with) She claims I took her virginity and promised to marry her when I had enough money.

The girl's father called me and all the men in my family spineless bastards to my granny's face and she understandably become very upset because stuff like this ruins a family's reputation. She called my folks demanding I come home and explain myself to the family and to my brand spanking new son. So my mom asks if I can go home and clean up this giant mess.

"I noticed that the venue itself can make a pretty big difference in how good/bad your experience will be if you go alone. College bars tend to be the worst -- everyone is in their groups/cliques, and it is often seen as ""weird"" to socialize with outsiders. In general, places where people go to look cool and show off their status are terrible to go to solo. However, bars that are overall more low key or more frequented by tourists are a lot better. Seems like people in these places are a lot more open to meeting new people, and aren't just looking to stick with the group they came with. 

Generally though, if you talk to people and don't come across as totally socially awkward/weird people will at least be polite and chat with you for a bit. So rest assured that MOST people will be nice and not treat you badly. Whether they'll actually go beyond the pleasantries and accept you in their groups is a different story though. "

"Incoming heavily opinionated and anecdotal wall of text, hope I formatted it well enough for you!

I never committed to anyone but myself until my current partner who is now my wife.  So I'm closer to the camp of ""was afraid of

First off I am a really cynical person and trusted no-one. The fact I trusted her was already a big sign that the relationship was different than the others I had before, so I noted that. I am a cold, selfish, apathetic jerk on the inside a lot of the time. Never ever felt that way with my partner. She even made me a little less mean over time funnily enough. When we met, she didn't have much, I didn't have much and was grinding (we still are honestly, the grind never stops though.) We didn't even have a clear picture of where we were going in life, but do you ever? Either way, it didn't really make a difference to me. 

Regardless of what the tides would bring, I knew who I wanted in the boat with me. Weird to say, but from pretty much the beginning we just knew. Nothing else mattered more than this to me. I knew what we had was RARE to find, and should never be let go of.

From the get go I was looking for a serious relationship, I was done with meaningless shit at the time I met her, and she knew that coming into the relationship and wanted the same. 

There were a lot of moments that I doubted maybe her decisions or outlooks on things, yeah, but I never ever ever doubted the relationship, our feelings for each other, or our desire to see each other every day. Most of the time before my current partner I'd want alone time or something really often since I'm pretty introverted, but I seldom if ever wanted alone time from my current spouse. For me that was a sign that I should take the relationship really seriously and commit to it 100% because I felt this was a person that  I knew I would have a happy life having her in, and I knew she felt the same. (good communication)

There is not really a right time for commitment at least from what I felt and experienced, only a right couple. IMO commitment only works with two people on board and willing+wanting to be deeply involved with each other. If one person wants to be committed and the other doesn't for whatever reason, I would imagine a lot of the time the relationship would be unstable or someone would get hurt, but I might be wrong. 



*(The following list has a lot of me adding on that my spouse feels the same because I am emphasizing the importance that the relationship was not one sided. Commitment at least to us was a partnership more than anything. Ride together die together)*

*((also, we are well beyond the whole fear of cheating or possibility of cheating thing. Cheating in a happy relationship is stupid. Cheating in a relationship just because things get hard is stupid. Some people are afraid of commitment because they think the other person will cheat. That's never a good train of thought and leads nowhere good in terms of relationship in my view.))*

**What really made a difference in my current relationship is and made me know to commit is :**

* A) COMMUNICATION. This was important for me like a really big deal. So I tend to never say how I feel to anyone ever. If someone upset me I'd just ignore them and they'd never know something was wrong until say maybe half a year goes by and they haven't heard from me or seen me. (Even some of my family members are in this boat). I never wanted to push away my spouse. I was always willing to open up 100% and explain my position, want to hear hers, and try to move past it. Even if we disagreed, we would work together to resolve it such that both of us are happy and we're both better off. When me and my spouse argue it's not really fire and brimstone shots fired anymore and hasn't been for years, it's more of a serious discussion where we are 100% forward and looking for a solution. Arguments that go nowhere and neither person is really trying to reach a compromise or even at least see the other persons side are usually really destructive and we don't argue like that. For example some arguments can stem from something else going on that you don't know about yet, but since we talk things through that doesn't happen anymore. If something else was upsetting her she'd explain for example she wasn't mad about what I originally thought but was stressed out about something else going on. If we had argued about the original point instead of communicating with each other openly and effectively, there would have been no resolution because obviously I wouldn't have known the root cause for her tension before the argument even started. The fact I even cared enough to argue was a good sign for me. The fact most arguments had positive outcomes for both of us was an even better one.

* B) COMPATIBILITY!!! have a good understanding of each other.  I usually am a pretty dense person when it comes to feelings and stuff, and I can be really crass and blunt. However even through that I take my partner in consideration with what I do and say. She also does the same for me, and it really helps with the stresses of life and also allows us to worry about bigger things instead of getting displeased at petty stuff. (We still disagree on some stuff from time to time like toothpaste being uncapped and stuff but it's really minor, not like she's doing stuff that makes me unhappy regardless of how I feel). having good chemistry not only for convenience in the sense of making life easier, but pleasure is really important to us. 

* C) I always want to do things to make her happy. I will sometimes drop into her job to surprise her with lunch, get her gifts even if they're small without any occasion such as an anniversary or holiday, and she does the same for me. She even hand draws anniversary and birthday cards and they're amazing. Furthermore, she's even reached out to some of my favorite music artists and gotten signed albums, or gotten me signed art from my favorite game devs. Overall this was a big deal for me because I'm a pretty selfish asshole but never selfish when it comes to my spouse. (I felt this way before we got married though.)

* D) NO DOUBT! I never thought there could be something better with someone else. Usually when in relationships beforehand I would always be in the lookout for something better if I was unhappy for even the smallest thing.  I never ever ever wanted that with my current partner, I always feel that either myself or she could grow into a bigger and better person than anyone could possibly compare to. 

* E) encouraged growth. I'm happy to do things with or support things that help her grow as a person or us grow as a couple, and she is the same. This was pretty important to me because I was always afraid that commitment would mean no longer growing and shackling myself down with someone, but I was wrong.(glad I was wrong too)

* F) TRUST. For us, trust is more valuable than any amount of money in the world. The fact we can trust each other with anything, and know we are 100% down for each other ride or die was a huge game changer. I know she values my trust and would never do anything to mess it up, and I would also never do anything to mess it up. Financial trust was a huge step in the relationship. If you can't trust the other person with your money, and they don't trust you with theirs, I can't imagine that being a good time. I was down to just share one wallet and one everything with her. Emotional trust was also important: I know she would never deliberately harm me and I'd never deliberately harm her. She and I even go the extra mile to avoid anything that could hurt the other person. 

* G) Fun! I was always afraid commitment meant boring seriousness (I had a really weird outlook on things before). But realizing that being with this person made anything infinitely more fun, even boring shit becomes enjoyable, was a really big deal for me. 

* H) Value. I valued this relationship more than anything I had, really anything. She feels the same. When you value something, least in my opinion, you cherish it. You'd never do anything to break it. When you know you will be cherished and you cherish the other person, and take care of each other. I never EVER EVER doubt the relationship. Bonds stronger than diamonds.

* J) Willingness to make it work!!! Both people have to be willing to at least put effort to make things work for each other. It was worth it for us, but not everything can be solved by just letting nature or random chance take care of it. A healthy well functioning committed relationship took some effort from BOTH sides. Not all diamonds come out of the earth beautifully carved. 

* I) Respect. I am respected and respect her. Not much I can say here but I've seen disrespectful partners in couples and it seems weird to me. Why even be with someone who doesn't respect you? 

* K) Support. She is a huge pillar of emotional support for me, like that Mulan song a girl
worth fighting for or however it went. I feel like I can do anything if she's got my back. she feels the same. This was a big deal either when I lost my job or she lost her job. It's like having a cushion to always fall back on when life starts stampeding you like it tends to do. Better than any hot meal, although sometimes includes hot meals. 

* L) Love. This is a big deal, and weird to even say here it should be a given, but the relationship has gotta have love in my opinion. I understand I can't see her every minute of every day, but man do I want to, constantly, for years. Same with her. We constantly have each other in mind. 



It has lasted so far, if it does come to an end [god forbid] it wouldn't actually be us separating, but probably death or something of the like. Yeah you can't predict the future, but I know for sure we're gonna be stuck together.

"When I busted my ex cheating (again), and broke up with her, I saw this desperation in her eyes, and they darted around the room as she thought for a solution.

"This is my favorite comment of the thread. Instead of giving the usual 'develop your personality' advice you also suggested actionable physical stuff.  

Hi OP - listen to this comment. ^^^ 

Also - to add some things from experience:  
You gotta work on your fitness, develop hobbies, pay attention to your clothes and grooming. Eventually the anger you're feeling now (very common) will change to acceptance, which also translates to confidence. You gotta hustle more in the dating world - you have to 'grow' on somebody like an acquired taste. Don't compare yourself to good looking guys and stay off of Tinder."
"I finally made my girl orgasm, after about a year of trying "
"I've gone out with a couple of guys who people saw as below my level of physical attractiveness. One handled it well, the other didn't.

The latter got jealous and clung to me like a bad smell whenever we went out. I loved him and everything, but it got to the stage where he hated me going out alone, so I ended up staying in most of the time just to keep me happy. Everything else in that relationship was good, but nothing kills love like feeling trapped by it.

The other guy just owned it (as another commenter said), and I think that's the only good way to handle it. At the end of the day, if you don't trust the girl you're going out with, you shouldn't be dating them. And if you do trust them, then you've just got to let them handle themselves. I know that's not easy advice to follow if you're naturally protective, but in my opinion it's the only way to deal with it."

Do *you* want to make new friends? Or are you content with where you’re at? Ask yourself that. 
"Yeah, but I'm 12 , and well... She doesn't exactly know we are dating..."
"Listen man, I had a similar experience. All these others don't know shit about how hard it is to do anything about it.

I don't have any answers, for me it was to spend a considerable amount of time reinforcing her other friendships until I felt like she had a support circle I could rely on. Then I broke contact, told those friends what was up immediately and made sure they handled it.

She's better off now, but it took a while.

Same night time call situation for me, what helped it was making evening/night plans of my own with friends or family that meant she couldn't always rely on me. Eventually it got better.

EDIT: One of the only things I'd tell my past self if I could would be to talk to someone, anyone, and honestly, about what was happening. I never did that and it's one of the few things I'd want to change that I know would have actually helped. You've already done that here so good :)

EDIT EDIT: Whoops looks like I replied to the wrong comment, sorry /u/Alecaz didn't mean to single you out!"
"Dude... None of this other advice matters. You obviously need to break up with this girl. She has way too many issues and is ""extremely manipulative and borderline mentally abusive"" by your own words. Run man!"
"Delete everything. She doesn’t want to hear from you and the only reason your doing this is because you are at a loose end.

Also and I speak from experience if you do contact her and she doesn’t respond it will make you feel worse.

Delete and move to pastures new."
I'm the most humble person I know.
I just got into college as a jazz major and I’m first chair in over half the bands I’m in and better than most of the freshman in my class. 
"Anything where you're supposed to act wildly different to how you actually are as a person. Even if it works, the person you're dating is attracted to a facade, not the real you. Why would you want that?"
Now we're thinking outside the box 
"Even though you don’t sexually attract me in the slightest, I’ll still go out with you - because (by my own admission) you’re kind, considerate and gentle and that’s nice to experience after my past abusive relationships.

But I’ll never really be into the sex, I’ll just lay there and take it. When you ask me if I’m enjoying, I’ll force a smile and say yes. After 2 months you’ll directly confront me to ask what’s wrong, and I’ll admit that you’re too short/ugly but I’m still with you because “physical attraction isn’t that important to me anymore, it’s about personality”.

At this point I’ll start secretly texting my ex boyfriend again, yes the one who gave me a black eye and cheated on me. After a few months I’ll dump you and go back to him. For added emphasis, I’ll dump you the night before your medical school board exam. My parting words to you will be “You have such a wonderful personality but you need a girl who can truly look past your physical flaws. I’m sorry I couldn’t be that girl.”

"&gt; You're the one attacking people simply because they're women.

Wrong. I attacked what she DID (not who she IS) based upon her grossly-anti-men ""reasons"" for why she locked the discussion. She used gross generalizations and acted like men are children who need to be ""corrected"" and/or stopped from acting like ""they always do.""

When I said ""check her gender at the door,"" I refer to her need to remember this is fucking /r/AskMen. It's a gender-specific subreddit, and she's not the gender in question. It's not personal.

She shouldn't come here and try and ""correct"" the people here by arbitrarily locking threads that don't agree with the typical female-agenda (i.e. the current disgrace that is the Family Law system).

Again, I only attacked her actions based on what I saw.

---------

EDIT: Furthermore, you guys are now doing something I've never even seen ANY Reddit moderators do: i.e. lock threads before ANY rule-breaking occurs, simply because you ""THINK"" it will happen based upon ""past experiences.""

That's some SERIOUSLY ridiculous over-censorship, and, if anything THAT is attacking a gender itself: i.e. men, and using gender stereotyping to boot."

So you're saying I can harass women with dick picks as long as I'm bragging about my bad love life. Got it! Back to the grind!"
"Definitely agree.  It can take a lot of guys (and girls) a surprisingly long time to realize that it's normal for girls to like and want sex.

Similarly, most guys want to feel loved and cared for and heard and all of those ""girly"" things that a lot of people assume only women want in relationship.

In general, men and women are pretty similar and want pretty similar things."

If that's true call me a no nipple having bitch. 
"Oh god, exactly that for me. A girl I was interested god asked out three times over the course of a few weeks by several of her male friends. She lamented to me that she was so tired of her male friends suddenly revealing to her that they wanted to date her, and wished she could just find a good boyfriend.

Later I'm told that was supposed to be a huge hint to me to ask her out.

?!?!?!

All I could say was like... ""Was I also not one of your male friends who would be revealing his feelings?"" and she was legitimately confused that I didn't pick up on it. It was infuriating."
"Part of being sorry is accepting the consequences of whatever you're sorry for.

Accepting an apology isnt synomynous to offering forgiveness either."
"I've been told by a coworker that three of the women that work at my company were making comments about how cute I was during a company event while I was out of earshot.

Most of them are older/married and in positions above me and they know I'm engaged, so its not like they are going to start hitting on me. But its still a confidence boost when you hear other people think you are attractive.

It always seems to be the cougars that I get the most compliments from."

"Maybe she had a bad day. Maybe one of her friends gave her terrible advice on how to get you more interested. Maybe she's just nervous. Or maybe she changed her mind. It could be any of these or a hundred more.

The point is you're in your head and overthinking things. I did this a lot in high school and it was a very unsuccessful strategy. Just go with the flow.

Give it a couple days and if you feel like she's still acting disengaged, calmly and politely say, ""Hey, I need to ask you something. Sorry to put you on the spot, but do you still want to go on a second date? I mean, I'd still like to, but if you're not feeling it, I totally understand. I just feel like you've been distant with me suddenly and just wanted to know where you're at.""

This will actually make you seem more mature which high school girls like. So even if she's not into you, she may talk about it with her friends and before you know it, the girls think you're more mature than you really are. But this probably won't happen and I'm imagining things. See what happens when you overthink? You say crazy shit and people think you're weird.

Alternatively, say and do nothing and continue on with the date as normal. Maybe she cancels or you have a lame date. Or maybe you have a good date! Who knows?!

Get outta your head, kid. Go with the flow."
"Yeah weird


Also weird how some people like having a lot of friends while others don't mind solitude in heavier doses

"""I had a baby just to see if I could do it. I could. Now I'm realizing motherhood isn't all that cracked up, I feel guilty and think I'm a bad mother. I only see my daughter twice a week, I'd much rather work at the bar, party and sleep in until I have to go to work. Even though my daughter lives a few miles away, sleeping in just sounds so much better then spending a few hours with my daughter before I go to work. I will spend at least two hours to get myself ready, while my daughter wears clothes from yesterday and could use a bath. I refuse to learn how to cook, so I'll spend $400 a week on ready made meals while my daughter eats scoops of peanut butter, buttered toast, sliced apples and Lara Bars. I will constantly say how much I miss my daughter, but I won't change any of my ways to see her more.

I'd much rather lie to you, than tell you the truth. I will make up stories and incidents, just so I wont have to tell you the truth. I will get so drunk at work you'll have to come pick me up or I will stay out on the town. I will blow you off because I accidentally got drunk at work. Again. I can't afford to take time off when it comes to you, but I will take off half a week to go to the west coast with my coworker and her sugar daddy.

"I don't mind armhair/leghair/pubic hair at all. Most, if not all, women get facial hair, so that usual light fuzz also doesn't bother me. But just growing a near mustache is unsightly and I don't say this as a guy free of faults. Sometimes my nose hair grows out and that's disgusting to women and men, so I keep that trimmed. I get a little hair between my eyebrows and I shave that off. Leaving unsightly bodyhair on you, guy or girl, tells me you don't care how you look to others when, like it or not, looks matter to varying degrees in society."
"If dick pics were sent to the user in question then that's inexcusable - as are any PMs or direct abuse to anyone online.

That aside, I feel that this needs to be said. 

If a mod believes that they have the foresight to close a potentially incendiary thread down before it takes off that's one thing. However, in this particular case the OP may well have come in looking to have his 'opinions validated', and he may well have framed his post in a way which suggested that he was looking for a certain kind of response, but the top comment at the time was a level-headed answer from a lawyer with expertise on the topic. And the other upvoted comments were, by and large, surprisingly reasonable.

And yet the thread was closed with a simple 'nah'.

I'm sure that the mod didn't have an agenda, and was acting from a good place, but if you feel the need to stop a discussion on the grounds that it usually turns out to be contentious, you've got to give a decent explanation as to why it's been closed otherwise you're just stirring the pot. 

And as a side note, the eventual reason given for the thread being closed *'You get a bunch of arguing and no productivity...'* ironically serves as a strong argument for why the thread should have been kept open (and moderated), because in this case everything pointed to it being an exception. The first people in threads tend to set the tone for what follows. So even though OP did appear to have coated his post in sass, there was a good opportunity there to have one thread amongst the *'plethora... about the exact same thing that turn into a whiny shit show'* for people to read in the future.

I like this subreddit. I think, for the most part, it's pretty level headed. It's maybe become a little more men's rights lately but it's mostly well run and the mods have a good back and forth with everyone else. But you need to offer sufficient explanations for thread closures or all that good will is going to go to shit.

Fast food is not cheap. When you drop 5-10bucks on a meal, you're not only making yourself fat and sick, you're also pissing away money.

"There's no doubt that physical attractiveness can be a HUGE advantage, but it's definitely not the salient characteristic of a person- there's always more to someone. Being ugly or unattractive just affects someone's first impression of you, but your personality, mannerisms, demeanor all affect how people continue to see you. This is why unattractive men can someone's pull off dating really hot girls and even hot guys can be total creeps. 

You gotta deal with the hand youre given man. Yeah we didn't all win the genetic lottery (I sure didn't), but it can't define you. There's a lot more to us than bone structure, height and physique. Find other selling points for yourself and showcase that. People can be dicks to ugly people for no good reason other than they are ugly.

"Your gf sounds like my soon-to-be-ex-wife. She's extremely needy and if I give her an inch, she'll take a mile. Once-in-a-while things that I do to be sweet/nice quickly become expected everyday things. And she pouts and guilt trips if I resist. And I cave just so I don't have to deal with hours of crying and trying to comfort her. People like this are experts at eroding your boundaries without you realizing it. Sounds like your gf is definitely doing that.

My wife would also play the suicide card every time I tried to leave. My therapist taught me that it's not my fucking job to keep her from killing herself. If she makes an attempt, call 911 and let the professionals deal with it. If she makes an attempt or is successful, she decided to do that. It was her choice she made and it's not your fault. Also, it is very unlikely she will actually do that. Manipulators threaten, but rarely act out on it. The only time someone is really a suicide threat is if they make a plan and they usually don't threaten it, they just do it. My wife still hasn't killed herself.

Your girl isn't borderline mentally abusive, she *is* mentally abusive. You're lying to yourself if you think otherwise. Threatening suicide to hold your partner hostage in the relationship is abuse. You can't save this girl. You don't have the skills or training to do so. All she's doing is dragging you down and wasting years if your life.

What's the end game here? Marriage? You know you don't want to marry her. Kids? You know you don't want kids with her. You don't even want to be with her. The only thing left is for her to keep dragging you along until she gets tired of you and drops you. That's what I did. And she never dropped me. I tried so hard to get her to. It just doesn't work. I had to end it myself.

And you know what your girl is going to do? She's going to notice you slip away and she's going to make sure she ""accidentally"" gets pregnant to keep you around. Even if you try to curb the Skype bullshit, there's still a high chance of her doing that. She's gonna think, ""He's going to leave me. If I get pregnant, he'll stay.""

I want to save you from my life. I wanted to kill myself so bad because of my wife. She destroyed who I was in just a couple years. She fucking broke me. Your girl is doing the same. I want to save you. No one deserves that shit. Just end it with her now because it'll only be harder later.

Just send her a text that it's over. No phone call, no explanation, no nothing. Because if you give her any opening, she's going to start manipulating because that's what works on you and she knows it. Block her on all social media, change your locks if you have to, call the police if she comes to your house and refuses to leave, block her phone number and email. Send her a text simply saying you're breaking up with her and not to contact you again. Then go completely no contact."
These routines are sooo boring.  Holy shit how do you people live?  My only set time slot (and even this one is a moving target) is about 8-10 working hours per day.  Outside of that is utter mayhem and chaos.

"My life as a single, child free 28-year-old:


**Weekdays**


6:45am: Wake up


7:30am: Leave for work


8:10-1:30pm: Work


1:30pm-3pm: Workout (I work for a pretty cool company that actually strongly encourages it's employees to workout during the day at the gym on site)


3pm-5pm: Work some more


5:30/5:40: Get home; from here my weekly schedule is as follows


*Mondays:* Used to be volleyball night but that ended two weeks ago, currently looking for something to fill that void


*Tuesdays:* A group of my friends have standing plans to get together to try a new happy hour/restaurant in the city/have dinner at one of our apartments.


*Wednesdays:* Trivia night at a local bar


*Thursdays:* Night classes, currently enrolled in an urban farming course at the local university to up my gardening game for next season


Intermixed in here is ""life stuff"" like laundry, cooking food, etc.  I don't really have a set day to do any of these but fit them in when I can.  I might watch a little TV, read, or other random things as well but I try to be in bed by 11/11:30.


**Weekends**


*Fridays:* I generally leave work around 2 and will meet up with people for happy hour or get ready to go out that night.


*Saturdays:* Depending how much I drank the night before, might workout in the morning but will generally have something planned for the day (I get mad at myself if I sit on the couch for longer than 2 hours not doing anything), go out again with friends on Saturday


*Sundays:* Pretty lazy mornings but again, I try to have something planned (on Thursdays I sit down and actually write out what I want to do during the coming weekend so I make good use of that time).  Sunday night my roommate and I invite an acquaintance over for dinner.  I say ""acquaintance"" because the point of it is to get to know the interesting people in our lives a little better (like the new guy at work who just moved here from overseas and seems like a cool dude) or someone from one of our social circles who the other doesn't know.  As you can gather, I have a pretty active social life and this doesn't just happen; it's doing stuff like this which is how I've developed a pretty extensive group of friends."
I think it really depends on the person you're directing it at.  'Most' people will get the point and move along.  You don't want to end up with an 'enemy' at work.
"Umm, just say 'no thanks'. Just dont go into rant about how it is stupid and you want to be paid overtime, and no ones going to be mad at you."
Because it'd be creepy to say shit like that to someone I'm not even dating. 
I made some guy really mad in this thread.
"If that shit worked, it'd be part of the scientific literature, the price would be exorbitant, and the insurance industry would get in on that."

"Just be honest, but not so brutal. I'd suggest ""I'm not sure that after what happened a few months ago, I'm completely comfortable with things being the way they were"". Not as brutal as saying he's a terrible person, but definitely will take care of the sitch."
"*She's a lol responder, Jerry*"
"Want me to toss you a bigger shovel? I get what you're getting at here, and yes OP does have his own inherent bias. In that though is what you've failed to address. His criticism to you, and the underlying fact that every human being ever has some type of bias; nobody is without it. Not even the mods, no matter how highly you think of your team or yourself.

At the end of the day, this user is most importantly criticizing you and the mod teams ability to actually moderate, and rightfully so. Focus on this, not on his ""Female agenda"" bit, because as true or untrue as it is; you're entirely avoiding the core issue and the reason why people are upset; which really just makes people question whether or not you're fit to moderate a subreddit. You seem more intent on arguing with someone based on one specific point you can latch onto rather than stepping back and being a leader.

Here's the thing, I don't give a damn she's a woman. I think a woman mod is a GOOD idea. I however don't think she may be the right choice. Why? Because OP is right, you're not gatekeepers. You're moderators. Your responsibility to this subreddit is to moderate threads, not axe them based on your own beliefs, contrary to what you said above. In this case the belief was that the thread would go south. An apology should be issued, as well as how things are going to change in the future. Bridge the gap between the user and moderator which is painfully obvious right now. 

Could the thread have turned into a giant shit-storm? Yes, absolutely. Many others have when you weren't around either. Here's the thing though. A moderator moderates. A moderator doesn't shut a speaker down when they begin treading into controversial territory. They monitor it closely and if the entire panel begins to devolve into a game of pointed fingers, they throw down the hammer and move on. 

&gt; Our lady mods (and our male ones too for the most part) are far more qualified than you to be in charge of this sub because they are capable of putting aside their beliefs to make an impartial decision. They don't presuppose beliefs and make a decision that is best for the sub. 

This is entirely 100% unbelievable. Human beings as people are biased, value driven beings. We're not robots that are capable of seeing in binary values. We're not omnipotent Gods with the ability to drop everything and see everyone in equal light, as everyone; including yourself have demonstrated in this thread. 

You, like any of us are an entirely normal human being that hopefully lives a fully functioning normal life. Don't place yourself or the mod team on a pedestal because you'll find very quickly that pedestal is only as stable as your convictions make it. Your attitude, and the attitude of some of the other mod team and approach to other people make it painfully obvious you do consider yourself ""Above"" others, which is already a MASSIVE bias and shows that you're not capable of putting certain things aside as you say, this is my primary concern. It means that you'll never be wrong, and that nothing will change as a result of this little fiasco. 

TL;DR:

Focus on his criticisms to the mod team and their ability to moderate. Don't focus on his biases, we all have them; including yourself. Don't engage in petty arguments over semantics and gender; that's just proving his point entirely. Focus on bettering the mod team, taking the advice and opinions of the many users in this sub to further that bettering.

I lead teams in a professional setting and have to deal with everything from corporate management to blue collar industrial tradespeople. Clashes happen all the time in my workplace as a result of differing opinions and personalities. I have to be able to bridge that gap and do a damn good job of it. This is really not any different.

"This one (insane) woman I work with poked a hole in the condom or pretended she was on the pill (not sure) years ago. Her daughter is now 15 and equally as unstable. The dad committed suicide a year or so after her birth. I feel awful for her daughter. She has so many emotional problems. 

Edit: just wanted to add that the lady is such a freakin lunatic. Totally batty. "
"Warning, long post, but I was asking this same question a few months ago and I'm so excited to talk about what I've found out   I'm also on mobile so this might ramble a bit.  

Venue is so important. I recently moved to a (not) college town and came here with no real friends, so I had to do everything alone!   At first it was unnerving and I probably looked somewhat awkward. Part of that was nerves and part was finding the right scene.

The campus has a lot of bars and locations directly next to it, they are the worst if you are by yourself and looking to strike up conversations.  The girls tried too hard with the way that they dressed, a fair amount of the guys have no game, so I'd leave wishing I'd stayed in.  The folks that looked comfortable weren't there to meet new people, just be with their friends.  Oh right and I might only be 26, but if you hand me a gin and tonic in a plastic cup at an actual bar, then I'm never coming back.

I started to feel at home once I found a little more up scale bar where the average age was a couple years above my own.  I've never been a bar fly, but I go there most weekends just because I can't wait to find out what cool people I'll meet.  I'd say 75% of the time I find myself with another group hopping to another bar. 25% of the time I just stay there all night.  I do talk to a quite a few women, but I really never leave my seat. I just make a promise to myself to, A: sit on the happening side of the bar, B: talk to EVERYONE next to me.

Guy on the right on a date? ""Hey man, you two come here often?!"" ""Uhhh, yeah.""(cold vibe because he's focused on his date and not some other dude) ""cool man! (look at his date) nice catch!"" (Fyi, I'm not gay and I don't give off that vibe, I just wanted to show that you need to enjoy yourself by being a bit of a dork at times)

Cute lady on the left ordering drinks, ""hey, do you recommend the pizza here? Or is it only good after I've had too many?"". Sometimes I get a really cold shoulder - maybe she doesn't find me hot, maybe she has a boyfriend, maybe she doesn't like meeting people at bars, no matter.   I'm only hunting for a good conversation and some fun people to share the night with, if something more happens, cool, but it isn't how I measure success.

You have to change your framing of success. It's easier to look at a night out alone and think, my goal is to talk to some people, have some laughs, be off my couch and have a drink.  Then it is to say, oh I need to get numbers or I don't want to sleep in my own bed tonight.  I'm not saying you can't still want that too. Of course I'd be completely excited to meet a great lady! But that isn't the end game.  

I really do stand by taking a seat at the bar and always talking to whoever comes up next to you.  Guy, girl, dog, Goth, etc.  If you are too busy talking to someone then you don't look like you're staring at anyone.  And maybe it's in my head, but I fucking swear, when I'm laughing with a group and then they peel off to another group while I'm sitting there, 9/10 times a lady will come order drinks right next to me and look receptive to talking.  It's like people see someone having a good time and want to be a part of that, but don't want to approach a group, but here you are by yourself. You're approachable!

2 last thoughts.  1, the first person who says, ""oh well step 1/step 2 for this guy"".  If you truly believe that, you already failed. Your mindset is so wrong that you WILL probably seem like a creep. You might not look like one, but you will probably sound like one. Because believing that you can't have a great night out because you are ugly is, itself, a very ugly mindset.

2, you will probably look like a creep. Hell, some women will probably talk about you as ""ugh that guy hitting on everything that moves!"". From her perspective, no matter how sckewed, she'll believe she's read you right. And that's fine, she isn't going to make your night any more fun with an attitude like that. It's not a big deal.  Do literally anything in life, someone will be cynical about it. Your goal is to find the people who aren't.  Being in a new city, bringing that up is the most humanizing topic for people.  The one's who were also new get it and don't want you to feel lonely like they did.  My point is, if someone seems cold, whatever, there's a dozen more someone's who won't be. 

Edit, I'm a little let down that most of the discussion below is surrounding my comment on cup material.  I really do hope other people, who struggle with getting out to bars alone like I was, can benefit from what's been said here. I have been thinking about doing a longer post to cover what I've discovered, if only for my own mental process."

"Crazy woman in a retail store parking lot called 911 because she saw a woman, ""run over her child and leave him for dead! OMG!!!!"" My mother had partially rolled over my foot (16 at the time) by accident.

Then the dickhead cops decided to ram into the back of our car **in our own driveway** right after we got home and tasered my mother. After everything was settled, they tried to tell us that we were liable for the damage to their vehicle (sustained by rear-ending our car IN OUR OWN FUCKING DRIVEWAY) and threatened us with CPS checks because my mother was ""irresponsible.""

Since that moment, I've harbored severe mistrust and, dare I say, fear of the police. I treat them with respect so I don't get shot, but I would gladly tell them to fuck off if given the chance.

Oh, and later on, I was actually arrested for trying to pick the lock to get into my own house. The cop still took me in despite the fact that I had my ID on me which proved that I lived there."
"Assuming it's someone you care about, just appreciate how nice this moment is. She trusts you enough to fall asleep in your arms. Those are the moments that in the future you may look back on and remember fondly."

"Agreed. She isn't in the wrong for sleeping with other people, and you're not wrong for feeling hurt by it. It's her body, and it's your feelings.

If you feel this much hurt now, you probably won't be able to get over it anytime soon without therapy, drinks, long talks. And even still, you'll probably hold it against her subconsciously, and being bipolar, she's got enough problems as it is.

For both of your sakes, end it cleanly now while you're still young. "

"I used to own four of them. I also lived with family, so it was seldom that I would actually get to use them. When I did, the preparation was almost a boner kill, and the actual act was disappointing because id try to simuilate actual sex, when I would end up back in my computer chair and letting my hands do the work. Afterwords, the clean up was humiliating because I would watch semen start floating in the water, and I would realize that I just had a foursome with 3 pocket pussies. 

They mostly stayed in the closet until one day I decided to throw them away. I put them in an old gaming console box, and threw them into a dumpster behind a grocery store. I like to think that I made a homeless man very happy that day. "

And, more long term, put up with me for 6 months of unemployment

I didn't last two minutes. And after I was done, she just collapsed onto me, looked up in such a way as to put her Baywatch-quality D cups right in my field of view, and said ""I love you.""

Another couple of minutes, I slipped out of her...messy, dripping creampie and all.  It was the most utterly pornographic sex I've ever had in my life."
"Wow, let's not take dating advice from anyone who thinks an entire gender is incapable of truth. If you believe this, you shouldn't even ask women out. 

OP, you said classmate, so you are in high school or college. Your date is young and has a million environmental factors that will affect her decisions. She's not a very good decision maker about dating because nobody is at that age. Most of us aren't that great at it by 30 or 40 but we're more experienced at least.

Your date is not interested in going out again with you right now. ""Hey, I got the feeling you changed your mind about a 2nd date. Just wanted to let you know I had a good time, and if you change your mind let me know, I'd love to take you out again.""   Done.

"Relax. I once had a situation where my best friend, I and now my girlfriend stayed in one tent for a camping trip. I had no intention to have sex with her or make any advancement on her whatsoever, I just kinda invited her as a friend to camping with us. One night it just kinda got out of hand and her and me just started to get really close. I mouthed an apology to my best friend and that I didn't expect it to go this way, because I thought that it's just gonna be a nice camping trip where we will all just relax, enjoy the nature and that's it. What he did? Because it was dark, he thought that I am asking for some alone time with her and just straight out left and told us that, if we need, there are few condoms in his wallet. We didn't have sex, but that hour and a half of alone time got us to the point of where we are now.

He was kinda disappointed that we didn't have sex, but he eased up when he saw us happy together afterwards.

If you ever had a ""spider bite"" that was like a big boil on your arm - that's not a spider bite, it's just a fucking skin infection.  I'm sick and tired of people with staph infections thinking they got bit by a spider."
I like it when my penis is in her mouth
"nah, im good, iv been cheated on by all 3 girls iv been serious with, not interested in that again, after one tired to kill me. i just noped the fuck out. i dont miss it, its been almost a year, never been with anyone in any way since , and have no desire too."
"I can see that you really want the reaction to be positive, but as you can see most guys don’t like the whole idea of it and neither do I. I’m insecure sometimes, and having those small insecurities would probably stop me from having a relationship with someone who has done that before. Not all necessarily your fault, but it’s just that I personally don’t want to be committed to someone who thinks it’s perfectly normal to sell their body to someone else."
"Perhaps we need a system by which all dick pics must be submitted to mods first for approval, so that only the highest quality of dick pics are allowed.  ;)"
"I was being a bit ""purposefully-ridiculous"" to try and get my point across; i.e. that this kind of stuff is a slippery slope to huge amounts of eventual censorship and over-moderation.

I don't actually have that /r/conspiracy attitude (at least not THAT much haha)."
"I see you're new to this whole ""banter"" thing.  A better response would have been ""Once more than you, bitch"""
"Look, it's never entirely your penis and it's never entirely not your penis"
"I work in supply chain for a company office that's about 70% women. I've legit been sexually harassed and gossiped about - some of that gossip was actionable unofficially - and considered rude and difficult because I would require facts and narrative to line up before I would sign my name off on up to a million dollars worth of shipments. There were a lot of fake office friends. To this day I can walk in that office and get hugs and ""how have you been, you look great"" type comments from people that also, to this day, have negative shit to say about me when I'm out of earshot.

A lot of people wanted to have control, but no responsibility. That is, do what I say, but blame the person who did what I said if it goes wrong. They should know better and that's their responsibility. But fuck that person if they did what they thought was best if it differed from what I said and I didn't like the result, because I know better and they should listen to me.

It had older women who of course, treated me as a child.

However, when I came through for them and made their lives way easier, I got gifts and shit. Couple of them looked at me like we were two drinks and an empty apartment away from something happening. Dudes never got me gifts."
"Reddit relationship posts in a nutshell. ""Reddit, I'm getting married to somebody I don't know that well."" So sad, how desperate people are for companionship."
Because most of us actually enjoy interacting with women and consider them to be capable of fair and appropriate decision making.
"When she calls sex ""mommy-daddy time"""
"Managed to talk the crazy bitch into an abortion, thank God. I told her it now just wasn't the right time since we were pretty bad off financially, and we would try again again in a year or two, and of course I wouldn't leave her between now and then why would you even think that honey you're my world. Was lying through my teeth the whole time of course."
"My problem is that I have a beautiful plan like these, but I  have serious trouble waking up in the morning and it's all downhill from there =("
Thank you. That’s what I was going for.
"""I kinda get the feeling you don't wanna go on the second date. If you wanna call it off, that's ok too. Just tell me""

not hard"
"I don't do it but the guys I grew up with that do, generally do it because they got into bad shit once and are trying to keep it straight now. 

I'm all for it with these guys, they need the affirmation and their whole sinner turned preacher thing is a good example for the rez youth that look to them for an example. Gym selfies are better than the beer and blunts and gang signs pictures they posted ten years ago. "
"&gt;You're the one attacking people simply because they're women

You've missed the point. 

u/Tomes2789 is saying he has a problem with the  ""pre-emptive strike""  that that particular female mod made.  He is drawing a connection between this and her gender,  which could be relevant,  but doesn't matter if it's not. She should not be locking harmless threads based on her  ""gut feeling"".  There is no harm in men discussing the legal system. There was no rule breaking or anything of the sort that should warrant thread locking. It was CLEARLY censorship based on her personal political views. That's not  moderation. 

And, if you expect people to respect your decisions in keeping her as a mod,  a genuine attempt at contacting the mods about a real concern should not be met with  ""calm your tits""  "
Don't be with someone you don't trust not to cheat...
"I know right! I once tried to send a dick pic, but after I made a picture of my dick I reevaluated my life choices and did something less unproductive and cried myself to sleep."
"Not joking: The first time I met my now girlfriend, a group of us eventually stopped to get ice cream cones. From the time she started licking her ice cream till the time she finished the last bite, she didn't say a word. She just kind of got lost in the experience. That's when I knew she was the one.  "
"this is askmen please go back to askwomen, no man would ever suggest that. "
Mourn with her. The idea that men can't have sad emotions is so ridiculous.  Mourn with her. You will grow closer because of it.
When I form an emotional connection and she has the power to rip out my heart and leave me questioning my self worth and ability to be happy again.
Its an older reference but it checks out
"So my opinion(s) don't matter because I tend to lurk in this particular subreddit and, in lieu of normally posting, instead get a lot out of just reading the threads?

What kind of person are you that you need to weed through my Reddit history in order to attack my ""credibility"" based upon my lack of commenting/posting, instead of actually attacking my POINTS?"
"I had a neighbor like that who lived below me. They would call the cops because we were being too loud. The first day they moved in they came upstairs and asked us to quiet down because their baby was trying to sleep.  We said sorry (even though I had just gotten home from work and my roommate was sitting there watching TV).

Half hour later a cop is pounding on our door. This happened multiple times and usually it was the same officer who came by.

One-time my roommate was away at military training and I was at home laying in bed watching TV. Again the same officer pounds on the door. I open it and he asks if I'm having a party. I say no, he asks to come in and take a look. 

Comes in looks around, no one is here. He apologizes and goes and tells them to stop wasting his time. "
"I was going to child support court in Cook county for a hearing to conclude my child support payments. As I was walking to the court room in the hallway, a sharp dressed attorney angrily confronted me and said ""Mr. Smith, I presume?"" I was taken aback a little, and said ""uh, no."" He looked over to a woman seated on a bench in the hallway. She looked like she had been crying. He nodded to her and she looked up hopefully at me then, sadly put her head back down and nodded ""no."" I felt like I dodged a nuclear bomb there, lol. "
"My last girlfriend was amazing. And I hate how good she is because now she's like my reference for great sex. 
  
It's an art form really. Let's use guitars as an example.   
   
I have a good friend who has been playing guitar for years. And treats it like a side hobby. His playing is okay.
   
I have another friend who just started this year and right away I think he's a better guitar player.  When he plays I just ""feel"" it. It's like the guitar becomes a platform for translating/expressing his emotion. 
   
He may not be as technical. But down the road he will. For now his playing just sounds and feels better.    
   
Blow jobs are the same. Some girlss are just naturals and others are not. 
   
Some technical tips:  
- occasional moaning during. Especially the end  
- deepthroat will change  a mans life  
- ask him what he wants  
- men are very visual. Kick your feet up if you're laying on your tummy. Tease with pouted lips while your jerk it to your face  
- don't try too hard and be natural  "
