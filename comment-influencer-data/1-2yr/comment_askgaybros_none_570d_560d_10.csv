Hi gay I'm daddy
" I was hooking up with this relatively attractive bicurious guy. The sex was stellar, and he was my type. Halfway through he started second guessing if he could do it though. He had catholic guilt super hard. 

He says. ""I don't know if I can do this"" then busts one of the largest loads I'd ever seen. Then sat with this dazed look somewhere between shock and pleasure. 

I'm 95% sure I watched him realize he was gay. It's a shame, never got to hook up with him again. "

"Whoa! There is so much going on here but the important thing is

#DO NOT MOVE IN WITH HIM.

I don't know if he's crazy or just an asshole, but neither would be much fun to live with.

To be honest all that stuff about the house and moving in sounds like diversion tactics from the fact you just came home to find him breaking the rule he made for you. So ignore it. Focus on NOT LIVING WITH THIS GUY."
"&gt; I probably shouldn't super-like him, right? Don't want to appear desperate lol. Actually, I just super-liked him, I couldn't resist lol!!

Sweetheart, breathe. "
"honestly, the generalizations in this thread are pretty amusing. "
"When every guy wants to date you it becomes exhausting. Going on dates makes me feel bad because I'm always the one who turns them down, and I can tell they're so happy to be out with me. Even if we don't have chemistry they'll still want to see me again. I always have to speak up and end things.

It is hard to make gay friends because a lot of them have the ulterior motive of wanting sex. 

If I complain about my dating life my friends roll their eyes, and tell me that I'm gorgeous so I have no right to complain. 

I become a bit self conscious in the sense that guys want to date me for sex, and care less about who I actually am.

Some guys I do date become so self conscious that it drives me crazy. One guy I dated was hot, but he was so self conscious about his hairy chest, that it turned me off. Sometimes I'm put on a pedestal and it sucks because I want an equal."

"Many gay people don't feel welcome in the ""community"" in its current state, and a lot of people who are involved the community are depressed as shit from dealing with everything, which is a problem. (not an opinion, an observation)

Unpopular opinion: This problem can be greatly alleviated if we all were just kinder to each other. **Stop**: with the stupid fems vs masc bullshit, the cliquey shit, the ghosting, bullying closeted people, threads like this, etc. **Do**: be kinder to people who are hesitant to open up, be honest with your feelings or intentions, respect others and don't say unnecessary mean shit, etc.

Guys, there are people out there who want us to be literally exterminated, or, short of that, without any legal rights or cultural recognition. We're all in this together, y'all, whether you like it or not. Start acting like it.

EDIT: Top comment? Goddamn it. This is supposed to be an *unpopular* opinion, guys. I have failed."
"In modern American culture, I honestly feel that everyone will treat you better if you come out to them - barring a few pricks here and there.

If they know you're gay they know to be sensitive about the things they say. They can stop asking which girl you're into while you respond by awkwardly smiling, and now they can pick on you when they catch you checking some dudes ass out. It completely changes the dynamic of your relationship, unlocks a lot more for discussion that wasn't there before, which then leads to better and stronger friendship.

Edit: typos, bad typos"
"Regularly communicate how you feel about them to reassure them.

"It depends on the cruise.

I mean, look - you're gay, if you've been around big gay events (Pride in a large city, Southern Decadence, Gay Days, etc) you know what gay culture is. Yeah, there are groups of guys who fuck a ton (this past Atlantis trip, someone was constantly updating everyone in a Facebook group chat I'm privy to where the orgies were), there are groups of guys who do a ton of drugs and treat the whole thing like one continuous circuit party, and there are groups of guys who get off the ship at every port and do excursions and tours and shit.

If the idea of Southern Decadence or Gay Days makes you really uncomfortable, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU DO NOT GO. I repeat, if Southern Decadence or Gay Days makes you uncomfortable and bitter, DO NOT GO. You'll be fucking miserable.

If you love those kinds of things, regardless of whether or not you're going to participate in the seedy (Oh god no pun intended) stuff, and you love the atmosphere of freedom that comes with pride-type events, go for it. You'll have an absolute blast.

Edit: And if you're actually interested in the orgies and shit, he was updating everyone 24/fucking/7. Like, 630 ship time, ""Orgy in 4170"", two hours later, ""Orgy 3320"", forty minutes later....

It was actually pretty obnoxious.

I do recommend going with a big group of friends though - you can get your rooms next to each other, and if they're balcony rooms you can have the dividers removed, etc.

"About 12-13 years ago when we went to a concert and ended up locking ourselves out of his house and there was no buses or trains to take us the 2 hour journey to my place as it was around 2am.

We ended up cuddling up in the garden shed to keep warm and because I was stupid and didn‚Äôt bring a jacket, he gave me his insisting he wasn‚Äôt too cold even though it was October and we live in Scotland. 

I sat with my back against the shed wall and he sat between my legs and I wrapped my arms around him to keep him as warm as I could. He eventually nodded off to sleep and I just enjoyed the hug.

Luckily, his brother randomly turned up so we ended up warm in bed not long after.

But I always remember that night as the night that I realised how much I was in love with him and that I‚Äôd be with him forever. Even now, he still does the old fashioned romantic gestures like offering me his jacket. He‚Äôs a great guy."
"Yes. Worked with teenagers for a while in a volunteer setting and we took elaborate steps to ensure no adult was ever alone with one of them. We usually had 3-4 adults in the room at any given time.

It crossed my mind that getting involved put me at risk of being accused of trying to kidnap him or something but his safety overshadowed mine at that point.

I wish. If they were hot and were down then that would be a seriously hot situation to be in lol. WHERE'S GAY FAKETAXI.
"This is a copypasta from a different sub where I told this story:

So I had a cold one day and was laying in bed, killing time chatting it up on grindr...begin talking to a guy who seemed nice. I made it clear that i was sick and wasnt in the mood to hook up at all, but he was persistent. He said he would come over, blow me, then make me some soup(lol). 

NSA blowjob and soup? Fuck it i can't turn down that deal. So I give him my address. 10 minutes later I hear a knock...turns out he has an infant daughter...with him. I express my concern and he is adamant that she will be asleep for at least a couple hours. 

Ok this is weird af but I'm not good at being confrontational, so I let him in. He puts his daughter in the living room and basically pushes me into my bedroom. I'm still weirded out as he starts blowing me but it's easy to overlook things when your dick is in someone's mouth...

A few minutes in he asks if I'd fuck him and I say I'm not in the mood, but he won't take no for an answer. He basically shames me into consenting (remember, I'm not confrontational). I basically lay on my bed motionless while he does his thing on top of me. I'm  nauseous, partially from the cold, partially because I feel like he just Jedi mind-tricked me into sex. 

After a while he finishes and dismounts, intent on returning to the blowjob until I cum. We both look down and discover the elephant in the room: 

Shitdick

It was like a coat of paint. As if it was rigged for demolition, my erection fell immediately. As I ran to the bathroom he quickly got dressed and grabbed his...baby...and was gone. 

So in the end I didn't get off, and I never got my soup. All I got out of the deal was a shitty dick...



"
Yup. It‚Äôs like being sore after going to the gym.  It‚Äôs a reminder that you did something worth doing. üòÜ
I am. But that‚Äôs not what hurts. Gay and proud is one thing. You can defend that. Bottom loving dildo user is another. That‚Äôs understandably gross for a family member to see 
That's why they call it a blow JOB.  
Of course this happened.
"Sounds like he has to work some stuff out and him crying had nothing to do with you specifically.  
Unless you wanted to play therapist, there's nothing more you could have done."
The opposite of what I want. 
This particular clickbait title and misleading introduction is acceptable.
"Oh yeah, I have been caught. Usually by my dad and he walks out very red and embarrassed but he always gets over it. He still hasn't learned to knock though so I guess that's his problem! Lol.

Edit: to add on to this, he doesn't catch me very often and it's not like i masturbate too much or anything. I usually do it before I go to sleep and he'll sometimes come in to ask/ tell me something. Either way, it's awkward for us both but we get over it and now I don't really care anymore even though I would still prefer him to never see my sexual side. At some point, you just get over it and learn to embrace your sexual side and not care what others think.

Edit 2: I have briefly touched up on this but some of you in the comments are acting like this is an everyday thing with my dad and I and I can assure you that it is not. I do apologize if that's how it is perceived, but this only happens fo me like once a year lol. I just wanted OP to know that sometimes walk ins do happen and it's important to not beat yourself up about it!!! We should all feel confident in our desires and express ourselves however we like (with some consideration to others)"
"The way its been described to me, many of us have problems being lonely, emotionally insecure, and theres so few of us thats its hard to find compatibility beyond physical attraction, so hookups becomes the default. Hookups are all empty ego so you put up very little to be rejected for, and it becomes a defensive way to get fleeting emotional and physical gratification. And then that feeds back into being lonely, and emotionally insecure, and so on. I dont really know though, i never hookup and have been taking my time slowly trying to date. It was just an article describing the isolation and loneliness within our own community, the superficial callousness we show each other on hookup apps,  and the effects on self esteem that lead us to depend on hooking up. I think it got into the party and play culture also. 
Edit: I couldn‚Äôt find the exact article, but a quick search on google turns up a lot. This one comes close to what i read http://highline.huffingtonpost.com/articles/en/gay-loneliness/"
"Call Me By Your Name is an indie drama that has made less than $50 million I think.

The issue is Black Panther is a 50 year old character.  Making a Marvel character gay just to make one gay seems a little bit like pandering. 

However, I'm sure we will see queer representation in the MCU at some point.  The actors have already played around with fanfic romances and various people have spoken about queer representation.

There's already gay characters in the Netflix Marvel universe I believe."
It's definitely something you would want to bring up before the date.  I don't think most guys would mind.

‚ÄúThis gay guy is flirting with me.... and I like it? Omg... maybe I do like guys emotionally.‚Äù

"not the same thing but my mom apparently found my dildo and started crying. I say apparently because I found out about this through my brother, my mom has never brought it up lmao."
"All the guys I seem to be attracted to turn out to be straight - and to be honest, it isn't about masculinity - because the guys I seem to like aren't uber masc and more beta than alpha - BUT I think straight guys tend to have a more 'natural' look - less likely to be tanned (fake or otherwise), have designer facial hair, shaped eyebrows,  teeth whitening, wear cosmetics, designer sunglasses, and accessories with clothing etc etc - none of which are bad at all! But I guess I like guy-next-door types!

Also I like clean shaven guys - and I've found these days more straight guys are clean shaven compared to gay guys!"
"At the risk of sounding full of myself, I'm kind of like your guy. I'm fluent in three languages, have lived and worked in three European countries including at a US embassy, written five books, and would consider myself well read and informed.

I married a guy who milked cows. He's hot, sure, but he's also the hardest working person I've ever met, and he's always pushing to improve himself. It's his drive to make a better life for us that has gotten us really far for our age. Also you should see this man butcher a pig."
Jack off with him
Nope. :) High school ain‚Äôt shit.
At a house party. I think I'm the only gay left who's never used the internet to get laid. 
People in open relationships don‚Äôt have the ability to be faithful. They just want to fuck other people while pretending to ‚Äúcommit‚Äù to their ‚Äúboyfriend.‚Äù
I don't know how. Games are the only good thing in this shitty world.

"Well, enjoy while you can! When you will try the real thing, you won't like it that much anymore... Especially when falling sleep...

You will quickly learn that your imaginary bf would never kick you, steal your covers, overheat you, accidentally almost choke you, got you stuck in uncomfortable position for the whole night, push you out of the bed, keep snooring right into your ear or spend the whole night crushing you, while real boyfriends do that everynight..."

"Relate heavily to this. I used to tell myself every year that this would be the one I'd stop watching gay porn. Every birthday I'd make a deadline for when I had to stop being gay. On the night of my 20th birthday, I sat in front of the mirror and cried because I had finally come to terms with my sexuality. Now I am 23 and I am proud of who I am and will never feel ashamed again. It's a journey but I know you can do it. We're all here for you."

"Funny story: I was at a hostel in Korea back then and all four of us (strangers) have Grindr and no idea that we all have the app. And then, the other guy randomly messaged me to have me follow him in the shower. He‚Äôs so surprised that it‚Äôs me and said that (when I first got in the hostel) he‚Äôs been hoping I‚Äôm gay so basically wish granted. So a good friendship became a steamy shower scene. Hahahaha. 


And the other guys, we trolled at but nothing happened. 

Edit: We had sex three times in that room in a day. The other one was very thrilling coz we‚Äôre always afraid we‚Äôll get caught. "
"Dump the current guy if you feel that way. Don't go running back to the ex just yet.

Take some time to yourself. Get your life back together. You need some down time. You need some time to get back to loving yourself and being emotionally self-sufficient. I'd say if you go back to your ex right away, you'll just use him as an emotional crutch. That's okay if it's done in a healthy way that allows you to grow at the same time. That's what relationships are for. It's not okay if you foist all your problems on him and try to have him keep you from drowning. You'll just drag both of you down. 

You've gotta work on you for a little while. Also, quit drinking when you're sad or angry. Reserve drinking for happier emotions or you'll risk using that as a crutch. 

Get a new job, a new place, chill out some, work your stress out in the gym or with a hobby, then call your ex. Set some new goals and accomplish them.

Sorry about your mother. "

"Weirdly enough, I found 2 people on Grindr in the same apartment building as me.

If you're cool with it and still want to be there to support him, you two can work it out together or if you feel too hurt and betrayed, then you will find out in a mature and responsible way."
"Wow, you're so random. I can't believe you did that."
"This question may be better answered on a subreddit like r/Gayyoungold.

It‚Äôs great that your boyfriend has introduced you to a lot of his friends, especially considering the age difference. It shows that he isn‚Äôt embarrassed of you and that his friends are receptive to you. Additionally, I am surprised to see the generally positive response from this subreddit itself ‚Äî it typically isn‚Äôt very kind to those in gay younger-older (GYO) relationships. This is a sort of mirror to the real world; a GYO relationship is overall not well-received when the age gap is something significant like yours.

My boyfriend is 37 and I am 20. Although he has been gay essentially his whole life, like me, I have been in the converse of your situation. He has tons of gay, older male friends and I don‚Äôt have many friends in general. I initially found hard to fit into his social circle since I was so young and generally couldn‚Äôt find anything in common with his friends. However, I am also aware that I am mildly anxious in social situations.

I resolved this by looking at it more as a problem with my social skills and less like an age problem. Blaming it on the age difference was really my way of not dealing with my social anxiety.

Before, I kept myself from making certain statements and participating in discussion because I felt like my input was less valuable to this group of successful real estate agents, designers, lawyers, doctors and educators. This was a blunder on my part because I they were indeed interested in what I had to say ‚Äî I am the partner to one of their very close friends. They were interested in my work, my school, my family and my interests the same way I was interested in theirs. More so, to my surprise I actually have a lot in common with them. I like to think that no matter your age, most people generally feel like 20-something on the inside.

Consider that this group of young people is not very different from you. You have likely faced many of the same hurdles they have if not in school or relationships then as a part of simply being gay. Try to find out about their interests and speak up about them. Additionally,  I feel like since you are rather fresh out of the closet that you would benefit from making some gay friends your own age. This will help your relationship because then you will have people to introduce your boyfriend to and give him a little taste of his own medicine ‚Äî see how he fares in socializing with people in YOUR social circle. This is a great relationship-builder because you will share the experience of feeling a bit uncomfortable when feeling each other out.

If you already have a group of friends who don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre gay then that is a problem. Your boyfriend has effectively brought you into the most intimate part of his life ‚Äî his friends and family. You should do the same. Refusing to do so because they don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre gay, or don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre gay AND dating such a young man, is a slap in the face to your partner. More so, you aren‚Äôt considered to be ‚Äúout‚Äù until you are truly out. This means informing the people closest to you of your sexuality and relationships. Of course, everything should be done when you feel personally prepared but just know that without this, your relationship will not last. This is OK because sometimes you aren‚Äôt ready for a gay relationship. Maybe you aren‚Äôt. It sounds like you are though. You just need to take all of the steps."

"It's like woofs on Scruff I think. Just like 'I think you're hot' but that doesn't mean necessarily translate to 'I want to fuck you or even talk to you'.

Basically, it's whatever. I just don't see why people seem to hate them enough to make their profile 'NO TAPSüö´'"

"It's fun having a brush with somebody ""famous."" üòé

 Many years ago, I walked into the local gay bookstore and on the cover of this magazine was this hot, captivating guy. It was freaky because he just seemed sooo familiar. I was so attracted. I kept wondering was this the guy of my dreams?  Did I did have some sexual dream about him?      

It wasn't until the following weekend, I was out with friends at our favorite gay bar and went up to the bar to order a drink and -surprise!!- there's ""the man of my dreams"" as the bartender! No wonder this guy looks so familiar!  He was our favorite bartender. I couldn't believe I didn't recognize him but it was because it was so out of context and he was all dressed up as a leather daddy.  Haha! Mystery solved. Actually he was really quite shy about being recognized, which I thought was quite funny."
"Oh god, ""thrupple"".

"When I first moved to SF, a friend who lived in the heart of the Castro said he had to pay for premium just to get beyond the hundred guys who lived in 2 blocks of his house."
My gay uncle has told me on numerous occasions that that is what he had to do to survive. He married a lesbian and had a daughter. My uncle is a great guy and it makes me sad when I think about how much he had to suffer from having to pretend he was something he wasn't.

"Gay or straight, triads are tough (I think the word ""throuple"" sounds ridiculously MTV so we're going to go with ""triad"" for the purpose of this post). I've been poly for my entire adult life, but have never been in a triad. Of course there's always the exception to the rule and some folks wind up in triads that last a lifetime on their first shot, but...

Often, people just starting to explore poly think triads are the perfect configuration. The logic is that if you and your boyfriend are ""sharing"" a ""third,"" you're less likely to get jealous. But there are problems with that: 

1. Finding a great relationship is tough, even more so when you're gay and your dating pool is that much smaller. Now think about the odds of finding two men who are attracted to you, whom you're attracted to, and who are attracted to one another. 
2. Couples looking for this think of themselves as a *couple* dating *a third*, or as *three people in one relationship*. In reality, triads are four separate dynamics: A &amp; B, B &amp; C, A &amp; C, and A &amp; B &amp; C.  Each of those dynamics develops differently, and people going into triads with the expectation that ""there won't be any jealousy because all the relationships will be equal"" often wind up breaking up spectacularly when they discover that one dyad has a stronger bond than another, or when different dyads just develop differently or at different rates.
3. Often, couples looking for triads create rules to protect their relationship, at the expense of or without input from the new partner. They often hold the new partner to a different standard than they hold each other, which leads the newer partner to feel like a sex toy rather than a partner.

In my experience, successful triads are usually those that form organically, when an individual is dating two people who get to know each other and eventually fall for each other. Like all relationships, the best aren't forced. I always *strongly* encourage couples who are considering poly to date separately rather than insisting on dating together/seeking out a triad."

"Actually, when I was coming to terms with my sexuality, I first saw myself as ""queer"" in it's original meaning and connotation of being different.   I thought I was bi, but now I identify as gay, or ""homosexual"" but I recognize that there are lots of us who are a standard deviation or so from the mean in different ways.  I do feel some kinship and we all fit under that queer umbrella."
"Idk if this is the same thing, but I used to be faaaaaat. I've gone from 250 at my heaviest to 160 now. I still see myself as the ugly, fat kid. But apparently I'm not the ugly, fat kid anymore and people like to let me know. Makes me uncomfy because I'm not used to attention from anyone, let alone hot guys haha. "
"No, but I have a buddy who has. He was also impressed by the guy having the balls to risk it. Even though he was being picked up from a gay club, the driver almost certainly knew he was risking some sort of sanction from Uber by sexually propositioning a fare, if it had resulted in a complaint. (Fortunately my friend isn't the sort to do that, even if he hadn't found the guy appealing.)"
"In order for an open relationship to work you need to be able to tell the difference between having sex with someone and making love. If your able to differentiate then it‚Äôs easier not to be jealous. 

Now on the flip side is if your bf is only having sex with others and not you then that‚Äôs a bad thing. The two of you still need to have passionate monkey love sex. 

Also ground rules. Can you only have sex with people visiting the city?  Is the sex a one time thing (that means after you sex up the hot barista you can‚Äôt fuck him a second time). Do you only play together in a 3way. Or you play separately the partner gets to watch. Do you allow hookups in your house or do they have to take place elsewhere. Do you want to know before it happens. 

All things to consider. "
