"This does not seem like a platonic crush. In a long-term relationship, people sometimes get unsatisfied with certain aspects of their partner, and someone who is the exact opposite of those aspects will catch their eye. Has your insecurity played a big role in your relationship? 



He talks about her, tells you she's pretty, and is wondering if she is interested in him. He looks her up on social media. He has feelings for her. Maybe he doesn't have bad intentions, but if he found out she was interested, what do you think would happen?



This should make you uncomfortable. You need to have a serious talk with him and tell him that he can't help his feelings, but it is inappropriate for him to give her special attention. You should also try to talk about any problems/improvements you'd like to make in your relationship."
"&gt;""Yes, but it'll be finished when it's finished, and I can't agree to your deadline next year, because other paid work that comes along in the future will take priority"".

Your boyfriend has dropped the ball, but his initial reaction should've been taken as a ""no.""  

So while you're right to be disappointed, but take this as a lesson that when someone says they can't agree to a deadline, believe them. 

He should take this as a lesson that he's not cut out for charity work (or at least not for charities he has no personal connection to). I wouldn't bring that up tonight; save it in case he starts thinking about another pro bono project with a hard deadline. "
"You know, I consider myself pretty openminded when it comes to my partner's sexual past. Numbers don't bother me but if I knew he did something like *this*, even if it were back in the day, it would make me seriously reevaluate the relationship. "
"Holy shit, you're both awful partners. Sorry to be blunt, but you two got married before you were emotionally mature. I'm 20, and I'm able to realize that this is one of the most toxic things I've read. Furthermore, you almost make it seem like what you do is fine. 
Such as:

&gt;making her quit her job

&gt;forcing her to change her clothes because you think they're inappropriate 

&gt;not letting her go out with friends because you won't work on your insecurity issues

She's right--you ARE controlling. Trust me, I get the anxiety issues. I have them too. I have intrusive thoughts that my partner might cheat on me when he goes out--but I WORK on this issue because it's my problem, not my partner's.  

She's also not innocent, but cheating is something you've both done. All you two do is find ways to hurt each other. Neither of you trust each other. I hope to God that you two don't have a child because it would grow up with the most awful relationship to absorb as ""normal."""
"This. I might have missed how long they've been dating, but this certainly seems like it falls into the 'reserve for further thought' category at the very least."
"My husband used to be a stage actor and demonstrated to me how actors actually kiss on stage. It is generally a dry kiss on the corner of the other person's mouth, but mashed together. From audience-view it looks deep and passionate. Up close it is just the faces mashed close together, mouthes closed and on the corner of the lips. "
"""Stop shit testing me, Roger!! You know you're just a plate"""
"I like that perspective, thanks. I think I just got so caught up in negative thinking that I figured I ruined my chance at happiness. But looking at it that way, you're right. I went to live abroad for a few years. I still have time."
WTF. She's a freakin' 23 year old woman. She can't just run away everytime her SO wants to have a serious discussion with her. Tell her to stop being childish and speak to you like an adult.
"Someone touching your food without your permission is not ok, it's hostile, unsanitary, and could be dangerous to someone with an allergy. You can definitely go to HR and say that so-and-so messed with your food and is creating a hostile work environment."
You should try the essence lash princess. Only 4$ and makes my lashes look awesome. And you won't get fibers in your eyes!
"If he hadn't broken up with you, we would have all suggested you break up with him. 

Also he TOLD YOU to do the research???????? What to hell? If you can't research your own business idea that's a good sign you don't have either the knowledge or time to run that business. "
"What I was going to say. She likes the attention obviously, otherwise she would have told her co-workers that she's married.

I can't stop talking about my fiancée at work, why doesn't she?"
Thats a real possibility. Birth control is hormone treatment and that can mess with libido. Best to consult a doctor. 
"I'm totally with you. Mike sounds a little creepy, and hands down it's inappropriate to share a room with him. Does Mike have a SO? What do they think of him sharing a hotel room with a young woman? OP sounds naive and not ready for a serious, committed relationship."
"This is not a one- or two-time thing; this is a pattern.  He gets angry, he uses emotional blackmail (breaking up and then getting right back together) as a way of inducing emotional stress on you, and then in between all of that, he's says complimentary things to you.

This is classical abuse behavior.

Do not forgive him.

Get out.

&gt; I don't want to give up on us because when we don't argue we're so great

Translated:  ""When he's not being abusive, and I'm walking on eggshells to make sure that he doesn't *become* abusive, things are great"".

What would you tell a girlfriend if she told you this story about her boyfriend?"
"&gt; telling me we had to break it off because he is not worthy of love, and he deserves to be miserable, so he should call off the divorce

I am trying to be as gentle as possible.  You are the girl on the side.  He has no plans to actually divorce his wife. I'm sorry.  I can tell you want this to work.

 "
Good idea to be prepared.
"Even if your concerns were silly (and believe me, the ones you have listed are very valid), you *still* have the right to tell your mom ""No.""

When she pesters you about it, say ""I've already said no, I don't want to talk about this anymore."" And then you change the subject or end the conversation, depending on how you feel."
"I'm sorry. But I think your boyfriend might be kind of gross.

"
"Ok, time for bluntness. This is actually a blessing. She was YOUR mom. Out of everyone there, since J does not want the ring, you should get it. You'll keep it safe, you'll take good care of it, and in a way, your mom will always be with you. If your brother and SIL live close by, pop over one day and ask them in person. If they do not, call them or skype them to ask. Better for you to wear it always than to have it locked in a dark box never to see sunlight again.

My husband and I didn't even have rings (I don't wear mine at all, I work in healthcare), so the fact that J wants her own is completely reasonable. I would not want a constant reminder that my dead mother in law is spiritually looking over my shoulder (or on my hand). "
"These are awesome and you should use them, OP. 
Are any of these women a healthy weight? It sounds like they're jealous and would prefer to sabotage your diet than take on their own."
"Denverite here: there are a decent amount of ""fancy"" places downtown you can go to before a show! Colt and gray is fancy, tomayo on larimer is nice, or even the kitchen or next door at union station are fancy enough for nice clothes. We really do enjoy Colorado casual here, but no one's going to judge too hard if you're dressed up. "
"I couldn't believe the OP's reaction either, she's a grown adult and can't understand that this is J's marriage, not anyone else's, and she's the one that has to wear the ring for the rest of her life so it's only fair that she gets something personal and meaningful to her and her relationship? I wouldn't want to be reminded of a deceased in-law and all that associated grief every time I look at my ring finger."
"Yeah it's possible that she's right.    Change up the chore chart to remove general tidying things that are related to time spent in the apartment.  (dishes and picking stuff up etc)  and leave it with big tasks like cleaning the toilet, taking out recycling etc.

Or just ditch the chart.   You're by default going to be more sensitive about cleaning because you work from home.  Try setting up a communal deep clean time where all three of you spend an hour     cleaning.    Or say each person has to deep clean a room once a week."
"&gt;I don't understand what's so scary about dentists and doctors.

really?

fear of finding out you have a terrible disease

fear of being poked and prodded by a stranger

fear of showing your most private parts to a stranger

fear of being vulnerable

fear of the unknown

fear of massive bills

fear of future pain and suffering

fear of humiliation

fear of having to admit to poor health habits

fear of being judged and found wanting 

there are plenty of reasons to fear doctors and dentists. these things are not based on logic, they're primal instincts and socially complex anxieties. "

"She chose to hide her ""healthy sexual past"""
"Exactly. I'm 3 months into a relationship and my ""guy talk"" typically involves me saying it's going great and how happy I am.

In fact if a friend messaged me and said they found my GF annoying I'd be having serious words with them, not saying she makes up for it with sex. How awful. "
"&gt; Yesterday I caught the youngest one scrubbing the toilet with my toothbrush, and when I told my husband he told me she would never do anything like that.

He doesn't fail to see the problem he is denying to OP it happened, despite OP seeing it.

Sorry OP, your husband does not respect you. He is basically calling you a liar and letting you be treated like crap. As a cherry on this shit Sunday he is being a crap dad by not being willing to parent. It's his job to teach his children to behave properly: both for the benefit of those around them and so they won't pull this stuff as adults and be disliked, beat up, in jail for stealing, whatever. 

You could maybe suggest marriage counseling or something but honestly it sounds like he is just a bad husband as well as being a bad father. I don't know that you can fix that. I guess make clear to him that if nothing changes you're gone. But if so expect things to be over. You could also show him this thread? I don't see what you have to lose here. "
"This life is not good enough for you. He is not good enough. Figure out if you think he can change, and then make a decision. But please don't wait for him to be the partner you need him to be, it's a waste of your life and potential. "
"I dated a guy like this once. Sweetest guy ever, but a particular game was giving him a hard time (Far Cry 4, I think).

The first time he screamed at a game I told him I was going for a walk. When I came home, I told him that the next time it happened, he'd be the one going out that door - with all of his belongings and minus one girlfriend. Curse and complain and whine, sure, but no one in my home gets to scream like that unless they're being murdered.

He didn't scream at the game again. Gaming culture tells these guys it's fine to be violently expressive when things don't go their way. Being shown immediate consequences and zero tolerance for this horribly frightening and immature behavior was all he needed."
"You mention that they aren't known for showing up to things on time. Do people usually wait for them? Do they enjoy the attention that being late gets them? 

Don't apologize. You did nothing wrong."
Sounds like my husband. Stopped going to the dentist at age 18. Finally started going around age 37. He's now 40 and he is finally caught up with all of his dental work. He had at least 12 fillings and several root canals. This could have been prevented if he had gone regularly. 
"What the fuck who thinks this is acceptable???? How in the hell does she think it's okay to put a piece of chewed up gum on your sheet? I went on a date with a guy once who discarded his chewed up gum in the side pocket of my car door. Never spoke to him again, because people should have basic fucking manners.
"
"OP, you should send her an article on the lawsuit. 

I'm petty AF and I totally would."
"Do you have a question?

She... didn't dump you because she thinks you're too good for her. That's not a real thing that happens. She dumped you because she wanted to be with the other guy, and she told you that to protect your feelings. I'm sorry."
"I would NOT be ok with this. You are not being too sensitive. I would recommend you put your foot down now.

I'm assuming she feels like she needs to flirt and be seen as available to get ahead at the company? Has it worked for her? 

Does she walk over you in other areas of your marriage?"
"She's hardcore trying to continue being one of the guys and not rock the boat to the determinant of your relationship. You need to talk to her about this.

I assume based on this you've never gone to any work functions with her as well. 

There is keeping your professional and personal lives separate and then there is this clap trap. She's literally living two different lives. "
"She can't control her temper. 

She hits you.

She destroys your property.

She gets verbally abusive if you don't want to have sex.

If this was a guy doing all of the above to your sister, wouldn't you do anything in your power to help her GTFO?   Why should this be any different if it's happening to a male?   Dude, you need to move out ASAP. "
"You are 22-the longer you stay locked in this dying relationship the more opportunities for other relationships you lose.

DO you want to struggle along on life support and throw away another 4 years of your life-thats even more of a waste."
"Also, try to read and learn about how women feel about creeps, and the threat of harassment, and how it limits their behaviour and sense of safety.

You ask, ""How can I get women to stop thinking I'm creepy so that I can get one of them to be my girlfriend, and also keep my male friends?""

It should be, ""I never knew I was creeping women out! How can I stop doing things that scare women and make them feel awkward and unsafe?""

See the difference? The first is about getting what you want from a woman. The second is about realizing that your actions have a negative impact on people. Notice how the second doesn't even include your end goal of getting a girlfriend. Creepy behaviour is about putting your desire for romance above a woman's comfort. Reverse that."
"When it becomes a pattern it has to do with how you pick men. Picking a person who's abusive usually goes back to trauma you may have encountered when you were younger. Any of your family members, friends, or first love, physically, emotionally or verbally abusive?"
"He's not pretentious, he's controlling and he won't change.

&gt;I knew what he wanted from the very start, never thought it would be so hard to accomplish everything.

You will never be able to ""accomplish everything"" with a person like your boyfriend. The more you bend to his whims, the more he will expect from you, and he will continue to shift the goalposts until your life revolves around him and his vision of who he wants you to be.

Guys like him pick girls your age to date so they can do this and get away with it. You're under his spell and think he's the love of your life, but you're 19 and have so much more to give to someone who isn't going to manipulate you into being someone you're not.

Leave him, OP."
"If your wife was a good wife and mother up until this specific event, she probably can be again. I lived through it when someone I loved had a complete mental break. It was horrible...but in the end we were both stronger on the other side.

Parrots live 50-90 years. If she got him when she was 14, he may have out lived her...if it wasn't for whatever caused his liver to fail. I imagine your wife is inconsolable with guilt in addition to grief. Did something he ate, something in his environment cause this illness? She probably feels as though his death is her fault. I can't imagine how I would feel if I caused the death of my 16yo dog...especially if I could have reasonably expected for her to live another 60-70 years. 

What your wife is going through is terrible. Even if it is ""just a bird"" to you, it is much more to her. He is probably the first thing she loved aside from her parents. 

That said, her response is very unhealthy and destructive to your family. She needs help, fast. Hire a nanny to help out with the kids temporarily, and get your wife into counseling. She will likely need intensive support. Outpatient or even inpatient, if it gets very bad.

Whatever you do, don't leave her alone with the kids. She is not in her right mind now, but she may be able to recover. Set her up for success by making sure she can't do anything that can't be fixed."
"I'd say it more like,

&gt; If a woman finds you creepy, it's almost certainty because she senses how intensely you want something from her, ~~but are not actually paying attention to, or offering her, what she might want.~~ and can tell you're not trying to make a genuine connection with her.

I get what you mean, but I think a lot of young guys view relationships in a transactional way (i.e. ""wanting"" and ""offering"" things) and that's part of why they struggle. People like to be treated like people."
"This made me tear up. I'm a foster care worker. Thankfully I have had nothing but good experiences with my foster families and I'm so happy you have found a wonderful home where you feel safe and cared for.

Maybe you should consider writing it in a letter to them. I'm quite shy and find I communicate best through writing. One thing I know for sure, they need to hear this from you. Adults who work in this field and our foster parents constantly question if we are doing enough for the kids. We know a lot of kids just try to put on a brave face and tell us everything is ok when we ask. To actually have that reassurance from you that you truly are happy with them and they're making a positive difference in your life will certainly be one of the best gifts they'll ever receive."
"This. I also wouldn't go out drinking every night and then go straight to bed, ignoring my SO. He sounds like a pretty selfish guy."
"The problem is she can't move back with my family, because our mother died 12 years ago, and our father sold the house and moved in with some woman a couple years ago. He's not very present in our lives, to be honest - just a couple phone calls a year and very rare visits."
"That's crazy?  There's nothing wrong with sex in the same house with a baby, and it's not social when a woman can fit into her mans tshirt.  I'd guess 98.9% of women in straight relationships can do that."
"I dont read that at all unless she edited it after your comment.  In fact

If you want a loving, committed, emotionally connected partner, a father to your future children, and a stable, hardworking, educated guy, then you want my SO. Is he as ""fun"" or as ""cool""? No. But, he's everything I want.

He's everything she wants-thats a pretty ringing endorsement that all of you seem to have missed completely."
"&gt; Edit to say I VERY STRONGLY recommend NOT saying ""put to sleep""

Can't stress this enough.  My friends made this mistake with their son and he was terrified of sleeping for months.  He thought he'd be taken away like their dog."
"What do you do? You be safe.  You focus on YOUR health. His health is not your fault or your responsibility.  it's abusive for him to make threats.  it's manipulative.  If he died it would not be on your hands.  It's on his.  It was his choice and you wouldn't cause his death.  He caused it by devaluing his life so much.  If you want, call the police on him when you leave or his family. "
"Your friend most likely blocked you because she's feeling guilty, embarrassed and upset and is lashing out at you and Ellen for identifying the fact that she's (at the very least) having an emotional affair. Especially because you and Ellen brought it up to her together, likely making her feel like you two are ganging up on her (and gathering evidence and examples). I am in no way condoning her behavior, but, unfortunately, it's not your place to tell her how to live. 
  
I can't really advise you on the next step, because i'm not sure what you want going forward. The ball is pretty much in her court--if you want to stay friends, you might send her an email apologizing for talking about her with Ellen and trying to insert yourself in her business. If you don't, then leave things as is and see if she addresses it with you. "
"Hey OP, I sort of understand what's happened.  I'm from North America, but my family is super religious, and even though I don't share their views, I basically absorbed a lot of the mindset without ever questioning it. 

Which means I jumped into marriage way too fucking early, before I knew what the hell I was doing.  I love my wife and we're a great team now, but I routine fucked our marriage over with bad or selfish behaviour for the first three years.  Some tips from the trodden ground. 

1) Communication is the most important thing.   If your wife can't start ESL classes immediately, you need to start trying to learn her language.  In fact, you guys should be doing both - her learning English and you learning her language (I'm guessing it's a local dialect of arabic? or Coptic?).  Doesn't matter if you're shit at languages or don't have interest.  It's a way of showing that you take communication WITH HER seriously.  It can also be a bonding activity.  Don't be obessesed with ""getting it right"". Approach with a sense of fun.   Make labels for everything in the house in both languages.  See if you can find movies and TV in her language with english subtitles that you can watch together.  Support her and compliment her when she learns new words and phrases. 

2) Find your wife a local community with the same or similar culture.  If you live in a big city, this will be easier. Start asking around for other women from roughly the same background as your wife, and introduce her to them. Chances are they'll have answers to questions you haven't even thought of.  They've been in America for awhile and will have some idea of how things work.  If you're in a smaller community, you're going to have to be the social diplomat for your wife for a bit.  

3) Find a way to communicate to her that she has time for herself now and can do what she wants to do. My wife was the oldest child with a dead mom and checked out dad. It took her a long time to figure out how to detach from caring for other people and start caring for herself. This can be pretty scary though and feels like there's a void.  

4) Start refostering your own social circle.  Your old friends aren't down with your choices (I don't necessarily blame them... it really sounds like you didn't think this through and were either bowing to family pressure or allowing your insecurity and inexperience with women to influence you to ""skip"" all the learning steps and go straight into marriage.) but no man is an island and you need to get new friends.  Look up ""making new friends"" threads on this subreddit and follow the advice, stat.   Even better, make couple-friends, so that your wife can make some friends too. 

Stop being selfish. You had agency in this and made a choice.  Treat her how you'd want to be treated.   If you need to vent, DO IT IN OTHER WAYS. Write it down, go to a counselor, go hit a punching bag, scream into a pillow. Stop taking it out on her.  "
"&gt; Can you compromise by saying that their bedroom and maybe a bathroom, living room (you said the house is pretty big) to be child free zones?

In another comment, OP said that SIL lives in a completely detached guest house. So this chick has absolutely zero reason to think the kids will touch ""her"" stuff."

"Sometimes I think the whole reddit ""blindly pro-porn no matter what the situation"" thing can actually be really harmful. This is a super hurtful thing to do. I understand that sex and masturbation are different things, but it's a normal and human response to feel hurt when your partner is choosing to masturbate to women in a video instead of having sex with you. Also, he lied about showering when he was actually going into the bathroom to jerk it to porn. Lying is never okay.

I would be really upset as well, OP. Don't listen to the people trying to rationalize your boyfriends behaviour - it's hurtful and you absolutely do not have to put it up with just because a bunch of internet strangers told you to. Talk to him about and have a real, honest conversation. Explain to him that you feel unwanted and sexually neglected. If he refuses to acknowledge your emotions and won't listen, then I would just leave. 

EDIT: Also ew at all the people comparing sex and masturbation to eating a meal? We are humans with feelings and emotions, not food to be consumed and eventually shit out. "
"You'd be an idiot to trust her. Look up ""emotional affair"" she's been cheating on you for months. "
"It was up to you. You are your own person. Don't let someone else dictate how you live, or die. "
"The older brother of a good friend of mine was a male model for many years. He never regretted it, and I am not aware of anyone holding it against him. If anything, everyone was jealous of all the cool places he got to go and how easy his job was.

---

Think about your future. Except for the most successful models, modeling eventually stops and unless you plan for that transition, you are in for a bad time.

This means two things. Set money aside. Don't spend it all on parties and fun. Second, plan for a post modeling career. Build a skill set that will make you employable after it all ends.

The guy I know is now a money manager, because he did a good job managing his own money and was able to prove that he could do it.

---

You only live once. You are young and this is probably the only time you will be able to do this. Go for it. If its not for you, you can always quit."
"Yeah, I get the feeling this was not an olive branch at all, and the subsequent name-calling using words from certain fat movements may mean she perhaps wants to sabotage his efforts to get healthy and fit. "
"&gt; I don't like it when women comment on my photos makes me look bad.

????"
I had a friend I hadn't heard from in year reach out to me a few months back. She knew I'm involved in dog rescue so wanted to ask me about her dogs before she ran. She stayed with us for months. I can't imagine anyone (and especially any woman) wouldn't do the same. 
"The number of times OP said he seemed ""surprised"" to see/hear from her makes me think he thought he'd *already* broken up with her. Like, in his mind, ghosting her was breaking up with her, but she just failed to get the memo. "
"The fear I have (and maybe you should too) in all of this, is that he's saying all the ""right"" things to prep for covering up cheating. 

1) We kissed once but she forced it. -- now if she ever tells you that they kissed and he initiated, she seems crazy, he already told you a different version. 

2) She ruined a relationship before by lying about cheating. --- OR did she tell the truth and he was cheating with her then too? Or is he saying that so he can be like ""No! You know she did this to me before!"" 

That's the kinda scary part. 

The REALLY scary part is this: if there's a girl who is trying to ruin your relationships and forcefully kissed you, WHY THE HELL DON'T YOU HAVE AN ANSWER TO ""Is she the one that got away?"" AND WHY IS THAT ANSWER NOT NO? "
"I really think your fiancé needs to try counseling. Insecurities are common for young girls, especially regarding looks. But, to be blunt, your fiancé stalked this poor girl. A complete stranger. Think of your future. What if you have a future coworker that's ""your type""? Will she stalk your work, sabotage your job so you aren't near her? May sound crazy, but it sounds like it's on her level. 

Sit down and talk to her. If she's not willing to work on her problem, then that's another red flag. Good luck OP. "
It feels like abuse because it is abuse.

"lol, your sister's boyfriend is 15, but your husband is the one who acting like he is. Holy smokes. He should have congratulated the bf."
"Girl, time for some tough love. She lost weight because she worked for it. You did nothing . You are at a unhealthy weight, don't do this for your looks. Do it for your health.

My sister became obese because she used her pregnancy as an excuse to eat crap all the time.l get emotional eating. I understand it. 

Talk to your husband and throw all the junk out. Now. Don't start tomorrow or Monday.  Download My Fitness pal, join /r/loseit and get going. You won't lose weight by being jealous and mot doing shit."
"This happened to me aswell, my SO of 6 years used to never kiss me like he meant it, it was just pecks and I used to initiate it. And let me tell you, I get how you are feeling, it sucks. Have you talked to him about it? I know this is going to sound dumb but talking about how you are feeling may be the best option here. "
"&gt;  He doesn't display any interest in helping with the baby unless asked and even then I feel like sometimes he deliberately does a bad job so that I take back over and he can go back to playing video games.

You do realize that this has NOTHING to do with him being an only child right? Your husband is just selfish. 

That said you married someone with a drastically different idea of what not only family means, but also what it means to be a father.

There is no magic to getting him to compromise. You can try couples therapy."

"5 cats is insane. That's basically your own little colony. 

Have they actually asked you about the cats or has it been implied? I think you need to just get right ahead of this and establish firm boundaries. If anyone has anything to say about that, they are more than welcome to take the cats in. "
"&gt; no one can be this crazy.


I don't know if it will help, but there are various subreddits where people can read pms, fb messages, insta, etc... from people (yes men and women) who are indeed 'this crazy'. Maybe if the situation has calmed down a bit and your wife keeps on thinking that no one is this crazy, you should show her those subreddits. "
"Every parent accidentally hurts their child at some point. You were literally fine with it and taking pictures at the moment he twisted out of your husband's grip. It can happen to anyone! 
You repeatedly say you flipped out or freaked out at him and various others...honestly, I think you have an issue with anger and appropriate reactions. "
I had to go back and look at the ages. Honestly even most teenagers are more considerate than this.
"I don’t have an address or I’d call rn. My bf has the address, but he says he’s overstepping his boundaries by calling because he parents could get charged with a felony.
I will definitely reconsider. His reaction will determine if I’m still seeing him at the end of this hurricane. "
They probably don't like your fiance and this is their way of expressing it to you. 
"&gt; To be fair, my SO is uncool but that's what makes him who he is, he is nerdy, dorky and has his own interests.

You need to realize the power that your words have. My SO is also stereotypically ""nerdy/dorky"" in, like, the high school sense but I think he is the fucking coolest, and I certainly would never describe him as ""uncool."" I also would never specifically compare his coolness to my ex's in conversations with friends. I cannot wrap my head around that. 

To me it sounds like despite all of your objections and clarifications, you still idolize and want a ""cool,"" guy like your ex. It seems like you just think that your current SO is the type of guy you're *supposed* to be with and that's why you are. That's certainly what I'd be thinking if I was your boyfriend.

This is probably a lost cause. I really suggest you think a lot about your definitions of ""cool,"" what you find desirable, and how you talk about the people in your life when they're not around."
"&gt;I was hoping she could learn to abstain while the rest of us don't

(This came out waayyyy preachier than I intended)

Please don't take this the wrong way. I'm not trying to criticize you or make you feel badly.

In an ideal world that would be possible.  However, people around her having fun and drinking is a form of peer pressure, if a very passive one, to do the same. Even if you ask her to stay sober, if you do it with a beer in your hand, it's hardly supportive.  You're telling her (and again I don't mean to insult) that her physical problems are just hers to bear.

When you're dating someone, at some point their issues become your issues, and if you want to act in her best interest, you must not tempt her into situations where she can hurt herself and then ask her to not.  In the same way you wouldn't bring home a 50 stack of frozen burgers to your partner on a diet, you must work to eliminate the choice to harm before it becomes a choice at all.  An ounce of prevention, pound of cure, etc.

If you want to stay with her and maintain a healthy lifestyle, you need to commit yourself to it as well.  She clearly needs your support instead of your temptation.  

Obviously her choice is her choice, and the responsibility that you bear is significantly smaller than her own, but as her partner you owe it to her to try and do what's best for her, instead of what's easy.

And you know all of this, obviously.  Maybe you had trouble putting it into words (or not), but you knew."
"Call your Landlord, ask if the previous tenant complained about this craziness. Keep the letter and provide a copy to the landlord.  

I would also take up origami, you can leave her lots of little presents then. 

I would do everything you can to ignore this nutter. If things get worse, I would even call the non emergency police... I mean her note could be considered threatening.  

Edit: If she is the landlord... then it explains why the previous girl upped and left."
"Honestly I think her jealousy is the biggest red flag here. You did everything right, there's no way you could've seen this coming,  and she has nothing to be mad at you for. Her breaking up with you may end up helping you dodge that bullet, though it's probably no consolation right now for you. "

"WTF dude!!!! WHAAAT. NO! 

This is not just a mom problem. You're blaming this on your mom and on them but you need to take responsibility too. You just invited her to be in your bridal party BUT YOU DON'T WANT HER TO BE. 

Oh my god."
"This is purely my experience, your mileage may vary...

I was married to a man exactly like this for 11 years and have two amazing kids with him. His extra big, gargantuan, over the top personality wasn't the only negative issue in our marriage, but it absolutely did not help. At all. I know him and can say 100% that he is a kind and thoughtful person at heart. But, most people don't know that; all they see is someone who is odd and tries waaaaay too hard. His use of big words, which are frequently used incorrectly, is often interpreted as him being arrogant &amp; pretentious and he makes people extremely uncomfortable (which, of course, he doesn't recognize). However, I'm pretty sure that it's *really* based in insecurity. He's actually a naturally very intelligent guy, who got the very short end of the stick in his childhood and has been trying to compensate ever since. It is kind of sad that he didn't have the opportunity to get a real education, where he would have learned what all those words really mean. My friends and family tolerated him, but after we broke up, they all (one way or another) let me know what they really think of him. The reviews were not glowing.

We've been broken up for 13 years, but have remained amicable (which definitely comes in handy when dealing with stuff related to the kids). It's my observation that his obnoxious overcompensation has gotten even worse, as his ability to give even one small fuck about what other people think of him has completely left the building. With technology, it extends to social media, where he is the reigning king of posting incredibly obscure/random references, then wondering why people don't respond. So.Much.Cringe. Our kids, who are now both young adults, do love their dad, but now totally understand about the cringy thing. They limit their time with him and often find themselves apologizing to other people for his nature. Super sad.

So... your SO is not likely to change. In fact, if your experience is anything like mine, it'll only get worse. Really, the only thing you can do is to either decide to accept it or not. All I can say is...I do not miss having to deal with this dynamic every single day."
For example: she has a foot cast. She can fold clothes.

"Get used to paying for Gabrielle for the rest of your lives if you marry her. It sounds like she was raised by a household that expects others to care for them, and she's internalized that. Were she serious, she'd have taken her certification exam or gotten a job. Obviously Mia was able to do so, after all.

You need to decide where the line is, or resign yourself to this not getting better. There's bad circumstances, and there's learned helplessness. It sounds like Mia had the first but Gabrielle has the second. That's a tough, tough habit to break and you're giving her no reason to do so.

Edit: Also, why in the world did you give Mia her rent money back??"

Not ""psychotic"" but also definitely not romantic.  I'd think it was weird. You've only been dating three months. And he's married. And he's not leaving his wife (sorry for being blunt).

"I was also coming here to suggest making fun of the dad or being a nag about it, but the line ""he doesn't like me"" made me think that maybe this might lead to an angry abusive dad, so maybe OP would know best whether this is likely to work."

"Ok that is bs.  I live on a farm and raise livestock. I am in an area with severe wildfires.  Whole communities are coming together on Facebook and so forth, valiantly offering their time, services, transportation, and farms for free to those with livestock who must evacuate.  Those with livestock are desperate to get them out and keep them safe.  I have evacuation plans in place for mine if we should have to leave, and have offered my own farm to others.

I raise them to eat, but I would never, never abandon them to a fire.  I took on the responsibility of raising them and it is my responsibility to not let them suffer and die in an awful natural disaster.  I care, and from the wonderful communities I've seen come together to save the helpless animals, the vast majority of livestock owners also care.

These people are just heartless. "
"Rather, every single word of this reply is an argument for why you *should* block him again. And forever. "
"I don't know where people are getting the impression that this guy doesn't know what he's eating from. OP doesn't know what he's eating because she's not interested in his hobby. But everything she does say suggests that the guy knows how to identify mushrooms with reasonable accuracy. I agree that he shouldn't be eating or feeding his child unidentified mushrooms, but that does not appear to be what's happening here."
"&gt; Are there any other problems he is facing?

You mean besides how his wife feels about him?"
"I expect he'll move back in with his parents and they'll be responsible for him until he finds someone else. Either way, not my concern anymore!"
"&gt; I think we have a different definition of cool. 

OP, geez. Most people use the word ""cool,"" to loosely describe things they find attractive or positive. If you don't live under a rock, this should not be a surprise to you. When you describe someone or something as cool you're putting your stamp of approval on it, and saying something is ""uncool,"" means you disapprove or dislike it. 

So, with that colloquial definition in mind, you can obviously see the problem in describing your ex as cool and current SO as uncool. Not to mention the obvious problem with comparing your SO to your ex in any sense, anyway.

God I'm trying not to be snarky but I gotta say, it's been a while since we had such a clueless poster here lol"
Definitely - it massively raises your risk of cervical and ovarian cancers.

"No, he's conditioned you not to think so. 

You were in a rough situation, and you are emotionally fragile due to your past trauma and lack of support. He is a predator- he took advantage of your weakness and need and made you his housekeeper, nanny and sex toy.

" Two nights per week at home with you is plenty. Have you been ""supporting"" her and spending two nights per week out with her and her friends despite the fact that you don't like it?

Right?! I'm a woman and only one of two in the whole office and neither of us act this way. It would be completely unprofessional and really off-putting.

The way his wife is acting is bizarre and I wouldn't be shocked to find out she's dating someone in the office, to be honest."
GET OUT. He could ambush and kill you tomorrow. Ask your closest friend at work for help and collect your child and GET THE FUCK OUT.

"Wait a free for all?
Thats nuts.

So you and your boyfriend load up on the easy stuff like unloading the dishwasher and she's supposed to take out the garbage or mop after you guys and not being home? Cuz I would also not want to clean up after my roommates and not being home for days at a time. I'm sure this isn't exactly what is happening, but it probably feels like it to her.

I think you guys need to talk about it again, and come up with a schedule"
"&gt; . However, as a male, I can say that I err on the side of practicality more often than not.

Oh totally, us silly women are incapable of being practical.

Or, maybe your girlfriend just wants to feel like you give a shit about her family. Crazy females, amirite?"
"That was the sad part about reading everything that OP listed. It's like he ticks off every box for alcohol addiction:

* Extreme irritability 
* Prioritizing drinking over other activities/responsibilities
* Excessive consumption (more than 14 drinks a week)
* Wanting to drink first thing in the morning (watching the clock to drink at an ""acceptable"" time of 11 AM)

Unfortunately, OP you will need to find a way for him to get help because this will only get worse. If he won't listen to you about seeing a doctor or other professional, is there anyone in his life that he might listen to? I'd try to come at it from an angle of concern, and express that you're worried about the amount he is drinking and the negative impact it has on his long term health. Stress the importance of him staying healthy for you and your child, in addition to the need for him to be alert and able to perform some of his responsibilities.  "

"Why not compromise and bring the cat's bed into the bedroom with you? He may not like he's bed now but he might like it better if it was in with you. That way he can sleep near you guys. Does your cat do anything to keep you or him awake at night? 

I can see why your boyfriend might not like it if he isn't used to cats. Cats can be annoying (I have always owned a cat) when it's night time.  "

"I worked at Costco 15 years ago...I'm sure I sold many bulk packages of condoms in my 5 years on cash...but I'll never forget one particular guy buying them.  He had his three children with him that were all under 4 years old.  I remember thinking, ""when do you have time to use all of these before the expiry?""  It wasn't judgement...I was impressed with the relationship him and his wife must have.  Because a Costco pack of condoms is a lot of f-ing condoms...that's commitment.  "
"It sucks. I was on strong anti-seizure medication between ages 22 and 28. Terrible age not to be allowed drinking, and it feels life is unfair and everyone else is having time of their lives. But I did eventually manage to find plenty of fun stuff to do, including hiking club, various sports, movie club, board games etc. Turns out young people do so much more other than just getting drunk in bars and clubs, who would have thought! And now I'm off medications and can drink again and I do and enjoy it, but I feel I have a lot more choice with what to do with my free time, and have made a much wider group of friends as well. I suggest instead of framing it as ""you need to stop drinking"" (which for her currently equates you telling her she needs to stop having fun), approach it as a positive development ""let's try something new fun to do"" (according to her interest etc). She may be more open to positive suggestions rather than bans. Good luck, you are a good person for wanting to help her. "
"Can confirm. I hate kids, but holy shit I would not ban my brother from coming to visit and bring the kids. I would suck it up and fucking deal with it as best I can.

The SIL sounds like a spoiled douchebag and I'd run her over with a truckload of kids.

I don't get why the grandparents and her husband cares that much about the sisters feelings.

If she would stop talking to the family over her brothers kids coming to visit without her wanting to then she don't deserve to be a part of the family to begin with.

Good riddance in that case. Not like the brother and sister are going to have any contact anyways until the kids are 15+ years old and the grandparents probably don't have many years to spare, waiting for the sister to gtfo.
"
"You're trying to argue rationality/irrationality in an emotional situation. Your GF is *scared*. People died outside her house and she doesn't feel safe. That is not a point that can be argued, it's an emotion. It's not rational or logical. 

Stop trying to get proof that you're ""right"". It's not the point. What you should do is talk to your gf, without judgement, about what will make her feel safe. If that is moving back to Canada, then that's what she feels. Rational or not, she can decide where to live based on any criteria she wants. She should feel safe in the place she would raise her kids. 

There is probably a middle ground, and this may pass, but you need to stop trying to force her to see it your way based on your experiences. It won't happen. "
"A lot of this feels very uncomfortable.

1. Six months in, she starts training your kid to call her ""mama""
2. The social media references to your son as ""hers"" and establishing with her coworkers as her son.
3. She knows you're uncomfortable with it but defends her stance of ""its natural"". She gets upset when you reassert the boundary.
4. Is living with you in a temporary circumstance but is already pushing to stay longer
5. Picked your son up from daycare, went dark for a couple of hours, and came back like nothing was wrong. 

She has steamrolled over a lot of boundaries and yeah, is trying to force this cookie cutter situation where she's now family. This relationship needs a step back and you need to talk to her a lot. Make it 100% clear this is unacceptable and have her leave. It was only a temporary stay and she's overstayed. Cut down on the amount of time she spends with your son cause that grooming shit does not fly. Whether your leave the relationship or not is up to you but I highly recommend ending it if she stomps over your boundaries again."
Is she getting treated for the bipolar?
I stand by my comment 100 percent. That is not how you act towards someone you love that has been involved in an unfortunate accident. The poor guy probably felt terrible already unless he's some kind of heartless sociopath yet you still felt the need to treat him like some kind of criminal.
"Sounds like this might be a ""straw that broke the camel's back"" situation that's complicated by the fact that you happen to be right about this one.

Do you often criticize her food? I'm not blaming you--just trying to understand what's going on. Does she often make this kind of crazy thing, and if so does it often taste bad? Does she *feel* like you often criticize her food, or was she just embarrassed?"
"Honestly I would ask her to create a dress code then 

When you mentioned that your boss said that dress codes create a ""grey area"" it really stood out to me because they actually do the opposite.   Saying ""dress nicer"" is extremely vague and could mean practically anything.  She really needs to be explicit in her expectations so you can tell her if they are reasonable or not. "

"Your MIL needs to be on an information diet.  I suspect that she has undermined your parenting even more than you realize.

Wife needs to tell MIL and SIL that an invitation is not a summons, and that your family's attendance at the cabin is not to be negotiated.  Then she probably needs to turn off her phone.

I don't know how old your kids are, OP.  I applaud your desire to make them more independent.  I think that you need to double check your state's laws on leaving children alone, however, just in case MIL decides to play hardball and call CPS."

"&gt;I don't make him as angry as often as I used to,  I'm better able to diffuse conflict. etc.

Admittedly, I'm reading between the lines here, but I think she might mean that there has been physical abuse off and on. 

OP, I found this list at Love is Respect (please google it):

&gt;There are many behaviors that qualify as emotional or verbal abuse, including:

**Calling you names and putting you down.**

Yelling and screaming at you.

Intentionally embarrassing you in public.

Preventing you from seeing or talking with friends and family.

Telling you what to do and wear.

Damaging your property when they’re angry (throwing objects, punching walls, kicking doors, etc.)

Using online communities or cell phones to control, intimidate or humiliate you.

**Blaming your actions for their abusive or unhealthy behavior.**

**Accusing you of cheating and often being jealous of your outside relationships.**

Stalking you.

Threatening to commit suicide to keep you from breaking up with them.

Threatening to harm you, your pet or people you care about.

**Using gaslighting techniques to confuse or manipulate you.**

Making you feel guilty or immature when you don’t consent to sexual activity.

Threatening to expose your secrets such as your sexual orientation or immigration status.

Starting rumors about you.

Threatening to have your children taken away.

Your boyfriend doesn't really think you've cheated. He just wants you in this hopeless state, where you'll do anything to please him and shrink yourself and your needs more and more and more until you're nothing. He's trying to take your integrity and your right to tell the truth away. You have to leave him."
"*In them*, yeah. I  think he should make an effort to wear other underwear if/when he's hoping to have sex. Otherwise? She's being unreasonable if she expects him to never wear them. That'd be like OP demanding she only ever wear push-up bras, because he doesn't like her in anything else. "
"&gt;How can I regain the old her?

You most likely can't, and that shouldn't even be your goal or focus

Edit: to clarify, you sound INCREDIBLY entitled and selfish across everything you've written, from how you pressured your wife, to how you prioritized you wants over hers, to how you dismissed her extreeeemely valid concerns and her health history, to how you reacted during her labor process, to how *you're* feeling about her reactions to her horrific trauma and now irreversible life decision. The fact that you even had the gall  to mention that she hasn't been interested in sex yet (even with your little ""I guess that's normal"" caveat) is just....unreal. So *you* ""getting"" ""your"" wife back is irrelevant, and the fact that that is how you're conceptualizing this situation should make you stop and really look at what kind of person you are.

Idk about advice. Apologize to her, maybe?"

His comfort with the current setup may be all well and good but what do *you* really want OP?
"I'm sorry about your mother and the grief your family must be feeling, but your family was way out of line. You are asking her to wear your recently-deceased mother's ring from a marriage that ended in divorce twenty years ago for the rest of her life as a symbol of her and C's relationship. You are essentially asking her to memorialize your mother in her marriage forever. If I were J, I would have a hard time separating the ring from the memory of the original owner and her untimely death, especially since every time one of the aunts sees it, they will likely talk about how much your mother loved that ring. Hell, I'm not one for flashy rings and would have been fine had my husband proposed to me with a plain band, but even I would have had trouble accepting a ring with that kind of history, regardless of how beautiful the ring might be. 

&gt;Our family feel like J's actions are completely unacceptable and we are wary about what this means for their relationship. 

If this is the sole red flag (and I assume it is since you don't mention any other red-flag behavior in your post or comments and you say that you are actually somewhat friendly with J), I don't think it means anything for the future of their marriage, unless your family continues to treat her like a pariah for a very reasonable boundary with regard to the jewelry *J will wear for the rest of her life.* If C takes J's side and your aunts continue to stonewall her, then J won't be the reason for any fracture in your family. That will be all on the aunts.

&gt;Who rejects the ring they were proposed to with? Especially an heirloom from the groom-to-be's dead mother?

If she rejected the ring because not receiving a 2-carat flawless diamond ring is a dealbreaker for her, cost be damned, then you might have a point. However, this ring is already fraught with a very emotionally-charged history. She's not wrong for wanting a different ring that reminds her and other people of the marriage between her and your brother. 

&gt;C is completely enamored with J, so I'm thinking I will have to handle things very delicately when I speak to him about getting Mom's ring from J. Or should I be more direct about all of our feelings regarding J and this situation? 

You don't talk to him about your feelings about J, unless you want to drive a wedge between C and the rest of your family. (If he has any backbone at all, he will take J's side.) You can ask nicely for the ring without any commentary on their engagement. Something like: ""Would it be okay if I could have Mom's ring?"" "
"&gt;Imagine your little girl twenty years from now in a relationship exactly like this because you taught her that this is how she deserves to be treated.

This alone is why the OP needs to get out. The OP needs to be better than her own mother and draw a line in the sand and want more for herself and her daughter."
"You're not trustworthy

"I went up to 160lbs at 5'5 in two years (after being a very fit 130lbs), so probably the exact same as her. I lost the weight and I work out daily.

Honestly? I would have preferred if my husband -straight out- told me that he found it unattractive and would like me to lose weight. He didn't, although I could tell he felt the same as you. That's me though, I feel that his need for physical attraction is valid in that way (just like how I would feel if he decided to go quit his job... financial security is important to me).

If she does NOT care about how she looks, likes how she looks, and does not wish to lose the weight, then you have to consider if that is the quality in a wife that you want (fine for some, not others). 

Just IMO but if you can't control your weight before getting married and having kids... good luck. It is much harder after."

The picture of Lily in her uniform already has tens of comments and like 50 likes. Even though she has basically all of my friends on social media, my friends don't post on her pictures of Lily, and a few have made some private comments to me ""Man Tammy posts a lot"". I don't blame them, I don't care about kids outside of my family either. "
"You're not an asshole, OP. I think most reasonable people would understand why a 23 year old, who has lost both his parents, would become tearful at an emotional speech given by a bride about her love for her parents on her wedding day. You weren't expecting this speech and didn't set out to make a scene. Grief is a weird thing that comes in waves, which can strike at the most inopportune times and can hit just as hard years down the line as it did in the first few hours of a loved one's passing.

Having said that, I can understand why Megan is upset. As others have already said, you stole her thunder (albeit unintentionally) and while I don't think you ruined her wedding, she's disappointed at the fact her carefully planned speech was cut short due to your reaction. To accuse you of ""sulking"" I think is a bit unfair as it implies that she thinks you did this deliberately, but her emotions are still raw and I think you need to reach out by way of an apology, which will hopefully help clear the air between you."
"Wtf? your friends are openly disrespecting your girlfriend, pretty much labelling her as ""the stand-in"" in yours and your friends grand will they-won't they love story, and what are you doing about this?

"This is one of those times mediation won't be possible. Convincing Emily she's being horrible won't be possible. Convincing Adam his fiance is horrible won't be possible. The only part that might work is supporting your mother in setting boundaries with Adam to try to avoid further hurt. 

If I were you, I'd have one last conversation with Adam and Emily - lay it all out: the way you treat our house, our mother, and her belongings, is entirely rude. The way you turn yourself into a victim is delusional. The entitlement you have about this wedding funding is outrageous. You are in the wrong, and I am no longer willing to pretend that you aren't for the sake of not making waves. 

Then you talk to your mother - Mom I think letting Adam and his fiance stomp on you and your house when you've been supporting him and paying for college is absurd. You need to set firmer boundaries and you sadly need to be willing to let Adam learn the hard way.

Your mother needs to have a conversation with Adam - Son I love you, but you've brought a person into our home who among other things violates my personal property and then calls herself the victim. I believe she will make you unhappy but I will no longer allow her to make me unhappy. If you need to learn this lesson the hard way, I will be here when the lesson is over."
I would also ask r/legaladvice just to cover your butts if you decide to let her go. Keep in mind that a toxic employee has quite a detrimental effect on coworkers ('why does SHE get paid so much to come in late and hungover?'). I wouldn't put off dealing with this. Good luck

"That might not be a solution at this point. Depending on where they're rooming, the rooms could all be booked up. Especially if they're staying at the convention hotel, which it wouldn't surprise me if they are. Cosplay can be a bitch to get around in. Have you seen the crazy shit people make?"

"Not only this, but it was a matter of time till he called the new GF mama. I am helping raise my niece and just recently she started calling me daddy(because her dad has only seen her a handful of times). It's super wrong to be encouraging it though.

"For someone who seems to be so devoted to the sanctity of marriage, you're kind of throwing the towel in pretty damn early.

You've been together 8 years- she felt comfortable enough to tell you her fantasy  and your response was to call a lawyer.

Obviously her attempts at reconciliation is showing you that this threesome thing was simply a way to spice up your love life and that when it comes down to you or her fantasy, she would chose you every time.

Therefore- it is *her* who is staying faithful to your marriage vows and you are not."

"You know you're playing with fire - you can be her friend all you want, but don't treat her like a pseudo-girlfriend when she's still dating someone else and then get annoyed if she doesn't want to date you."
"I'm pretty similar to you in a lot of ways, but I'm also several years older. What happens in your 20s and 30s is that your friends get more and more wrapped up in their own lives and it's harder and harder to find someone who can come hang out. I got really, really dangerously depressed when this started to happen, so I think it's really important that you're working on this now.

So, what helped me? The biggest thing was just starting to do things on my own that I would normally do with someone else. It felt weird and uncomfortable at first, but for me I learned that it's not that I can only enjoy a museum if I go with a friend, it's that the experience of going to a museum is different when you're alone. It's enjoyable, but in a quieter way. 

The reality is you're never going to avoid the feeling of being alone. Even if you have a million friends, there will always be that one fluke evening where nobody's available. So start doing the stuff you want to do, but do it alone and see how it feels. Keep trying it until the uncomfortable aspect passes and you actually start to appreciate those times. Learn to have that quiet appreciation of your time alone at home, too. You can't avoid loneliness, and knowing how to be comfortable with being alone is an important life skill that can be developed. Give your therapist's advice a real try, for weeks or months, and see how that changes things for you.

The other thing that stood out to me is that you've lost friends and relationships due to being clingy and needy. This is going to cause you serious problems as you start to grow out of your early 20s. You'll find that being the life of the party at some point stops being enough to sustain friendships. You're not respecting other people's boundaries and needs, and that's a problem. Work on your social skills, especially your compassion and boundaries. Practice spending time quietly with a friend one-on-one, just talking instead of doing an activity.

What I found, and what I suspect you'll find, is that the issue wasn't really about needing to be around people. In fact, I wasn't even really connecting with them. Instead, it was about wanting to avoid my own thoughts and feelings, because they were scary and uncomfortable. It took me a long time to start confronting those things, to start learning how to connect with people instead of just spending time together, to be alone without frantically looking for someone else to fill that moment. When I did, though, I started to become a better person with deeper friendships, calmer and better able to handle whatever life threw at me, comfortable feeling difficult things, and loneliness suddenly didn't feel so scary and overwhelming."
"You need to learn very quickly what happens to hormonal teenagers who ""just need affection"".

This. A fucking STRIP CLUB on Mother's Day?! How fuckin' disrespectful can you get? I'd be out of there in a heartbeat. That's 100% unacceptable.
"Your fiance almost certainly will not be spending much time with her at the wedding. He'll be eating with you, dancing mostly with you, and walking around to talk with all the tables with you. I didn't spend more than 2 minutes with any one person at my reception, other than my husband.

How much time does he spend with her now? Are they friends, or is she just his friend's wife?"

"Any reason to believe she could be into you? Maybe she's actually jealous of V, not you? 

Have you had serious boyfriends before? If so, would she get a little distant or always have an ""opinion"" about them? Even if not to this extent. Maybe now that you guys are older, she sees this boyfriend as a real threat &amp; could ""lose you forever"" compared to young teenage boyfriends?"
She thinks you find her attractive because you are sleeping with her. You don't and are keeping it to yourself so easy sex doesn't go away. That's leading her on too.
"What really irks me is that if a woman was going through the same situation, commenters would say she has the right to make a CHOICE on who she continues to see or ends it. But nooooooooo. If it's a man, then he has to just accept her past and deal and accept it. What BS!! Complete and utter double standard! Her values on sex do not match his, enough said. BF needs to end it and find a woman who better matches his beliefs."
"I would be concerned that she doesn't feel like you're going to want to stay around as ""dad"" now that her mom isn't around, and is trying to secure you in her life via whatever means she has available.  If it is, taking actions to ensure that she knows she'll still be your daughter even when she's 48 and you're 71 may help.  It could be something like planning father-daughter events for some sort of milestone, like ""let's go see [the grand canyon/nyc/some other cool place that isn't primarily a romantic holiday destination you both want to visit] when you graduate college"", making comments about her visiting you in a nursing home.

&gt; I've spoken to her many times about grieving our loss but these conversations don't seem to solve the problem.

Have any of those conversations explicitly addressed the ""I'm sure you don't mean it that way, but the ways in which you interact with me lately are ones I associate with a romantic partner, not a daughter"" issue?"

"""Hey, so I just wanted to give you a heads up that I'm a having a party here soon, but I wanted to talk to you first. I would appreciate it if your boyfriend didn't attend, and I would be completely understanding if you didn't want to come after hearing this. I just feel like the guy has been giving me aggressive signals, and I just want to avoid any drama and have a good time. You are more than welcome to come, but it is my party and I hope you can respect and understand where I'm coming from."""
"&gt;I asked why he was doing that, and he said that the last shirt had come out fine, and that I was overly worried about the clothes.

This is the red flag here -- you handled him washing it by accident when it was your fault it was mixed in (and expecting him to care about delicates isn't reasonable).  So you made a SEPARATE BIN.  You accommodated him, took on washing them yourself.

He then belittled you.  THat's a serious problem.  It's similar to the cleanser issue -- he's got a huge streak of 'you are not the boss of me' which is negative relationship behavior. 

Any person who tells you a well formed and honest requests is you 'overreacting' is a selfish and cowardly person unwilling to care about YOU and YOUR NEEDS.

His fit over the laundry, claiming you were being controlling because it was your apartment is pathetically immature -- you two would deal with laundry no matter where you live!

It's time to sit him down and talk about *general relationship behaviors -- GOOD and his negative ones*.  Always, always start with the good.  Then using I statements express how you feel when he says YOU are overreacting (hint: he's using a YOU statement...).

"
"A few things.


* Your friends are awful people. They showed their true colors and how they continue to support this guy who is filming women without their consent (there are women who would totally consent and often times especially when their face isnt shown!) 

* You should tell Jen. If my friend knew something like this about me, I would want them to tell me for my own safety. For all you know, Francis could be continuing to record more of his sessions with Jen. 


* Hacking is illegal and depending on where you live, could have serious consequences. Francis could use it against you, so keep that in mind."
"&gt;Is this something worth bringing up with him, or is this something that's probably not going to change? 

Definitely worth bringing up to him especially if he wasn't really like this before. If everything besides this is great and you want to be with him, then you should tell him that it is affecting your relationship and your desire to bring him around social situations.

""Look, BF, I love you and think you are an amazing, smart person. But you know it's excessive to talk this way and even though you're using big words, it can come off as very unnecessary to others, including myself. Do you think this is something you can work on? I love our relationship otherwise and hope you can consider working on this before it starts affecting us in a major way."" "
You should be shutting them down even when she is not around
"Speaking of first responders- Op's family pisses me off. These kind of people pull this shit, then put responders' lives in jeopardy to come and save their dumb asses. If you have a way to evacuate and you won't, fuck you."
"OP you're on a crash course for a possibly irreconcilable problem if this keeps up, and it really has nothing to do with the sex and pregnancy -- it has to do with the fact that you're not on the same page about the life you're building together on a practical level. Namely, how many kids you want to have and how you're going to support a growing household. It's already making you anxious and it's only going to get worse. Now, it may be all well and good for your wife to lay down the law where family planning is concerned, but you are still a family, and you still need a plan -- besides crossing your fingers and hoping for the best.

*That's* the conversation you need to have with your wife."
Unbelted passengers pose a substantial risk to belted passengers as well - they become projectiles in an accident. 
"Let me get this straight: You didn't tell him not to dangle your son out over a rock, but when it went wrong you're happy to blame him 100% and call him names?  And then scream at him so much that he has to leave per the staff?  

Maybe next time, help your husband to not be so reckless, and when there is an accident keep your shit together somewhat instead of driving him away.  

Not to defend him vanishing, but you have to take ownership of your part in the whole thing.  Bad things happen, but you need to act like a partner if you want to have a partner."
I'm sorry but I don't think she's trying to keep the peace. I think she's  100% encouraging that type of behavior because she likes it. I think OP should pay attention to how the other women in the office act. Are they ALL super flirty? I doubt it.
"Of course he called it petty, if he insulted it, you would feel bad about it and not do it, and therefore he would be guilt free."
"&gt; I just hope my mom isn't going to ask me to take more of the kids.

It really doesn't matter if she asks you to take more of the kids. They're not your siblings, your only responsibility is to your own sister. Those kids are on their own. Sorry if it's harsh, but that's life. For the love of God please tell her no if she tries to pawn them off on you."
"Well worth the investment. They're fantastic, don't skimp, and don't run it in a common space. Garage or shed is fine, the heat will keep it sanitary. You can also make beef jerky and your own 'sun dried' tomatoes (with way less salt!). 
But mostly it will reduce those mushrooms to a bunch of drawers of shredded bagged mushroom, which you can encourage him to trade. 

Heck, there are chefs out there that would pay top dollar for a fridge full of those mushrooms. If you can find a local proper chef, they might have a mushroom broker. No kidding, make money off it. "
"Tell your manager about her, and have them contact police if she comes to work."
"&gt; I'm a shy, nervous mess IRL. Which is endearing at 22, but not exactly a desirable trait in a mate at 30

Have you considered that you are still a ""shy, nervous mess"" 8 years later because this relationship isn't good for you and you aren't growing as a person? 

A supportive, loving, strong relationship can form a bedrock for self-confidence and emotional security. A partner who doesn't build you up and only brings you down will hurt you in more than the obvious ways, for one, stunting your emotional growth and leaving you medicating yourself to deal with the issues the relationship is causing. You are still the same insecure 22 year old you were when you entered this relationship. Do you want to be the same at 40? 50? Can you imagine what it would be like if you broke up, spent the next year picking up hobbies and socializing, met someone amazing who tells you he loves you in an appropriate time frame, cheerleads your burgeoning career, doesn't make you feel less than for not making as much money as he does, and actually wants to marry you ASAP? You could have an amazing marriage with 2 kids by the time you are 35! "
"Whoa whoa - you sort of glossed over the cheating part. That's a big red flag, that he just started dating someone else behind your back. The financial/career stuff can happen to anyone, and I think does deserve patience from a partner while it works itself out. But it seems this guy has other issues with your dynamic, and that's troubling."

"I can only assume they think it's just going to be like riding out a rough storm – bundling up on the sofa and watching the rain on the window, reading by candlelight, playing boardgames until it all blows over... when in reality they'll probably be trying to avoid flying glass and debris when the windows are blown out, and scrambling to the upper floors (assuming they have upper floors) to get away from the flood waters. And then being trapped there with no power or services, likely in a home that's flooded with waste water, for *days* at least, while the city recovers. That's assuming of course that the house isn't destroyed completely."
"The way your mother responded to your brother is not normal. His reaction makes me worry there is some kind of emotional incest going on, and it might have been rooted in jealousy. I would do your best to put some distance between you and your family when it comes to discussions of intimacy because a very abstract conversation turned into a big ordeal that they shouldn't have involved you with. "
"OP, I was the mom who never left her kids for a moment....no-one was ever good enough to look after them, because no-one was as neurotic as I was. Not saying you are neurotic at ALL, but it's an easy slope to slither down when you have tiny ones.
Please make sure you BOTH have time off and also COUPLE time - date night, or just coffee and a cake out together. Make the time, make it happen. Can't stress this enough.  It might feel weird and artificial but just do it, trust me.  You need to stay connected and remember why you made the baby in the first place - because you are each other's person, not resentful housemates.  I wish I had done so many things differently -  although my kids are grown up now and utterly lovely people, much was lost along the way.  

Good luck with everything, and  enjoy your new family together. "
"Sex can often put people in a vulnerable position with their partners which is why trust is so important. When you make a person's identity or sexuality a punchline, that seriously damages the ability to trust and feel safe with you. Emasculating him because you felt entitled to sex is a toxic thing to do to someone. You think you're joking, but this is called ""negging"" and it's an emotional abuse tactic.

You were dumped. Ending a relationship doesn't require your agreement, it's not an armistice treaty."
"Childbirth is a process where you're about as physically and emotionally bare as most people ever get.  You're entitled to not want your husband there. 

My advice:  When you go into labor, don't tell ANYONE who might tell your husband, or others, or might post to social media.  You want a complete lock-down on any information regarding your labor until after you've given birth and are feeling up to having visitors.

You can, and should ask the hospital staff to help give you privacy during your childbirth process.  The hospital staff shouldn't release your information, but it would be reasonable of you to have some conversations to ensure your privacy.  The staff won't allow anyone that you tell them isn't permitted  in the delivery room.  But you may also be able to put a complete lock on any information regarding your stay.  (For instance, you don't want him calling the hospital and asking if you're in the delivery room there.)

"Honestly, since you've already been and gone, I'd lie. ""Oh my gosh, I'd only just arrived at your house and have been called off because disaster at work/a water leak in my flat/bf has food poisoning/whatever""

Then I'd spend some time writing down a list of the ways you feel comfortable interacting with your family. It might help to have a do and don't list to help you not get pressured into these things. I'd also look into therapy because it sounds like you've been severely abused, and to some extent still are. You deserve to feel safe, and if that's only achieved by distancing yourself from your family then that's OK. Hugs"
"Say no. Be polite but firm. End phone calls from the pastor promptly, and don't go to the church. You don't have to explain why, but you could say that you're not comfortable or not interested. Just don't do it?"
"I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that OP already lied to his girlfriend about having used protection and that's why he doesn't want to fess up to having gotten VD. In any event, he's most likely already given it to her, so you need to be absolutely honest, OP. 

Edit: She's also going to see right through your lie OP, because it makes no sense for you to all of a sudden realize you should get tested 8 or 9 months *after* you stopped being a man about town. And once she realizes that you lied, she's going to be more inclined to think you maybe never stopped being a man about town...  "
I think you should tell your hubby if you haven't already. It's something your husband I personally feel should take care of.
"Do you think her parents are going to be willing to pay for a $40,000 wedding if and when they find this out? Fake report cards? That isn't sane at all."

"Well...yeah, but what about the sister? It is something I want to do....at least I think....but, is it fair of me to bring that to his sister and I'm sure the rest of his family when she speaks to.them?

"I cringed right away reading this because it sounded like you were describing a relationship I had that came way too close to ending in marriage. 

Yes, divorce will have complicated logistics. Yes, it will hurt. Yes, you will doubt yourself. 

But then you will both be free to find someone you can both love and be best friends with. You're both young and have no kids so this is the best possible time to end things. "
I know it can definitely come across as hostile or mean- but I really think the guy just wants some alone time. Idk if I read it I'd think well crap I must be smothering him how can I correct that

"My wife, who is going through one of the most difficult years of her life, sleeps with two teddy bears, and has a third one for hugging when she is emotionally overwhelmed.  Not to mention the 6'5"" giant teddy bear which she can't really hold (more like it holds her).  She is a strong and mature woman, but needs that emotional tether to her childhood and safety/security/comfort.  

There is absolutely nothing wrong about you keeping the bear, especially is it helps you sleep/study/concentrate.  Getting rid of your teddy likely will not help your funk, and will probably make it worse.  It's a coping mechanicanism; one that is helping you deal with your current mental situation.  I would seek out a therapist for your issues, not give up the bear.  "

"You kind of have to get divorced. He was comfortable lying to you, and letting you doubt your own sanity, for *years*. Even now, he's thinking of how he will be impacted, not thinking of what's best for the baby.

He's lost any moral right to be a part of your family. You can give him some access to the child if you want, and if you're certain that he can have the child's best interests at heart. But as for a relationship with you - you will never be able to trust him, and as such, you will never find happiness with him again."

"&gt; All my relationships were extremely passionate and I'm a passionate person by nature. 

Can you elaborate what you mean by passionate? Some people use passionate to describe being very loving and expressive with their love. Others use it as a nice way to describe extreme mood swings and frequent loud arguments. 

I don't mean to grasp at straws, but for all four relationships to end with broken engagements, something's going on. 

Did you get the impression that any/all of these guys proposed to you because they really wanted to be married to you? Or were there other reasons (ie, family pressure, you were putting pressure on them, they felt it was the ""logical next step"", social group pressure/keeping up with the Joneses, etc.) How old were they all at the time of proposing?"

"I think this a valid thing to be disappointed in him for. 

The key thing for me about porn, is it should be consensual. The people making porn know what they are doing and for what purpose they putting out those images. (If porn is created without the consent of everyone being photographed/filmed, that is not okay and no one is justified in watching it.)

What he's doing with this women's photos is an invasion, and your concern that this behavior is in some sense of continuation of an existing relationship with them is totally valid. 

Your boyfriend is making shitty choices and you're right to be concerned about his lack of judgment and lousy boundaries. 

And fantasizing about threesomes doesn't require his exes IG accounts—I'd seriously be a bit suspicious he was just throwing out the ""Well, I was thinking about threesome *with you*."" to try and make it seem less shitty than what he was actually doing, which was using his exes photos to jack off too."
Yep. Little sister is expected to share a room with two non-familial boys on the cusp of puberty. Not a good situation.

"How do you handle this? Get yourself into counselling. Not just ""anger"" issues but power and control issues. 

You have been controlling her and using her anxiety as an excuse to do it. How you handle this is accepting that you may not be able to save the relationship and that it's not your choice. Even knowing that, you still go to counselling and be honest with your counsellor. Find one who specialises in power/control issues.

He has dismissed them because he is valuing what he wants more than your concerns or wants.

She is also 12 and I'm 22, so probably not much risk of me having to choose between her and my own newborn child. 

I would ask your regular vet about Satan Cat. Maybe you and your husband can bring it in and be like ""is this a good animal to have in a tiny high rise flat with a newborn? :)"" and see what they tell you. He might be more convinced if it's coming from an expert. If you start rehoming now, there's way more chance someone will want it before the baby comes!"

"Oof. Well, that sounds like your brother has a pretty textbook Madonna/whore complex. Mom was in the ""pure"" category and now, in your brother's mind, she might not be. But for crying out loud, your brother shouldn't even be thinking about his mom that way so much and she shouldn't be encouraging it.

I would talk to your mom and give one last explanation - that it was a mild joke you had no idea would blow up like this - apologize, and then leave it be. I think whatever's going on with your bro and mom is above a lot of people's pay grades."
"Here's how this dynamic works out in middle school kids.  She's a new kid.  The existing social hierarchy in that class is already set, and she needs to find her place in the pecking order.  Now, if the bullies pick on her for a really obvious reason, and she does not respond immediately with confidence (and she didn't), she becomes a target.  This means that being friends with her is now dangerous for low to mid-status kids, since the bullies would turn on them too (Look, she's friends with the r******!).  That means that a substantial portion of the class won't risk being friends with her.  Depending on how strongly targeted she is, and how afraid the rest of the class is, she may find herself completely isolated and ostracized, which can break an adult, let alone a 12 year old.  By the time someone is that kind of target, there's basically no way for them to get back to any sort of normal social functioning.  

I was ""that kid"" as a 12 year old.  I got those platitudes too.  Didn't help me any.  I was still ostracized, spending my day in constant fear and on high alert, and dealing with suicidal thoughts daily.  The grownups who told me all those wonderful platitudes wouldn't have lasted a week dealing with what I dealt with.  It took me decades to recover.  

What I'd tell OP's kid, instead of platitudes, is how middle-school social dynamics work and how the bullying dynamic works, and coach her in some responses she could make to the bullies.  But I'd also take away the giant ""Kick Me"" sign.  It would take a really confident kid to overcome that sort of disadvantage, and OP's kid isn't.  "
If you like the male attention but not female than it is sexual. Figure out why that's where you're putting your self worth with therapy 
"I had this whole thing in my head about how she's probably stressed out that her child is in pain and suffering and is likely in denial that Yes it is that bad so she's trying to pretend that you're just lazy and ungrateful so she doesn't have to accept the reality of your situation but all I can say is if anyone had tried to force-feed me french fries while I was still recovering from having a piece of metal cut out of me and then decided to lean on my incision, I'd likely put them on the ground once I'd been cleared for physical activity.

Also the magic button was the business. 

I think what you need to do is bring your dad in on this. Does he understand your recovery process fairly well?"
My first thought was 4 before I got to the bottom of the post and realized OP was worred about 3. 
"I think this is the best description of what's going on here. Yeah, OP was probably a bit awkward and hovered a bit too long and I could see someone's reaction being ""...ok"" to that. But the melodramatic 'omg I don't feel safe' reaction is way over the top. "
"What a surprise, someone who didn't want a dog still doesn't want a dog.

All I will say is that this is a lesson for you in being self aware and standing your ground when it comes to major lifestyle changes. You were a pushover and let yourself be talked into something you knew you didn't want, and now you've ended up here.

If you don't want the dog, give it away. Don't spend your life in misery because you feel guilty. Try to find her another home or surrender her to a no kill shelter."
"well to be fair, OP had known him for a year and a half and had been dating him - happily - for five months. she had no reason to think he would be such a jerk."
"This kind of comment is what I was looking for!

OP, this does NOT sound like a happy or well adjusted man.  He's running around just spinning his wheels and getting no where in life.  Despite all these women he's slept with and despite all his bravado, he is still stuck.  He needs to try to show off to you and try to put himself over you in a desperate attempt to feel like he's something.  He's not.

You, however, are something.  Maybe you don't see it right now, but you are.  Don't let him put you down.  You're taking the steps to be better.  You've traveled, you've got a new job, you're in therapy.  Guarantee that he's seeing some of this and comparing himself.  He's coming up short, and instead of trying to be better himself... he's trying to take your value from you.

Cut this man from your life.  He doesn't bring a thing to the table.  Focus on yourself for a while.  Healing doesn't happen overnight.  Be patient and kind to yourself.  You'll make it through this."
It's hilarious that they think they get so much say over your lives that *you* rearranging your lives to suit *their* preferences is a compromise. You need to shut these kinds of expectations down now.
"&gt;Yes he plays music for a living but that is irrelevant to him as a person, hes so sweet and caring and would do anything for me. As a person there is no one easier to like.

Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it almost sounds like even you look down on his profession a bit? Why do people need to like him in spite of his career? Why is it surprising that he's intelligent? Being a musician is badass. And the hard work and dedication required to get a band off the ground is admirable."
This is not a winnable argument. You can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. All this will do is cl broaden the fight into other topics until they see how fundamentally different they are to each other.
"Step 1:  Change the locks.

Step 2: Dump her."
"I did this. I announced our wedding and my colleagues started discussing divorces like three sentences later. They later complained about not being invited, so I told them they uninvited themselves right that moment. It shut them up completely and forever. 

Your girlfriend sounds fantastic. There are many beautiful women that do not want males to hit on them all the time, and learned to hide their beauty. 

Also: don't spend time with people who are so shallow that they can't like her for what she is to you. As if they are in the position to comment on her anyway.  Get some new friends. "
"You are talking about a max of 8 days a year where you do something you dislike but is really important you both your gf and her family. 8 days out of 365.

You call the cops if a minor has been kicked out of their home. You don't invite them alone into your bedroom for the night. 
The fact that English is not your first language is extremely relevant here. That should be in your OP. I think you go to your boyfriend and you tell him that you've looked into the definition of the word cool and you now understand it means something different than what you thought. If he's at all reasonable that should work.
"Be happy that is was a cheap lesson :) 

You cant trust your brother with money anymore, and from now on dont even give him the chance to get near 1$ of yours. If you keep letting him do this he will be buying a car with your money when you are on debts working full time and studying . Even worse in the future . 

Make him pay you those $700 and never trust him again with money or any material stuff as he will just proceed to abuse you "
"You think you love him, but real love cannot exist in the absence of respect for your partner.  What you feel is affection, comfort, and lust.  It's not fair to either of you to confuse these feelings."

"I've done a lot of reading about MLM schemes because a family member was once involved with one. They are scary. The ""negative hater"" thing is classic. They make money primarily by selling motivational material and conferences to the people they recruit as vendors. One of the big themes they promote to their victims is the idea that success is a matter of just mindless perseverance, and that anyone who points out how much money they have lost, how it's all a scam, etc. is a hater or a loser and they need to get those people out of their lives. 

She's a victim of a cult, not a small business owner. If she's deep enough in to be parroting the buzz words like ""hater"" she needs serious help from a psychologist who has experience with cults."
"&gt; I never would have let someone new in my life like that pick my child up from daycare.

If you trust someone enough to let them live in your house with unfettered access to your child, you should probably also trust them enough to pick the kid up from daycare. I personally think OP moved in with this woman too fast, but he did, so her ability to retrieve the child from daycare is neither here nor there. If she wanted to kidnap him, she could do it in the middle of the night from their shared house."

Obviously not.

Seriously though, sounds like she's attracted to him as well. And of course she's going to say no to you.

You need to have that hard discussion with her. It may even end your friendship. But from the looks of it, if this continues, it may end anyway.

Good luck."
"&gt; She had fallen asleep in the couch in the common room, so I stood around to see if she needed any help like me tucking her in.

For future reference, this is **not** something you should do for a near-stranger, i.e. a new roommate. Reserve that for romantic partners, close friends, and family. I don't know if it's your phrasing or what, but this just seems really creepy. She was asleep. Why were you ""standing around""? Why would she ""need help"" if you'd already determined that she was asleep?

Apologize ASAP. ""Hey Allison, I'm sorry scaring you and for moving your phone! I just wanted to charge it for you. I won't do it again; I wasn't thinking!"" Then, don't do anything like this again."
"Calling the baby ""my baby"", insisting on being present at labor/delivery, trying to be the first to hold the newborn, demanding the baby spend the night with her, accusing the new mom of ""hogging"" her own child... and probably most of all, refusing to hear ""no"" when the baby's parents object to stuff like this. Of course it's normal for new grandparents to get excited and to want to bond with the baby, so I don't mean that every one of these things is instantly evil, but it's baby rabies when it becomes an overall pattern of trying to elbow the baby's actual parents out of the way."
"Just chiming in to say that I was a sensitive kid who got bullied through school and it had a very lasting effect on me. I'm now a totally adjusted and functioning adult, but it can't be overstated how horrible it is to go through being the ""outsider"" at such a young age. 


If you ask her, be aware that she may say she doesn't mind taking the bus because it feels like the ""right"" thing to say. You don't mention if there's a reason she's on this bus - generally, busses for the alter-abled are for them alone. Do you not live near another route? I think having a conversation with the school doesn't have to make you seem like a jackass. You can pretend you genuinely thought there was a mistake - heck, maybe there was. If nothing else, they should care that your daughter is being bullied."
"Also: ""what are you talking about? I didn't think it was a big deal so I lied about it. I know I said it wasn't a big deal but now I guess I've been fantasizing about another guy for weeks. Plus we should take a break."""
"Call a hotline that will help you safety plan. You can usually google one for your country. I know you can call the US line at 800-799-7233 or there are many places where you can chat via phone or computer. They will help you create a plan and provide ideas for managing until you can leave. 

Try to keep track of important documents (passports, IDs, etc...), know if you're allowed to take the kids out of the country without his approval, start to gather cash, get a ""go bag"" ready if you can.

She's dating Vincent Adultman
"&gt; He never has a strong reaction or emotion to anything and doesn't understand when someone does (or has a different reaction than him).

Show him your post and the responses. But short of therapy -- couples or individual -- he will probably not understand, at least not on a feeling level. He's sounds like he's got some serious issues that have caused him to repress his own emotions. 

What you say above sounds awful. I'm sure he has other good qualities, but a complete lack of empathy? That's important to me. 

Good luck, OP."
"My daughter did this too. The stories where horrible. She was in therapy for 5 years. She was diagnosed as having a slight narcissistic personality. She told everyone she was bipolar. 4 therapists and each told me it was her personality and liked having all of the attention on her. She received more attention for negative posts so thats what she posted. I would like to say she has matured and no longer does this but that would be a lie. She cycles through friends so she can convince new people of her horrible life because the longer you know her the more her lies dont add up. Im sorry you are going through this. Eventually the truth will come out. I suggest you also get therapy for yourself. I would retain a lawyer, get into the Facebook and print off everything. Remove her electronics. Maybe she also needs to volunteer somewhere. Take away her extra time.
My sympathies "
"&gt;My mother is demanding I send a portion of my check to her monthly or she will call the police on me and my fiancee

And say what? My adult son won't support me? She has nothing to charge you with so this is just a bullshit threat to try and get you to pay her. That reason alone should be enough to cut her off.

While I usually disagree when SOs try to tell their partners to not talk to their family, I think you're girlfriend is in the right. Sending your mom money can only get worse with time. She could start demanding more and more and how will that help you create a new life for, not only yourself, but your future family? Is your mother able to work? If so, she can pay her own damn bills.

It's okay to want to help out your family every once in a while but for her to demand you pay her back for raising you (a responsibility that comes with getting pregnant and having a child) then she's really just using as a cash cow. **DO NOT LET HER GUILT YOU INTO PAYING HER FOR A JOB SHE KNEW DAMN WELL SHE HAD TO DO WHEN SHE HAD YOU!**

 I know it's hard to let her go fully so maybe keep her at a good, long distance for now. If things get worse you may need to cut her out completely for your own sanity."
"They get to make their choices just like you get to make yours.  It is not your or your sisters responsibility to make up for your mother's bad choices.  Move where you want and be happy.  If it makes you feel better about it, send her a few bucks now and then. Pay yourself first tho so that your future and old age won't be as bleak as hers is, being a burden on everyone.  "
"1. Have your locks changed. 

2. Break it off and go no contact.

3. be fully prepared for the shit to hit the fan."
Cut contact. Permanently. Accept that your brother is being brainwashed and until he figures it out for himself there is nothing you can do. 
"You said your mother has reduced her hours of work.  Well, if she wants to avoid being on the street then she can increase them.  You are at an age where you need to move on and start living your life.  If you move back you will be trapped.  How will you develop a relationship with a SO?  Will you feel comfortable dating while living with your mother and sister?  What happens if you get engaged?  Will you move out then or will you be guilted into staying with her.

You need to cut the umbilical cord and move on, as hard as that may be.  Your mother will survive.  She has the money your dad sends, the money she can earn from working, and when she hits 65 she will be eligible for a variety of state pensions and support.

If you don't leave now you will be trapped for a very long time.  The easiest time to leave is now.  Tomorrow will be harder."
"I feel you. I went to a sort-of-exclusive prep school with a lot of rich kids. I was there on a scholarship. I got pretty tired of explaining to my friends that I couldn't come to Austria with them over spring break. They were mostly good kids, not assholes, but fairly blind and numb to the idea that someone could have limited funds. 

But there were assholes among the other scholarship kids, too, and some of the worst were those who wore their financial situations on their sleeves and acted slighted / butthurt all the time... when for most people, most of the time, the issue of financial background and family resources was not really an issue at all.

You will encounter jerks from all strata of society. This will continue well beyond private school. What you have here is an opportunity to acquire real, genuine sophistication, which is the ability to be comfortable and confident in any situation, from a hot dog stand at midnight to tea with the Queen. 

So go to the party. Act like you belong, because you do; nobody's checking your income tax returns at the door. If it turns into an asset-comparison contest, or a bunch of one-upsmanship about who's skiiing in Gstaad and who's stuck going to Stowe, then you, by staying quiet, are more sophisticated than they are.

Addendum: over senior spring break I persuaded a small circle of friends, rich and not so rich, to ride a Greyhound bus from New England to the Florida Keys. It didn't cost very much money and we all had a great time. It's not how much you've got or how you spend it... it's who you are. Even the rich kids figured that out eventually.

Edit to fix a typo and improve clarity."
"I don't know the legal ramifications, but yes, it is possible for a minor to go live with extended family. Many families have this arrangement by choice. If you go to your uncle's or grandparents' and your mother doesn't like it enough to go through the courts, though, it will get ugly. You only have two more years before it stops being something she can control, though.

Your step father is an abuser. He might also have anger management issues, but he is definitely an abuser. People who start by abusing animals frequently go on to abuse people.

I'm sorry for your situation. I grew up with an abusive father with anger issues, so I understand."
"Your mom needs to convince your dad to get evaluated by a doctor. If he refuses, you do have the option of making a police report. 

Should anything like this happen again, you should find out if your area has a mental health crisis team - they can come out to your home and do an evaluation. If this isn't available, you will need to call the police. I'm concerned for your mom's safety."
"Don't be too hard on yourself for letting things slide. It's tough. My husband was objectively gorgeous when we met, but he was involved in an incident that left him physically disabled. Goodbye six-pack abs and male model looks, hello major scarring and struggling to keep the weight off without starving himself thanks to his new limited mobility. I still think he's gorgeous, and I mostly haven't heard anything to the contrary, but I had a childhood friend who started to make ""jokes"" about how I should leave him because, according to her, he wasn't handsome anymore. I put the scare quotes because, while she always played them off as just for fun, there was obviously an element of truth behind it. And it really hurt me every time. I was probably somewhat extra sensitive because our marriage was going through a lot of turmoil at the time due to all of these sudden changes and his PTSD from the incident. And I *still* put up with those bullshit comments for way too long, because I figured we'd been friends for decades and she never said anything inappropriate around him and blah blah blah. Eventually I came to my senses and cut her out and I don't regret it a bit. I don't even know why it took me so long, except that I think when you have that kind of long-term friendship, it's hard to know where to draw the line.

Now, obviously cutting out a friend is different than cutting out family, but I've done the latter as well (and also taken way more abuse than I should have before making the decision). It's painful, but it is sometimes the best choice. And it doesn't have to be permanent. I didn't speak to my brother for 15 years due to his addiction issues, but he's been sober long enough and finally did some things that convinced me that maybe he really has changed. So now we're having occasional Facebook chats, and will probably start calling each other soon. I'm happy to have him back in my life, even though it's been so long that we barely know each other anymore. So I guess I'm just saying that cutting people out doesn't have to be permanent, even when it's pretty extreme.

You sound like a really good guy, and your girlfriend is lucky to have you (and vice versa, she sounds pretty awesome).

eta: I do think that cutting people out should be a last resort, though. I'd sit them down and have a very clear conversation about how you love Lucy, and you hate those comments, and they need to stop right now or there will be consequences. And then stick to those consequences. I like the step approach others have suggested--the first infraction means no contact for 1 week, 1 month, whatever depending on how often you see/talk to that person, then escalating for each subsequent comment."
"""You are welcome to live with mom if you are concerned with her. I will not and I am not obligated to do so."" 

Then ""gray rock""  with your mother and family if you won't go no contact for a while. Any sort of contact is going to be mentally/emotionally/financially/time draining and ultimately pointless. 

Your mom is going nuts on you because she's nuts, and your family is siding with her because 1. they don't want to deal with her and and are hoping you will 2. they may or may not feel slightly guilty. 

I can already guarantee you where this is headed: give your mom a little bit of time and she's going to back off, calm down and then come to you with a *different* proposal. This proposal will require much less of you than buying a home for her. It will be less financially burdensome or tumultuous, to the point that you will consider it to be *A Very Reasonable Proposal,* especially if it gets her off your back. Don't be fooled. It will not be reasonable and you should deny that (and subsequent attempts and proposing smaller and smaller things, too). "
I saw on Reddit that an elderly guy ended up getting a gum disease and lost all his teeth after his grandchild did that to him.
"I dont really understand why everyone else is saying to bring a gift. This sounds like a casual hang out. Bring something you like to drink and share if you want to bring anything.

"Wow this sucks. It probably is that woman from your work place, wouldn't be ironic if it were her. She couldn't have you, so now she's trying to come in between your marriage. That wasn't really a love letter...

I can see where your wife is coming from, she's stuck in a sticky situation as well trying to make sense of  what is going on. 

You never from day one hid this crazy womans existence from your wife, right?! I'm not sure if I understood correctly but, did you tell your wife from day one (before the letter) that there was a woman who was infatuated with you? "
"When my daughter was born...I felt like a hollow shell of a person for close to a year.  I didn't have energy for cleaning.  I didn't have energy to cook.  My daughter was a fairly high maintenance baby, and pretty much fed constantly...so I was stuck, attached to her for 90% of my day.  I  barely  had time to poop (I had so little time when I wasn't holding her)...let alone time to shower.  Speaking of poop, do you have any idea how long it takes your body to heal after giving birth...and that it affects things...like your ability to poop?  I had stitches until my daughter was 6 months old...pushing something the size of a watermelon out of your lemon sized hoo ha wrecks your body.  Sure some women bounce back right away, but I still pee a little when I cough and my daughter is 9.  There were times that I was so hungry (but trapped feeding my daughter) that I debated eating Kleenex because it was in arms reach.  My daughter woke up several times a night until she was 9ish months old...the sleep deprivation alone made life almost unbearable.  The exhaustion, boredom (due to repetition) and isolation that a SAHParent experiences is insane.  

If I had to deal with all that...and a toddler.....I probably would have lost my mind and drowned everyone.  I have so much respect for SAHM with multiple kids in that 2 year age gap...it would be pretty horrible for the first few years.  

Not to mention...the lack of anything else for...years.  I mean, it sounds like your wife's main socializing is with her parents and you....and that's lame.  She doesn't have coworkers to talk to.  She is basically talking to and about kids all day everyday without a break.  I know a lot of my SAHM friends resents their husbands for working instead of them.  I know that I'd rather work than be a SAHParent.  And I *was* a SAHM.  It was the hardest job I've ever had. 

This is a rough time.  All of my friends with small kids just kind of shrug and say that it's going to suck for a while, and they know that.  It does get better...but you have to survive this part.  Compassion, understanding, and kindness will determine if your marriage survives, or if it crumbles.

"Thank you. This whole post consists of OP's girlfirend making all the compromising and supporting of how OP wants to spend his time and him complaining she's ""not supporting him enough"" while he makes zero effort to do what she needs. 

I'm sorry OP but you are being pretty selfish here. I'm sorry you are having a hard time. But you either need to date a homebody or be okay with someone going out even if you don't want to come (which it sounds like you never do?). It's not fair of you to date people who need to be social for their sanity but have them sacrifice that for your apparently more important feelings while you make zero effort to reciprocate. You are being a bad boyfriend. She started dating a guy who sometimes did social things with her and now you have dropped that completely and it's her fault the relationship isn't working? If you each spent 2 nights a week doing the other person's thing that would be 4 nights a week together. But yeah, when you expect her to make all the sacrifices and you try half of one night once it's not going to work well. "
"So much this. There are SO MANY red flags to her post. She is supporting someone she's only known for 6 months AND apparently he has some anger issues:

&gt; I'm super paranoid cause finding this would start world war 3...

On top of being an entitled shit, this guy is not mentally or emotionally in a place where he can be in a healthy relationship. OP needs to get out.

"Naw, for sure he was just trying to get you to confess and then get rid of you when you did. I don't think it's about the money at all. "
"As others have said, it's not the idea of it--if you guys are comfortable expressing other celebrities you're attracted to, great. But explicitly talking about fucking them, and comparing them to you negatively? That to me is disrespectful and maybe even negging."
"Yeah OP has a really screwed up view of relationships. She says she's ""soured on the relationship"" but she's also ""down to be exclusive"". Eh?"
"Change? Lol yeah, right.

Will you be having kids? You need to really set some boundaries, which your husband announces,  because your future is grim."
Exactly. You have to depersonalize this as much as possible. This happens sometimes and you never know if your org will do it until you put in notice. I've seen those final 2 weeks-1 month go really well and really awfully. Just be happy you're leaving.

I love how you feel this awful and are preaching about good vibes after hooking up with her man like 5 times. Kinda find it amusing. Just gotta call out the bullshit when I see it.

Anyways, if you want to do something right, I'd tell her. Just don't think this is gonna end well just cause you apologized. "

"This dude is a predatory loser. He picked you out as a teenager because grown women knew how to recognize his obvious red flags and avoided him like the plague that he really is. Now, you've grown up and realized that. Congrats. He's toxic. You don't owe him shit. 

Google ""Warning signs you're dating a loser by Joseph Carver"" and read all of it. It will give  you a lot of tips about disengaging from scummy people like this. He is 100% responsible his own actions. He's all alone because he is a miserable person. You didn't cause that, you can't fix that. 

Don't let him further infect you with his issues. Get the fuck out and never look back. I'm glad you're already in therapy. You really need to self reflect on why you stayed with this dude as long as you did. 

If you insist on a face to face break up, do it in public with a friend nearby. If he shows up at your door after the fact, call the fucking cops. If he shows up at your work, call the fucking cops. Block him on everything and shut down your social media presence for a few months. "
I don't know. I think I'm scared to leave. I love him despite being miserable often. I also am living in a foreign country and gave up grad school to be here.

There are 50 states to choose from and it's overwhelming and sometimes it seems easier to just wait until my shitty BF is in a good mood again. I feel really stuck. 
"This definitely smells like elder abuse to me. Emotionally for sure since she's trying to control what goes on in their home. She might be out for the finances at some point. 

Most people's motives are money driven. She already doesn't pay rent and now she's trying to call the shots. No plans to move either?"
"If a compliment puts you down in the same breath, it's not a good compliment. He basically told you he's having to settle."

"I suppose a Hail Mary effort is all I have at this point, don't I? :(


Thanks for the recommendation though."
"Maybe you should start a more open ended discussion though? Ask her if she wants to lose weight/change her lifestyle.

Then ask her which way she thinks it will be easiest for her to accomplish. A simple idea is just downloading MyFitnessPal and sticking to a set amount of calories. No exercise. Then adding walking after a while.
This might seem more managable for her?"
"This 1000 times. /u/jasrosexo he is not trying to make this situation any easier for you by getting angry, crying, and HEAVILY GUILTING about your reasonable decision. 

You've already compromised: he can be at the hospital but not in the room.

Yes, his child is being born, but you are the person who has to physically **birth** this child. And he is a man who let you experience mental anguish *for years* due to his own selfishness and he is continuing to be selfish."
"So she isn't moving with him, he found someone who loves him (you), he is cancelling his divorce because he is worthless...

Does this make sense to you? Because to me it screams as dodgy."
Your girlfriend is awesome :)
"It's really thoughtful that you're considering this from your brother's perspective. I just want to point out how special your one-on-one time probably is to your sister. She may typically be limited to those activities that both she &amp; your brother can both do. (I'm assuming your parents are stretched a bit thin managing everything with your brother, so there might not be a lot of opportunity to focus on activities your sister enjoys, especially if they're not appropriate for your brother to attend with her.) So I hope you're able to find a way to make your time with your brother feel equally as special, instead of taking these outings away from your sister as a result of your brother's behavior. "
"I think you're getting the responses you are here because you've been purposely vague about the nature of the assault. 

If this person is a child sexual abuser then absolutely you did the right thing. And no, you shouldn't apologise. If this person savagely beat you then again, you did the right thing. Shame on your cousin for trying to sweep it under the rug. If she didn't want you to say anything then maybe she shouldn't be entertaining this person, especially not in front of you. I would go as far as to say that she's not ready to be a mother if she considers child abuse NBD."
"&gt; I never said anything about my own greatness.

Well, come on, that's just not true.

&gt; I'm an overachiever

&gt; also a networking queen

&gt; has allies and friends in high places

&gt; i was interviewed at 3 different radio stations

&gt; invited to all kinds of VIP events

&gt; achieved a lot in my relatively short life

&gt; People recognize me, I'm able to ""get into places"" I wouldn't otherwise and people do me crazy favours without me even asking them

&gt; I come and suddenly everyone is fawning over me

&gt;  I get a secret invite to an event with its leader

&gt; My boyfriend was floored by that but shocked how I managed to get that far after just a few weeks

Your post comes off as super braggy. It's not a great look, and it could have something to do with why, despite all the success you can't stop talking about, you've struggled to build relationships.

EDIT: After glancing through a couple of responses, you also mentioned that ""things just always came naturally to me and I could talk my way out of anything lol"" (yikes) and that ""He also can play guitar and I have never succeeded at learning an instrument despite being a good singer."" So even when you're complimenting him, it's sounds like you can't resist complimenting yourself."
He's blaming you for violence he did to you. Get out now. 
"&gt; Who the hell turns down a rent-free apartment?

Someone who doesn't want to do *anything* at all adult for themselves. True enough the free rent is grand, but I bet this young woman doesn't want to take out her trash, clean the toilet, wash dishes, do laundry, change the sheets, sweep, you know all the stuff so your living space isn't a pigsty. She sounds like the type and wants to live at home because she wants someone to pick up after her."
Lol. Let her throw her tantrums. She can't control how other people behave towards her. She sounds like an entitled brat and doesn't have enough maturity to take a step back and realize that maybe **HER** behavior is why she's treated the way she is. 
"So he's on board, but you don't want kids with him. And you can't come up with any real concrete reason except maybe he's a bit old and it just doesn't feel right.

Honestly, this reeks of self-sabotage and depression. I don't think you're being honest with yourself, and you're just randomly coming up with reasons that you want to end what seems like a perfectly good relationship.

You need to get into therapy immediately and hash this out. I'd be really skeptical of what you're feeling right now and try to get to the bottom of the ""why"" you don't feel like it's right to have kids with somebody who is already a good partner and father. You need to get to the bottom of this before you ruin your relationship."
"&gt;     stepped on his moment. His version of events is that I spoiled the surprise and then kind of took his spotlight, and while he was really happy about the trip he was really hurt that I chose that moment to tell him

This is exactly how I felt too. You did kind of mess it up IMO I would be very annoyed if I her him"
"Reading this hurts my heart, especially since you've had this dream since 12. You can't rush something like a family though.

I wish you the best of luck in starting a family. "
"My sister was very musical and developed that through her teens. When I was in my twenties I bought a guitar, but I was scared to play it around people really. I just knew I would be no good and didn't know what I was doing. I wasn't the sort of person who played guitar. My friends knew I had it, but when my sister came to visit I literally hid it in a closet.

Maybe this is what's happening with your brother? Maybe it's something he feels really nervous and unsure about and wants to figure out himself?"
"The skills for being a good boyfriend are pretty similar to the skills for being a good friend. You need to listen to your girlfriend, take her seriously, and consider her feelings. Show her that you're interested in what she has to say, and that you care about the things that are important to her. If you can do that, you probably won't be a shitty boyfriend."

"Yeah I'm wondering if the mom just has a nicer bedroom/bigger bed, and sister and her bf thought they wouldn't get caught..."
"I'd be pissed off if my partner and their entire family expected me to wear something every single day for the rest of my life that I'd had absolutely no say in whatsoever. My god, what year is it?!"
"&gt; I also hope she gets the hint and declines.

What hint? You literally just told her she was welcome to be a bridesmaid if she wanted.  She only knows what you tell her, and so far all she knows is that the bride *and* the bride's mother want her to be a bridesmaid."
"Don't compromise your health for this guy. He needs a wake up call. 

You should NOT try to adhere to his unreasonable and entitled expectations. Let him know this isn't okay, and that it's not okay for him to make you feel badly about your normal self.

Let him know so he doesn't continue perpetuating this horrible attitude with other women. Don't give in to it. "
"As a Canadian who has lived in the States, I'd be out of that American apartment and back to the land of Touques and Timbits in a heartbeat. A drive by shooting outside my home is an automatic get the fuck outta dodge moment. 

I do not blame your GF for wanting to go home, and quite frankly I think your downplaying what happened as normal and not a big deal is insensitive and callus. All you can decide is are you willing to follow your GF back to Canada or is this the end of the relationship. She needs to move to feel safe, and I do not blame here one bit. "
"Absolutely, positively do not have any wedding with her.

She's probably not OK, so you'll want to wait a while to be sure."
"But if you still don't feel safe then why not go? There's no use in you stressing out when the storm comes just because he didn't feel like going. I could understand if there was nowhere to go, money is tight, anything like that, but if safety is really your concern there's not really a reason to stay. "
"&gt; because of my breakup my parents really weren't letting me hang out with people until I finished my work to graduate

Um, what? You're 22, why are your parents deciding whether you can or can not hang out with people? 

Re the rest of it, frankly, you've been leading this guy on, and also you've been emotionally cheating on your ex/current bf. 

I think you should sort yourself out and start behaving a bit more maturely than you currently are. "

"Jesus this already sounds immensely creepy and this is OPs sugarcoated point of view.

Who ""stands around"" to see if they should ""tuck in"" their roommate? The fuck? "
"If it was his FB post, he also could have deleted the comment."
"Yeah, definitely learned that one. In the epic words of the bearded mountain man who hauled my sorry arse out:
""Your mistakes were forgivable. They could also have been fatal.""

...what a badass"
"I've rarely criticised her food because she normally makes basic and tasty things like pasta or sandwiches or pizza. Things that are hard to find faults in. 

I guess part of the reason why I was so blunt is because I thought she MUST be seeing the same dish that I was. Like there's no way she was looking at that thing and thinking yeah this'll work. So honestly I thought we'd have a good laugh on it and she'd bring something else or nothing. "
"&gt;I know Reddit is going to advise me to dump this guy, but I'm so terrified that no man will ever want to sleep with, or date me again because of my body. 

I promise you, there are men out there who would never, ever say the things your boyfriend has said. This goes beyond a loss of attraction; he doesn't seem to respect you, or care about your feelings or health at all. He's going behind your back with his ex, for crying out loud! If I were in your shoes, I'd rather be single than sleep next to someone like that night after night.

You should leave and take care of yourself. If your illness is due to stress, it's not going to get any better staying with him. Every day is another bit of your self-esteem, gone. Take it back. "
"I would strongly recommend not showing your mom this post. I've dealt with an unstable, uproot the kid's lives for a fling relative, and it will not go well. Other people telling them they are wrong will not make them change their mind, and will most likely cause them to lash out. Also, with the talk of calling CPS/landlord (which are very appropriate for the situation), you will become an adversary and your mom most likely won't allow your sister to see you again, since you ""made your mom look like the bad guy""(even though she is doing it all herself). The best thing you can do is to keep record of anything that happens (including a log of event, saving texts, etc.) so that any reports to CPS can have additional backing and continue to reaffirm to your sister that you are her ally."
"I understand there are money and insurance issues but your husband needs to maintain his PT exercises on his own. Going to the gym, doing the stretches, or using some pretty inexpensive (i.e. Stretch bands, small free weights) at home will help manage his pain. Another user suggested COBRA/Medicaid options. Look into that. Also see if there are PT /medical massage schools in your area. They always need people to learn and practice on and it's usually at a reduced rate. He needs to take more accountability for his pain management and figure out how to communicate with you when he doesn't feel great. I say this as the one in my relationship with spinal injuries/nerve damage/pain I'll have to manage forever. This is no excuse for him to let it impact your relationship. Good luck. "
"My guess would be her anxiety is far worse than you (and possibly she) realises, possibly with depression too.

My experience is that when mine was bad I could sometimes manage things spontaneously as I didn't have time to worry, a week gave me time to build up to something. But a day or two was just right for my anxiety to maximise. 

The failure to launch angle strikes true for me and may be accurate too, but I'd guess they're linked often to other issues. 

The thing is when your mental health is bad enough, fighting it hurts more than staying depressed. Definitely worth considering. "
"There is no compromise. You are clear on your position /feelings (you want kids) and she is clear on her position (she doesn't want kids).

You either stay together and resentment grows because one of you doesn't get what they want or you separate now.

Just because you love each other doesn't mean that is enough to keep a relationship going/happy.

Split now before it becomes an even bigger issue. "
"I agree with this. Also, consider that anal sex can be incredibly vulnerable and bring out a lot of emotions afterward, kind of like when you go to a yoga class that does a lot of hip openers and you spend all of savasana crying."
your nice friend does not seem that nice to be honest. 
"Have you had many other partners, has the issues been persistent with all of them? Its perfectly possible that you and your boyfriend is just not in sync with you. Its perfectly normal, you will not enjoy sex with everyone, regardless if you love them or not. Its possible that you just don't enjoy some types of sex but its less than likely. 

If you bring it up it will likely hurt him, hes only human, but if its having an impact as large as you suggest on the relationship, you may need to talk about it. Sex is something you work on, you could enjoy different things. Give it a try!"
"I'm sorry it came to that. At least you know his true self, before it got to a more committed stage. Good on you for standing your ground.

Hopefully the next guy will be more interested in building a future, instead of remaining a child."
"Yeah, he's abusing you. Yelling at you and kicking you out of your home when you don't want to leave, telling you if you can/can't lock a door, he won't acknowledge that he's treated you badly when you bring it up. He's an abusive asshole. Go take the quiz and loveisrespect dot org if you need more convincing."
"I want to emphasize this - in the movies, there's lots of ""you tell her, or I will"" junk. but all this does is further ensnare you in a situation you shouldn't be ensnared in, and give the potentially cheating parties an opportunity to complicate things in some silly shakespearean way.  honestly, it's inappropriate for you to have any role in this situation aside from telling your friend the truth of what you saw. don't try to play god just because you have foreknowledge of a situation that's probably going to hit the fan - it just makes things messier, and it'll make you seem manipulative.

I know you're horrified at the prospect of causing hurt to any/all of these parties, and that it'll hurt you to do so. but assuming the tryst isn't part of some 3-way agreement, *the hurt has already been committed* - by *them*. sure, maybe the blood hasn't showed up on the shirt yet, but the wound has *already happened.* the worst case scenario is *already* here, it's just that you have the bad luck of being the first to realize it. again, it's not for you to play god and try to stop something that your friends have already set in motion. you can't. the real harm is done. your role is to simply be a good friend and tell her, and the fallout will be whatever the fallout is.

it's shitty that those two friends thrust you into this awful position because of their behavior.

anyway, I would tell her what you saw. definitely in person. don't speculate on what happened, don't defend or attack, just simply tell her what you saw, tell her that you've been feeling torn up about it, and that you feel she deserves to know.
"
"Thanks for your (and everyone's) advice. I think the bottom line is that I stop hanging out with them. The men are really cool, so I have friends at work at least. They'll be even more pissy about me 'being too good for them' if I actively avoid going out with them, but you guys have made me realize the salad thing really was over the top. 

Thanks! Your help is appreciated and noted!"

My mums cousins did Amway for years. They stopped getting invited to things and got shut down by family at every turn. People don't want to be harassed to buy things they don't want/need. My cousin started doing LipSense to pay for her wedding and auto added me to a fb group. I removed myself and that was that. They'll dig their own graves.
"So you're a last minute re-invitee. Just say you've already made other plans, so sorry, and send a gift like you were going to. If they press, say you are having a small family-only wedding that weekend and that you can't reschedule."
"&gt; I think she just needs more understanding friends (It's okay when someone in the friend group gets on a table, but not okay when she takes food???)

I don't think I can agree with any confidence.

People are clearly struggling to agree with their interpretations of some of these examples, but I read the table example as pulling the same joke someone else pulled, but without context. Sort of the see-and-repeat behavior that people with social disabilities often try, but with poor results because the 'why' element is missing.

I have an expressive face, but don't get called out to the degree that OP seems to. She also says she is confused 'often' which is a bit too much.

I don't think the issue is that her friends aren't gracious but that OP is undiagnosed and struggling in social situations, and her friends either can't put their finger on what's up or don't know what to say.

Based on the amount of difficulty OP seems to have with relatively common social cues, I think it's absolutely worth seeing a professional."
"What the everloving ratfucking shit went wrong with this house?!

Look. If this is a til-death care arrangement your wife is insisting upon, then this house needs to be just as much your home as it is theirs. Which means you get to adjust it, within reason, to your comfort. 

It doesn't impact them one bit if you install a shower, take over the utility bill, and flush the toilet to your heart's content. They are free to continue not bathing in the house if they please, and if they insist on not flushing, you're free to flush for them. They will adjust. I understand your wife's reluctance to start a fight when you're all living under one roof, but it won't be *nearly* as dramatic as she fears if you present a united front and take charge of the changes that need to be made. 

If you really need ammunition, call an inspector out to look at the house. If it's really this bizarre, their feedback should be all you need. "
Note to OP: You're welcome to post there even though she's not legally your MIL.
I wouldn't vacation with Sis any longer.  Life's too short to waste vacation time with people like that.
"Your mom is abusing you. She intentionally put pressure on your incisions, and screamed at you for pushing her off. That's sick and abusive. I'm not sure what you should do in the short term, but you should move out as soon as possible. Once you're out, don't let her help you with any physical ailments you have, because she will do this again. And check out /r/raisedbynarcissists, to see if anything sounds familiar. Even if your mother doesn't technically have NPD, you'll find a lot of support in that sub. &lt;3"
"&gt; This puts me in a really uncomfortable situation with my friends because I don't want to go around saying he actually has a small dick but I don't want to lie either!

""That's between us.""

Done.  Because it's none of their business what it's like to have sex with him, regardless of his degree of personal endowment."
"Aussie here. When mum comes to my house, she sleeps in my bed with me, no biggie. Sometimes my sisters (4 and 7) join us as well"
"I like how he took an hour to respond to such an important message and then claimed, ""Oh! All guys do it! It's guy talk!"" as though that makes it okay?? Smh "
"Please listen to the rest of the above be commended post about exploring why you acted the way you did while in a relationship with Mark. Yes, it's probably going to take some time with your brother. But it's so extremely important to reflect on your actions so you don't end up in the same sort of situation again. "
"As a feminist I am reminding you that birth control agency is important for both genders, and purposefully taking that agency over your body or reproduction is sexual assault and a huge betrayal. We aren't forensic experts you need to figure out what happened but in the mean time no sex at all. Better safe than sorry. She's not on any birth control at all? You're playing with fire anyways. I'd go pick up plan B and give it to her saying you noticed holes in some of the condoms so she should take it just to be safe. Her reaction might help you figure this out."
"That may be true, but it'll never be a good relationship while she tries to hold you under her thumb.  She's being intrusive and need to have boundaries set.  It's hard to do and she'll cry and scream, but after the tantrum passes your relationship will be a lot healthier.  

Remember, it's not just on you guys alone to form a good relationship, your MIL needs to do the same, and it doesn't sound like she is."
"Alex is sheltered &amp; doesn't get it but I don't blame him, it's a bit shocking for the kid. 

With your friends take a couple out for a coffee one on one and ""ask for advice"". Explain the situation, with reference to the fact that there's a couple of maids who stay on because they're older &amp; after caring for your gran who passed, your parents worry about the kind of positions they'd find elsewhere. Explain that they have their own bedrooms &amp; are paid well but then say 'should I tell my parents to fire them as its wrong &amp; makes Alex uncomfortable?'"" They will say no and hopefully stop teasing you. 

They're just not having the facts or being bothered to see it from anyone's perspective except Alex's. Force them to put themselves in the maids (and your parents) shoes."
"Don't worry, they can then just come and all live with you."
"Speaking as a farmer, I am appalled by these people and their carelessness. The authorities are undoubtedly more than a bit busy right now, but I hope that they will be reported in future as they absolutely should neither have animals, nor pretend to be farmers.

You aren't wrong for wanting to distance yourself."
"Yes we are in the same boat! Your frankness made me smile, and you sound much stronger about it than me, being able to open up to more people about it. I like to try to pretend that they are normal with strategic bra-work, only confided in my boyfriend &amp; my mom. My mom has been very encouraging and supportive about surgery, thinks I should do what is best for me feeling better about myself, so the pretty big difference in support/response between her &amp; my boyfriend is part of what felt odd. Anyway, thank you! :)"
"Does she know where you live? If she does, guaranteed after other avenues fail, she's going to turn up on your doorstep with a crazy hamper. How to best prepare for that? Definitely have some kind of recording device handy, so you can get any threats on file. If she doesn't, make sure that your online stuff is locked down. Don't let this stress you, just take smart precautions. Be vigilant rather than alarmed.

Would love an update when all this dies down, if that suits ya."
"&gt; However, I told my gf that I would want her to be on the same page as me about trying new things like anal, and she said she would be willing to try it eventually. Turns out she is 100% firmly saying no, and doesn't ever want to do it, but would ""do it if it would make me stop asking"", which really hurt my feelings.

Dude. You know she doesn't want to try it and she told you so. You still want to try it, *knowing she doesn't want to*. How do you think that makes her feel? Perhaps also slightly hurt, that you care more for a sexual experience than her full consent? Ouch. You wanted open communications and open dialogue, but you didn't hear what you wanted to hear, and now you're hurt. I get that you feel she's gone back on something she said she'd eventually consider, but I honestly can't imagine being with someone who wants me to do something I'm clearly deeply uninterested in doing, especially if they put *any* pressure on me otherwise... regardless of anything I had said in the past.

&gt; I woke up calmer, but honestly don't know if I can trust anything that comes out of her mouth anymore. She's willing to bend the truth and lie to tell me what I want to hear, and I don't know if she's capable of changing that.

Break up. Break ups suck and I don't think many people find them easy, but it really honestly truly sounds like the best option. For both of you."
"The problem is, You're married but your husband isn't.

Divorce him. Find someone worthwhile.                 "
"Move. Now. It's only going to get worse. You have every right to break a lease if you fear for your safety. Do not tell her you are leaving and be sure to have other people around when you vacate. Get. Out. Now. 

She appears to be a binge drinking paranoid delusional and you won't believe the shit they make up and assert as true. 

If you don't have a lock on your bedroom door get one today and use it. Document everything. "
In that case your options are to dump him or accept it. I know which one would make me happier in your shoes.
"^ Yeah, that's the best idea imo. Definitely consider calling the police. "
I'd be even madder knowing a friend knew about the rumour and didn't feel they could tell me. I'd think they didn't consider me a friend. 
"I think the first thing I would do is get the children examined to make sure nothing has happened to them.

I its this might be a worry with some of the things that you do in involving the police or social services.

If they were your children would you take his word that he hadn't done anything? I can tell you from personal experience that when one of my children was abused by a grandparent(now dead) that child would not admit anything had happened until after his death,when the whole thing came out. 1 wrecked life later we are still helping her pick up the pieces of that.

Having travelled that road,I'm telling you that children can't deal with that stuff and the child's mother needs to be sure nothing else happened and support her child if it did,its not going to be easy in getting them examined or raising the issue with drs because they have a duty of care for that child/children also and legally have to report on.

"
"&gt; It's not as simple as throwing them away.

It really is that simple. It isn't pleasant, but if they can't cut the shit (and they're well beyond ""joking""), that's the answer.

You can't force people to be nice if they continue to be jerks after you ask. What you can control is who you hang out with."
"Look, I get it.  I grew up in Washington Heights, where we had about 70 murders, in the span of 1986.  I mean, I didn't have a pistol at my waist at the time, because that sort of thing wasn't encouraged in New York, and also because I don't think I was a good enough shot to hit bullets sprayed in my direction in midair.

But here's the the thing:  Your girlfriend went through a legitimately traumatizing experience, and she doesn't like living in Chicago any more.  You're not going to be able to argue her into not being traumatized, and you're not going to be able to argue her into feeling safe in Chicago.

If you want to frame this as you being tough and her being weak, sure.  Why not?  But I'm not really sure that's going to change anything.  Chicago is more dangerous than Toronto, and that's been brought home to her, in a way that she's not going to forget.  Even if you come up with some crackerjack arguments, and statistics and pie charts, she's going to want to live somewhere that she hasn't heard people firing automatic weapons and killing each other.

Also, sure, southside is more violent.  But as you've discovered, violent people can use cars to go to different parts of town.  And you're going to be in the more violent parts of the city from time to time.  That's part of living in a city--you go to other parts of the city, people from other parts of the city go to the places you live.  And Chicago has a lot of murders by US standards, let alone by Canadian standards.

Your options include looking at suburbs with convincingly low numbers for reported crimes, looking at cities with less violent crimes--I mean, Washington Heights is so super fucking gentrified these days that I think that the drug dealers have all been priced out.  That, or you can start brushing up your French, and practicing saying ""sorry, eh?""

Or you could break up.

Or, maybe, you'll figure out something to say that'll make her stay in Chicago, panicking when she hears cars backfiring, or when you're going through a rough part of town.  I mean, literally every other option sounds better to me, so you might want to consider them first."
"OP, I think you need to get as far away from your mother as possible.  Move out. Don't be around her when she drinks.  Also, I think you have an incredibly *clean* mind not to feel like your mother is sexually assaulting you.  If that were your father or uncle, how would you be reacting?"
"And despite all this, he keeps her around.

Oh, I don't disagree that she's been inappropriate, but OP hasn't helped himself by not enforcing sane boundaries. He catches his GF of six months trying to coach his infant into calling her ""mama"", and he sets a boundary of Nope. She keeps referring to the child as her son and OP *moves her in*. Most people would end the relationship at that point, but he *chooses* to escalate it.

There is a massive disconnect between what he says and what he does. That rests on him - not on Sarah, and not on bubs. And the longer he lets this disconnect go on, the more attached bubs will get to Sarah, and the more he will come to think of her as his mother. 
 
I get no sense from OP that he realises this. Honestly, in his position I would end the relationship, move Sarah out, go to goddamn grief counselling and commit to not dating anyone for a year, but *if* he chooses to keep living with Sarah he has to consider the consequences of that increased attachment on his child and act accordingly."
"Any man who treats you like that (not just yelling at you to the point of tears,  but ghosting you after 8 months)  does not deserve your time.  Move on girl.  It's for the best"
"Would it be an acceptable outcome if he said no? If that seems handle-able, I think you should tell him that you'd like to try dating. There's never going to be a perfect time. "
"This! Schools do fuck up! I experienced this as a kid...

I had just switched schools, and didn't know anyone. A few weeks into the year, my mother gets called by the teacher to talk about my ""clear mental retardation""... Cue fish-face by my mother, who thought I was just a standard kid. 

Turns out they had taken my little grade 2 self and mis-enrolled me in a FIFTH grade full French immersion class... and instead of questioning why there was a much smaller child who didn't understand instructions, the teacher assumed I was developmentally challenged.

"I've talked to her a lot about this.  My dad is even more vocal with her privately.  My mom is the biggest people pleaser in the world.  She absolutely hates conflict.  So she never sets appropriate boundaries for herself or on behalf of her and my dad in a lot of other extended family situations as well.  Thankfully, I don't have to deal with most of those other situations."
"I think this is way far and above trying to ""be one of the guys."" She is actively *flirting* wth them, and they are flirting with her. She literally wants these men to flirt and see her as a single woman. If they find out she is married, it is going to make her unavailable to the male attention she loves."
I don't know really. She used to see a therapist but I'm not so sure she is anymore. She hates every therapist she gets. 
"When some someone tells you who they are, believe them the first time - Maya Angelou

Dump him now."
"I think so too. I've seen interviews where this used as a technique to get someone to confess; rationalize and make light of the offense to make the suspect feel comfortable with giving an admission.  I would never use interrogation techniques in a relationship though, seems weirdly manipulative.  "
"&gt; but he regrets getting married and having kids because it interferes with his relationship with alcohol. 

There is also the possibility that he uses the alcohol to cope with the decisions he made in life that led him to having a family. Some people straight up don't want kids and have them because of pressure from family and/or their partners. 

Becoming an alcoholic is no cope because you are unhappy with your life. "
"Eh. I really don't see text flirting with other girls in the beginning of a brand new relationship to be a ""huge betrayal."" A little perspective is needed here... they were just some random texts, and your relationship wasn't yet serious. 

If the relationship now is otherwise good and he seems apologetic and like he's learned something (he had a lot of insight into why he did it and understands that what he did was wrong) and it also seems like he'd not do it again, this seems like something that's easy to forgive and forget."
"This would be a deal breaker for me. You shouldn't have to live in a house afraid to be attacked by your pet. The dog clearly isn't happy and neither are you two. I'm shocked for her lack of concern for god and other's safety. She's lucky the dog hasn't been put down for biting people yet. 

There are obedience training classes for aggressive dogs. I'm sure there are some in your area. I think you worded your concerns in the last line perfectly. I think you should point out that the dog is going to seriously maim someone if it's not under control. If that happens, the dog will be out down and your fiancée could be sued for a lot of money.

You need to sit down and talk to her about this before you're married. "

"I'm renting a room now. It's about 30 minutes away. So I can bring her here every once in a while but my mom has not been a fan of the idea. She always talks about how ""stability"" is important for children. Not sure how this new upcoming situation helps stability though!

&gt; Other than that, what you really need to try and give her is your time and advice. As an introvert in a large household, it's important to find ways to feed that alone-time need outside of the home. That can mean taking walks, going to the library or to a movie, going to the gym. Sitting alone in a bedroom may feel like the best way to address that need for space and downtime, but you do have to get creative if it's just not realistic.

Thanks. Taking her for walks or movies is good. I just hope my mom isn't going to ask me to take more of the kids. That would defeat the purpose. 
"
You need to cut her out of your life completely - as soon as you possibly can. She is a toxic presence that is hurting your sobriety and your future. Is there any way you can go back to rehab?
"I think you need to take the sexualization part out of this and focus on how this level of attachment is going to impede his independence going forward. That said, since you are not the bio dad, any argument here is one you will lose every time. It sounds like you need to bring this up with her if your relationship has any hope of lasting, but I would suggest coming at it from a ""hey I read this book/heard this thing on the radio"" etc, about children needing to learn to go to sleep by themselves to grow up in a healthy way, and what does she think? And never mention that it creeps you out on a sexual level, which will only make her defensive."
everything here is about him and what he wants.  what does he do for you in return?
Never marry or have children with someone who isn't jumping at the chance to do so.
"Dude... that is not healthy at all. Jealousy has its place, usually in your gut when you know something is wrong. But all the time and with everyone, even in mundane interactions? Bugger that!

The best thing for you is to either have a serious discussion about jealousy in the relationship, or end it. 

You shouldn't have to navigate through interacting with other women like a minefield in fear that your girlfriend will explode on you.

You didn't betray her or wrong her. She may feel that way, but she is wrong.

What did she expect you to do? Spend the entire night sitting in a corner waiting for her to acknowledge you when she was ready? Again, bugger that."
"On the bright side, you have a new phone! 

Seriously, why not take the phone from him? Do not tell him ahead of time. When it is charging, just take it. When he ask, tell him that since it was your money, it is your phone. 

Be prepared to run like the wind. "
"You didn't want to disappoint your parents? That is your reasoning?

And you are resentful of your wife? You should be furious at yourself for screwing up your life over something so trivial. "
"Seconded. I think the BF flips out when OP shows good parental judgment, if that makes sense. Her egregious errors are putting on a show the kid likes while the BF smokes, wanting to establish privacy rules, when that fails, asking if she should change her own behaviour. His response is to pit her and his son against each other, implying his son was demanding dinner of her, and implying she wanted his son banned from ever visiting their bedroom.  He's being the opposite of a peacemaker. It probably freaks him out subconsciously to have a co-parent who has a good relationship with his son. 

This analysis aside, it doesn't really matter why he freaks out - just that this needs fixing! Family therapy seems necessary, if OP wants to stay in the relationship. I also wonder what the rest of their relationship is like based on this context.  "
"Your comment is super relevant because I have often wondered how my two asshole exes have spun me as the ""crazy"" ex to their new girlfriends. When really I had to get a restraining order...."
"He's not your best friend, he's not the ""one"", and your actual best friend is understandably frustrated with you allowing someone to take advantage of your feelings for him. Move on and find someone who treats you the way you deserve to be treated."
"You simply tell her. But you also need to realize that unless you (or someone you really trust) is there to make sure the rules are being enforced there's no guarantee. 

So keep it simple. No unsupervised contact, your child your rules. 

If she doesn't like it too fucking bad. "
"I think u/mischiffmaker is on to something when they say 

&gt;and the wife already knows

You said she told you to 

&gt;just spit it out if there was something I wanted to tell her

If she had asked what was bothering you, that would make sense, but she seemed to know you had something bad to say, that you didn't want to say.  It sounds like she knew something was up.  Maybe she knew that her husband was out of bed at some point, or has seen some other indications, lingering looks, sly smiles, some flirting behaviour.  I think her gut is telling her something, and the right thing to do is exactly what mischiff has said.  Just tell her what you saw.
"
"Honestly you're current approach (smiling, not saying anything) sounds like the best one. Because if you say anything she'll pick it apart and try to argue or lecture. Not giving her anything to work with is going to make things increasingly awkward, but, it already sounds soooo painful, what's a little more? Good luck, she sounds like the absolute worst."
"Plot twist, its perfectly normal how you sleep. If someone has a problem with it, get someone new.

There is nothing wrong with sleeping with a night light.

I sleep with a 60 pound dog next to me that growls at everyone walking by the apartment at night.

I sleep deep knowing my dog is there.

Does that make me a child.

Who cares? If I meet someone and they don't like my dog sleeping next to my bed. Bye bye."
"SHE'S FOUR MONTHS POST PARTUM AND CARING FOR AN INFANT AND A TODDLER.

If there's not a ""real effort"" being made it's you and your shitty attitude, bud. 

&gt;that there just isn't a real effort there.

An attitude because what? You want to come home to a clean house if it means a miserable, exhausted wife? She's not angry and tired like you so she's not ""making an effort?"" 

Are you kids healthy and happy? Is your wife happy? Then there's effort. It's just the the level of effort you want."
"&gt;Her response was ""I'm not like you, you can be cold, mean and hate someone - I can't"". Actually, I respect that.

Don't respect that. It's the cry of the doormat."
"Post on your local subreddit, craigslist, Facebook group -- find someone who'll let you carpool with them in exchange for some gas money. You're not stuck, there are still people leaving, potentially with extra space in their car."
"You've gotten great advice already, but I'd just like to point out another possibility: he might have a skewed idea of what plastic surgery looks like (aka huge fake boobs). If you have done some research and know what you'd like your future boobs to look like, maybe try to assuage his possible fears that they won't look obviously plastic? "
Let's be clear: she's lying to her husband. It has nothing to do with being professional and everything to do with flirting her way to promotions. It would be one thing if she was honest with her husband about that. It's entirely different that she kept it from him for this long.
"I can't believe this, after months of not knowing i think I'd be relieved to know he just wrote erotica. If i were him I'd just tell them that he is a ghost writer for a living and then if they ask what genre then make jokes, but by the 4th date they better know the truth so they can make an informed decision if its something they can deal with or not."
"I don't feel like anyone of normal social intelligence would make a joke like that on an engagement post.

A joke like ""wow, conned her into marrying you bro! Good job!"" Maybe... but something specific referencing another woman? No way."
Oh that has come up several times throughout this process. They think that them taking our future baby to get christened should be a compromise to our destination wedding. We will not be letting that happen. Future is grim.
"If you stay with him, you're going down a long, painful path that will probably end in his killing you.

Leave now. Immediately. Go stay with friends or family and tell them he is physically abusive and you need help. Call a shelter for battered women if you don't have a good place to go. You've got to get out."
I think you were right to do it. It's kinda weird that you should be expected to keep the peace while everyone makes nice with the person who assaulted you.

Selfdepricating humour that obviously exaggerates the mocked characteristic. Thats my kinda humour
"Damn. That drunk, she could have killed someone. Is that somebody you want to date? If she gets busted, are you ready to be her personal driver after her license is taken away? 

Talk to her when she's sober. If she's contrite and recognizes that she did a really bad thing and needs to change her ways, you can go from there. if she doesn't think it's a big deal, you should probably take out the trash. "
"I think there might be a few things going on here. 

(1) Your girlfriend is depressed/ashamed she cannot find a job and depressed/ashamed she has to rely on you. I say this because this was how I felt when I could not find work and had to rely on my SO for financial support for several months. It was, to put it mildly, humiliating. I faced rejection from jobs nearly every day, and on top of that felt guilty for not contributing to household expenses. I barely left the house because I had no money and could not ask my SO for any more. I felt trapped, ashamed, depressed, disconnected, angry. I was in a black hole. 

(2) If your girlfriend is experiencing what I described above, her jabs may be a passive-aggressive attempt to let you know how she's feeling (Note: this does not in any way excuse her behavior. I'm just saying there might be an explanation that isn't her being ungrateful). She may be drowning and not know how to tell you. She may feel like she desperately needs to get out of the house, but is waiting for you to take the lead so she does not have to put herself in the very vulnerable position of asking you to go out to dinner with her when she knows you would have to pay. 

(3) She's really and truly ungrateful. I don't think this is the case, but I don't know her and don't know the whole story, so I wouldn't want to leave out this possibility. 

In short, talk to her. Say something like ""Hey, I've noticed you've been making these jabs at me when it's clear we're going to be eating dinner at home. What's up with that? Is everything ok?"" and let the conversation flow from there. 

ETA: One more thing - her jab about other guys taking their girls out? Having been in her position, I read that as ""Everyone gets to have fun except me."" Her inner dialogue might be something like ""Everyone gets to have fun except me because I suck and can't find a job."" Also her ""successful people go out to eat all the time"" I think is really a jab at herself - she's ashamed that she doesn't have the money, and it's easier for her to project that onto you than process her own feelings. Again, that doesn't make her behavior ok and I would for sure let her know how it's affecting you. I think, though, that this is more about her and how she feels about herself than about you not providing enough for her. Just my 2 cents. "
"Are you fucking kidding me? I had a blast. I was in a sorority and did my fair share of partying. I also have a chronic illness and alcohol fucks with my meds, so no I didn't get crazy shitfaced on the reg cause I actually care about my health and had some semblance of common sense and responsibility. 

The fact that you're trying to rationalize your life with animal house - a movie about people being idiots - is downright sad. Grow the fuck up. "
"His manipulation tactics are all the confirmation you need you're doing the right thing. Don't respond to him under any circumstances, ever. If you have reason to believe he's an immediate danger to himself or others call 911 but DO NOT RESPOND."
"Op, he's telling you that he wants to divorce you but doesn't want to be the  ""bad guy ""so he wants you to file the divorce papers.


Start seeing lawyers and then let friends and family know that you're getting a divorce because he requested it.  Let him experience the shame and embarrassment of having to explain to other people why he wanted to lose you and his kids."

"I'm not telling you my definition of cool, I'm telling you how most people use it. Which obviously includes your SO. When you use touchy words like that you should probably use the commonly accepted definition, not your own obscure version. And not compare your ex to your SO, especially in way that should've be obvious it was going to be seen negatively."
You hang out at a bowling alley where there is something that non-drinkers/light drinkers to do besides drink. You support your girlfriend if anyone there pressures her to drink more. You find more entertaining places to go than straight up bars. 
"&gt; continuing to drink in front of her I don't think is a good idea at the moment.

I was really hoping she could learn to abstain while the rest of us don't but I think you're right, that's not the case. 

It would break my heart to break up with her, I really don't want to. But it also breaks my heart to watch her self-destructive behavior. I think you're right, I need to help her develop an alternative lifestyle. Thank you for your help. "
"Don't light yourself on fire to keep other people warm. It sounds from the second to last paragraph that they have things they could sell or adjust to raise funds for this irresponsible purchase. You should tell them you're sorry but you need the money to enable your transportation and therefore your livelihood / education. 

It SUCKS for you to be in this situation but they are adults who need to face their own decisions as adults. "
"&gt; I'm confused by this post. Why did you tell us about your parents and your mother sexually abusing you, if this post is actually about you being annoyed that your BIL is your houseguest and you do not like how he is behaving?

He mentions later in the post that his wife used his mom's sexual abuse to hurt him in a fight. "
"Does he shower 2 times a day? Does he change his underwater 2 times a day? Does he use baby powder or special products? Why do you want to stay with someone who is 1. Immature and unkind to the point where they can't have this conversation with you in person and 2. Expensive as you now have to do all this extra, unnecessary work.
Your doctor said nothing is wrong with you, and you seem fine with it and so have your past partners. It is literally a 'him' issue. Does he have other obsessions? Does he have these obsessions about himself? 
I would personally not be dating someone like this. He sounds very juvenile and uninformed about both anatomy and hygiene."
"Expecting other people to put up with your baggage but you believing you shouldn't have to put up with theirs is an example of emotionally stunted, selfish behaviour and the signs of someone who has nothing to offer as a partner.  Also - Feeeeeeeeemaaaaaaales.  Could you be any more of a cliche?  Thank you for providing a great example of the sort of ""emotionally delayed"" attitude being discussed ;)"

"No one knows what's going on in his head except him. 

My best guess? Girls want him now because he's an NHL player. He knows that won't last. He could get injured next season and that's the end of his career. If that happens, he has you as a girl who will still want him even though he's no longer a star. Until then he doesn't want to commit or restrict himself by starting up a relationship.

He likes you, but he likes his current lifestyle more. When that lifestyle ends, then he at least has someone he likes (hopefully) waiting for him."
"I had to walk 45 min home. But you are so right. If she is in a car with a dude making a move on her. I won't think she will be unfaithful. I will be worrying about her. 

I honestly have no clue what is in her mind with what happened. But I think based on her past relationships. There was alot of cheating and lies. So now I was in the car with a young woman that want to make a move. This is not a comfortable feeling for her. And I can understand that. 

I think she thinks something happen and she probably think I am not telling her. "
"Ask him out. If he's gay, or he's not into you, he'll turn you down. NBD, you're fit, young and healthy, and getting fitter and healthier every time you go to the gym. There are plenty more fish in the sea. Don't let your shyness drag you down, if he IS bi or whatever, he's clearly shy too :B

Best case scenario he says yes, and you may yet get to touch his delicious amazing physique!!"
"I think you're over-estimating the emotional intelligence of a 2 year old. What OP knows and what Sarah knows is entirely different to what that child knows. All *he* knows is there's a woman who lives with him and loves him, who has been around as long as he can remember and who helps take care of him, and *of course* that little one is going to bond with her as if she's his mother, whether he calls her ""Mama"" or ""Sarah"". The attachment doesn't alter with the name.

If OP didn't want to encourage that bonding he should never have moved Sarah in. But he did, *knowing that she had prior form of over-stepping* (wtf?), and now he's all ""What shall I do, my child is attached and confused?!"" Well, no shit. 

My point is he needs to decide very very quickly if he wants Sarah in that child's life, because the kid is the one who will ultimately pay the highest price here. If he doesn't want Sarah to be a mother figure she needs to move out and not come back. If he does then he needs to stop trying to undermine the growing bond between them. Unfortunately he's floundering about in the middle (""Don't call my child your son, but come live with us as a family!"") and it's fucking them all over. 

He needs to make a decision and stick with it."
"I'm not surprised she reacts harshly... You're essentially telling her ""I'm kind of thinking about leaving you but I'm not really sure."" It's painful and scary. You two made the choice together and she probably feels like all of the sudden she's not enough for you.

Could you be satisfied by taking care of children in your family? Volunteering with kids? Having a job that involves kids? 

I actually think there's more staunchly childfree women than men, because statically in the US, women do 2/3rd of the childcare when both partners are working FULL TIME. Not to mention the enormous physical and mental toll of pregnancy, the agony and injury of childbirth and the common life long changes to your body. Men seem to get enamored with the ""Kodak moments."" Teaching the kid to ride a bike, taking the kid camping. Have you taken care of babies or children overnight, preferably for several days, as the primary caregiver? Even that can't really touch how much having kids affects your life.

There's no point trying to convince her of the good side. Instead you need to figure out if there is some other outlet for your desires, or if you are just wearing rose colored glasses about the whole thing and would regret throwing away your relationship and resent a toddler you brought into the world because now your life is diapers and The Wiggles. Or you need to decide to leave her!"
"MIL is not relevant here; I would avoid bringing her into this any more than she already is.

You need to have a one-on-one conversation with your wife. Apologize for scaring her even though you didn't mean to and had little control over the situation. It was only a dream and she shouldn't put *this much* stock into dreams.

It is unreasonable of your wife to continue operating her reality with fantasy logic."
Damn you denied her IG request! Cold.
"I literally gasped and said ""What the fuck‽"" in response to that training line.  I would have lost my shit over that comment.  

He is now engaged with an echo chamber community that radicalizes men.  To me, they're on par with supremacists.  He now has extreme views and is trying to indoctrinate you into his newfound, urgent need to get you to submit to his awesome power like the ""plate"" that you are.

This man does not respect you.  He is openly hateful so he can go online and collect virtual high-fives with his fellow toxic cult-members.  Your child will learn how to treat you from this man.  You get that, right?  

I am absolutely appalled that you have had to go through his calculated emotional torture, but I'm outright outraged that you are so vulnerable that you can't see this situation for what it is and decide you deserve better.

Please don't stay.  He refuses to hear you anymore, the echoes are just too loud to fight."
"""I have a big heart that just wants to love and be loved"". You wrote that a year ago in a fairly heartfelt post, and from a quick scan of your other posts, there aren't really any indications of you not being a good guy. I might be wrong on closer inspection, but so far I'm pretty convinced you're not too bad. Saw one with you wanting to talk about movies and video games and shit. Would be down if you're still interested, even if the post is a year old lol"
"&gt; what are some boundaries that could work?

Let me just say that there is literally no reason he needs to be constantly checking his phone DURING games, or even immediately afterwards.  Once his lineup for the week is set, there's literally nothing he can do about it.  All he's doing from the start of the games Sunday until their conclusion on Monday night is looking at his score, and I can state unequivocally that looking at your score has no impact whatsoever on the outcome of your game.  

Long story short, he can put his damn phone down and live in reality on Sunday and Monday night.  Hell, you don't even need to watch the games, those players are going to put up their points whether you're watching or not.  

All that said, if he prioritizes this fetish he has over your relationship, do yourself a favor and get out.  "

"The level of supervision he is under can and should be changed when there is a need. Often disabled adults have changes in their level of functioning, not just behavioral but sometimes medical as well (for example, difficulties with tasks due to the progression of dementia). Keep calm when you interact with him and if you witness an outburst. It isn't a given that he will display aggressive behaviors but it's always good practice to be aware of your surroundings and avoid situations where you can't get to an exit. "
"That was hard to read, you don't want to be someone's 'project' who 'has potential', you want to be your own independent wonderful self who goes out with friends and buys new shoes and wears short skirts with no 3rd degree.

I don't think it's age here that's the problem, it's a guy who has such a demanding and controlling nature that whatever you do is not going to be right in his eyes."
"Having a disagreement on kids in a valid deal breaker. Sit her down, ask her why she's hesitant and if she really does want kids. Tell her to be honest with you because dragging you around for years without giving you a definite answer is just cruel.

If she's worried, talk it out. Maybe get a counselor/therapist involved. If she doesn't want kids then maybe it's time to go your separate ways. If you're financially secure you could try adopting/fostering on your own. And there's still time to find a woman who is willing to raise kids with you. It's not too late, you have options."
"For everyone, OP has hidden the actual reason in the comments because he doesn't think it's a reason.  

&gt;She has never shown any nudity on the chat. I've asked once or twice in the past and she says no. That's 100% fine with me.

He has continuously been badgering her to strip for him and refusing to accept no for an answer, and he said that, just before he commented on the bookcase, he was 'complimenting her eyes' and physical appearance.  Probably after she asked him several times to stop.  So she blocked him as it was clear that he had no respect for her and kept 'asking' things of her to which she refused.  I would have told him off and blocked him too."
"Exactly. They were in a field, keeping to themselves and not bothering anyone. IMO she is the one causing more problems for the neighborhood."

"I'm an only child. I have had to overcome and get rid of some ''only child'' bad habits as I matured into an adult in order to improve my relationships and career. I'm sure people from big families have their own habits to break. But that's all they were... habits, not some major complex or syndrome.

His behaviour is selfish and he (you?) are just using a buzzword to justify it. Talk with him about this in an calm and non-judgemental manner, it will take time."

"Well, I know where she's coming from, but I think she's going about it wrong.

Not shaving I get - sometimes its a pain in the ass, and it really is unfair that women are expected to shave. But on the flip side, partners have preferences. And sometimes we have to compromise for those preferences.

There is a middle ground here where she shaves less often than she used to, but not frequently.

As for BO... well... BO is offensive. Not just to a partner, but to a world in general. She does not live in a commune where a stank is acceptable. She lives in a real world where people have to walk past her in the grocery store. 

I think she's being pretty childish about the whole thing. You can't just expect people not to have preferences.  Approach her with the fact that you want to compromise. If she's unwilling to compromise, ask yourself if she's still the person you want to be in a relationship with."

Have you ever address how these nasty hurtful comments make you feel? If this is the criticism you get, I can see why it would be difficult to be more adventurous sexually with him."

"I briefly dated a guy just like that in college. I'm not sure if ever realized the words he used didn't make him sound smarter, they made him look uneducated and ridiculous. And he always enunciated the phrases so dramatically, too. It was weird. Anyway, years later, I ran into him at a wedding for a mutual friend---he hadn't changed at all. He's not a bad guy--he's sweet, loving, etc. just really insecure, covered with a weird bravado, and anyway I'm glad I don't have to put up with it. I think you will be, too. Have you ever tried politely calling him on it? Like, ""lol, dude, what'd you just say?"" Or ""you know you didn't just say what you thought you did, right?"" "

"Sounds like your husband needs a reality check because he really doesn't understand how finances work and thinks that once an items is off his balance sheet then it doesn't exist. I think you might do well to sit down with a real financial planner that can talk to the both of you about long-term goals and spending, because maybe he's just not getting the message through you.

I mean, t seems like it's compounded by the fact taht your'e bailing him out and he's hiding all this spending on his cards.

Then start to draw really bright lines and don't worry about his dumb BS. You get that there's a problem and you know what it is, now it's just a matter of getting him to see that as well."

Her response was completely immature and I don't blame him for scoffing at her ""offer."" "
"Yea.. I'd bet money that the boyfriend IS NOT off drugs. First time he got caught stealing pills. The second time he pawned off what he stole. He's not a undiagnosed kleptomaniac,he's showing signs of drug abuse. "
Call her from your fiancé's phone.

"Apparently she's in thousands of dollars of credit card debt from these costumes (per a different comment). I would be freaking out about marrying her too, damn."
"Right? Of course she's allowed to move on and find love again and all that crap, but her child should be her first priority. The boyfriend's 10,000 kids are his own issue to figure out, not something an 11-year-old should have to ""adapt"" to. "
Why on earth are you working for free?
"I don't think he would have told me if she didn't boop me on Facebook and force his hand. He also said other things to me like how he was scared she would message us and try to ruin things ... but I saw that he had actually liked her posts between the time he said she forced herself on him and now.

I don't think their relationship is purely platonic considering what he told me about her feelings for him in the past and how he likes the validation now. 

&gt;Then added onto that was the use of the proposal as a tool to end the argument. That's like when someone uses an engagement ring as a tool of manipulation, it is really immature and disrespectful. Then the worst part of all, the fact that he couldn't assure you that he's over this girl.


That's exactly how I feel. It just seems like a proposal would be tainted now by him doing that. I'm so sad and broken up about it. Like I really don't know what to do."
"Talk to him: ""Bf, I am starting to feel unappreciated in this relationship for X, Y, and Z, reasons. It's starting to feel really unfair that I have to plan everything that we do together. This is really starting to affect how I'm feeling about the relationship in general and I need you to put in a bit more effort into our relationship by planning dates and things for us to do together. I'm not asking you to do all the planning, but I need to feel like you care about spending time with me, because right now I don't."" 

Your requests aren't unreasonable. Don't stay with this guy if he can't get off his ass long enough to put some effort into the relationship."
"I would recommend not talking to the principal and guidance counselor. They are mandated reporters and if they get wind of this, they will call Child Protective Services. "
"Tell him he either pays for his damn food or no more dinner nights and it's a deal breaker. It's not difficult to roughly do the math how much his food cost and I can totally see your point. I wonder what other things are unbalanced in your relationship.. Or tell him that from now on you pay 40% and he pays 60% of the bill. Or if you want to try playing game, order more expensive dishes yourself and watch his reaction, if he keeps ordering as per usual it's cool, if his portions start turning more expensive too then insist you pay no more than 40% that's it.       
Edit: no problem taking your phone out if it's difficult to do math in your head. It's a free world, no one knows what you do on your phone and who the heck cares anyway. If he's bothered he can pay the whole thing at least once in a while."
"TBH, if I went on 2 fairly quick dates and then waited a week+ to hear back from you (much less even plan a third one) and then after the third one you were already hinting at wanting sex, I would be pretty irritated with you. 

You can't even take the time to text ""hey I've been super busy with hurricane prep/whatever, but I had a nice time with you and want to plan another date when we are both free"" but you can take the time to hint at wanting to get in her pants? I would be soooo turned off by that. It gives the impression that you just want to use her for sex, which it sounds like that is really not what she wants. I would be really cautious going forward with you. 

Stop joking about sex. It makes her feel like a piece of ass. Get to know her more, make her feel like you're interested, text her more often and convey that you're interested and want to plan more dates. This will lead to her probably being more comfortable with and maybe even wanting to get down with you. "
"&gt;He says she really likes the fact that I'm making an effort to learn the language/assimilate when I bring up the issue, as in ""this is also a thing to adapt to"".

Next time he says this respond with, ""Yes. Exactly.  I'm already making an effort and changing myself.  I need your mom to meet me half-way. Please explain that I'm not yet comfortable with kissing on the lips.  Maybe I will become okay with it in the future, but the more she tries to force me, the less comfortable I am.""

Compromise means *both* people bend a little to meet in the middle.  Not one person does all the effort while the other does none.

So your boyfriend admitted to cheating on you and has a history of cheating. Just break up and move on. There's no reason to ever trust this guy ever again. 
"No no.  There's a big difference between men showing emotion, expressing pain, and otherwise acting human, and men who act like very, very young humans.  This guy is acting straight-up infantile, over-exaggerating life's minor cuts and bruises with totally disproportionate cries for attention.  Totally immature, for both men and women, no discrimination."
"I agree, especially since OP mentioned that her stepmom wouldn't let her see her dad when he was dying so it's not like he died suddenly and had no chance to review his paperwork one last time. It seems like he had the chance to ensure all of his ducks were in a row but he elected to not make any changes. "

"Appeal to logic. 72 hours is just not enough time to get a job and an apartment. They want you to get your shit together, so you won't live with them forever, but with their current demands that's impossible without you becoming homeless. Try to set a realistic timeline with them to move out, like a month from now.

If they don't agree with this, learn your legal rights and assert them. In most places in the US they'll have to give you a formal 30 day notice to evict you.

Either way use this month to find a job and a new place to live, but they can't boot you out with 72 hours of notice."
"It sounds to me like you have continued to grow and develop and he has not. He doesn't sound worth the sacrifices you make, to put it bluntly. If he was truly loving and supportive it would be a tougher call, but he is not. I think you should start making plans to move on."
Then it's time to make it clear that you choose her.

"My FMIL just offered her wedding ring to my fiance to give to me.  She asked him not to tell because she wanted it to be a surprise for me.  He talked to me about it right away, because his parents divorced and he didn't want me to feel pressured to wear it, and because it is OUR marriage and MY finger. 

 I simply don't want to start married life with a reminder of the divorce that tore my fiance's life apart at 17.

You need to remember that your brothers engagement and marriage is about NO-ONE but them.  You and your family have no right to guilt this poor girl in to memorializing a divorce and a deceased parent.  "

"No offense, but are you even sorry?  

You literally pushed your wife to go through with this knowing she was afraid and didn't want it. Was literally screaming ""Noooooo"" in the hospital for fuck sale. But from your post, all I hear from you is ""My dream is ruined. This isn't how I thought it would go, blah blah..."" Even though she TOLD you before how it was going to go. Sorry about your dream, I guess, but you ruined an honest to God living *person*. For your dream. Take off the rose-tinted glasses, bud. "
"&gt;Yes he plays music for a living but that is irrelevant to him as a person,

This isn't fair to him. Especially as a musician, he's likely passionate about that. It's a huge part of his life. Does *he* consider his music ""irrelevant to him as a person""? 

Honestly, there's judgement laced throughout your post. It doesn't sound like he's ""immature"", it sounds like he knows how to enjoy life. You aren't giving huge examples, but a musician singing along with his band doesn't really seem childish to me.  Telling someone to ""fuck off"" may be, but cursing is becoming increasingly more common. I recently attended a training session where the trainer, who's been doing it for years and been in the industry for decades, casually dropped the 'f' bomb quite frequently.

Maybe it's becasue I'm a parent, so I'm used to people able to easily switch between ""playing with kids"" mode to ""being a responsible adult"" mode, or do both simultaneously. Which isn't ""immature"", it's part of life.

A person can be intellectual, mature, and easy going.

So you might want to sit down and take a serious look at yourself. It sounds like you look down on him for what he does. You go on and on and on about all the ways he's ""not like other musicians"", but there are loads of musicians who are very intelligent, well read, even in academic careers before getting their start. 

If you're partly ashamed of him, then eventually he's going to notice and it's going to hurt your relationship. And if you're partly ashamed of him, you're never going to be able to convince your parents. Because they'll see that *you* are judging him as well, just keeping quieter about it.

"Nope, that's not what I said at all. If I talked to my boyfriend about wanting more sex, and he responded by saying I must have a sex addiction and brushed me off just to go and masturbate in the bathroom I would feel hurt and upset. Not because he *has* to have sex with me (which is not what I was implying or saying at all) but because he actively dismissed my concerns, shamed me for having a sex drive while he went to the bathroom to jerk it. "
"I agree with this, but I must call OP out on something:

&gt; Basically, we married when we were overweight at 23.

&gt;I'm not attracted to her

Think back to when you got married at age 23.  Were you attracted to her then ?  Yes, she lost weight and gained it back, but she looks like what she did when you first married her.  So you were attracted to her then, but now that you're in good health, you are no longer attracted to her.  Do you think you deserve better ?   You took vows of ""in sickness and in health"" right ?

I'm not saying you shouldn't divorce her - your lifestyles are very different now, you have grown apart, and she has resorted to manipulating you by trying to get you to ""prove your love to her"" by giving up your race.  This is ridiculously unhealthy and shows just how far you have grown apart.  It isn't really about the race, it's about you changing everything that you are, and her staying the same.  

If you want to save your marriage, then couple's counseling.  But I can tell from your post that you are resenting her deeply and don't really want to save your marriage because she hasn't changed in the way you have.  Marriage counseling or divorce - but don't leave her hanging, ok ?"

"Thomas isn't doing anything; all of this is their behavior.

They need to work on moving past what they're going through."
"Ask if you can come to one of his happy hours with his co-workers. 

I find it hard to believe that his co-workers NEVER invite their girlfriends/boyfriends/spouses.  

You don't have to come to go to every one, you just want to meet the people he works with.

This will show his female co-workers that he is in a serious relationship, and will probably put you more at ease.  

If he is against you EVER coming to ANY of his happy hours, he probably has something to hide.

Also, you guys should plan date nights during the week - something fun -so you don't feel like you only hanging out with him for ""boring stuff""."

Bottom line - if you get involved in this, things are going to be incredibly messy, incredibly unpredictable, incredibly up and down, and probably very very very far away from the reality you are imagining where you both live happily ever after.

"Okay, well, they can either step up this time or the cats can go to a shelter. This *cannot* become your responsibility. It will completely fuck your home life up and the cats likely won't benefit either. "

I felt kind of weird telling you then, but it feels even weirder to have you keep thinking that I remember stuff that I don't.""

She'll probably say ""no big deal"". I didn't have a traumatic accident and I can't remember much of my childhood now anyway. Hell, I don't even remember much of college (late 1980s).

Also, it feels like you are building up a lot of resentment towards her that she doesn't really deserve. She's here in a strange country with this seething stranger.   Maybe try to do a reset.

Re your friends, maybe its your part of the country? Or maybe they are catching from you a kind of negativity/anger? I have two friends who ended up in arranged marriages. I was pretty shocked, but most of us kind of rolled with it.

Maybe two years ago there was a post from a guy in an arranged marriage that seemed to work out well. Gonna try to find it."

"If you can't be ""young wild and free"" without being blitzed, you're doing it wrong. 

&gt; and as everyone knows, your judgement goes when you drink.

This happens when you have a problem with alcohol. Personally, I can take two drinks and stop. I know my limits, and I'm not dependent on the effects of alcohol to let me have a good time.

It is possible to go out and have fun and hold down on the drinking. I drink Jack and Coke when I go out with friends. After two, I catch the waiter and ask him to change me to just Coke, I've had enough Jack for the night. Nobody knows, and we all have a great time. Or I drink Guinness. Everyone knows you don't chug Guinness. A pint will last me about an hour.

My advice is to set a good example. Let her know that you'll be holding down on the drinking, but figured out ways to keep quiet about it. Don't tell her to do the same, just let her see you drinking less and having fun. Maybe she'll join you. If not, I'd let her know that you really don't want to be around her the next day because her self-inflicted seizures rip your heart out.

"There's really no way for you to know. In this situation, you only can know how *you* feel and do what's best based on that.

"You don't need to make everybody happy. Your brother and SIL's engagement is not about making everybody happy. It is about making *them* happy. It has nothing to do with you - you're not getting married to either of them, so you don't get to pick what ring they use!

I'm going to be very frank with you, OP. Your job, as your brother's sister, isn't to run around trying to make everybody happy. Your job is to shut your mouth on any comment that isn't ""I'm so happy for you both, congratulations!"" 

Your job is not to force your SIL to wear a ring she doesn't want. That poor girl is allowed to be happy with her own engagement ring. She's not a mindless walking prop for your mum's jewellery, she's a person with romantic dreams of her own, and if she doesn't want the ring her creepy overstepping inlaws are trying to force on her, your job as her new SIL is to admire what she chooses and say ""How lovely, I'm so happy that you've got a ring that you love"" and then shut your mouth. 

Your job as a niece is to take you aunts out behind the woodshed and read them the riot act for their petty, selfish behaviour. Your brother is under no obligation to keep them or you in his life if they cause grief and trouble to the person he loves best, and a small reminder of that wouldn't go amiss.  "
"I especially think that you need to take the initiative to keep yourself out of those situations, rather than force her to say it explicitly. For example, if a good friend is getting married soon and throws a similar bachelor party, you should decide on your own not to go. Don't put her in a situation where she needs to balance her concerns against her desire not to sound like she's holding it over your head. 

Years down the line, it might be a different story. But for now, you need to accept that you're both going to be feeling these effects for a year or two. For the time being, play it safe. "
"I will definitely move out when I start university. My brother says he will move out in four months, but I highly doubt it since he has a hard time saving money. Thank you."
This right here is the best advice!!! The best apology is changed behavior. She will never trust you with your friends if every time you all go out you get black out drunk or act differently around them than you would if she were there. She can and will earn your trust back by your words and behavior. All the best!

"Have you asked them if they really want you to be lonely for the rest of your life? You're only 52, you're still so young. How is it fair that they have companions, but you're expected to be at their service and ask nothing for yourself?

My dad was diagnosed with cancer when I was around your kids' age (26) and thankfully he's fully in remission, but I've wondered what would happen if he passed away young. It would break my heart for my mom to not have someone to have dinner with at night, breakfast in the morning, someone to dance with her at parties and weddings, someone to travel the world with, someone to make sure she's safe and happy. 

I'm sorry to say that your kids don't sound like especially great people. Unless you're leaving out some damning facts about Thomas, they sound very childish and selfish. They're adults now, you've done everything and more for them to flourish on their own. Take this time in your life for yourself and don't feel guilty for your happiness. You deserve happiness. If your kids are incapable of feeling happy for you, their hearts are black pits and nothing you do now can make them the generous and compassionate people that you hope they would be. "
"""It has always been the twins against my youngest.""

At the risk of sounding uncharitable about the twins because you did mention that they had a really hard time with their father's death and subsequently went through therapy... the twins are spoiled rotten and incredibly self-centered.

"i agree that you sound depressed...but that doesn't mean that this is all on you.

what i'm getting from this post is that...you married young to an older man who has a lot of baggage.
not only that, but he's bitter and cynical about said baggage.
not only that, but when this baggage affects your relationship negatively, even though he makes cursory efforts at addressing the issue, you feel that ultimately nothing changes.
not only that, but he ""jokes"" about using your relationship to spite his ex.
not only that, but you're carrying a lot of weight in the relationship. 
not only that, but it's pretty normal, when you're dating someone who's experiencing marriage and child-rearing before, to feel a little pang that they've done it before while it's brand new to you. 

that's a lot to handle. even if the rest of the relationship is strong, it's a lot to handle. these things might be affected by your depression, but i don't think your depression has *invented* them. 

don't make any rash decisions. talk through it with a therapist. not with the goal of fixing or ending the relationship, but just to clarify what you're really feeling and what you really want. now is the time for a lot of self-searching and introspection.

Please don't feel like you need to marry someone because of financial outlays.  She is not a good partner for you.  If she's willing to lie this extensively, then she will lie about other important things in your relationship.

"&gt;  she's the type of girl who doesn't really do drama and girl friends if you know what I mean.

That was really, really sexist and off-putting. No, I do not know what you mean. I had to point that out as that completely soured my opinion of this entire post and I'm going to be open about that bias right now.

You literally wrote a sentence saying ""Anna isn't like Rachel [...] she has a lot of friends and hobbies outside of me and is overall more independent."" That would be a red flag if I heard that statement from a significant other.

You are spending a large amount of time with your roommate's girlfriend, this is *reasonable* cause for concern. You sound very dismissive and angry towards your girlfriend and have honestly painted Rachel in a nicer light (or at least attempted to) than your own girlfriend of 5 years, which is extremely concerning.

1. You aren't forcing Rachel to pay rent even though she's likely making the utility bills increase. Did you ever make Anna pay rent/utilities when she lived with you? Did you split bills on dates with Anna, or was she more financially involved?

2. You and Anna used to bond by running and that was your ""thing."" Now you and Rachel do it- if Anna was here, do you think all three of you would do it together or that it'd just be a ""You and Anna"" thing. If you answered the latter, that's probably because it's more intimate for you two. If it's more intimate, then clearly it's logical for your girlfriend to be upset in this capacity as you are legitimately doing an intimate activity with another girl instead of your girlfriend, the one who lives with you...for free.

3. You simply spend almost all of your free time with Rachel now. Going to the gym, going on trips, going camping, running, going out, likely cooking, eating, cleaning, etc. as you live together. She is in your life every day. You likely spend more time talking to Rachel and being with her than you do texting/attempting to interact with your own girlfriend, and that's cause for concern.

Regardless, it sounds like you already are dismissing your girlfriends concerns as crazy and jealous so until you change your perspective and are willing to open your mind a little bit to reflect upon how your own actions may be perceived and how you are hurting her, then likely things aren't going to improve. Because you're not going to make your girlfriend ""magically stop being jealous"" until you improve and show a bit more consideration and respect for her and her feelings. 

Lastly, a footnote, saying you wouldn't cheat because ""Rachel is Mark's girlfriend, duh"" is a terrible reason. How about something better like ""I would never cheat on you, Anna, because I love you"" or ""I'm not attracted to Rachel and would not be with her even if we were both single."" Unless those aren't the main reasons, which is, again, concerning. 

And one more edit to point out something I noticed, you didn't list Anna's actual criticisms. You just said ""She's always criticizing Rachel to me."" Why is it that for some reason, those criticisms aren't listed? Either you think your girlfriend's opinions are invalid/wrong OR you think they're right but don't want to say negative things about Rachel...both of which are again, cause for concern. I think most people would be uncomfortable being the Anna in this situation, not just because of all of the time you're spending with Rachel but also how you choose to handle her concerns and how you're completely unsympathetic and void of any empathy. You don't come off as a good boyfriend based on this post, OP. I could be wrong, but I'm telling you this so that you can try to empathize a little more from her perspective."
"She left Jack, so she *really* doesn't get a vote in what happens afterwards. "
"I get what you're feeling, but what you're contemplating is legally binding yourself to someone that lied to you for three years about the future you're going to have together... because you feel bad that her parents will lose money. "
WTF isn't cool about voting in primaries and rinsing recycling? 
"She really did. 

What else has she been doing with her time? Has she used this as an excuse not to work or bring in income? "
"Look, I'm not in the habit of flippantly calling other people alcoholics, but if your GF is unable to limit her drinks to just one *and* is experiencing extreme health consequences as a result *and* gets resentful when anyone tries to help, she/you might want to consider that she is, in fact, an alcoholic and that she should not be drinking *at all*. That said, she is only going to stop if/when *she* wants to. You can only control yourself and *your* reactions. I can tell you, however, that nothing changes if nothing changes. 

I'm in recovery myself and understand that even one drink could easily lead to my death. My SO, bless his heart, is a normie who, like you, didn't *want* to stop drinking, but *did* because supporting me was, by far, a bigger priority for him. Lo and behold, our life has vastly improved. "
"&gt;  I bet OP's boyfriend wants to feel comfortable in his own home, which someone crying precludes.

Then he should move out. Or maybe grow up."
"That makes sense if her family is spread out and she uses Facebook etc to keep them up to date day to day. That is what social media is meant to be for really. It doesn't mean *you* need to use it in the same way, though. From knowing other mums etc I think it MIGHT come across as disinterest on your part or your wife is worried that it will appear to your family that you aren't as engaged as she is. I doubt this is the case! I would just explain to her what you said above that you do share photos just not through FB. "
"Omg that is not only exhausting but really manipulative in a way. The one person who is supposed to be on your side chooses the other team and is rooting against you. I had an ex like that and looking back it was just one of the tools he used to keep my self esteem down so that I would feel ""lucky"" to be with him. When in reality if I took the blinders off he was a piece of shit. (and I think deep down, he knew it.)"
"So when Lucy isn't there you just let them say whatever they like?  They aren't making fun of you, they're making fun of her and your relationship.  You should be shutting them down 100% of the time."
"If I were you, I might say something along the lines of, ""Boyfriend, I find you charming, intelligent and easy to talk to, however when you use overly flowery language it becomes difficult to have a conversation and your charm and eloquence can get lost. I love that you're so smart, but I think that that quality shines through your actions rather than an overly complicated vocabulary""

If that doesn't work, maybe be a bit more frank, ""boyfriend, I know I talked to you about this a bit before, but while you may have the intention of sounding smart when you speak like that, you end up coming off in the exact opposite way and it's becoming a turn off. This is beginning to be a real problem for me""

After that I would probably begin to think about breaking up. It's hard to be with someone like this because it can make them sound (at best), pretentious and like they are trying too hard and at worst uneducated and stupid. 

Hopefully your words will be enough to make him realize what he was doing wrong, especially because he sounds like a pretty reasonable guy aside from the obvious. Best of luck to the both of you.

"You are ridiculously cute. I think the ideas given are good-  pretty much any form of theatre. Fancy restaurants are good (if you need a jacket, it's fancy enough). I would also see if there are any galleries in your area, or if any museums near you have events - equally good reasons to dress up.

"Stick to your guns. Once they sit you down, listen to what they have to say, then tell them or show them what you wrote in this post. Tell them how when you feel accused that it erodes the trust and damages your relationship with them. I'm betting they'll be willing to listen. "

He would do anything to get me out of it. And your dude wants to make you stay? "

"This. Oftentimes when someone is fawning over you they are going to treat you like glass and/or downplay some key aspects. She has a undergrad they ""admire"" her for.

We can't help you if you don't want to help yourself. I'm assuming the last time you posted, people told you to work on yourself, and if that failed, get professional help. That still applies.

&gt;But I also don't want to hurt her.

You're hurting her far more by staying and wasting her/your time than you ever could by breaking up, you just don't have to see the tears.

&gt;I don't want to continue this relationship after I graduate. This is just a college relationship to me. HOWEVER, my gf wants us to stay together and move in together and start a life together.

The best thing would've been to not get into a relationship where you have different goals. The next best thing is letting both parties move on to someone who can match their goals. You really aren't doing her any favors by staying"
"It's one of the #1 rules of wedding etiquette that you don't propose at someone else's wedding. So if he does propose, the general reaction won't be ""wow that was romantic,"" it will be ""OMG, there's that tacky guy and the poor girl he proposed to.""

Maybe he doesn't care about the general reaction, but my point being, it would be doing a favor to him and his possible wife-to-be if you redirected him to proposing after the wedding.  If you have any mutual friends who the MOH's boyfriend might listen to, I'd lean on them to try to talk him into this."
"End the relationship, cut of all contact, and get yourself the help you so desperately need, OP. "
"Thanks, I think this may be the best approach. I guess I'm confused is because the ""higher end"" clothes we sell and she wears would still be considered ""casual"". She never wears slacks or blazers, just dresses, shorts and skirts.  So it's not like I can accurately model after her appearance. "

"You don't get pregnant from hugging, holding hands or kissing.

She's trying to push you to leave her by devising larger and more complicated mouse traps to conquer to win her love.

Healthy relationships have intimacy and that doesn't mean sex.  Physical contact is an expression of love and appreciation.  You are dating a friend at best.. a stranger at worst.  

Please love yourself and find someone who takes you, your feelings or your well being into consideration.  You deserve someone who treats you like a human being and doesn't dictate ridiculous rules with no compromise.

It will be hard to be alone since you haven't been for a very, very long time but once you adjust.. you are going to have a very good time and will find someone who doesn't make ridiculous and controlling demands."
"This is a fantastic idea. I think you should approach this from the angle of a 'divorced parents' set up - one bedroom in each place. Sure, for now she'll end up spending more time at your mother's. But have her put every single valuable thing she has at her room/space in your apartment/house. That way, no matter what happens at that place, if one of the kids steals or destroys her stuff, it's not anything particularly valuable of hers. Do laundry at your apartment for her (so nothing gets mixed in / 'borrowed' perpetually), go grocery shopping with her and keep her food at your place etc.
&amp;nbsp;

My father's now on his fifth marriage and I have a lot of experience dealing with this kind of split scenario when dealing with other kids that are unrelated but of a similar age. An 11-year-old will usually be particularly concerned with ownership of things, and use of space. If you can keep all her valuables at your safe place, and additionally give her her own space at your place, it would significantly ease the anxiety she would get by being at your mother's.
&amp;nbsp;

All that being said, this is a horrible idea on your mother's part and your sister is going to feel like she's being ignored and replaced. I worry about her safety with the younger boys - there's no way in hell they should be rooming with her no matter what type of kids they are. She'd probably never get any sleep or have space to do her homework, be expected to look after the little ones quite often, and be expected to share every single thing she owns with nothing in return. I sincerely think you should call CPS and seek advisement on the future situation, and speak to your mother about how bad this would be for the development and education of your sister."
"i am a HUGE dog lover but this little pit has got to go. your fiance needs to bring him back to whoever was taking care of him before. it is INSANE that she would say you have to respect his boundaries. especially since his boundaries mean 'don't go near her'

even if he didn't get crazy when you kissed her, and only did it when you opened the fridge, or put on a coat, or brushed your teeth or whatever, you can not be expected to live somewhere that you have to feel like you're on the constant lookout. 

he's bitten people before and he tries to bite your face. YOUR FACE. it would be bad enough if he was just going for your ankles but this is straight up wrong. wrong. wrong. wrong.

i seriously can't understand how she doesn't see the issue here. i would say to tell her she has to choose between you or the dog. seriously. "
"Write down *all* the chores that have to be done around the house, and check off ones that you have done. Let him see this. After he knows what you do, from then on, only do half of them. Cut out chores to get down to that mark, and let him see what he *should* be doing."
"Eeeewwwwww.  Ew. Ew.  

Sorry, I'm reeling.  That's seriously revolting.  That would be a deal breaker for me.  So gross.  Did he think you'd never find them?  Like, you guys would never move or something?

"While it may hurt that your boyfriend isn't ready to put on his mouse ears with you and take a visit to Tomorrowland, it's not the end of the world.

Couples generally need separate interests. If you both loved the same things it would be fun for awhile, but there would be nothing novel. If your boyfriend doesn't like Disney, that can be your space you go to when you need a break from your boyfriend (and you will).

Take solace in the fact that he says that for now it's not worth his money, You guys are young so I'm guessing that you don't have the most disposable income at the moment. So it is understandable that he wouldn't want to blow what money he does have on something he's not that interested in.

All that being said, if at some point in the future he's not even willing to fake enthusiasm in what you're interested in, then there's a slight problem. But for now, let him be Grumpy, don't take it personally."
I have had people contact me pretending to be friends in a crisis twice... so it does happen.
"&gt;How do I either compromise with her or let her off easy that this isn't my preference?

First, communicate your preferences using ""I"" statements. As in ""I really like wearing surf shirts and shorts when I'm not at work. I like casual clothing when it's up to me. I don't mind dressing up for special occasions, or for work, but on my own time, I like to dress casually."" Notice the use of I/me/my in that script. You're not saying *she* has bad taste, or that you think *her* ideas are bad. You're simply stating what you want. That's important, because if she says ""you hurt my feelings"", you can reply back ""I am talking about what I want; I'm not attacking the choices you make for you, just saying that I get to make choices for myself.""

Now, compromise can be easy. Wearing matching clothes on your honeymoon sounds sweet. So you can tell her that when you two are on vacation, the matching outfits are fine. Holiday get-togethers with family are also a good compromise to offer: Christmas, Thanksgiving, 4th of July. 

There's another possible compromise here: when you two are *alone*, in the privacy of your own home, you want to wear *comfortable* clothing, right? So the other compromise is that when you're at home, you two can have matching sweat-pants/hoodies/board shorts that you both change into. You can call it ""Mr. Rogers changing his shoes"" or say you're taking off your grown-up costume. You two can still be matching, but you're matching in clothing that *you* find comfortable. "

"He's definitely focusing on the wrong issue here - his resentment stems from being restricted in activities due to injuries, and her resentment stems from his lack of sexual interest due to increased work due to injuries, but that doesn't mean becoming angry at the injuries themselves is a productive route.

He has to figure out what he actually wants from her, because ""stop hurting yourself"" isn't reasonable. ""Be understanding of the burden your injuries impose on me"" is, because she's definitely being unempathetic in multiple ways - saying her injuries don't affect him at all, and making his lack of interest about herself.

Another reasonable request might be to be over-the-top with gratefulness when he goes out of the way for her when these things happen, maybe with some pampering (thinking-of-you gifts, special one-on-one time, something that she knows he likes). Or an agreement on some kind of celebration whenever she recovers from an injury, so he has a light at the end of the tunnel to look forward to. He had to focus his feelings on the fixable."
"No. Tell him to be a fucking adult, help out with the baby and house, or it's over. There is no power tripping in a partnership. He's such a cringey ass piece of shit trying to 'train' you. Tell him to train himself to be a decent human being."
I took him to my friends mom who is a vet. She checked him out and I told her what happened and they said he's free to stay with them for the time being if I wanted. He is doing good now and is back to his happy self.
"This is going to hurt to read but

You're projecting your insecurities onto your boyfriend. If you don't cut this shit out you're going to most likely scare him away. You can't blame him for things your ex did."
"Tell him this arrangement isn't going to work out. He needs to find a new place ASAP.

You mentioned your roommate has a boyfriend. It's time for him and some of your guy friends to start spending a lot of time at your place when the two of you are there to ""check"" Michael so he doesn't feel like he can bully and be spiteful to his female roommates, as once you lay down the law that you want him out you can expect him to be nasty.

* Make sure you and Jen lock your doors when you're not home.

* Have him move the dog into his bedroom. (this is where male friends to apply pressure come into play, ""Bro, why is the dog crate in the living room again? OP and Jen told you before to move it into your room."")

* Look on Craigslist or ask around to expedite him finding another place. Remind him he needs to be out by the Last week of September, no exceptions (you *don't* want him to establish 30 day residency which would give him tenancy rights).

Edited to add -- Since you and Jen just signed the lease in July, I'm assuming Michael is not on it. If he is getting him out would be harder, but not impossible."

"i am your current SO in my own relationship. my girlfriend used to date tall, athletic, good looking climbers. they wouldn't treat her badly, but the aforementioned qualities were really the only things going for them.

i'm the geeky nerd. i'm not in great shape, and i'm not particularly good looking. but i treat her well, i take good care of her, i am loving and attentive, and i have a great career.

take the words ""cool"" and ""uncool"" out of the conversations with him immediately. telling him that he is ""uncool"" compared to your ex, and saying that you don't care is NOT ok. we don't even hear the second part. all we hear is ""you're not as cool as my ex."" stop saying that shit. 

no matter how nerdy, geeky, or boring we are, we are still men. we want our women to look at us with adoring eyes and think that we're the most macho, amazing, sexy man in the world even though we know we are not. "

"Having a large family, maybe your parents would rather you entertain each other and help look after the other kids? I'm not justifying this at all, it sounds absolutely terrible, just giving a reason."

"He's a teenager. He saw an easy opportunity and jumped on it. I am happy he wants to use protection and also cares about his sister enough to throw himself under the bus. 

Good kid here."
"Well if they're all terrified about her protected status, then I don't think there's much you can do.  And if they are correct in being terrified, then you causing problems could put a target on your back.  Honestly I'd just either suck it up or find a new job.

But, it sounds like they are very sensitive to threats of legal action.  So I suppose you could document the favoritism and make your own threats.  "
"You're being too kind. He ditched her and their 2-month-old on her first Mother's Day to get wasted at a strip club. You can't blame his friends for that. There's no excuse. He's a selfish asshole and needs to grovel for the way he acted and grow up. 

You simply don't get too drunk to come home and not communicate with your partner, leaving them to worry with an infant at home alone. That is wildly irresponsible."

"This is just the beginning and you have already spotted a few red flags. You can probably expect more to come, some likely bigger than these. 

Try to confront your wife about these issues and perhaps also her parents. If not, you can seek out a therapist who can advice you as an objective third party and communicate your feelings and thoughts to the rest of your family. The third party can be a therapist but also other family members who might agree with your POV. If none of these options work, I would recommend finding a place for yourself and let your wife join you if she wants to. These are not minor, trivial issues but are reasonable, sound, and, most importantly, valid issues.

&gt;but who knows how long that could be.

No one. Do, however, prepare for the worst and assume this could last up to several months, if not even years. Can you live under these standard for that period of time? Realistically, other, bigger issues will most likely occur the longer you stay."
"It's not exactly healthy to look at prescription medication as a way to ""treat yourself."" "
"You are both right. And it is your body so you chose what to do with it.

He sounds great. He loves you just as you are and considers you perfect already. He is telling you that, and he is telling you that he supports you in your choice even if it is not his choice. I expect he will live you just as much as you are going to be, and will support you just as much."
"So:

1. Don't deliberately hide things from your partner. First of all it makes them feel bad that you think they're the kind of person to be turned off by that kind of thing. Second you can't hide things forever, the longer it's been hidden the bigger the blowout. Third, you're saving time. If it's a dealbreaker, you find out early on and thus don't have to waste time only to realize ""hey I could've been with someone more compatible"". If it isn't, you can have an early, open conversation and move on with less hurdles. It helps build context for your relationship.

2. People feel how they feel about things. What's NOT ok is how he spoke to you about it. He degraded you, insulted you, and made assumptions about you based on...? That isn't how you talk to someone you care about. He doesn't care about you - harsh reality. And turns out with the way he's acting, he's exactly like the guys you used to sleep with. Onto the next ~pure innocent girl that's good enough for him. He just stuck it out a bit longer. You don't deserve that.

3. His behaviour after the fact aka ghosting you and all that is not how you act EIGHT MONTHS into a relationship. You say this is different from your usual argument. That means it's done. Accept that and please move onto better things.

I'm sorry this happened to you OP. "
"Again, if the lines were drawn more definitively this wouldn't be an issue. For instance, if OP told her that their relationship will be separate from his child full stop, he would know by her actions that she doesn't respect his boundaries and can move on to someone who will. What I've read so far is someone making their discomfort known in very specific cases instead of introducing a catch-all edict to draw definitively lines so that similar scenarios can be avoided (either by her being aware and stopping before crossing any lines or OP simply breaking up with her).

The whole ""finding new ways to do the same thing"" stems from the fact that Sarah clearly WANTS to be a mother figure to his son. However, OP avoids spelling out his wants (or maybe he doesn't quite understand what he wants himself) in a clear way. A simple ""No, I do not want you to involve yourself in my son's life in a mother's capacity at all"" should get the point across and makes everyone's lives easier. What I'm afraid of is that OP wants the benefits of a partnership and the feeling of completeness that Sarah brings to their little unit, but also want to keep her at arm's length because he's not fully grieved his wife. In which case, keeping Sarah in limbo is detrimental to both his son and herself."
"Personally I'd point out that avocados oxidize and brown, so it will end up look unappetizing, and that the fish she picked out won't be safe to eat.  The casserole video might have been popular, but was likely served right away and not sitting out for hours on end at a party.  When you say stuff like ""that looks like vomit"", it's more hurtful than helpful. Say what's wrong without rubbing their face in it."
"I stress-lost 35 lbs this year. I'm 110 lbs right now with huge bags under my eyes. My fiancé has been nothing but kind and supportive. The sex hasn't stopped. He compliments my ""new"" body but also tries to help me eat and makes sure I know he finds me just as sexy now as he did before.

Your BF is an awful person. Dump him. I promise there are men out there who will love you at any size, and understand that stressful events can change a person's body. If he really loved you, he'd be concerned about your health, not his boner. 

Asking for naked pics from an ex is cheating, by the way. If you're not sure you agree, ask yourself - would you ever ask YOUR ex for naked pics? And if you did, how do you think your current BF would react?"
"You just have to tell her you're not into her romantically or sexually, and it might be a good idea to create a little distance for a bit. Maybe hangout in less romantic settings. "
"If she can visit you often, offer her a shelf she can put really sentimental things. Even a locjbox is no guarantee and in sure she has things she'd be heartbroken if they got broken or stolen. "
"Wow, no you're not overreacting. He told you he was too busy to get you, after you loaned him your car and made arrangements, and when you show up, he's just chilling with his roommates? He didn't have the decency to give you a heads up or even reply to your texts. I can't think of an excuse that would pardon that for me. Take some time, think it over and then have a discussion with him (if you find you have an interest in trying to fix it)"
Do you share any mutual friends with your exes who may be able to give you insight?
"It's not a matter of being evicted for having ""too many"" children, it's having more than the maximum number of people living in an apartment. That maximum number is determined based on the number of bedrooms in an apartment. Children usually count differently (e.g. a studio apartment that usually limits tenants to 2 would not include infants/very small children in that number), however children of these ages would absolutely be included in the overall resident count. 

Edited to add: If 2 adults in a studio apartment have a baby, they will not be evicted. However if they stay in that apartment and have twins when the first is a year old, depending on the tenancy rules, the apartment management might tell the family that they need to move to a larger apartment or risk eviction. "
"""I'm basically the greatest person to ever live (I've met many famous people lol) and am just overall an incredible soul. Just incredible. The best, really. But for some reason people don't want to be with me :( :( :(""

Gee, I wonder why."
"The answer is No. Certainly, you want to make time for the rest of the family as a group—you'll want to show some respect for your mother's choice to blend these families—but your sister is your sister. You make separate time for her. Just stand your ground on that one.

You also may find your Mother is less resistant to the idea of your sister spending time with you once she has 5-9 other ones to worry about. Suddenly, one less for a night won't seem like such an issue. Let her get through one or two weekends with them all underfoot, and then ask if your sister can see a movie and have a sleepover with you. Work up from there."
"You called it OP. There's being a delicate flower. Then there's being an asshole. You don't get to visibly pout but say your emotions aren't anyone else's problem. He *makes* it everyone's problem. 

I'd just stop inviting him anywhere and when he asks to come just be honest. ""I will be staying out past 11. I do not want to be around you if you're going to get into a sulky mood so I'm giving you the heads up now."" 

But honestly? He sounds exhausting. He is publicly pouty. He expects you to go home early and/or deal with his moods no matter how much he says he doesn't. He refuses to keep his childlike whining and sulking to himself. I could never put up with it. I'd feel held back and resentful and I sure as hell wouldn't want to build a life with him. All I can imagine is him being a complete jerk at your wedding because ""his suit is kinda hot"". "
"&gt;After a particularly stressful weekend where my mom thought she had misplaced a family heirloom, it turned out that Emily ahd taken it without asking to wear to a party and didn't apologise or explain, just started crying and then ran away and went home. So, my mother told Adam that Emily was no longer welcome as an overnight guest since she's been so disrespectful. 

Haha WOW. Your mom let her off easy. I would have filed a police report on Emily's spoiled, thieving ass.

Look, there's the usual ""parent freaking out about their child dating"" situation, but... this is not that. If anything, I think your family has been TOO nice and accommodating to Adam and Emily. And what has it gotten you?  Their behavior has only become more greedy, selfish and demanding. You gave an inch and they took a mile.

As hard as it is, I would honestly call their bluff with no contact. I would sit Adam down for one last conversation and say, ""We love you, and you are always welcome back in our lives. It will break our hearts if you choose to cut your family off over money. But we cannot and will not continue to give in to your and Emily's outrageous behavior. If that's a dealbreaker for you than I'm truly sad about that, but my mind will not change.""  

Your brother and Emily are still relatively young -- that certainly is no excuse for their overall behavior, but there is the possibility that one or both of them will grow up. And I think that's especially true if Adam is forced to deal with Emily on his own, without his family to conveniently have around as scapegoats. Make it clear your arms are open to him, but that he is also responsible for his own choices and his own life."
"&gt;I have seen women like what OP's boyfriend describes

Why are you judging OP for the actions of others?   Since when did OP have a child?  Project much! 

I find it ironic that you are offended when certain women want to stay away from men like you - yet you are completely justified and sanctimonious about ""staying away"" from women you deem ""lesser"".

The misogynistic hypocrisy around here is off the charts today!"
"I mean honestly there's two issues here, there's the racial part but also the gender one. Do you really wanna be with a guy who talks about women like that, constant crude remarks about women's bodies?"
[deleted]
I'm going to focus more on the relationship than his profession here. Is he similarly dismissive when it comes to things that aren't academic? Is he judgmental? Does he view other people as beneath him? Because I can't see this behavior existing in a bubble that only comes out when he's reading someone's thesis or grading papers. 
"Yeah I'm very confused. OP is apparently 24, the whole post would be more understandable if he was more like 16. We're definitely not getting the full story. "
"You're not overreacting. There is zero chance I'd want to be around anyone who smacked me in the face. ""But I was drunk"" is not an excuse, and you deserve a real apology. 

I would explain this to your girlfriend, and if she truly keeps defending her roommate, I'd question the relationship and whether it was worth it to stay. "
"Did you ever talk to her about your expectations beforehand? 

It's not a matter of what's right or wrong in general here, but what is right and wrong for you and your relationship.

It kind of sounds like she didn't think she did anything to be upset about, and that she was honest with you about what went on (if that is not the case then the story changes a lot). If you expected her to behave a certain way and she didn't know that, then you should probably have a conversation with her and explain why you felt hurt, without being too judgey at her, just to explain it for the future."
"There is no easier way to put this, so I'm just going to say it. You and your husband are both suckers and your sister knows it."
"Would your mother have been the one to pick out her engagement ring if she was still alive?  It's upsetting to all of you (and yes, you totally come off as angry) because you have built up this idea in your head. You want a compromise, but let me level with you...a compromise in this case is ridiculous.

I get that your mother died, and that's sad, and I'm very sorry. However, that does not in any way mean that you and your family are entitled (and yes, you are all acting very entitled) to dictate anything in your SIL and brother's marriage. You don't get any more say or rights over this situation than anyone normally would. You seem to be under the impression that your SIL is acting selfishly, but actually, it is you and your family that being selfish. You are absolutely in the wrong on this situation. I think you need to think about why you have this idea that your SIL owes all of you this, and why she should make her engagement about your emotional needs, and not her own? Even suggesting a ""compromise"" on her part is extremely selfish and awful on all of your family's end.

Someone suggested this earlier, but let's say it again: If the ring means so much to you, swap out your own ring, and wear that instead. Would you be willing to do that? If so, problem solved! If not, ask yourself why you're requesting something from your SIL that you don't want to do yourself. 

Your mom meant well, and it was a nice gesture, but alive or deceased, she doesn't get to make those sort of demands on someone else's engagement. To be very blunt, it's odd that your mom held on to a ring from a divorce to give to her son. It's her thing to do, but people don't buy rings from pawn shops for the reason that it is considered bad luck to wear a ring from someone else's failed marriage."
"&gt;She's been distant and avoiding me. 

Good, at least all her abuse got you somewhere this time. Keep it that way. "
I agree with this the problem is within yourself. As a Latina woman it's frustrating always being sexualized in the same way you're describing in the work place. You're basically admitting that there is nothing wrong with the new girl and that you feel bad for feeling completely irrationally (not trying to rub your face in a you're wrong kind of way but obviously you identify something in this equation isint adding up). You're saying you want to have your peers not treat you equally? I would give my left perky tit to be treated equal at the work place and not like a sexual object. Imagine going to Yale trying to be the boss of your own company having it flop and then start a new job where the men are clearly not taking her seriously because of her looks and she likely is picking up the vibe of your jealousy. How much she has done to not be defined by her looks and yet there she is... So I really think just don't compare yourself to someone else and work out why it is you're projecting your version of individuality onto this other person.
"Good rule for baby-parenting: both parents get equal amounts of free time (i.e. time that is not work or baby-parenting).  My spouse and I actually put together a spreadsheet of day-to-day time spent, to make sure the free time distribution was fair.  

So if he gets to go out twice a week, you get to go out twice a week for the exact same number of hours (or, considering how old your baby is, to take a nice long uninterrupted nap twice a week).  If there aren't enough hours in the week to allow you to do that twice a week, Hubby needs to cut down on socializing time.  "
"We moved the utilities into our name last week. 100%. They're living on SS and a small pension and we have jobs. Seemed like the right thing to do. We've also taken over all of the cleaning, cooking, grocery shopping, driving, etc. 

MIL is healthy enough to walk down the street for a shower. FIL has a scooter. It doesn't seem like a massive problem to them because ""that's how it's been forever."" 

Time for an uncomfortable conversation I guess."
"Disagree. My ex constantly told me that I *never* compromised and did what he wanted. I'd drive up with him to go look at cars/go to car shows/find parts for his car, but the few times I said no and suggested we do something *not* car related, he'd tell me I never wanted to do what he was interested in. In my experience, people who use statements like ""You never do **insert thing here**"" are generally exaggerating in a massive way because they're not getting what they want in that moment. "
"Yep, there's a respectful way to complain/vent about your partner, and I'd even say it's healthy to do so. It does help keep you from making an issue about the little things that definitely don't matter in the grand scheme of life if you can just complain to your friend about it. That is not what this guy is doing. There's no love in his words. There's no respect. Just bile and contempt. "
"In a comment he says that they would all be in the same room in 2 double bunk beds- 5 kids in her room during the week, 8 kids in her room during the weekends plus she'll share a bed with the 7f."
"Slowly distance. 

He will burn himself out eventually. Or he's just going to be that 40 year old still clubbing...with no job or no decent relationship in his life.

These people are fun 1/10 times.....and now that your older that number is getting smaller.

Sounds like he is hanging out with the other guys more anyway, which is good. Just stop putting any trust in him, don't invite him to things that you need to rely on him for, and distance yourself."
"THIS! ^^^^^^ A thousand times over, this. He had your car, your keys, there is no way he ""forgot"" or should even have said he didn't want to do it considering he got the free use of your car for two months and couldn't even offer the common courtesy of arranging a ride for you.

I'm sorry OP, it sounds like he used you for your car. Or there is something seriously wrong with him, but stop second-guessing yourself. It's not that he didn't pick you up. It's that you loaned him your car and the agreement was he'd pick you up at the airport. And yet he broke that agreement then acted like it was nothing. No shame, no sorry, no I'm the biggest turd in the world and let me make it up to you.

Dump him or expect plenty more of this behavior. In fact I'm not too sure that wasn't deliberate just to see if you'd put up with his gaslighting and bad behaviors. My advice - don't. "
"You should probably not have a joint account that he can access - that only works if the two of you are on the same page. If he's that irresponsible, he gets a small checking account that has $X deposited in it weekly. When it's gone, it's gone. Either that, or he manages his own money and you *never* bail him out.

Berating you is a deflection - this isn't your problem. He doesn't make enough money to support his lifestyle and his past irresponsibility, and he needs to *own* that. Once you're getting wage garnishments, it's a sign you've pretty badly screwed up. Obviously shit happens to people, but the difference comes in how you move forward and *learn from it*."
"Your wife will never make you a priority in this marriage. Your MIL will always come between you and your wife. At this point, you need to talk to your wife, let her know how you're feeling and honestly, maybe look into some couples counseling. Don't stay with your wife if she can't prioritize you in the marriage and set boundaries with her mom. "
"&gt;Am I wrong for wanting to distance myself from them?

Not wrong at all. They're irresponsible fantasists. Had they had more time, they probably would have been able to find places for all the creatures, but unfortunately nature has intervened."

"Never never never never n e v e r have kids out of a sense of obligation to someone else. You need to decide if *you* want this child for your own happiness. Also, you're not even in your 30s, it's a little too soon to be worrying about who dies first when you're old.

Have you and your husband considered going to a couple's therapist just so you can hash out the details and see where you both stand?"
"Stop doing the work around the house, grocery shopping, and cooking I actually ended things with an ex-finance for this (among other reasons).

I'm not on social media. I've blocked her number. I am considering getting a new job. I don't know why it took me so long to realize how awful she is. 
"~~You tell her to fuck right off~~ 

Yeah, okay don't but *damn* your ""friend"" is being awfully shitty. Imagine if T's friend kept asking if he was okay with you not having huge boobs because his ex did (obviously hypothetical but you get my drift). Why does she care so much about her perceived image, and *why in the fuck* did she bring up your tall ex? Either way, I respect T for having the patience and kindness to try to keep the peace.

Personally, I believe you have two choices:

1) You stop associating with G because she's petty and you don't value that characteristic.

2) You draw a firm line in the sand and have a frank conversation with her. You are happy with T and that ""how it looks"" isn't important to you. Tell her you will not accept her bringing it up again."
"Idk about you, but I'd rather disappoint my parents than marry a stranger and be forced to be unhappy.

"You sound really immature. Break up, for her sake, and don't pressure your next girlfriend into doing things she doesn't want to do. She didn't lie, she changed her mind. She's allowed to. She's also allowed to change her mind about anal, and it's incredibly shitty of you to keep pressuring her into that when it's clear she doesn't want to do it. This entire post is you being selfish and immature. Focus on growing up a little and thinking about your partner's feelings - not just yours - before you get into another relationship."
Vaginas are self cleaning and have a particular pH. Go back to your gyno and tell them / ask them if the 'hygiene' routine is appropriate. It's probably a waste and can causing other issues if used around such sensitive seas so frequently 
Every single post here says the same thing so I don't need to echo but I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU ARE 29.
"It is. Honestly, the cringe is not bothering me as much as this.

My ex thought it to be 'fun' to have debates at night when I just wanted to share my feelings about something and rest after a long day at work. He used to tell me it was 'fun' and 'thrilling' to have these clash of opinions.

Obviously it wasn't for me, I was so tired, I just wanted someone to say 'ofc Grey's Anatomy is the best show ever honey, whatever makes you happy, yes I love to hear about all those characters I know nothing about' (this is sarcastic but you get my point,  I wanted support just for stupid stuff that made me happy) but he had to always go FULL ON debate mode about the social and intelectual and whatever repercursions on society and whatever GOSH.

Also he was very jealous of everything and very controlling. TBH OP your guys sounds like my ex, except for the cringy talk. Being jealous was the first red flag for me. It's normal to be jealous but not to an unhealthy extent.

tl;dr: you're getting tired of his bs. been there done that. "
Also one of those children. I'm 32 and I still wish they would get divorced. 
"This isn't a case of mix matched expectations, it's complete lack of respect for you. It's not like he didn't know you needed the eggs for the cake you told him. He literally forgot your birthday until some one else said something. He had a whole day to panic and come up with something shitty last minute which he even offered to do (tidy) and then didn't bother to follow through on."
"I think the problem is we can't really visualize this table situation in any way that doesn't just look weird. See if I was standing on a table is have to then bend down to get a chicken wing and...yeah just all weird in my head. So let's shelve it for now.

Listen awkward question. Is there any chance that you've been evaluated or diagnosed with Asperger's or any learning disability affecting ability to recognize social cues?

Another thing I'm noticing is you seem slightly unable to translate what's going on in your head. Even your writing style when you respond to others references ""that"" or ""this."" Dolphinesque indeed wrote multiple paragraphs and your responses were really hard to understand because we don't know what ""this"" or ""that"" you're talking about when you respond without referencing the point you're responding to. 

Don't pay attention to people getting frustrated with you on here. It'll only send you into a tailspin. For now you need to get your butt evaluated or in front of a good therapist where you can talk these things out. 

For now, practice EMPATHY. When you enter a room, make an effort to genuinely learn something about someone. Don't intrude with comments or come off like the party therapist, but maybe try and ask someone about how their week was. If they tell you about a bad work situation, listen. Offer encouragement. Don't bring yourself up. Don't try to be witty. ""Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I really hope it works out for you."" ""I think you'll be great blah blah...""

Try to focus on being #2, not #1. No one likes the guy trying for attention. 

As for a therapist or psychiatric evaluation, please do this. These people will be able to provide you with tools on social interaction you may not currently have, and will do so in a manner that doesn't overwhelm you. 

One day at a time. Be kind to yourself and others. Good luck."

"&gt; She could go months without speaking to me.

Take that as the blessing it is and continue to limit her negative presence in your life.

&gt; She has never apologized in her life.

She won't this time either. All you can do is tell her not to take any of your pills again and then hide them from her as best you can. I suppose you could threaten to involve the police, but that's either an empty bluff or the nuclear option depending on whether you'd go through with it."
"&gt; As a coming father I don't mind unsolicited advice at all, so I can't understand her view in any way.

So imagine one day you're out with the baby and you decide to take a picture of the baby in his/her car seat. You post said picture on your Facebook or wherever. But what's this? Baby's seat isn't buckled! Even though the car isn't moving and the keys aren't in the ignition and there's zero risk of Baby falling out because you're right there.

Now, who do you think gets hellfire rained down upon them for this? Dad, who is ""babysitting"" his child and therefore just doesn't know better, or Mom, who is 100% responsible for anything that is done with the child no matter who does it because mothers are expected to be completely devoted and if they express one single failing then nothing they ever do for their child is right and they are bad parents who deserve to be judged harshly because people LOVE to judge mothers which is a big part of the reason why PPD is on the rise.

Don't try to logic your way through this one. Just because it doesn't make sense to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen. "
"Yes.  Valuables and anything not really valuable but sentimental.  Accidents can happen and kids can be cruel.  These kids are older so your sister may like having a couple older sisters, but they are also at the age where they may have friends over who may not respect your sister's stuff.  I would want to keep something like a favorite shirt in a location where I know someone else won't try to wear it.  Stuff like that."
"Sounds like a real winner...

OP, your next boyfriend will offer to buy you tampons, and will pick up chocolate while he's out, and will never leave jizzrags under the couch."
"It happens. 

Story time:

My best friends husband had anger issues, but she always said ""it's okay. He's in therapy! He acknowledges it!"" Like it swept away all the things he did. He then started blocking doors so she couldn't leave, holding her arm so she couldn't leave, pushing her, until it eventually turned into him slapping her arms, legs, and stomach. She always excused it away. ""Everything else about him is perfect! He bought my this necklace last night! It was totally my fault I said his pants were ugly!"" This went on for a number of years. She's currently in an assistant living home because she's paralyzed from the waist down. Him? He's in prison for attempted murder, on top of a slew of other things I won't get into here. 

Run. It always escalates. It's not your job to fix him while exposing yourself to all of the abuse he slings. "

And maybe get some security cameras.

What else do you think she's been creeping through while you're not home? Chances are nil that she hasn't been looking through everything there is to look through. "

"You can sleep with whoever you want. She can leave and stop being your friend whenever she wants. 

Honestly you sound like you're not a very good friend. You turned a trip with your good friend into blowing her off and bringing someone you know she detests into your shared space where you were staying. That's pretty shitty. It seems like it's much more about you being a bad friend than you sleeping with one guy. "
"&gt; I explained this to her multiple times, but she always seems to ""forget"" our conversations and brings the issue up every time we talk.

1.) Cut down on talking to her. Like instead of once a week, talk to her once every few weeks. Tell her you're super busy lately. 

2.) When she asks again about moving to you, just say, ""Sis, like I told you last time, that isn't going to work for me."" End stop. 

3.) Stop feeling so guilty. If I know how families work, sis and baby won't starve or go homeless. Your family back home will ensure the necessities. Your freeloading sister just wants a full time nanny (you) and free housing while she manhunts in a new country. 

OP, if you value your life and marriage, grow a spine and don't let your sister guilt you into this. "
"NO. No no no. DO NOT WAIT 2 DAYS TO CALL.

The dog could come over in the next 30 minutes. Could come over tomorrow. Do not trust your neighbors to keep their dog in check. They've shown you they obviously won't. You are putting your health and your pets health in the hands of fate for 2 days because you want to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Don't do that. Please call. Like now. After that look up security cameras for your porch if possible. Protect yourself and your pet family. Fuck your neighbors."

"A 25 year old and a 37 year old typically do not have that much in common. 25 year olds are in a more transient state of life, typically, and 37 year olds are *usually*  more settled. Not saying that's always the case, but USUALLY this is true.

Yes, they typically have less baggage because they've lived shorter lives. But the point of dating, for many, is finding someone to spend their life with. That 25 year old will age and accumulate more baggage with more lived experience. Does that mean you will dump her for a younger, hotter model when she's 37?  

Emotionally delayed means immature. A 37 year old dating a 25 year old is typically immature. "

"Something about this rubs me the wrong way. It seems...manipulative? to ""subtly guide"" your spouse. Someone who should be your equal. This sounds like something done at work to be diplomatic or with a child who can't handle being wrong yet.

Sometimes it hurts my feelings when my partner says something sucks or how I did something totally wrong, but I'd rather know his actual opinion instead of being coddled."
"&gt; I'm still damaged by it, to be honest, because it was really unfair of them to put all the work and expectations on me, and then punish me when my siblings didn't do what they were supposed to do. I'm not the parent, they are; yet I was expected to be a parent and in charge and responsible for everyone at the ripe old age of 12.

Yep.  I was in the same boat as a kid.  I love my siblings - but man do I resent my parents for expecting me to be a nanny just because I was the oldest.  Funny how my mom just can't understand why I don't want kids of my own.  A huge factor - I did my parenting already as a child!"

She has made that utterly clear to you the past few times you've brought it up and as the woman who has to put her body through hell having those kids, she holds the ultimate veto card.  So, it's time for you to stop bringing it up and decide whether you want your wife or children more.  Because you can't have both.  And yes, it's that simple.  One or the other.  Which is it going to be?

I am childfree by choice myself, and I'm your age, but I've never been in your shoes.  I've always been 100% on board the ""oh hell no"" train, so I can't give advice on what happens or if it fades."
"I hear what you are saying and you have my sympathies.  I also admire all of the sacrifices you make for your son and the tremendous love you have for him.  Hold on to that in your heart.  A lot of the posters here are angry on your behalf.  And you have every right to be angry.  For all of the amazingness of your son, he got here through lies and trickery.  You would have been in a better position to parent him -- more emotional maturity, a completed education, better financial prospects -- had he come later in your life.  You know that.  

So, what to do?  For all of the advice of the other posters here, you know that leaving your GF would have the probable result of seeing your son less.  And you are adamament that you don't want that.  I don't know if you can every make your relationship with your GF into a healthy relationship -- not after what she has done -- but you can try to make it healthier than what it is now.  Or at least more honest.

First, you need her to hear that what she did has had serious repercussions on your life.  The dropping out of school, the changed prospects for the future, the feelings of being trapped and tricked, your frustrations over not being able to provide better for your son because of the timing.....  For your own mental and emotional health, you need to articulate that to her and have her acknowledge it. 

Second, you need to hear that she is sorry.  That she regrets what she did.  Not that either of you regret your son or that you two lessen the love you have for him, but you need to hear her agree that this was wrong and that she apologizes for it.

Third, you need to start planning for the future.  And she needs to take some of the responsibility for helping.  This is the start of making it up to you.  You want to continue your schooling?  She has to find a way to help make that happen.  You want to train for a trade with good prospects?  She has to help with that.  Maybe it means that she looks to family for some child care while she works so that you can cut back on your work schedule.  Maybe that means she helps research opportunities for you that can be done on a flexible and low-cost basis.  You will have to work that out.

Fourth, she needs to demonstrate to you that she understands that your trust in her has been broken and that your relationship is on shaky ground.  Maybe she gets birth control implants so you know there will be no more surprises.  Maybe she lets you keep the condoms in a lockbox for which only you have the combination.  Maybe she agrees to counseling and participates in an open and constructive manner.  Maybe it is up to her to research some low-cost counseling options, too.  

The point is that you cannot carry on as you are.  You want to stay in your son's life, but you are going to get eaten up by resentment and mistrust for his mother.  And he is going to see that.  And everyone will be miserable.  If you are going to move forward in this mess, you have to start talking honestly about what happened and you need to see your GF take some responsibility for helping the two of you work towards something better."

If you have issues with YOUR relationship, you need to talk to your boyfriend. Tell him that a timeline is more important to you than a surprise. That you want to make sure you are on the same page about marriage, weddings, your future, finances, etc. Those are things you need to address with him...regardless of what his brother does (and I think most people will view his brother's decision as not a great one)."

I now make more than my boyfriend. At first he was a little emasculated and told me that. Understandable, he does have self esteem problems, especially relating to working. He was a bit of a late bloomer and honestly does really well now, but didn't always.

But he's also thrilled for me. He got over feeling emasculated and is so happy I not only love my job but that I make good money. He met some of my coworkers yesterday. And is really encouraging me as I learn what skills I need for this job. "
"You can love someone without being with them.   

 My mum and dad divorced when i was 8 because they wanted different things. They still love each other and have been fantastic co parents to myself. Even now im 32, my dad will still go round to help my mum or nan if needed, even though they are both remarried.

   I think you are stuck in the ""if you love someone you should be with them"" but that's not true, that's what we think when we are younger but Love is not as black and white.

  Sit down and work out what would make you truly content and happy."
"&gt; Checked for what? Not-giving-a-shit?

That's a pretty shit attitude. From what you've written it doesn't sound at all like she ""doesn't give a shit."" It sounds like she's doing what she can and wisely not overextending herself. 

You are the one who seems to need to learn to set boundaries. The situation with the engraved glasses you could have simply refused to be involved in. "
"You're not attracted to her. You know it. She knows it. Her insecurities about losing you are written all over her responses to this. Her attitude towards you is typical of someone who is miserable and unhappy with herself. Often people take that misery out on their spouses. It seems so much easier to try and drag you down, than facing the hard facts and being willing to make life changes. 

You've gotten super healthy and left her behind. "

"Are you sure that he is actually seeing all of these girls, or is he possibly lying to compensate for possibly screwing up the first relationship?  This just seems so over the top that maybe he had an embarrassing sexual experience or something and is trying to convince all of his buddies otherwise. "
Yeah the damning thing is she didn't eat it either.
"God, tell her to get some therapy. That's not okay. "
"&gt;make sure he does not hurt our child or kill me

How do you propose to do this? You cannot 'make sure' he won't kill you. **Choking is the number one predictor that an abuser is ramping up *to kill you.***
GET OUT. People will help you, even if they are only acquaintances. Take your child, and go!"
"&gt; You won't magically become more 'adult' if you leave it behind so just enjoy your goddamn teddy bear.

This made me LOL. I agree!"
"Wow wow wow everyone is being hella harsh to you, OP. :\

I am on your page. I think if he was just jerking it to memories, it'd be something you might just have to deal with.

But actively searching up exes to jerk it to their current photos, and potentially pursue a threesome with one of them? That's pretty shady and I personally wouldn't be OK with it *at all*"
"Nope. Nope. Nope. The only way this works is if she has one bedroom for the girls, one bedroom for the boys (each with two sets of twin bunkbeds) and the adults sleep in the living room. Anything else is just so many shades of wrong."
"I don't think there ever was a Tindr date. I think that was made up to get you to come out and pay attention to her. And that worked out great for her, because she had your undivided attention all night. Imagine her jealousy and disappointment when you spent your your second ""date"" (in her mind) dancing with other people and being bent over on the dance floor by her competitors. 

Sucks that you live together, because she is attracted to you and is going to c0ck block you every chance she gets. 

I think you need to be direct and tell her that you're not interested in her. As for the intrusive questions, you tell her it's none of her business. Would you tolerate that from a guy friend who showed an interest in you and started acting possessive?  "
Please go see your doctor.  I am very worried for you and it is possible you are suffering from post partum depression.  Please ask someone for help.  
I really hope you're paying the 12 year old for babysitting 14-21 hours a week. 
Sounds like the patterns of emotional abuse in domestic violence . 
"I would have the conversation with her if it's bothering you, which clearly it is. But I wouldn't worry about from the sexual  standpoint. I highly doubt he is going to start seeing his mother in that way. It's clear they have co slept for a while and that cuddles with mum is all it is and all it ever has been. My son is four and will sleep all night in his bed but nightmares and insecurities happen. 

Honestly I would be more concerned about the habit forming nature of this. As single mum she has gotten used to the extra sleep she gets not fighting the kid back into his bed (It's fucking hard, trust me, Iv'e been a single mum in a relationship) but it's a habit she is going to have to deal with soon if she is going to have partners over. 

Take the sexualisation bits away because that is not the issue here. Try to go with the angle that you are concerned how it is affecting your relationships and how you want to help her get her child feeling more secure in his bed. But also be prepared that she may choose her son's sleeping habits over you. I agree with the other poster, if you even accidentally make it sound like you making a ""it's me or your kid's well being"" argument, you will lose. "
"Look your boyfriend made this bed for himself.


He's the one telling stories about this. It's not like he doesn't have a ruler or porn.


The thing I don't get is, aren't plenty of douchy boys bragging about having a big dick? How is his getting such traction?


So I'd tell him first to be honest because this must be getting obnoxious. And then any time anyone says anything just roll your eyes. 

"
Leave. Better safe than sorry with these sort of things. It's much better to leave and then find out that you didn't have to than to stay and find yourself in a dangerous situation that you can't get out of. 
"Her retirement plan was your dad dying? Zero pity. 

Edit: Also, I would be amazed if your dad really didn't know that a life insurance policy pays out to the named beneficiary.  He literally had to give them your information and name you as the beneficiary. That did not happen by accident. He's either astoundingly ignorant or he lied to his wife. I suspect the latter. Sounds like he *intended* the money to go to you. It's the least he could have done, and you should keep it. "
"this story seems fake af - if you help troubled kids from broken homes in the US, you should definitely know what CPS is, AND you have resources for alexei that didn't involve having him sleep in your bedroom. if it's real, you need a metric (that is the measurement y'all use, right?) fuckton of training before ever working with children again, my fucking god."
"The vast majority of poisonous mushrooms make you sick within 24 hours, which is the husband's standard waiting period. When I say ""vast majority,"" I mean I can find one common mushroom that takes more than 24 hours to induce symptoms. Mushrooms are dangerous if you're stupid about them, yes. But they're not nearly as dangerous as people think if you're not stupid about them. Part of the alarmism around mushroom hunting is to keep amateurs away.

I don't think he sounds obsessed in the ""reckless and stupid"" sense. I think he sounds obsessed in the ""serious about his hobby"" sense. There's nothing particularly dangerous about that."
"You wouldn't. First thing I thought, and this is probably super silly but, you know people who put up other people for sex trafficking ads? My first thought was ""OH God he's taking pictures of him, now that he knows his address, to put on the dark/deep web"". 

I'm probably super paranoid though. The whole thing is very unsettling, creepy etc but unlikely he's doing what I thought he was. "
"This is the best advice. I think she must be really excited about having a hot boyfriend, and she also probably has a skewed view of how a good looking person thinks of themselves, specifically due to having been overweight before. I used to be very overweight for a huge portion of my life and always felt incredibly invisible/ugly because of it. I still struggle with weird automatic thoughts that all beautiful people must have perfect lives because they're beautiful (even though I am 100% aware that this is NOT in any way true). So she may genuinely think that it couldn't POSSIBLY bother you that you would be shown off because of your appearance.

It's not an excuse, just an explanation. As people have mentioned below, it IS gross behavior and can be likened to a guy telling his friends to touch his girlfriend's perfect tits or something."
"&gt;pedicure

"No. 
Please don't overthink this.
You're not asexual 

You and your boyfriend just aren't compatible like that. Unfortunately it happens. It can be confusing sometimes especially if you love them in other ways.
But unfortunately you aren't compatible like that and may have to have a talk about your future."
"I don't think I can actually be safe from him. I have blocked him on everything, but IF he wants to do something he knows where I live, where I drink coffee, where my yoga studio is...

And of course, he knows i am the only one who would do it.

I am thankfully not ""tied"" to him in any way. We do not share bank accounts, we don't live together thank god, and I don't want the stuff that I left there anyways.

So I believe I am secure enough to do it. I just want my peace back."
Tell her. And move on. You're 23 and he's a piece of shit. Good luck. 
"At first, I wondered if he was deleting messages because maybe you have snooped before and he figured you would freak out if you saw friendly attempts on his part to hang out with other girls.

But he clearly lied to you about going to the gym and he wasn't home when he ought to have been. You aren't being paranoid.

I say you be straight with him -- you drove by his house and his car wasn't there, and you saw him deleting facebook messages as they were coming in. Be neutral about it and non-accusatory. If his reaction is anger or defensiveness that is pretty much a guarantee of cheating. 

Does he accuse you of cheating? That's another sign that he is cheating. "
[removed]
"I was thinking more about the fact that HE goes to HER house nightly.   Clearly he hasn't even said ""I'd like to stay at my place tonight, catch up on some things.  See you tomorrow maybe."" Because if she was actually clingy, she's be over there inviting herself in etc.  
    
She's just inviting him over, he's saying yes and then resenting her in secret."
"Really irked me that that person just had to go ""but this very gender specific thing happens to all genders not just women!""

My bf and I joke around sometimes when we observe this sort of attitude in media, online, or in person. He leans to me and gives me the face, you know the one that says can you believe this is happening? And then he says but sofetchbeeeetch, what about my penis? I hear what you are saying, but more importantly, how does this relate to my penis?"" And we both just go really extra with it haha. Can't wait to show him this."
Even just one short break up is enough to shake the foundation of even the strongest relationships. It breaks both trust and confidence in your partner. 
"Why does he like that you're ""virginal""? That's... weird."
"Sure, there's always stuff to keep an eye out with Poly relationships to make sure no-one's feelings are hurt.

But then, who hasn't seen ordinary monogamous loving relationships go very, very wrong? Relationships of any kind have the potential to fail spectacularly."
Make sure you dust flour all around that mouse and heat pad. Follow the flour trail to find the hide spot. Works 90% of the time. I used to breed pythons and have had a lot go missing over the years. 
"The contemporary way of thinking about sex is to be ""sex-positive."" That's not saying that sex is amazing and that everyone should have it with everyone else. What being sex-positive means is accepting that sexual activity is an important part of mental and physical health. It isn't unnatural to masturbate or to have sex. If God didn't want us having sex or orgasming, then why would he make it so much fun/feel so good? As long as you and your partner have open communication and are willing to do the work necessary, sex is an amazing way to build intimacy in relationships and really allows you to get close to your partner in a different way. Both of you should take the time before the wedding to work on really reframing how you think about sex. Otherwise, it's still going to feel unnatural and ""wrong"" even after you two marry."
"I get exactly what you're saying. I'm going to give you some advice that someone gave me a long time ago. Slow your roll and chill the F out.

I grew up in a very sheltered home and honestly had very little experience in social situations outside of my very small group of friends. When I got to college I was in for a whole world of hurt. I can remember going to parties and being so frustrated that people didn't think I was funny or girls would seem to just run away from me. I was finally approached by a group of my fraternity brothers who sat me down and said that I was ""the creepy guy"" and I just needed to chill out. Sit back and actually watch what other people are doing instead of trying so hard to be the center of attention.

It took me a few years, but I wised up, matured, and finally found the groove. If you asked anyone who knows me now, but didn't know me back then they would never believe that I was ""that guy"". Next time you're in a social setting like that listen way more than you talk and you will be amazed at what you start picking up on. Best of luck and don't get too down on yourself. You are very young and you have time to figure it all out."
"There's gotta be more to this story. What exactly are you doing when you're interested in someone? specifically.

"If she's that worried about work where she's spending hours on the phone talking about it, she probably could benefit from some counseling."
"That's how I read, OP wants Sarah to be a mother figure occasionally? He wants her to treat his son as if he were her son and at the same time she isn't allowed to think of herself as his mother?"
"I hate it when people purposefully hide aspects of themselves from partners because _they_ think it's being unfairly stigmatized to them.  Like yes sure you can believe people who judge sexual histories are terrible people, but they still have the right to date people they want to date. 

Deliberately hiding something that you know the other person doesn't like because you feel like their preferences are unfair to yourself is so selfish. There is nothing defensible about those actions. 

I had a friend who did this with her ex on a lesser scale. She HATES dogs and met a guy who was a big, big dog-lover. She faked it for 2 years because she liked the guy, but never got over her true dislike of dogs. Well, they eventually moved in together and the guy wanted to bring his dog and she flipped out. They ended on other things, but I always thought she was insanely selfish to deceive the guy like that since the dude was an obvious dog-person when she met him. 

If he knew how much she hated dogs, he likely would've never dated her and therefore had to choose between his dog and his new gf. But she still roped him into that situation as a result of her dishonesty."
"&gt; She's hardcore trying to continue being one of the guys 

From the post:

&gt;  I've watched guys hug on her, play with her hair, make sexual innuendos, etc.

I don't think she's trying to be one of the guys; I find it very hard to believe they are doing any of that to each other. And absolutely none of that is professional, so any claim that she doesn't want to acknowledge her husband to remain ""professional looking"" is horseshit. 

She's taking advantage of her sexuality at work and seems to be crossing the lines of professionalism and appropriateness. Whether OP can trust his wife who gets drunk with the coworkers that she allows to touch her intimately while on the job is up to him..."
"&gt; my response thus far has been very firm and completely calling her bs. She knows she was caught. She knows I wasn't backing down.

You should actually go even further. She's intimating that she deleted the conversation out of spite, and won't admit to any wrongdoing. She says the conversation was ""casual"" and ""about music"".

Well, if that's the case, then she won't mind you seeing the messages, right? She deleted them in haste because she was mad at you (her justification), but **now you can give her a chance to** ***prove*** **she's telling the truth**. And if she were truly innocent, she would JUMP at the chance to absolve herself.

So ask her to let you download data-recovery software on her phone, to recover the deleted messages. It's very, very possible to do (although best done sooner rather than later for best results). If she's totally innocent, she might bristle under the loss of privacy, but she'd understand that she damaged your trust and needs to verify her version of events. Period.

Even if the data recovery doesn't work (and it should), her response to your request will probably be quite enlightening. "
"Thanks for all your input! Our savings is definitely pretty measly right now, in part because we just dropped $2000 on our car.

If I thought a financial planner would help I'd be all for it. The issue for me is that at home when we go over our budget and expenditures he's very receptive and understanding. Then he goes to work and spends whatever he wants until there's no money left in our account. Then because he can't by lunch he spends a day berating me over text message about it.

I sent him the link to this, hoping he'd read some of the comments and maybe realise how irresponsible he's being. I dunno. There's a lot about him that I love, but you're right that if nothing changes he's going to destroy me financially. "

"I lost 80lbs. No idea where the weight came from, but I started working out and basically went from a size 18 to a 4. I feel you. It's weird being in a new body. But you lost it all before meeting him? He probably loves you a lot even if you guys haven't said it.

Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you've been feeling? He probably senses something is off. See if you can bring it up. He sounds like a really great guy, don't make any decisions before talking to him.

As for the excess skin issue, everyone is different. I had good results by putting on some muscle, it helped to fill in the space I had left over and my skin got tighter. I didn't have a lot of excess skin but I was self conscious about it. And same with my boobs. I'd honestly suggest looking into a decent therapist or joining a support group. Losing a lot of weight is a total mind fuck. "

"Have you been to a doctor? If you have recurring UTIs or something, that could definitely cause some unpleasantness that showering won't help with.

If you go to the doctor and everything ends up being okay, it's possible that your BF doesn't have a realistic idea of how vaginas smell. He also needs to work on his communication if he's laying it on thick and making you feel stupid in a conversation about your own health."
"Yeah, I'd be curious to know if he is equally as willing to 'learn' from OP's political views as he is to 'teach' OP his political views.

"I did go to my gyno after he brought it up the first time because I was hoping that was it. She told me everything looked and smelled perfect as far as any infections were concerned.

He did tell me that his ex used to shower before they had sex every time, so I assumed he was just averse to any type of sweaty smell that accumulates during the day.

I'm aware that I probably wasn't my most attractive self while I was sick this weekend, but I still tried to go home and get clothes and shower twice each day, and it still wasn't enough for him. I'm just really bummed and don't know what to do."
Why can't you live together and be celibate? People should figure out if they are sexually compatible before marriage but barring that you should at least find out if you can stand her farting on you while she sleeps. 
"Well it sounds like your sisters family has a inappropriate relationship with food. As well as being a self absorbed person. And a parent with no backbone. 
She promised her kids pizza, there is no pizza place open. Rather than telling her kids that the plans have change and dinner will be at a different place. She inconveniences everybody.her kids are old enough to understand that plans change, and they won't have pizza.
Wanting to get everybody together for what she wants/ has promised her kids. And trying to force you to join and eat. Not healthy at all.

It may cause drama but seriously stop letting her act like this. If there isn't enough food... speak up and ask for more, if the wine is nasty... say something. If she wants to pick dinner for the entire party with out their input...tell her NO! Family vacations mean family choices, not just hers."
"I agree with what you've said here.  This was an ACCIDENT! OP's poor husband must feel wretched about dropping their child and OP made it so much worse by blaming him and then allowing her parents to treat him so poorly. 

Marriage is about being partners. Not turning against your spouse when they make a mistake. It's about supporting each other through trials and struggles. 

Incidents like this usually cause one of 3 reactions- fight, flight, or freeze. The husband froze. Then OP made things worse by blaming him and treating him so badly that he used the flight reaction to get away from her.

I hope the baby is ok. I'm a mom. It's so scary when your child is hurt. But turning on your spouse is such a shitty way to handle your fears. The marriage is fractured-and I'm not sure it can be repaired. OP is the one who fractured it-not her husband."

"I know this isn't the point of the post, but again - ***why did you do this????*** Are you normally this wildly irresponsible?"
This was my first thought. I'm pretty sure the dish wasn't even safe to eat.
"Where is he asking her to help raise the child? From all that OP posted, he does all the heavy lifting and she only likes to do the fun/public stuff. I'm so confused as to why people are acting like he's asked her to take on a lot of responsibility. It seems like the opposite. "

"Get her into therapy ASAP, there is something huge going on here and you need a professional to get to the bottom of it. It is an odd route to go for attention, you also want to protect yourself so that these false claims are not being reported to social services, do not hesitate get her some help immediately. This is just what you have seen there are so many other social media sites online, tumblr, instagram, twitter and who knows what's going on there. Talk to the therapist as well (without your daughter) they will most likely find social media is toxic for your daughter and she should not be using it right now."

"Dude, wtf are you doing? Stop fucking up."
"Break it down:

1) you feel he chose to deprioritize you  

2) you feel he chose to mismanage your expectations.

3) you feel he chose to violate boundaries in your relationship. 

4) you feel like he is choosing prioritizing his relationship with  (objectively shitty) colleagues over you, leading to the above. 

5) you feel like he chooses not to have your back when those colleagues are directly shitty to you (tbd, based on this reaction to that text.)

These are all choices (note, no passive voice in the above) he is actively making. 

He can choose not to do those things. He can choose to actually be your husband / partner and either not put himself in or learn to extract himself from peer-pressure / bro-out situations. 

He can also choose not to have a relationship with you, his daughter, etc. I'm not saying jump to that now, but holy shit where else does this lead through time? "

"You're screwed no matter what.  There was this scene in a Tv show I watched a long time ago. 

underage kid was trying to do something like tell her story publicly for having AIDS.  Parents trying to prevent her because she might regret it one day to have been so public about it.

The mediator said: ""You're right,  in all likelyhood she'll regret doing this later in life and wished she never came out.  But with the 5 minutes that I known her,  I can tell you she'll regret it a whole lot more if she doesn't follow through.""

Not sure if that came out right.   But basically we internet people can't tell you what to do here.  You'll regret if you leave and something happens,  You'll regret it if you stay and something happens, you might not regret it long if you die when something happens.  It's a bet,  place your bets where you think the odds are in your favor.  You'll regret it if you're wrong, no matter what option you pick."
But you ARE alone. You are in this relationship alone. He is not a partner. He doesn't sound like he even *likes* you.
"I think you should talk to your partner about this. Try not to come across as being angry or upset, as it may make him upset since it is his mother, but definitely talk to him about it and see if he can better help you understand it or better help you react to it appropriately. After all, your boyfriend should know his mother best, so getting advice from him how to handle it may prove valuable. "
"This sounds like my first marriage. He was a good guy, but I was ready to explore the world and every time I tried ti get him to go with me, he was guaranteed to get a ""headache."" I felt like I was being suffocated. It made me guilty as hell to leave him, but by the end of it I felt like he was only happy living the life of a 70 year old. I felt like if I stayed I would never be happy again. 

I respect that you have made some efforts to treat your anxiety, but if having 10 people in a movie theatre with you is too much, I'm afraid that it may still be very poorly controlled. Maybe you need DBT, maybe you need better meds, but it doesn't sound like you have a good handle on your condition at all, and until you do, your world is going to get smaller and smaller. "
"Look, he's the one who is the wrong here, not you. You're an adult woman and you have the right to take nudes and write personal notes. He violated your privacy and clearly does not seem like a good friend at all. I'd feel embarrassed in your situation, too, but I'd hope a friend would point out to me that even if it's normal to feel embarrassed, it's illogical because YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. I do recommend maybe keeping a personal diary on your computer that's protected somehow and deleting nudes/saving them somewhere not as easily accessible as your phone in the future. He owes you a huge apology. You owe him nothing. "
"&gt;she has texted me and tried to follow me on IG but I turned down her request. &gt;

Probably didn't want you to f**k and chuck his best friend? Which sounds like you are doing...having sex with her then ignoring her and ghosting her, he's probably pissed you did that to someone he cares about. If was a random he wouldn't care cause he wouldn't have to hear her talk about it, now she's prob saying your an ass!"
"&gt; I am a two time combat Marine Corps Vet. But what I am is smart.

Then you know that sometimes the weaker party can do real damage. Heaven forbid she swing a lamp or throw a bottle when you aren't looking. You can still get hurt.

Exactly. Although I would encourage you to look deeper than a discussion and an apology and look for a tangible change like a hard limit on how many drinks or something like talking to a counselor. "
"I feel like it depends on their relationship. If my husband said that to me I would probably laugh and throw it out. If my brother said it to his wife he would probably be signing divorce papers the next day. 

Then sometimes you're just a little extra sensitive and something that would usually make you laugh hurts your feelings.

Apologize for how you said it and that you didnt try it but thats all you can really do."
"Mandated reporter here. If I heard about a situation with same-age male and female children sleeping together, I would have to report it to CPS. Make of that what you will.

"You might make a list documenting the upsetting contact you've had with him as factually as possible.  Then obtain a copy of your work's policies governing employee behaviour.  Then ask for a meeting with his counselor and show the counselor that Max is clearly harassing you in violation of company policy and that if this isn't resolved, you will have to make a formal complaint to your workplace that will likely result in Max's dismissal. It sounds like the counselor is supposed to be handling these kinds of situation, not just shrugging and calling it a phase.  "
"You've only been friends for a year. In that time another friend of yours has seen you break down SIX time because of this guy. I find his behavior incredibly manipulative and absolutely exhausting, but maybe that's just a part of his mental illness? I don't think it matters that he's ill, though, if he's having such a negative impact on your life and well-being then you're better off distancing yourself from him. Especially because he stomps on your boundaries and acts really entitled. 

&gt; I am the sort of person who will drop everything to help a friend in need

His needs are too big. You're not his caretaker. You need to look out for yourself first.

"Don't pursue girls with boyfriends. She's definitely giving you mixed signals and stringing you along, probably as a backup. It's not cool of her. If I were you'd I'd break contact or at least keep your distance. Don't allow her to string you along. "

I just feel like there has to be a way to make things at least livable. To talk them down somewhat but I don't know what it is."
It's a new relationship...I'd break it off with her. That's just not right.
I think they meant all of the randos evil stepmother is spewing this to.
"Have you had conversations with him about this when the son is not there? I almost feel as if everything you have discussed here should be mentioned to him, over and over. You two have a lot to talk about. 1. Micromanaging your relationship with his son is a no no. If he thinks something is wrong, he can discuss it with you in private afterwards so it can be adjusted in the future and not become an argument in front of his son. 2. HE NEEDS to tell you exactly the kind of relationship he wants you to have with his son. Clearly you trying to go with it and guess is not working. (his fault, not yours) That way at least you have an understanding of the boundaries in the relationship between you and the son. 3. NO arguments in front of his son period. Both of you need way more communication about this, A LOT lol start from the very beginning with him, as if you and his son have never met and ask him exactly what kind out of outcome he would like all three of you to have together and work towards it. This is not horrible, however it will not be easy. Communication is the only key that will open this obstacle for you guys."
"&gt;Right now, I would have you and your husband maybe call or write an apology letter/bring it to her house, since she isn't being responsive through texts. Tell her that, since you aren't a parent, you can't understand how the situation made her feel but that you love her and her son and sympathize and apologize. Then leave it up to her. If things smooth over eventually, I'd somehow try and bring up therapy.


I'm going to talk to him again and ask that he apologize once more (for me) and agree to let it go. Hopefully she accepts and we can move on. 

I think this is a good approach, thanks."

"This needs to be at the top. 

A 25 year old hanging out one on one with a 15 year old at cons is definitely not normal.

I'd belive that OP is broke and acting in good faith if she just mismanaged money (you need to be literally burning money in the fireplace for that cos to be $1000) and there's 10 people packed in a hotel room for 2. That sounds more normal. 

OP needs to stop being an e-girl and start living real life. No one puts up with that kind of shit.        

Edit: ""one on one"" not one one one.   

Edit 2: OP has a fine arts degree, graduated last year, still not looking for jobs, but not worried because she has a degree which equals a good job, so she can totally pay off all the debt she put herself into for this con in a snap if she wanted to. She has $24 to her name (ignoring her thousands in cosplay debt), but don't worry, her idea to open an online cosplay store will make her a multi millionaire by the time she's 30.

"Your parents were kind of abusive and your husband is just kind of emotionally dumb. Also, you got married *really* young. Neither one of you have any idea what a healthy relationship looks like because of your childhoods. This is the very type of scenario that couple's counseling is perfect for.

"Because she does NOT like lying in.

Because she wants to let you sleep.

Because she wants to go to the bathroom privately before you are awake.

Because bringing you tea and toast is a thing now and she really likes doing it for you.

I could go on and on. But nowhere do I leap to the conclusion that she is doing this because she secretly hates you.

Have you said to her ""Can we cuddle in the a.m. for a few instead of getting up?"" Only when she acts disgusted by this request can you say ""OK, she is not that into me..."""
"Hell yes. My husband and I have supported each other through long periods of unemployment, and not once, in three of these occasions between us, have either of us said ANYTHING like this, to each other or anyone else.

Her dad said he'd ""do something dangerous to himself"" if she told her, and that he just needed some time to clear his head and he'd tell her himself. Obviously he never did. It completely changed my girlfriends life. Carrying a secret like that has been one of the defining aspects of her life. She struggles on such a deep level that everyone isn't carrying such hurtful secrets. She struggles with trusting me all the time. She struggles in every aspect of her life that involves any kind of intimacy or trust. Tell your mom. It's what is right. "

"From your post:

&gt; I asked her if she would be happy being a SAHM

Ok, you asked her.  That's not the sexist part.  

From your post:

&gt; she said she her career is too important for her and she plans on being a partner at her firm

Ok, so you asked, and her answer was no.

From your post:

&gt; After a lot of discussion, I made it clear that this is a deal breaker.

*This* is the sexist part.  

The part where either *she* stays at home with the kids, or the deal is off.  

Unless *you* offered to give up *your* career and stay home with the kids, so that she could pursue her career.

Did you do that?  Or were the only options on the table ""Woman stays home"" or ""Deal is over""?"
"Kids at that age are little shitheads. I was ostracized because my parents gave me shitty advice instead of taking action.  ""Just ignore them."" ""Walk away from bullying"" ""They're just jealous of you. "" I was beat up, had my crap stolen, sat alone at lunch, constantly had gum in my hair. I once even had a crowd of students start hitting me with rolled up notebooks. I had zero family support, shitty advice. My only solace was books. 

You want your daughter to have a normal school life? Protect her. Yes, teach her to respect the handicapped  but don't be enablers. Take her off that bus, for the love of god push her to take a regular bus route or start driving/carpooling her to school if you can afford it. This is a confusing age for her &amp; she doesn't need this in her life. Its a new school, that's overwhelming enough. If you don't want her to resent you &amp; hold this against you in her teen years, take her off that damn bus. 


Do better than my ignorant, enabling parents. Protect your kid instead of taking the easy way out. For all the adults who had shitty preteen years, make sure she is safe &amp; healthy  physically &amp; emotionally as possible. "

"I loathe the gym, I really do. I like walking, and yoga and bellydancing. And sleep :)

Keto works really well if you can ride out that first week or so until deep ketosis kicks in and your appetite goes down. I always found the Atkins books really motivating - not the new ones with the bars and crap, but the older ones, written by Atkins himself. Maybe that might help. 

Also, over at The Diet Doctor they have weightloss stories that you can sort by age - it is waaaay more motivating to see a fat lady in her forties lose weight than some  18 year old :) :)

Don't hassle her to get up in the mornings and hit the gym. I'd rather chew my own nipples off than do that. I have to say, you do rather come across as a Born-Again Evangelical Gym Rat, but what works for you (spectacularly) clearly isn't working for her...

Why not go for a walk with her in the afternoons ? And not a pounding-until-your-heart-gives-out walk - but just a nice walk where the two of you can chat about your day, and about your plans. You get a bit of togetherness and a bit of exercise that may even kill two birds with one stone.....?

As for your comment about cons, I'm not sure if you're joking? That's not a good measuring stick for the dating scene - not that you can't find good dates there, I know people who have - it's just not representative of eligible singles. I mean, if you want to enter the dating scene at 30, and cons are your idea of mingling, then you'll have to get out of your comfort zone. 

Also, it's pretty clear your self-esteem is in the dumps. Therapy will help with that."
"My dog was attacked by a neighbor's dog twice. The first time I didn't report it because he claimed it was a ""new behavior"" and she was quite young. The second time she got loose from her leash and came barrelling towards us from 50 yards away just to attack my dog. After this incident I was so upset and disturbed that I reported it to my landlord (lived in an apartment) and animal control. I was told that because so much time (3 months) had passed between the first event and I didn't report it right away, they wouldn't take it into consideration.

I say this because I should have said ""fuck politeness"" the first time this dog showed aggression. I wanted to be a good and understanding neighbor, but that only lead to this guy not taking his responsibility seriously. Once I did take action, he took his dog to behavioral training and kept her on a shorter leash for more control. My dog wasn't attacked again.

This dog not only has been aggressive to your pets, but also you. That's the more disturbing thing about this. Next time the dog won't just feign a lunge, but might actually attack you. 

Report to animal control. They should take this seriously and give a serious warning to your neighbors. Also start carrying a walking stick when you're outside, just in case."

Obviously the easy temporary fix is finding another hotel, but it sounds like you've looked into that already. 

This is the kind of relationship defining moment that determines whether you'll be a doormat for your fiancé or whether you'll assert your independence. I'd recommend the latter. How he chooses to take it is up to him. "

I'm not impressed that the fiancé waited this long to address an issue that he would be willing to nuke their relationship for. If it is important enough for him that he would call off their engagement for it, yet he's waited this long to bring it up, he absolutely needs to be more willing to discuss and aid in how they might fix the situation.

You come across braggy. Ridiculously so. Let your actions speak for themselves for goodness' sake! This post was ostensibly about your relationship, but something like 80% of it was about you? Not about how the two of you interact, or how he talks to you about these things...just you. 

Also the timeline you're talking is really fast. Yes, even for this culture. My bubba would be rolling over in her grave if she heard one of us girls had this planned.

Take the time to like him for him, not the gratification and awe he can heap on you. If you treat the people around you like an audience, you'll always feel as though you're performing. That's why things feel fake and you have to always keep bragging. Even about making challah---I mean, come on girl, you live in Israel! That's not a big accomplishment, just enjoy the yummy bread!

She constantly undermines our parenting-even though she has NOTHING to do with our kids. And this past year she has tried to undermine our marriage (by telling my husband he needs to keep secrets from me-I don't need to know everything, etc-he flat out told her that was never going to happen).

My husband has now started to pick up on the small things his mom does to take jabs at me or us as a family. The only reason why it's taken this long is because he has always wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt because she's his mom."
"&gt;About three years ago, my girlfriend suddenly started being very concerned about not wanting to become pregnant.

Makes sense, you're both childless, cool.

&gt;About two months after her elevated concern about pregnancy began, my girlfriend said we couldn't have sex anymore. 

This should've been deal breaker **number 1** right here because when a relationship starts out with two sexually consenting individuals, it's a hard stop when someone says they don't want to have sex anymore. It's a huge elephant in the room. I'm surprised you went 3 years like that.

&gt;One month later, my girlfriend suddenly got an offer from another branch of the same company with which she had been interviewing. She accepted the position and made plans to move out (to a state on the other side of the country) immediately.

Your girlfriend *left* you right after being accepted into the graduate program. This is deal breaker **number 2**. This is right here, shows her cutting ties with you right after the no-sex policy.

&gt;The next summer I went to live with her again. By the end of the summer, she had apparently become comfortable enough with me again that she said I could touch her.

**IT TOOK YOU TWO SUMMERS FOR THIS TO HAPPEN**. Why do you allow yourself to be placed into a position where your girlfriend tentatively loves you? This shit sucks and this is deal breaker **number 3**. Your normal meter is broken cause you've accepted the bullshit of waiting for her to love you back when she's clearly checked out.

&gt; She said that the only way she will have sex with me again is if I get a vasectomy.

Look it took you two summers to even touch your GF, and it's going to take you having invasive surgery for her to have sex with you? What if you do have the surgery but she doesn't want to have sex with you?! /r/relationships promotes bodily autonomy and you should never let someone tell you to change your body for any reason but for your own happiness. She's only a girlfriend, there will be more girlfriends to come, and a compatible wife who will love you.

15 years of being in a relationship is a big deal but don't let that affect your choices on what will make you happy in the long run. Look up sunk-cost fallacy. Don't let her string you along just cause you're the available option to her. It's not worth the hassle for someone who loves you, doesn't love you, but now tentatively loves you. "
"Would you have had the balls to post something like this on fb as an abused person? I didn't have a great childhood or home life and I would have NEVER posted these things and risked losing everything to put junk on fb.

I knew people like this in high school and never believed them because they lie SO MUCH. These people post whatever dramatic thing they can think of and stir up shit for no reason. Yes, that can be a sign. But to me it's a sign to stay away from that person because it's only a matter of time before you're their next target. "
Exactly. It's sad how many posts there are like this.
"&gt; I always knew i needed to work on my anger issues. I always knew i probably needed therapy for childhood trauma.

But it never seemed like a priority until she was actually gone for good. 

Assume she's gone forever. Assume the break-up is permanent. Go to therapy and learn how to be a non-abusive partner so you have a chance at a relationship in the future."
"That's so irrelevant and definitely shows that you think your job difficulty levels are a competition.  Your job is hard, yay, good for you. That has NO BEARING on whether or not your wife's job is hard, or if she's tired and exhausted.  A 15 month old demands constant, excessive attention, correction, saving from hurting themselves, etc.  

Your attitude sucks and I bet your wife feels your disdain at what she does.  She is keeping your child alive and working to love, support and raise him.  Get over yourself and start appreciating what your wife does and support her more or get her hired help."
"Could you not approach your boss with a plan where all contracts are evenly divided among staff.  If there is strong documentation showing everyone is treated exactly the same then i can't see her being able to build a case. Especially if she was dumb enough to make the threats in writing.

Mind you, now that she has been given all of them it's probably too late."
"That wasn't the only cruel question she asked. She also asked ""who is the most likely to die alone?"" No one else asked questions that mean. I've never seen her be like that before"

"Yeah this is fucked I'm pretty sure you knew that before you came here but if you want me to reinforce it I'll tell you.

Open relationships are the type of thing you discuss and put boundaries on before any actions are taken and this is a violation of your trust.

Aside from the obvious issue of this event, there are other red flaga you are clearly smart enough to see, but don't have the courage to act on. Her jealous manipulative behaviour is just a front for things she feels insecure about with herself, and that alone is a reason to leave

Cut your losses and try again. Being more open with yourself over what you want from a partner."
"I disagree with the other commenters here. 

It looks to you like she is cheating, or headed that way. You don't have to give friends a ""pass"" to act at shitty and destructive as they like. You did the right thing to bring up that her apparent behavior would not be ok with you. "
"I'm a cat owner, and I don't think not wanting the cat to be on your bed is that ""mean"". I've always felt the bed is a very intimate place. What about sex? What about sexual teasing and fondling that could practically last all night? What about spontaneous middle of the night sex? Kick the cat out then let him back in when you're done? 

Yes, the cat is your family, as my cat is mine. But I don't share a bed with any family members as an adult. 

That said, if sleeping with your cat is a must, then I guess you two are just not compatible. "
She told you that you were dumb and she is correct. It is dumb to stay he doesn’t care about you. Apologize to your friend. She is a real friend
Thanks. Yes my parents are very supportive and will definitely help if I ask. 
"If it's your personal account you should be able to do this. Do not, I repeat NOT do this with an account that has both your names on it--just your own personal accounts. Talk to a lawyer if you are concerned. But definitely get screenshots of the accounts NOW so that you can prove how much money was in them in case he starts hiding money."
"""His number one interest is politics. He is a libertarian and is quite involved in the movement.""

Run."
"But clearly in all her 33 years she has never experienced it, so this type of thing is closer to home than you think. While this is an isolated incident in your eyes, it doesn't help that Chicago is notorious for gun violence. You said so yourself that you grew up around violence and are desensitized to it. Is this how you want your kids to grow up? Do you want your wife to live in fear? 

If you ""convince"" her to stay, she may grow to resent you and will most definitely hate you if another incident happens again. 

You two need to work together to make a compromise. Maybe you guys can move to a different neighborhood or consider moving to Canada after a certain amount of time. Whatever it is, you are still downplaying her justifiable concerns and that is the first issue you need to tackle."
