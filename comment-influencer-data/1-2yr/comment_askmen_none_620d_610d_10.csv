"You killed a man that was already dead. You’re a bad, bad man. "
"That's rough OP, I can relate. I was waiting tables at a wine bar and the place was packed. I just finished serving a table and was headed back to the bar, bobbing and weaving through people, when a gorgeous woman stepped in front of me with her arms open. I was busy and wasn't really thinking. I figured she wanted a hug, so a hugged her. Bad move on my part. She pushes me away and says ""what the fuck do you think you're doing?!"" She then goes to hug the guy standing behind me. I was crazy embarrassed. Add to that, I had to walk by her and her friends for the next two hours.

EDIT: nice to see my most awkward moment is also my most upvoted comment. To everyone saying the woman was a bitch, I didn't get that vibe. It was definitely awkward and I completely caught her by surprise. Like one of the comments said, she was completely oblivious to me. Also, I'm not some hugged crazed maniac. For those that have worked in popular bars, you'll know hugging (and being hugged) by strangers comes with the territory. "

"Point Nemo is the most isolated place on Earth. It’s a couple thousand miles to the closest land mass and at times the closest people to you are in the ISS. Also there is no current movement in the ocean there, so there’s not even any animal life to keep you company. But hey at least every couple months, a satellite comes splashing down to be your friend "
I think I just cringed into another dimension. Feels bad man. 
How do you kill that which has no life?
Fun fact when Andromeda and the Milky Way collide in a couple billion years not a single star is expected to collide from either galaxy that's how soul crushingly vast space is and it isn't even as isolated as OP would feel right now.
I hear the Andromeda Galaxy is nice this time of year.

My wife still after 28 years of marriage adores me. She still loves to hold my hand and kiss me on my cheek as she is passing by. She wants to be with me.

"Very useless, as I was recently reminded.

Best example was back in college, with this girl I had a crush on but had renounced thinking about it. We were on a field trip with all classmates. It was evening:

- I was sitting at a table and she asked if she could sit on my lap. I told her I didn't mind but she could have my chair because I was going to the dance floor. She offered we dance together then.
- We danced together for hours, then it was time to call it a night. She asked if I could escort her to her tent.
- While we walked, she asked if another girl and me were dating. It's true this other girl and me talked a lot, but everybody knew she doesn't date. I told her I don't have a girlfriend in a slight self-deprecated way. She told me to not feel bad, she doesn't have a boyfriend either. Told her that's because she's picky, as any guy would jump in at slightest sign of interest. She said she used to think so but didn't so much now.
- On the way we passed my tent and I noticed my tentmate had company, to which I made a random comment about where was I supposed to sleep now. She told me her tentmate was sleeping somewhere else and I could join her. Told her she didn't need to do that (must be so awkward to tolerate the guy who has a crush on you cramped in the same tent as you), and I'd sleep in my car.
- When we arrived at her tent she proposed we go for a walk, around the park at night. Where nobody would be there. We walked until 4am.
- Told her goodnight after I walked her back to her tent. She asked if I was sure about the car, then goodnight.

... Yeah, fairly useless.

"I would start by apologizing, you're already a week late on that. 

""I've been meaning to tell you this, but just haven't known how. I'm sorry. I acted inappropriately, crossed lines, and just all around made an ass of myself. I understand if you never want to talk to me again, but if it can be saved I would like us to remain friends""

It doesn't sound like you did anything that the police would become involved in, that's not the concern here. The concern is trying to keep her friendship. "

"Doggy. Great view, she gets tighter, just an awesome level of pleasure. "
"If a man opens up to you, try and be completely non-judgmental. It's hard to men to be vulnerable, and often even harder to do it in front of women- we're meant to be the supportive, strong ones and all that gender role stuff. People are stigmatising themselves in their head even as they open up.

Be mindful of that, and be kind and listen. They've had to make this leap and try and trust you, so repay that as much as you can."

"When they made him, they broke the mold"
I died inside bro. 
"Ah I see you too date online.  I've never had so many failed first dates as I have had via online.  I now refuse to meet with someone unless they reach out to me first. Far fewer dates, but far more successful.

And they all did the same thing, ""It was so fun! Let's do this again!"" Never another word.  Cool.

Edit, as usual comments range from insightful to out of touch. I should state that I'm looking for more than a hookup, but I have had those as well, but don't actively seek them.  So some sex doesn't constitute success to me and I don't sleep with anyone until I actually get to know them.  That influences they types of women I message and also the apps I use.  I used match,okcupid, bumble, and tinder (I realize that is counter intuitive to my goal, but I actually met up with and had far better conversations with women from tinder than the other apps). I don't like first dates, so I do try to feel people out before meeting, which should lead to better results. But go figure.

Double edit: I always split the bill and never do anything more than drinks for a first date. No free meals here. And if you are doing that, stop, have some self esteem and be willing to walk away from women if they show signs that they expect you to be that guy."
The thing on your calendar is my birthday today
"Never.   Inability I suppose, but it's more accurate to say it's just not in my nature.  I'm more of an introvert, so the idea of going out to a bar and striking up a conversation with a stranger is pretty foreign to me.  And even if I did, I'm not sure I have to social prowess to pull that off."
"Yeah right, we all know you cringe about this moment in bed sometimes ."
"&gt; I joined r/niceguys to try and identify nice guy behavior in myself and cure it if I can **but no one really gives advice on what to do, just what not to do.**

Let me reveal the truth to you then, young grasshopper.

What you must do, without fail, is to find self-love and self-confidence.

To find self-love, you must find yourself believably attractive.

To find yourself believably attractive, you must have positive, interesting qualities.

To have positive, interesting qualities, you must have genuine interests and emotions that do not gravitate around yourself and your resentment.

To have interests and emotions that do not gravitate around resentment, you must learn not to blame others for your failures.

To not blame others for your failures, you must learn to appreciate errors.

At that point, the young student attained great enlightenment."

"Girls who have horses have zero time for much life outside of taking care of the horse. Horses require tons of care.

Liking horses is like anything else. Indulge in it and it becomes time-consuming."
You did your best
"I've found that some women are a bit conflicted about what they really want, and project that outward. She may say she wants you to be a certain way, and she might believe that she *should* want you to a certain way but what she *actually responds to* might be something completely different. So she's giving you bad directions all the time and can't figure out why she's not feeling fulfilled.

The lowest maintenance women who are simple to read are the ones who say the want the same thing as the believe they should want and respond strongly too. 

Example: she says she wants you to be sensitive because she believes that she should want a gentle guy who treats her with respect at all times, but he leaves her cold sometimes because he's so harmless that he's not all all exciting. What she might be happier with is someone who is exciting and a little dangerous but also very civilised, but she's not in touch enough with her impulses and desires to be able to express and act on that.

It takes a lot of self reflection to bring these things into harmony, and you might find that what turns you on emotionally and physically isn't the same as what society says is ""acceptable."" But you should embrace it, you'll be happier."
"One ex admitted to me that whenever she feels like she's not getting enough attention she will never directly ask for it. Instead she will start an argument about *something completely different* and the man is just supposed to guess that she actually just wants positive attention.  

I feel bad for the guy she ended up with."
"She made out with me, but I thought she made out with me as a friend."
"Women 101.

Plausable deniability - refers to circumstances where a **denial of responsibilty** or knowledge of wrongdoing can not be proved as true or untrue due to a lack of evidence proving the allegation.

Disclaimer:  The following obviously does not apply to every single person 100% of the time.  There are always individual exceptions to the rule.

Women learn early on to operate under the safety net of plausible deniability.

Let's look at the old cliche of why women won't ever choose where to eat, but will endlessly shoot down ideas.

They don't want to be responsible for choosing a place to eat if it ends up being bad.  _denial of responsibility_

If a guy likes a girl, he is usually forced to make moves and make his intentions known if he wants to get anywhere.

If a girl likes a guy, she will make subtle hints like putting herself in his victinity, maybe playing with her hair, giggling, etc, but it's rare that she will overtly put her cards on the table (thus giving up plausible deniability).

This is why women are ""hard to read"".  They act in a way that can mean whatever they feel is convenient for them at the time.

""Just because I'm twirling my hair and laughing doesn't mean I wanted you to kiss me, omgawd gross!""

"Nurse here who specializes in geriatric psych. 

Frontal lobe dementia is one of the worst as far as dementia goes. A seemingly normal person, usually on the younger end, can turn into an unrecognizable person in a very short amount of time. 

One thing to always remember, especially during those really bad days: ""This isn't my dad. It's the disease.""

One of my more memorable patients locked herself in her closet and required the help of 6 firemen to get her out. She was throwing things at them, screaming, swearing, biting and eventually had to be restrained by the paramedics. (This was in an assisted living facility where they weren't equipped for this type of incident.) 

Her daughter showed up and saw part of the ordeal and she just broke down. I still remember her words to me. ""This isn't my mother. She never behaved this way!""

One of the best things to do for your dad is preserve his dignity. He'll likely need help with even the most basic of tasks. Don't let any of his caregivers forget about the man he was before dementia. Keep pictures of him around for them to look at. Write out a short biography of his life and post it for everyone to read. 

I've taken care of neurosurgeons, lawyers, professors, members of presidential cabinets, you name it. This disease does not discriminate."
I dated a horse girl.  I can tell you about her specifically.  She came from money but didn't really have any herself.  That was due to the fact that she didn't have a steady job while we dated.  She portrayed herself as a socialite but in reality she didn't have an apartment and slept on her friends couch.  I didn't learn that until after we broke up and her friend told me.  I had always been puzzled as to why she never invited me over.  
Shit yourself.
"First thing's first- if you are not happy with your life, recognize that you have to *work* to make it change.  People have inertia, and as you get older, that inertia slows down (less entergy to do stuff, time goes by faster, bodies fall apart, etc).  You have to *actively* combat this, plus whatever mental/physical health issues you might have that get in the way (as best you can; that shit is hard)..  You don't have to be on the ball all the time and it's certainly ok to chill and relax at times, but commit yourself to self-improvement.  Life only gets worse if you don't.  

Secondly: recognize that it's not going to be easy.  Nothing worth doing is.

* Don't coast through life anymore- it's time to build yourself up.  Take responsibility for yourself and move forward.  Find balance and calmness in that forward momentum.  Don't resign to simply being an observer.  
* Read more.  Learn about interesting stuff.  You don't have to dig into it too far, but staying on top of recent events is good.  Learn about how people's brains (esp. their emotional subconscious) works.
* Stay current with the news, and learn about *why* people are often upset about current issues.  Remember, things that are ""just politics"" to you are incredibly personal to others.  Keep that in mind before you start badmouthing anyone, too.
* With that in mind, don't put others down to make yourself seem better.  We're all doing our best here, so be positive and encouraging.  Be someone others want around.  **Don't be selfish.**
* Have a variety of hobbies that you can share.  Shared interests are good way to connect to people (and a good ice breaker).  Kicking butt at Call of Duty isn't something you can share easily with others.
* Learn how to communicate nonverbally (and how to read others' body language).  A **lot** of communication can be carried along with things like posture, tone, inflection, hand gestures, and so on, and the better you can present yourself, the more effective you'll be.  Word choice is fucking critical here, and again, do your best to be positive.  This is surprisingly important.
* Have a better opinion of yourself.  There's no ""wrong end of your 20s"".  You're still young, dude.  Remember though: wisdom only comes with age if you work for it.  ""Late 20s-early 30s"" is when most people really start getting their shit together as an individual.
* Address those mental health, self esteem issues, and fears.  
* Have interesting life experiences to share.  No, this doesn't mean put yourself in danger, it means work to improve yourself and your surroundings.
* Be fun. Make others laugh.
* Everything is a skill, and skills get better at practice.  Sure things come easier to some more than others, but so what.  Study and practice will absolutely overcome untrained talent alone.
* Confidence comes with growth and practice.  There's no magic trick to it.  Study and practice.  When you make mistakes (which you will), work to understand it and learn from the situation, so you don't repeat it.  Ideally you can learn from the mistakes of others.
* If you want a specific type of person in your life, look to see the kind of people they want in their lives.  Recognize how to be a positive influence, and learn how to deal with negative influences (avoid them).  
* Meeting people is just a matter of networking.  The more you get out there, the more opportunities you will have.
* Recognize your strengths.  Not just personal ones that you cultivated, but societal ones as well (for example, white, male, heterosexual, living in a first-world country, etc).  Understand how those things affect your outlook on life, and work to understand the lives of those who don't have those things.  Cultivate empathy and understanding, and again, learn what it takes to be properly supportive.  
* Learn to stand up for yourself.  This doesn't mean be an asshole, but it's ok to have reasonable standards.  Be supportive, but don't be a doormat.  Be empathetic and compassionate, but don't tolerate toxic people or coddle dangerous mindsets.  Know where to draw the line, and more importantly, *how* to draw the line.
* Be forgiving as best as you see fit, especially for small stuff.  We're all doing our best, and everyone makes mistakes.  This includes forgiving yourself, too.
* Develop good emotional communication skills.  This is for connecting to others, but also for communicating with yourself.

* And most importantly- **Get out and talk to people.**  That's how you practice social skills, network for new jobs, and make new friends.  Staying home on the internet only gets you so far in life.

Everyone exists in a world independent of you... unless you make yourself someone they want to include.  That's how life is.  Everyone is the hero of their own story- you can either be another hero to them, a strong and supportive ally, or a *nobody.*  Don't be ""an enemy"" either- that's just lame.  

Edit: thanks for the gold!"

"When you say the wrong side of your 20s I assume that just like me you've hit 27 or something. First of all I think you should look ahead instead of back, it sounds like you are conflating being young with being interesting and exciting.  
You should look to the future and realise that you can still have a lot of great experiences. I'm sure you have hobbies and ideas that make you an interesting person and you can keep expanding on them. 

So I think you should develop yourself, your hobbies and seek new experiences. That might mean joining groups, reading new things, going to music festivals or flying out to another country to check out the vibe over there. It could be a lot of things. Hopefully getting out of your shell might give you the confidence boost you need. And I always found people who can confidently talk about things they are into intoxicating to be around. "
"I'm 6'7"" and have slept with women as short as 4'10.

Missionary gets a bit tough under 5'2"" but it can be kind of hot to have her face buried in your pec/shoulder as you go to town. Big plus if you're into nipple play (not my jam) or being bitten (my jam)

Cowgirl is fine, of course, and lets her do the work for a bit which is good because you might need a rest after;

Holding her in the air. Use a wall if you're not feeling confident, or just stand in the middle of the room like a big sexy oak tree, you magnificent bastard. It's a lot of work for your shoulders and back, but if you can do it right you feel like a ~~king~~ god.

Similarly, if you're on a bed try and start in missionary, have her lock legs around your back and then lift her up so you're kneeling if that makes sense. An arm along her back to cradle the head, her arms around your neck, and you can use her like a doll while having an arm free to play with her tits/ass/clit.

* Missionary/some variation of me on top for sustained, rougher sex. This probably feels the best out of all of them (edit: and the only position I've been able to make girls cum with anything approaching consistency).

* Despite missionary feeling best, it's always been easiest for me to cum from prone bone. Plus, I get to play with tits from an ergonomic position. And for girls who enjoy their earlobes being nibbled/kissed, this is a great position for that.

* Bonus: I've never gotten much from being ridden. I always assumed the issue was my smaller size. Few nights ago though, I was on holiday and hooked up with a much younger, very enthusiastic, and reasonably athletic girl. She was pretty insistent we try this, and when I mentioned my size might make it an issue, she just smirked. Holy. Fuck.

"I think you are asking the wrong question. Don't worry about being interesting, be interested. Read, learn, create and learn from your mistakes. Most importantly, listen. Listen to people, friends, strangers, family. Listen to their stories, their dreams, their hopes, people share what they hold dear. People like someone that's interesting, but people love to FEEL interesting. Become invested in the world around you, and the rut will naturally break."
"I just think you should realize that, at 19, your life could go either way.  I think that a man doesn’t set out to make mistakes, he makes decisions.  In my own humble opinion, you’re already fucking up by asking what mistakes are worthwhile.  You shouldn’t make any of them but the fun part is that you’re going to make plenty on your own without any input from us - and that’s when you’ll be who you were meant to be.

Most of us who have fucked up are better for it but we all wish we would have known better from the beginning.  Don’t get hooked on phases of your life.  At 24, you could be a fit, college educated man with a career and a wife or you could be an overweight drop out stoner gamer cooking gyros with a pet cat.

Ask yourself who you want to be and remember that guy in your head because he can die from the poor decisions he chooses to make.  Life is serious or it’s not.  There’s no reason to half-ass being a loser or a winner.  Define what a loser and a winner means to you, other people don’t matter.  It’s your call who you want to be but never blame anyone else for who you resolutely became.  A man takes responsibility for the choices he makes and he looks them in the eye.  Not making a decision or not committing to one is still making a choice.

I would go ahead and get out of all your teenage shit out of your system - play all the video games you want, find a music scene, smoke weed, find a weird style of clothes you like, chase women but don’t fall in love.. be a kid for a while, realize that these are mistakes and phases, don’t get trapped here.

Mistakes not to make - do not flunk out of college.  Do not drastically change your major.  do not get hooked on drugs or credit cards or video games.  Don’t go to jail.  Pull out.  Do not get married, she isn’t the one.  She’s not either.  

Remember that there are no save points for grown ups.  Good luck.

Also, don’t ever call yourself dumb again."

As to myself, I think I take one about once every 3-4 months. A lot of the time, they are not really fully mental health days, but are combined.

""I want to be pursued"" which played out as ""You're too clingy.""

""I'm not materialistic"" which played out as ""You never buy me nice things.""

""I just want someone to treat me respectfully"" which played out as ""I need to be with someone more exciting.""

Etc. Lots of guys have been told one thing by a woman and then got the opposite response as a result. I'm sure guys do the same thing. People want to want certain things, but don't really. Or are socialized to want them, but don't. Or want things at certain times and then change their mind.

Just try to be as open and honest as possible, even when things change."
"I gasped reading this. I've been noticing the same thing as OP and it led to a mini existential crisis. 

I used to draw people. People just gravitated toward me. That was when I was 18-26 and excited about life. Living in my car and loving it, hiking frequently, dumpster diving, taking free school classes, traveling around, riding motorcycle across country, moving to new cities, volunteering with food not bombs, living with anarchists and freegans, shopping only thrift stores and not caring about money. I offered experiences to others who were surprised by the lifestyle. Brought them into a life that was joyful without money. Taught them how to dumpster dive. They loved it. 

Now, I own a house. Work. Volunteer a little. Buy groceries at a store. Vacation in Hawaii. Yawn. Bore myself. Also, much more stressed now. I learned how to live in the US off of $5 to $7k a year and never used any social services/assistance and now I'm making 10 times that amount and struggling. 

This will be the year of being a creator and not a consumer. Thank you for the paradigm shift. The reminder of something forgotten. 

With that, I'm getting off Reddit now."

"&gt;I think a lot of us are just beta males

First of all you need to ditch this concept entirely. The alpha/beta social hierarchy hypothesis comes from research into wolves in captivity, and was never meant to apply to humans. It was eventually even disavowed by it's authors when they discovered that wolves in the wild behaved entirely differently.

&gt;Overly respectful (I ask for consent for everything)

As in everything sexual? That's not being ""overly respectful,"" that's just having decent communication with, and respect for your partner's boundaries. More experienced guys might be better at eliciting consent non verbally (aka making them beg for it), but guys who cram their dick into their partners without consent aren't successful, they're stupid at best and rapey at worst.

As others have suggested *No More Mr. Nice Guy* by Robert Glover is a fantastic book, for men today in general, not just for those in your situation. One of his core concepts is the idea of ""covert contracts"" whereby Nice Guys are nice to in order to get something in return, (usually sex, but it could be anything) whereas true goodness means being respectful, polite, etc. for its own sake without anything expected in return. That sounds like the bit you should focus on."

"Personally, I think it's a red flag when companies try and restrict employees in meaningless ways for the sake of ""production"".  Some of my favorites are:

* overly restrictive dress codes (key word here being ""overly"")

* time logging, especially in office jobs

* restricting internet access

* mandatory product evangelizing (basically forcing you to shill their stuff at all times)

* bad overtime policies

* ""we don't have set working hours, but most people come in at 8 and leave at around 7"".  Translation: ""we have insane working hours and will probably make you adhere to them""

* if they say something like ""our employees love working here, nobody really takes vacation days because it's so relaxed"".  You should read that as ""we hate when our employees take vacation days and we will make it really difficult to take them"".

Basically if a company tries really hard to worm their way into your off-work time, as well as heavily monitoring how you do your job, I would be very suspicious.  "
"I knew a horse girl in college. About a week after the earthquake/tsunami in Japan that took down Fukushima we were in class and talking about places to donate money or food.

She pipes up and asks about where to donate to help the animals, which is great and all. Then she clarified that she was looking for somewhere to donate that *wouldn't* spend that money on people, just animals. She'd heard so much about how ""certain funds"" (she didn't specify) would reroute the money to help people instead if animals, or had joint funds for people and animals that helped both. She wasn't interested in that apparently.

She was also majoring in ""equine studies"" as a custom major and the daughter of someone on the board of directors for the school. Red flags *everywhere* with that one."

"My current girlfriend (of over 7 years) made it obvious to me, but I was oblivious.


So, we met up randomly one day at the train station - I'd met her before, but this time she said 'Wanna go watch a movie?'

I had nothing else to do, so out we went.


After the movie I asked where she lived so I could take her home.

""Oh, I told mum I'm staying out tonight, so can I stay at yours?"" (she was living at home at the time)


I brought her to my house and it was getting late. I asked her if she wanted my bed as it was more comfy, or if she wanted the spare mattress on the floor.


She chose my bed.


Then she pointed to the Jager I had on my desk.. ""I've never had Jager before"" she told me.

She made me drink half a bottle with her, then when we were about to go to bed, I laid on the mattress on the floor and she said ""Oh... I thought you were going to sleep up here with me?""


... and THAT is when I figured it out. "
The level of enjoyment from being ridden is entirely dependent on the enthusiasm of the girl.
"Being ridden, it's a good way for a girl to show much she adores you because she has to put in the work. Visually it's very stimulating because if she's a good rider, she can really work those hips or have her breasts bounce if they're decent sized. Also really hot when the girl keeps on going after you climax to make sure you're completely drained(""already came but she's still riding!""). 

Oh and your hands are free so you can reach for any T &amp; A, motorboat, or for a controller if you want to make Cuphead even more difficult. Then again she might be the type who grasp your hands, while she continues to grind away....

For the more romantic oriented, she can right to kissing after you're both done... or muffle your orgasm cries with her lips at that one instant. If you're lucky and have a more adventurous girl like Jessical Biel in a movie(London) she did with Chris Evans(no you don't see the explicit details), get off of you as you start to climax and try to catch all all of your super strength soldier serum in her mouth.

"Take out the ""when I was drunk"" part. It feels like a qualifier, an excuse. The rest sounds good."
"We've known each other for many years and she was the first person I met when I moved to my current city.

We have different tastes in media, music, food, she doesn't drink or smoke pot (unlike me) and she's a dog person (I'm a cat person). We also have different political views and consider each other imperfect allies for the same political side. She's POC, I'm an Eastern European Jew. We can't play video games together cause she's a completionist and I just want to best the story as fast as possible. 

That said, we have awesome banter. The way we play jokes off one another is cherished. We share stories, gossip, etc - and I feel as free to talk with her as anyone else. Once a week, she comes over and we watch a sci-fi thriller on Netflix, order food, catch up on the news. Sometimes this involves baking brownies. She usually crashes on the couch and leaves early AM cause we do this on weeknights.

I don't think of her as a 'female friend'. Its weird to put a gender there. I know a lot of dudes struggle with this because they view friendships with women as stepping stones to relationships. That's okay, I guess - but not me. I'm super picky about my dating and tend to make my intentions known upfront. The idea of sexualizing her is akin to sexualizing a relative. Ew. And I know her views are similar.

Luckily, she gets along famously with my girlfriend. I know they occasionally text. We all had a slumber party last week during the snowmageddon. Black Mirror marathons and crockpot lamb roast was had.

"I saw a post on Blackpeopletwitter (I'm on mobile so I'll link to it in an edit) that has various stories of celebrities or family/friends talking about their experiences of sexual assaults where they've been laughed at or made into a joke. Find an article about some 30 year old teacher being caught harassing/assaulting/sleeping with her students and despite her using a position of power to sexualise a minor, all the comments will be about how lucky the 14 year old boy is. 

This sort of lack of listening is dangerous, especially when many universities and other institutions that have a women's officer, there's no male equivalent. That despite large amounts of men with mental health issues and huge numbers of suicides in young men, there's no support. And it's explained by the perceived privilege men have.

So to answer your question, listen to them, not all men are misogynistic marauders that orchestrated society to hate and belittle women, and we need help. And the fact that *some* men are bad or whatever, doesn't mean we can ignore the rest or tell them that they should be happy. It's pure victim blaming.

Sorry for the rant."

"It’s actually quite easy.

Just understand that men aren’t used to have anyone really care about them. 

One time a girl made me a sandwich while I was at her place. I didn’t ask for it or say that I was hungry. She didn’t even make one for herself, just for me.

It has now been four years since that sandwich and I still remember it with a smile on my face and a warm feeling inside.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that you cannot even  imagine just how much can even a small thing like a sandwich mean to us."
"Not to take the conversation in a circle, but part of the creative process should be consuming.  I know for myself, I'm hot to trot on ""creating"" and everything else feels like wasted time.  Sure, I think I get the exact ratio wrong (why did I binge Futureman in one day again?).  But the distinction comes from purpose.

Let's take my life and hobbies for instance.  My day job is IT and a lot of what I do (net engineer) is regurgitation of things I learned earlier.  There's only so many ways to stand up a firewall kids.  But often times I'll get a fun project where I get to redesign a campus or argue about WAN design (can I get ISIS on my resume this time guys?!).  My personal life consists of riding bikes and racing them.  Again, I'm reusing someone else's engineering.  There are only so many ways to seat flush mount disk brakes.

After both those things, I don't have a ton of time in the day.  One would argue that is a full day in itself! 9 hours working, 1-2 training and then eating and sleeping, not much time left.  But I still feel a need for a creative outlet.  This was actually a stress point for me last year. I felt as though, if I were to die, I'd have left behind nothing tangible that people could say I did.  So I started writing short stories (don't ask to read them yet), I make candles as gifts, I work on a stand-up comedy set (haven't performed officially yet, but the local bar folks like my material).

My point is, don't read this thread and feel that every act of consuming is bad and you should always be creative.  You'll burn out, you'll fall back to comfort and be right here again.  Creating is a muscle, you have to start slow and gain momentum. Eventually you'll crave the freedom of creation, but just like the gym, you won't love sweating right away.

My advice is to pick one thing, one small hobby.  Maybe it's an instrument, small craft, small writing projects, journaling, painting, dancing, gardening, candle making, brewing, etc. The action can be whatever you desire, as long as there are no rails. Just you and an idea that you came up with.  Do it twice a week for a small period of time.  That isn't the most important part, the goal here is to kick start your creative thinking. Reflect on what you did and think of how to make it better or different or even just how you decided to do it the first time.  Eventually you'll adjust how you do things naturally and before you know it, you'll be doing whatever it is pretty decently.  

Edit, and one more thought that is very close to me.  The ""what if when I suck"".  Here's the thing that you obviously don't know about me, this isn't a woe is me comment, is that I'm not particularly great at anything naturally.  I have two skills that I never had to put much effort into to be (only) decent at: 1 my sense of humor and 2 dodging Dodge balls (not to be confused with throwing them). Outside of that, I really am terrible at most things and not a very fast learner (sorry to all the women I've tried flirting with and awkward dance floor moves I've displayed).  I'm not naturally athletic, I have to spend 10 hours on the bike to do what a lot of guys do in 7.  I have to study the same material again and again just to remain competitive at my day job, just to retain the info.  Never very good at school, not particularly good with mechanical work (sorry rattly bikes) etc.  The key is pushing through it for long enough.  Sometimes the best you got is to just not suck.  And that's perfectly acceptable, especially important to remember in the age of Instagram and online competition.  "

"Horse riding guy myself, so I may give a bit of an extra insight.

As mentioned, yes, “daddy’s money” can be seen as a red flag, but there are as many, if not more genuine hard working horse-women out there.

Smell is a big one. Yes, I don’t notice the smell of horse shit either, but most people do, so you’ve got to respect that.

Crazy is another factor. If you’re aware of the hot/crazy scale, you’ll understand this one. Horsey people are crazy, that’s a fact, what sane person would get on a ton heavy animal that could easily kill you. Obviously, you need to be hot to counter the crazy and make you dateable…

The biggest one however, and this in in multiple ways, is time. Yes, horse riding is a very female dominated sport, it’s very rare that I ride with another guy, and horse girls don’t really put yourself in situations where you are around guys, and, as well as that being a detriment to the dating scene, it does cause an echo chamber for what the expectations of men should be. Honestly, I don’t think I’ve met a man who would meet and be willing to meet all of the expectations that the women at the yard say they want. It just isn’t plausible, and that scares men off.

Another link with time is that the horse comes first. It has to. If the girl has “daddy’s money”, then yes, maybe not, but if you wanted to date the hard working horse girl that got it all herself, then yeah, she will prioritise the horse over you. It’s kinda like dating a single mother. It’s kinda got the same strings attached as dating a single mother, if that makes sense.

And finally, he will be expecting to help out, won’t he? These are guys who (most likely) may have had zero interaction with horses in their life, and now they’re expected to pick up their shit. As in, literally. You’ve got to respect, in there eyes, horses are just glorified cattle, and don’t really understand all the hype. But, if you do find the right guy, he will help, just to make you happy.

Fuck, that was longer than expected, but I’d struggle to date a horsey woman, and I’m horsey myself. Anyway, hope that helps!"

"&gt; So she's giving you bad directions all the time and can't figure out why she's not feeling fulfilled.

I feel that this is the silent killer of relationships. In my most recent relationship, it played a major role in the breakup. The communicated expectations just didn't line up with what she actually wanted and the discontent eventually built up to the breaking point. And because it wasn't communicated before hand, it just came out of nowhere and since my ex was already ""done"" mentally, there was nothing I could do."
"I've always been spectacularly clueless about that.

At my 10 year class reunion, I was sitting at a table with 7 of my fellow female classmates, all hot.  After some light chat, one of them says, ""Hey how come you never asked me out back then?  I had such a crush on you.""  Then every single one of the other girls chimed in and said, ""Yeah, me too.""  One then added, ""I thought you were really stuck-up."" 

I wasn't stuck-up, just shy.  Even worse, I had found all of them hot back in school, but didn't have the courage to ask them out.

The girls I *did* ask out all hit me with ""I just like you for a friend.""

So apparently I asked out the girls who had no interest, and didn't think I had a chance with those who did.  

The woman I eventually married had to take the step of just writing down her number and handing it to me.  (This was before you traded cell phone numbers.) "

"Being extremely materialistic. Like being judged as to why you don’t drive an Audi, BMW, Aston Martin etc, because she sees other people my age driving them on Instagram so clearly I must be fucking up in life when I don’t drive anything near that. Or because I buy cheap clothes, like nah I’m not gonna spend $300 on a pair of jeans when holister has em on sale for $25. These were all legitimate complaints I’ve gotten from 1 ex who had unrealistic expectations. What makes it even funnier is she wasn’t any better, didn’t even have a license for fuck sake (not in a Roy Moore sense she was 22)."
"It's all the mindgames women play by never speaking their minds. A simple tip (obviously not all men work this way but for me has worked every time). Assume we're oblivious to all your hidden ways and tactics, just be upfront and tell us what you mean, don't beat around the bush and leave out all the extra fluff that doesn't matter to the direct point.

Case in point, a few years ago after just recently getting married I wanted to go shooting at the range, my wife instead of telling me that she had made plans for a surprise dinner told me that I could go if I wanted to but she sulked the entire time. I asked her if something was wrong and she said no, she just said that she hoped we could spend some time together and I said of course and asked her when she wanted to, she sighs and says nevermind and leaves in a huff.

That shit is infuriating, just tell me up front you want me to stay, don't tell me to go, testing me to see if I'll actually stay. I'm retarded, I don't get your feminine subtlety. Thankfully we had a nice discussion about open communication and now we don't have issues like this anymore."

However, Ive always been a coward and I fear rejection. so I spent a lot of time in my head trying to figure out how to ask her out... So I decided to just talk to her, but I would have to do it alone, there's no way my brain could ever do it with anyone around.  So I waited, and waited and waited. Well one afternoon she is walking ahead of me to class and there's NO ONE around so I knew this was my chance and I sprinted past her to get to the door. As she approaches it I hold the door, but because I'm freaking out, I held it shut.... So she's looking at me and I'm looking at her. We're just standing there. No ones saying anything and I'm assuming she's terrified. My eyes are probably crazy as fuck and I'm almost shaking. So I open my mouth '""REBECCA WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME?!"" Like a fucking mad man. She's petrified. She stutters out a ""no im sorry"" and I open the door. I don't think I ever talked to her again...

When I was younger, I was a member of the Royal Canadian Air Cadets. I achieved a high rank and was accepted as an instructor for a weeklong course over Christmas break. It had members from across the city come in for all sorts of training, and I was teaching the effective speaking course.

This was before cell phones were mainstream, so we would make both our families angry by tying up the phone for hours. We would joke and laugh, talk about the angsty things that teenagers do, and just be there for each other...but we didn't really hang out together.

A few months later she told me she loves me, and that she wants to hear me say it back to her. This caught me off guard, so I replied ""I love you...as a friend"". She said that she didn't want to hear the ""...as a friend part"" and tried to get me to say it back to her. I said that I couldn't say that. She kept on trying. 

I probably should have realized that our friendship was over then and there, but I was 17 and didn't have a lot of experience with girls or dating. We kept in talking on the phone over the course of a few weeks, where she would try over and over to get me to say that I loved her. I, on the other hand, tried many ways to kill the subject. I told her that I wanted to become a priest, so God could be my only love from now on. She said that she could show me what heaven was like. I told her that I was gay. She said that one night with her would change that. I've never been pursued in such a persistent manner until then.

Finally, after weeks of her trying, my underdeveloped self came up with the half-brained idea of telling her that I was depressed and going to commit suicide the next day at this time. I thought that she would just immediately lose interest and leave me alone. I hadn't considered that she would try to talk me out of it/tell my family about it. Keep in mind that this was before cell phones. So when she said ""let me talk to your parents"" I realized the shit storm I had just created for myself. Obviously I didn't let her talk to them, and then hung up and asked her to never call me back.

Then I sat by the phone. Every time someone called I would pick up the receiver before the first ring was over. She tried calling many times, and each time I basically said ""you can't change my mind...sorry!"" and would hang up. She even tried to get her sister to call, thinking I wouldn't recognize her voice. It didn't work. Finally, it passed the time that I had stated, and I never heard from her again.

This event is something that I am ashamed of now, but at the time I didn't know how to deal with someone who was so persistent after I had made it clear that I just wanted to be friends. It is literally the worst way I could have dealt with the situation.

If by some miracle you read this, Christina, I really am sorry for what happened. I hope that you are doing wonderfully in life.

"I see this all the time: nice guys call men successful with women ""jerks"". Why? I don't fucking get it. They're not jerks (well I guess some are), they're normally adjusted confident men. 

So, the main reason why you're a nice guy: You think being nice and falling over backwards for a woman will get her to fall for you. *wrong*. Women don't go for nice guys. Women go for men who are interesting and charismatic. If the only way you describe yourself is ""I'm nice to everyone"", you're not interesting nor charismatic. Anyone can be nice. 

Instead, you need to be yourself first, and then also be nice to people. That means growing a spine, which I'm sure is a thing you aren't used to. Guess what, it's ok to turn people down. it's ok to say no to a woman. You have to stand your ground, and then if others want to stand the same ground you let them and be nice, and if they don't, you don't. You have to be independent, and confident in yourself first. 

The simplest way to paraphrase is this: what you want right now is, a woman to let you in her life because you're nice to her. No. What you want to get to is, having *your own life*, and then having someone special to accompany you along the way. "
"Welcome to knowing what it's like for a guy to step up and try it. You just have to risk it, you'll probably strike out, but you never know.

"For me, it's not just any one thing in particular so much as the attitude behind it- there are few things sexier than when you can practically just *see* the wheels in a woman's head turning, and when they finally, *finally* click over from ""hmm, this is fun"" to a sort of lusty-drunk abandon where you can tell she really, really, *really* wants it.

Kissing, for one- when she grabs the lapels of my jacket and just *dives* in, looking up and tugging me down and just sort of making those little mewling noises in the back of her throat, or when I can see that instant in her eyes when she decides she needs it *bad*... That always sends chills down my spine. 

And touch. Christ, is touch important. So many women I've been with seem to think that foreplay is just another word for me getting her off and falling over myself for the chance to just be in the same room as a naked woman.

... nah.

If she's looking at me, if her fingers are already running through my hair, if her hips are working a little, needily, probably even unconsciously, when I touch her? Mmph. If she's running her hands along my skin, feeling my heartbeat, if I get the sense that she's just trying to get as much of her on as much of *me* as she possibly can?

That, my friend, is certifiably *the shit*.

You know what's also great, what gets me hard enough to feel myself drip a little? Handholding. No shit, it's *amazing.* If a woman grabs my hands, laces her fingers in between my own, and just squeezes them so that I've got no choice but to just kiss and nuzzle and eventually bring my own hands, still warm with her memory, to her own body for some full-on, lust-choked *fucking?*

*Hnnnnngh.*

A thigh-touch has creepy, unwanted, sexual harrassment innuendo attached to the gesture because it pushes through many boundaries so quickly, so it's almost always going to be a poor choice for a first touch even if she's into you.

As well, female friends tend to not see you in a sexual way (that's why it's called ""the friend zone"") so you can't exactly expect move in on them in the same way.

"My stories:

- My first girlfriend basically had to throw herself at me. We worked together at a Blockbuster and she made excuses for why we should grab a drink together after work and I just thought she was being weird and kept declining.

- Chatted with a girl at a university bar and when I got ready to go she told me that it was fun meeting me and we should do it again sometime. I agreed with her and left, thinking she was just saying something polite, and didn't even try to take her number.

- A new girl was at the gym where just the two of us were working out. She kept talking to me which I found irritating because I was trying to do my workout and catch up on podcasts. Towards the end, she said something to the degree of ""Sorry for talking your ear off! I'm new to the city and don't know anybody. I really wish someone could show me around!"" I said ""Haha, yeah, I felt the same way when I moved here. Anyways, nice meeting you"". I went into the change room and never saw her again.

Two stories to defend why men like me can be this dense:

- Went on a date with a girl who laughed at my jokes, *accidently* brushed against my crotch twice, flirted heavily, and artificially extended the date at a reasonable end point twice. She then had her brother pick her up and told me ""I should hook you up with one of my friends"", went home, and texted me in the morning saying she didn't see me that way. Meanwhile, the girl I ended up dating for 3 years almost never got a call back from me because she seemed distracted on our first date by everyone in the room except me.

- A woman in a Meetup group asked me out to brunch at a place I recommended to her. Then asked me to join her friend in town for a night of drinking and dancing. Waved goodbye while her friend was willing to go in for a hug. Then invited me to a wine tasting weekend where we would travel with other couples and share a bedroom together.  Got offended when I passed, and proceeded to ask another guy from our group that she knew even less then me and apparently she is just known for being this friendly.

"I can't date someone who makes me take the reins on every conversation. My ex used to always ask me ""so what do you want to talk about"". Every normal person in the world would already be talking about said thing if they wanted to talk about it. I just don't sit with a list of shit in my head of cool topics. It always ends up with an idk on my end because of how inane a question that is. 

I've also been on dates with girls who do the thing where they respond to a comment with a ""yeah"" and laugh/chuckle and then after a second of silence they say ""so..."" And then look at you as if you're supposed to start a new conversation or elaborate. It's just so ambiguous of signal to send and like if I feel like I'm the only one contributing to subjects in a conversation I'll start to bug out and think I'm either boring them or I'm dictating everything.

I just want to go on an interesting date once in a while. Women out there need interests and passions and should talk about them. It makes for great conversation to have someone talk about something they love, their eyes light up, and you get to really see them. So many dates I've had where the girl can't communicate that she's interested in anything. They're so forgettable. Everyone likes music and movies and hanging with friends and traveling. "

"Initially, like a painfully bright bolt to the heart. 

Then an intense tingling heat in the chest that makes it impossible to breathe because your heartbeat is moving up into your throat whenever you look at her, that turns more and more intense the longer you look until that warmth turns into the feeling of a red hot poker being shoved into your heart, so you have to look away...but then have to look at her again. 

And this sweet-and-painful yearning to hold her and be close to her, and whenever you are close to her and holding her, or are being told affectionate things by her, this amazing feeling of happiness and completeness unlike any other which just keeps growing and growing until you seem to be floating an inch off the ground. And the feeling of time flying by whenever you are together.

And at the same time, a feeling of certainty and clarity of purpose and invulnerability, like the whole world can't harm you so long as she loves you.

However, whenever she isn't around, time slows to a crawl, and all that happiness and warmth turns into agony and longing. Whenever she is unhappy, or scared, or hurt, it feels like your heart is being ripped into pieces.

By and by, that painful-giddy intensity turns into something different: Into a warm sparkling tingle which is an echo of the first, intense brilliance - if you tend to and take good care of this spark. And into a feeling of great calm and protectedness and being ""at home"" whenever you are together.

"You ever said ""you should know that by now."" or ""you should just know that.""?

Women have this expectation of empathy from men that just isn't always going to be delivered.  Men do of course have empathy, but the simulator we run in our heads when we empathize, is very up to date for manly desires, and lets say a few versions behind for what women want.

To put it bluntly, we don't read minds.  If you expect us to ""just know something"" that you haven't verbally told us (with your mouth, and at a time when we were listening with our whole selves) you have no reason to be upset when we don't ""just know it.""  you've done nothing to inform us of it.

Also, do you say ""i'm fine? it's fine?""  We don't know what the fuck you're talking about when your body language says 'fuck you"" and your mouth says ""i'm fine.""  We assume, with our outdated shittier female empathizer, that you're working through something, and you'll get over it, but that overall you're fine with us.  So what do we do?  We don't pry.  That would insinuate we don't trust you to handle your own shit.  We give you space, and quiet to talk about it.  Right up until you say (or maybe YOU DON'T but a lot of times this is how this goes down) ""I JUST THINK IT'S FUNNY THAT..."" 

This is almost always when we turn on the radio to kill the awkward silence, and especially the TV.

Basically do you ever present in a way other than how you feel?  Do you ever lie about your feelings (no matter how white the lie)?  Do you ever try to use those feelings to manipulate a situation in any way?

That's complicated, and hard to read.  I call my wife on that shit because it's nonsense.  We have a better marriage without it.  We say what we mean, we don't lie about our feelings, we have open honest dialogue.  I haven't heard a ""I just think it's funny that"" in a while now.  Thank God."

I didn’t even hesitate and said “I don’t like ice skating, thanks tho!” She responded back with a “well we can just hang out after then and meet at my place” and I tell her I’m busy with the homies.

At least I noticed it a few years later. Too little too late haha"
I tried it for a bit but I realized I'd rather be rejected old school than with the efficiency of 2017 technology; a man can only take so much.
"Do you think about her, daydreaming when you are supposed to be getting work done? Do you smile when you see her in the hall, without thinking about it your face just lights up? Do you get a little tinge of nervousness in the pit of your stomach thinking about what she might say when you finally ask her out? You like her.

Do you feel a deep hematologic hunger in the depths of your soul? When you hide from the vicious, vicious sun waiting for darkness to strike so you can emerge once more? Do you practically smell the iron, taste the acrid sweetness as it runs down the side of her neck, your fangs piercing her vein as she screams? You're probably thirsty."
"OP, are you sure that you got it from a former partner?

It's possible that your wife got it from a former partner, and according to Wikipedia, 70% of women can have no symptoms at all.

Best to tell her that you have it, and explain that symptoms can show up in both men and women years after the initial infection, and that it's best that you both get treated for it."

"Never underestimate low self-esteem.

I've had a girl ask me out straight up *""____, will you go out with me?""* and I just couldn't believe she was serious and convinced myself she wasn't. Treated it like a joke and she played along.

This was after she invited me to stay over after inviting me on a night out, but in my defence, I'd been told by her friend that she didn't like me a month prior, and she was telling me stories about guys that thought she was into them when she wasn't.

I want to say that I've learned my lesson from that, but in reality I think it really messed me up. That's not even the worst one for me."

After stimulating my wife to climax, I prefer intercourse with the sideways scissors. She is relaxed on her back with her right knee up slightly. I am on my left side with penis in vagina. If you were above us (looking down) our bodies would form an X. Both of my thighs are around her left thigh. I can easily caress her breasts with my right hand, for her pleasure and/or mine.

My actual favorite is me sitting on an ottoman (or a chair with no arms) and my wife sitting on my lap facing me (both naked, of course), penis in vagina, boobs in my face...using a chair gives her something to hold onto..."

"Three major learning curves:

1.) You have to genuinely think of the best of your spouse ALWAYS. Mutual respect feeds love. Learn to recognize when something is more important (emotionally) for your spouse, let go and compromise. Sometimes what's best for your spouse may be the exact opposite than what you'd want. Learn to pick your battles, find balance. When you do give in, don't see them as favors. See them as acts of love.

2.) Never take your partner for granted - Find ways to remind her how much she means to you. Small acts to make her life easier when she needs it the most. Word of affirmation. Shake up things in the bed! And of course going through the effort of giving her surprises that you know she'll appreciate. Sometimes that surprise can be just letting her have some me-time alone. Don't be afraid to spend time on your own, it's good for the both of you. 

3.) How vital proper communication is for the relationship. Work towards making sure you always help your spouse to understand you. Human mind is quirky in the way that it almost always picks the worst possible interpretation version of the sentence if you allow it to. Don't state your wants, talk through your heart. Tell her how you feel about it. Tell her WHY it is important to you. Similarly, learn to listen to her and be willing to change your perspective. The relationship only ever works if you both see each other as equals."

"I'm not sure if this is an answer as I've had one night stands but I have never gone into them assuming or planning for them to be one night stands. I don't have sex with people I don't like. If I like you, I'm probably willing to date you. They all turned into one night stands at the choice of the female, which I'm not complaining about. I always offer to let her stay over and invite to grab breakfast to get to know each other the next day. Some accept and we give it a shot. Some decline (always very politely), and that's cool too. 

I'm not a nice guy or a bad guy. I think I'm just pretty honest and people I meet can label me however they want. "
"If someone asks me out, it generally means that they choose the place and price range of the date- so (I think) that they would pick up the bill... However, the exact same rules apply if I asked a guy out, I would totally expect to pay for the evening that I planned myself.

If it was a mutual plan, or we'd been seeing eachother for a while- then definitely half and half, or paying alternately.

This, to me, is equality!"

I see [this](https://www.google.com/amp/starfleetrambo.tumblr.com/post/132568389283/damedoctor-fr3ight-train-acutelesbian/amp) on my feed now and again and think it makes a lot of sense for here.

&gt; A lot of people ask me what my biggest fear is, or what scares me most. And I know they expect an answer like heights, or closed spaces, or people dressed like animals, but how do I tell them that when I was 17 I took a class called Relationships For Life and I learned that most people fall out of love for the same reasons they fell in it. That their lover’s once endearing stubbornness has now become refusal to compromise and their one track mind is now immaturity and their bad habits that you once adored is now money down the drain. Their spontaneity becomes reckless and irresponsible and their feet up on your dash is no longer sexy, just another distraction in your busy life. 
Nothing saddens and scares me like the thought that I can become ugly to someone who once thought all the stars were in my eyes.

&gt; I never expected this to be my most popular poem out of the hundreds I’ve written. I was extremely bitter and sad when I wrote this and I left out the most beautiful part of that class.

&gt; After my teacher introduced us to this theory, she asked us, “is love a feeling? Or is it a choice?” We were all a bunch of teenagers. Naturally we said it was a feeling. She said that if we clung to that belief, we’d never have a lasting relationship of any sort.

&gt; She made us interview a dozen adults who were or had been married and we asked them about their marriages and why it lasted or why it failed. At the end, I asked every single person if love was an emotion or a choice.

&gt; Everybody said that it was a choice. It was a conscious commitment. It was something you choose to make work every day with a person who has chosen the same thing. They all said that at one point in their marriage, the “feeling of love” had vanished or faded and they weren’t happy. They said feelings are always changing and you cannot build something that will last on such a shaky foundation.

&gt; The married ones said that when things were bad, they chose to open the communication, chose to identify what broke and how to fix it, and chose to recreate something worth falling in love with.

&gt; The divorced ones said they chose to walk away.

&gt; Ever since that class, since that project, I never looked at relationships the same way. I understood why arranged marriages were successful. I discovered the difference in feelings and commitments. I’ve never gone for the person who makes my heart flutter or my head spin. I’ve chosen the people who were committed to choosing me, dedicated to finding something to adore even on the ugliest days.

&gt; I no longer fear the day someone who swore I was their universe can no longer see the stars in my eyes as long as they still choose to look until they find them again."

Thats a bullshit thing they put in like how they all love travelling and shit. They're trying to come off as interesting people who try new hobbies but in reality 6 out of 7 nights a week they're parked in front of netflix. Most online dating nerds post that shit.

I'll add to this that a real friendship can be the single most healing thing for someone trying to overcome mental illness. Often the connection found with other humans is one of if not the main ingredient that's missing.

"Sometimes just asking ""Hey, is everything alright?"" can be all you need to say. We guys try to act tough, but internally we need love too. "
"My opinion's not worth much, but here it is:

I've always thought that interesting people look deeper into things, whether it's just a little, or deep dives into subjects that they're passionate about.

Imagine being an avid gamer. You could just go ""oh yeah, I game 4 hours a day"", or you could, with a little reflection and thought, articulate on why games as a genre offer an experience that films, books, and music cannot. You could be sharing your opinions and observations, from how the industry has evolved, to the major franchises' current state and what they could do to spice things up, to up and coming developers to look out for and why. You could draw parallels between the zeitgeist and state of technology, and how they have shaped what games are popular. These thoughts elevate you above being a mere ""gamer"".

Don't game? What's your hobby? If it's something you're passionate about, surely there's much you can share about it.

Don't have a hobby? What interests you? Go do it!

...or you could give skydiving a go. It's definitely given me heaps to talk about with strangers."
