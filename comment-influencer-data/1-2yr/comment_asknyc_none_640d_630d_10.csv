"The silent ride, Wednesday Nov 9th 2016."
"that sucks! but you're writing is really good, have you ever considered doing childrens books? i am a children's book illustrator, i can do the pictures. i charge $100 a page, you in?"
"I once had a coworker offer me a half a Knicks season ticket plan through her ""friend"" who ""worked"" for the Knicks for $1500. I jumped at the opportunity as I could've sold the tickets on the secondary market for a 200% mark up. I was like, there's no way that this woman would scam her co-workers. Her reputation alone is worth way more. Apparently not.

I took her and her friend to court and won. Scumbags."
"I was having a really shitty birthday, circa 2007. Just feeling kind of lonely. I play the piano, just for my own enjoyment, and so I decided I would buy some sheet music as a ""gift to myself"". This was when Colonie was still open in the theater district. So I went there and was pleasantly surprised to see that there existed a piano sheet book of Pixies music, and the Pixies kick ass, so I bought it and decided to go home.

I went underground at 49th St, and was waiting for the train, sitting on the bench. There was, what seemed to be, a homeless guy -- 60s, maybe, black dude -- clutching an electric guitar with an amp at his feet, but he seemed to be taking a break, sort of leaning back.

So I'm sitting there for a few minutes, and the guy takes notice of me, with my bag from Colonie Music, and he leans forward and is sort of like, ""Heyy!"" and points at the bag.

And I'm like, ""Oh, yeah! Bought some sheet music.""

He doesn't say anything but kind of confidently gives one of these, ""Let me take a look at that"" motions with his fingers, and I'm like, oh, right, this guy's a musician so he knows sheet music. So I open the bag and take out a book, and I'm like, ""It's the Pixies.""

And his eyes widen and he more eagerly kind of waves his hand in a cheerful, but frantic way, in the universal, ""oh man, give it here!"" way.

So I hand it to him, and he sets his guitar across his lap, takes the book, and opens it up to the beginning. I'm like, ""You a fan of the Pixies?"" and he doesn't answer, but kind of looks nonplussed, and starts flipping through the pages, stopping every now and again for like a second.

Finally he gets to the song ""Letter from Memphis"", and kind of looks at me, with these big saucer eyes, really excitedly. So I'm like, ""Oh! Letter from Memphis! Do you know that song?""

And he looks back at the book spread open across his lap, then picks it up, still open, admiringly, with both hands.

I'm like, ""What is it?? Do you know it??"" and I'm getting excited now, too, but he still hasn't really said a word at all, and so I'm sort of feeling like the local sheriff from Lassie working out from the dog's barks that Timmy fell in a well -- but at least I'm working it out, and I suddenly feel like I'm having this weird and wonderful connection to somebody, on what was previously kind of a shitty day.

He transfers the book to one hand, looks at me, grinning, then holds up his other hand, open-palmed, facing upward, and heartily flicks the back of it against the book, in this kind of, ""Would you look at that way?"" Grins at the book; back at me.

And I'm like, ""You do know it! What is it?! Is it a special song???""

And he flicks it again -- then two more! Grins at me! Grins at the book! Then solemnly he lays it back down on his lap, looks at me, and declares, in this leather voice that's weathered a thousand years: ""Frankfurters.""

I say, ""Frankfurters?""

And he says, angrily: ""Frankfurters. Frankfurters and ketchup! Frankfurters, ketchup, and mustard. Mustard and ketchup. Apple sauce.""

And I realize, Oh, I'm not having a magical human connection. I'm just talking to a crazy person.

Dejectedly, I reached over and gathered the book off his lap and put it in my bag, as he raved on, and my train pulled into the station."
"&gt;	third thought was I only had 3 more stops and he wasn't gonna get any deader.

The most New York thing I’ve heard all minute. "
"F train @ 4th Ave and 9th St. Got on an ""empty car"" and only realized as the doors closed behind me. This sleeping homeless dude had a bloated chest that wasn't moving up or down. Moved in for a closer look. Waaaayyyy dead. First thought was panic, second was to tell someone right away, third thought was I only had 3 more stops and he wasn't gonna get any deader. Got off and told the conductor(?) 'hey man you got a dead guy in that car'. He just looked at me for a minute deciding to himself if he should pretend to not hear me and finally said ""awww mannnn!"" and took the train out of service. "
"It is fucking fine and everyone is overreacting. The only thing to consider is that any google maps estimates should be taken with a grain of salt when calculating your commute, just like with driving/traffic (ie if it says 40 minutes, realize that it could take 1 hour on a not so great day.)"
"You want a toe? I can get you a toe, believe me. There are ways, Dude. You don't wanna know about it, believe me. Hell, I can get you a toe by 3 o'clock this afternoon... with nail polish."
"Go to museums, I like looking at stuff at my own pace and skipping stuff I don't care about."
I looked. Just my LinkedIn and an article about several grisly murders I committed a while back. 
"it was far more somber.  cmon, i hate the guy too but 9/11 was so much worse "
They own the building
Walk walk walk. Turn down a street I've never walked before and I always find something interesting.
"It's transit-related, but I found ExitStrategy to be super worth it, especially when going to your friend's cousin's art show at a weird subway stop out past Prospect Park at 11pm in January. It tells you where to get on the train for easy transfers and exits.

Also, Dark Sky does a really, really nice job for precipitation and knowing whether you should leave right now or have another beer and wait out the rain.

Citizen is a good one as well, for those who want to know about nearby police-related events. I'd prefer not to know if there was a mugging 2 blocks from me, but I am endlessly entertained by the less-intense reportings. ""Local woman injured falling off barstool,"" etc."
"Yeah, that's what I thought, too. I'm a real estate agent where your word and reputation can make you or break you, too. When shit hit the fan, she claimed to have no knowledge of everything and basically buried her head in the sand and started getting super defensive. So I'm like, she doesn't care, I don't care either. I walked into the police station, and the next day they marched into the office and tried to arrest her. It was pretty awesome and almost worth the $1500 on it's own."
Bryant Park has some of the nicest public shitters in the country but there might be a line at any given time
"This is definitely not the weirdest, but it does pop up in my head the most:

A man walked onto the A, screamed at the top of his lungs, “BOOTY DOC IS IN THE HOUSE TONIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,” and then sat down and refused to elaborate.

I just want to know!"
"I was coming home once after a night out and shared the train car with 3 people. Two of them were sleeping and looked like they were coming home from work. The other guy was a homeless man with a shopping car. Out of nowhere I see the homeless man get up, walk up to each of the guys and kneel in front of them as if he was praying for them.

Very bizarre. Especially since the two guys have no idea they were once blessed/cursed by this homeless man. "
"I was standing on the 7 and a seated ginger white dude in full Muslim garb asked me to shift over slightly so I could provide cover while he gutted, packed and rolled a huge blunt.


On the R in midtown, a normal appearing young guy wearing a backpack walked onto the train. He started talking to himself, stripped down to just his drawers and changed his outfit. "
"I've noticed that a lot of people in New York play it ""fast and loose"", if that makes sense. In CA I was used to going on a couple of dates a month and putting my best foot forward for each of them. Here I feel like people go on so many dates that they're not really interested in putting effort in unless they're particularly interested from the get-go.

One of the first dates I went on in New York my date told me she wasn't interested within the first 10 minutes. That caught me really off guard -- I've been on bad dates before but at least we gave each other the courtesy of having a drink, especially after putting in the effort to meet up. After that, I learned to take it less seriously, and eventually found someone who was worth putting in the effort."
Hit em with the “you just did” and moonwalk up out that bitch.
"I can’t give you any advice because I have no idea what you’re like in person. That being said, like dinner, there’s so much variety in the city that sometimes people have problems choosing."
Used to be a half-man whose torso rode on a skateboard on the 7th Ave. line. I was asleep on one ride and the train came to a screeching halt. I awoke to see the guy whiz by me after he failed to grab onto a pole.
The one thing you must see is the puddle at any given street corner that only looks like a light dusting of snow but is actually 4 inches of cold gross sludge when you go to cross the street.
It's fine. Everything was fine.
I need to return some video tapes.
"Anytime someone asks ""can I ask you a question?"" it's time to disengage."
"What, a guy can’t ask where to buy body parts in the city anymore without getting downvoted immediately anymore?  

Thanks, gentrification "
Holy shit. Who would pull that on someone they had to work with every day? Glad you got your cash!
"In the episode they say it's Delancey and Orchard, but I walk past the real location every day: one block away from there at Allen and Rivington. The bench is on the northern side of the Allen St. median... Smoking a bowl in Delancey would be so stressful lol 

Definitely this bench: https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7204838,-73.9896733,3a,44.9y,356.44h,83.63t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sUkQwa92JeW9Cj6eNuHL8Lg!2e0!6s%2F%2Fgeo3.ggpht.com%2Fcbk%3Fpanoid%3DUkQwa92JeW9Cj6eNuHL8Lg%26output%3Dthumbnail%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26thumb%3D2%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D292.5126%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656"
My go tos: (1) port authority (2) grand central (3) any Barnes and Noble (4) Bloomingdale's (5) Manhattan mall (6) Macy's (7) the oculus (8) any hospital 
"This place is really my Grandmother’s. I got it from her when she moved to Florida, otherwise I could never afford a place like this. So if the landlord ever asks, I’m 87 year old woman, who’s afraid of her VCR."
Definitely. Everyone was silent and sad.
"I think you're overthinking this. The subway is the lifeline of the city - it's simultaneously frustrating and one of the things that makes New York City the city that never sleeps. Complaining about the subway is a pastime we all enjoy.

As others have said, the important things are to factor in a buffer for delays and to factor in weekend service changes. For example, on a perfect day, my commute is 45 minutes. On a hellish day, it's 90. But 9 times out of 10, it's in the 55-60 minute range and so that's what I plan for. Even with the bomb going off in Times Square last week, I got into work only 10 or so minutes later than planned - but so did everyone else. "
"The 1, 181st Street station. Heard a meowing sound, I started looking around for a cat. Realized it was just an old man doing the meowing. "
Drink.
Honestly...not fun. You’re going to meet people &amp; they’re going to want to hang at bars &amp; restaurants you can’t afford. You’re going to be around tons of ppl &amp; see rats on the subway &amp; want to go home to a nice clean apartment &amp; decompress alone...but you can’t because you live in a tiny shithole w/ a million roommates. You’re tired after work &amp; want to order in from one of the amazing restaurants around you but you can barely afford the groceries in this city. NYC broke just isn’t fun. 
Abracadabra on 21st St btw 5th and 6th Ave. If they don’t have one no one will. 
"Any historical district looks great covered with snow at night, looks like something from miracle of 34th street."
"Any scam where you pull money out of your own pocket to secure a larger payout than ends up being spurious.


For example... you're seated on a park bench and someone taps you on the shoulder.  They hold up Beats by Dre headphones and ask if you dropped them.  
""They were laying on the ground right behind the bench."" 

If you're a ""pigeon"" you'll try to get the scammer to give you the Beats because you know they're worth a couple hundred bucks.  You and him will go back and forth and eventually the scammer will say that he knows they're not really yours and he found them first anyway. ""Just give me $50 for my trouble and they're yours.""


So you fork over $50, only to find out a few hours later that they're actually a $5 pair of Deets by Bre.


There are  a lot of variations of this scam involving lottery tickets, rare coins, drugs, etc. "
reading comprehension son...
