"I mentioned to my SO that I needed a potato masher. I just had a plastic, inexpensive one in mind, but he went out and bought a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer because he once heard it ""does everything."" When I laughed and said ""I just meant the little handheld one!"" he turned around and bought an immersion blender.

I still don't have a potato masher."
The instant green flag for me was that he didn't play games. He straight up asked me whether I liked him or not and actively asked me to hangout/go on dates. I think people who are too cryptic about their feelings for you lack the emotional maturity necessary for a successful long term relationship.
"After being reunited with my adult daughter that was placed for adoption, I stopped insisting that her adoption had been a good thing and admitted that I had never consented to having her taken from me.  Getting honest about it allowed me to resolve the feelings I have about the sex assault and family drama that led to her adoption. After I admitted that I didn’t have a choice in the adoption, my daughter was able to tell me that she had been sexually abused in her adopted family. 


No one wants to hear anything about the adoption beyond the story of her finding me and us meeting. "

"A guy I work with is named Daniel Daniel Daniel. He takes it in stride since a lot of people ask if this is really his name. He gives ever changing Joker like answer about how he got the name. My favorite is his dad lost a poker game and had to name his kid the same name first, middle, and last. "
"Quasimodo in the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2. One of the biggest plot points of the first movie was that he *doesn't* get Esmaralda as a prize. He loves and cherishes her as a friend, and he supports her relationship with Phoebus (after a bit). It was a great example of how someone can have a happy ending without ""winning the girl"". So...why the fuck did they write a sequel specifically to write in a love interest for him???? "
"Posting pictures of people online to mock their looks. Subs like awfuleyebrows are just trashy to me. I'm not going to say I've never seen someone's eyebrows or outfit and thought ""yikes"" but I've also never felt like I should post their pictures somewhere to mock them for it. "

"People who display green flags are like this IME:

* They have zero interest in controlling you, display very little jealousy
* They trust you and are trustworthy themselves
* They like who they are; they have good self-esteem
* They are not quick to anger
* They have a full life of their own, they don't want or need you to become their life and reason for being
* They never critique things you can't change, and they are happy with/are attracted by/really like things you can't change and/or are natural to you"
"Not me, but I know someone who’s surname is Potter, and she had a son about a year before the books came out who she named Harry. He’s probably totally sick of it."
"Made a throwaway to avoid any of the horrific comments I worry might come from admitting this, but here goes:  


I was raped by a member of my family from age 5 until age 12. While I obviously have a fair few issues as a result of this (namely trust issues and panic attacks/anxiety) I also have a few good qualities which I feel trace directly back to being tortured and hurt at such a young age. I am more empathetic, more prone to believing someone when they say bad things happened to them, I am more likely to drop my entire life in order to help a friend out, and no one in my family is like that! I was always too afraid to try drugs or alcohol because I don't trust the people around me, but that means that I managed to escape poverty and a family FULL of drug addicts/alcoholics and now never have to talk to any of them ever again.  


I also gained a LOT of confidence in myself and in telling people to back the fuck off, because the last time he touched me I screamed at the top of my lungs (finally realized what he was doing was NOT okay and NOT normal no matter how many times he said it was) and I got to watch pure panic light up in his horrible face. I still sometimes remember the look on his face when he realized he was going to be in serious trouble and it makes me laugh/cry even now 19 years later. I'm routinely told that I'm surprisingly caring/idealistic/sweet/imaginative/smiley, and I don't know how to tell people that it's because I had my childhood stolen from me and so I clung to these things far too long.  


No one wants to hear that I am a better person for having been brutalized and raped, but it's the truth. I would happily trade my life for one where I had an actual childhood full of whatever it is kids do at that age, but I love myself anyway. Despite the foundations of my life being awful, the actual things I've built with it are amazing. To me, at least."
My boyfriends dad named all his children Tonty because that was his nickname growing up. I'm not sure the story behind it but basically since hes something important in his country he thought it would  benefit the kids to have them all named after him. The thing is Tonty is the spanish way of calling someone a dummy in an endearing way and my boyfriend now lives in Southern California where people laugh to his face when he tells him his name.  Hes developed this great way of handling it but I cant help but resent his parents for naming his something literally so stupid.

"When I was 17, I attempted suicide and was hospitalized. They wanted to keep me in the ER and then wanted to move me to a state hospital (a mental institution). My mom made an appointment with the best psychiatrist in the city and made a deal with the doctors to let me leave the hospital on the condition that I see the psychiatrist/therapist.

So I got to leave the hospital and I went to the psychiatrist and she also wanted me to be in a state hospital for at least the foreseeable future. My mom never made me go back to that therapist. She did make me find one who was right for me, though, and I had to go twice a week.

It completely changed how I felt about my mother and looking back, it is the defining moment where I realized how hard my mom was trying to protect me and fight for me."
"Calling other people's hobbies a waste of time. 

How I see it most often: They'll go on for days about how video games is not a waste of time at all because it's them having fun, but then say things like playing sports, watching TV, sewing, ect are a total waste of time. "
Netflix and Spotify. I listen to A LOT of music so definitely worth it for me and Netflix is just awesome.
"Cases of bottled water to drink at home as part of your weekly grocery store run. 

Many cheaper options: you could do a reusable water delivery subscription. Or just buy a filter. Or God forbid, if your tap water is perfectly okay, just drink straight from the tap! Why buy cases of water from the store? Why do people do this?

Edit: Talking more about the 24 pack of individual plastic bottles, not bottled water jugs or reusable water cooler types. If your tap water is bad and you do the latter, that sounds reasonable to me. "
"I just... do?  I know he's not always going to be feeling in the mood and there's nothing wrong with him saying no.  I can either choose to get myself off or wait until a time he's into it.

*That said*, I think it really depends on how big the difference in drive is.  Like, if I were a once a day gal and they were a ""maybe on my birthday"" kind of person, that's an extreme difference that would likely lead to a split.  In my relationship, the difference is there, but much smaller."
"Once he's finished, that's it, that's the Grand Finale. Once I'm finished then even if I'm sensitive or chafing, I'm expected to continue until he's done.

I'm expected to be cool with tasting myself (which I mean, I am, I don't really see the big deal but...) and kissing him after he gives oral but if he gets so much as a tiny fleck of his own come anywhere near his face then it's the end of the world. Oh, but I still have to swallow this fluid he finds so incredibly disgusting.

And on that subject, for way too many men blowjobs are seen as a default menu item but cunnilingus is a special treat that he should be praised for even considering deigning to do.

Me getting a full Brazilian wax is seen as equivalent to him trimming his ball hair.

If I don't make any noise or give any feedback during sex I'm a boring starfish prude. If he is completely silent and unresponsive during sex then hey, that's just normal, don't you know. After all, teenage boys had to grow up being silent when masturbating in their parents' house. Not like teenage girls, who all have soundproof bedrooms as mandated by law."

"If they wanted to, sure. If they didn't want to, also ok.  


I trusted him to turn down other people's advances then, and I still do.  A ring doesn't stop other's from hitting on you, at all.  A ring wouldn't have made our commitment any more or less official than it was.  "
"My father took my brother and I to Spain (we grew up/live in New Zealand, my parents were divorced) when we were 7 and 10 to visit his family there. My father and his family had a bad relationship because he struggled with substance abuse, was fat and rebellious as a teenager and they are extremely attached to their image. This was our first time meeting his family. 

About two days into the trip my father got ridiculously drunk, had a massive fight with his parents. They decided he had to leave my grandmothers house so my uncle said to my brother and I “you can stay here with us or go with your dad”. Of course we picked our father who we actually knew considering the rest were basically strangers to us still. 

We ended up staying in hotels in Barcelona for the next week and a half while my father was out of control on drugs. He spent all his money, took us to dangerous parts of town at night, left us sitting in bars alone while he went to the bathroom to take drugs. We had to beg for food, at one point my brother and I were locked out of the hotel room and spent about 6-8 hours in the lobby because he was passed out drunk. In the end my father hit a lady over the head and stole he purse and the police found us at the hotel. 

We got taken back to my fathers family for a few days and then flown back to New Zealand to my Mum. No one ever spoke to us about what happened, my brother and I only just talked about it recently - over 10 years has passed. We tried to talk to my Mum about it and she didn’t want to listen. My father ended up dying from an overdose which is another thing we don’t talk about! "

"I always hated the ""I grew up with brothers"" trope - when a woman throws a good punch/shoots a gun/etc, and then turns to the hero and says ""I have 4 brothers"" to somehow explain how she got so good at fighting. Most of my martial arts trained friends are women, and all of them took to it because they wanted to. It's just a ridiculous way to somehow ""explain"" why a girl can fight, because nooo, she can't just be good on her own, a man needs to me involved somehow. Really pisses me off."

"Leaving items you decide you no longer want to buy just anywhere around the store.

Would you do that anywhere else? At least give the item to an employee. They’ll be happy you aren’t going to force them to damage out spoiled milk later. "
"Nobody wants to hear about my struggle with ED because I’m an average weight.

I grew up with an anorexic mother and it was just the two of us in the house, so I’ve always had a tough relationship with food. I never knew if there would be anything to eat, for days at a time. I had to start cooking my own meals at twelve- not that young, but that’s when my dad left and I had never cooked before. Did the grocery shopping when my mom remembered. Lived on ramen noodles and school lunches for a long time. And granola bars, and toast, and those little ritz bits snack packs. I just had no idea how to grocery shop a healthy meal for myself. My mom pretty much just ate unbuttered microwave popcorn, like one bag a day, and then she got down to like 85 pounds and they hospitalized her. People care a lot about her ED.

But now I’m an adult and I can’t figure food out. If there’s no food, I’m in full on panic mode. I can’t skip a meal to save my life, it makes me feel a constricting ring of terror around my heart and I can’t breathe. If there is food, my brain tells me there won’t be soon so I need to eat ALL of it, NOW. I can’t figure out portion control because the panic is always right there. I’m jealous and possessive of leftovers and helping sizes. I try so hard to eat healthy- no sweets in the house, tons of fruits and vegetables, low carb, whatever- but I can binge on anything. I’ll eat two tubs of hummus in a day.

But no one wants to hear about your problems with food when you’re not skinny, or even particularly fat.

EDIT: thank you to everyone who has responded with kind words and commiserating stories. It’s really helpful to hear that this is something so many people can relate to, because it’s so easy to feel like I’m the only one. I’m at work now so I don’t have time to respond to everyone, but please know that I read every comment and they’re all meaningful to me."
The first green flag for me was comfortable silences. 
IMO that’s just about right. I’m tired of stumble/crawling over 2 other people to get out of our tent. 
"Contacting your friends, relatives, and acquaintances to sell pyramid scheme junk. I just think it’s trashy to use your personal relationships to guilt those you know into buying that crap. It’s different in my eyes if you’re trying to start a business of your own, or if you’re selling something you make.... but get your younique, lipsense, fat burner pills, weight loss shake crap away from me! Especially if we haven’t spoken since high school and you randomly drop me a message feigning interest in how my life has been, only to drop your sales pitch immediately thereafter.

I know that a lot of people don’t like this/are annoyed by it, but I’m not sure many people find it trashy, per se. I just think it’s so tacky. "

"Hair is actually a big pet peeve of mine. Very few women are able to do their hair how it looks on tv/movies every single day. Often, you see characters in the middle of the desert with perfect flowing hair. Do you have any idea how much product and water you need to do that? Also, any fight scene you see with a woman in it. In real life, she would pull her hair up.

Also, this is less a steorotype because I've only seen it in Jurassic World. But Aunt guilt really? Why is she supposed feel guilty for not spending time with kids that aren't even hers!? "
"I knew a girl called ""Tissue""....... ***legal*** name... everyone in school called her ""Tissue""... (pronounced ti-shoo)

If I'm making reservations I just use my husband's name, it's easier. 

I was always annoyed that I could never find my name on any souvenirs. "

"Honestly, my house. My husband and I don't need this much space and we only want feline dependents. We have way more space than we could ever need, but it's got a hell of a lot of character and it fit our budget because we live in a low-COL area.

It has some great space for entertaining so we're going to have a lot of game nights, potlucks, craft parties, everything. I grew up way outside of town and my mom's a hoarder. I can count on one hand with fingers to spare the number of times anyone (even family) came over, and it was inconvenient for me to go visit people in town. It was terribly lonely. So fuck yeah, I'm gonna have a dope house and fill it with friends."

"A bit of a niche answer, but after deciding to get back into using a paper planner and finding the planner world has evolved my answer is decorative planner stickers. I'm not talking about cute icons or washi tape but getting to the extreme of no white space planning (kits can be $20-$30 for STICKERS) or using so many cute stickers you don't have room to actually PLAN. Pinterest found planners and bastardized it into scrapbooking lite."

"Complaining you have it worse when someone tells you something wrong in their life. When someone tells their story, how is it opening the door for one-upping?

The kind who buys that creepy old possibly-haunted house on the hill with my wife and is only ever seen looking wild and disheveled and lurking around the woods.

"The potential to wreck my body/health, having to put the child first over everything else and the lifestyle change. 

Comes across as selfish and probably is a little but it’s a huge responsibility that you’d have to be willing to give 100% to and I don’t think I’m at that stage or if I’ll ever be. I see people half-ass their parental duties and I couldn’t do that. "

"I would like to make a defense for the case of Ron Weasley who is remembered poorly from the books and a movie depiction that emphasized his negative traits. Ron has his bad moments, sure, who doesn't but overall is a fairly average teenage that acts with great bravery. Here are some of examples;  

He follows a trail a spiders, his literal biggest fear/phobia, into dangerous woods to exonerate Hagrid and find out what petrified Hermione.   

He follows Harry to the Ministry in year 5 thinking that Voldemort, you know the scariest dark wizard ever, is torturing Sirius.   

Everyone remembers Ron being a git 4th year so I'll address that. He was, which, teenager isn't but he still warns Harry about the dragon task despite their falling out. Once the danger of the tournament is apparent to him, he apologizes very publicly and stands by his friends side.   

He tells a convicted mass murder that he has to get through him and his broken leg if wants to get to Harry.  

He rushes off with Harry to save the Philosophers Stone, knowing that a follower of Voldemort is after it. At there least he knows they have to get through a Cerebus for it and he sacrifes himself on the chess board knowing it was the only way to advance.   

Those are a few cases, overall in seven years of frienships, during, school, Ron was an asshole a few times and owned it up everytime. That's a great track record for a friendship, you've never been mad at a friend? Stuck your foot in your mouth. People remember Hermione as being perfectly capable and brilliant, because her movie depiction emphasized this. But, shee too had her share of asshole moments, which, as in the case of Ron, are drawfed by her better ones/traits. I find it totally believable that they'd end up together given the attraction/friendship/mutual experiences over the course of the books. Ron is a loyal, affable guy who owns it up when he's wrong – there are worse traits to have in a husband.   "
"This is a great question!

I ended up in a mental health facility about 6 years ago (I checked myself in because I felt suicidal one time too many), and that's when I started getting professional help.

Since then, I've experienced:

- Finding a therapist that suits me
- Graduating college in the top 5% of my class
- Getting my dream job
- Cutting out a toxic long-term relationship
- Finding the best friend I've always wanted/needed (brb, gonna text him)
- Growing closer with my brother and helping him come out to the family
- Meeting a bunch of amazing people, including my boss
- Discovering a love and talent for gardening
- Reconnecting with an old childhood friend
- Finally finding a Dungeons and Dragons group that needed another player
- Taking a risk and showing my interest in one of the guys in the D&amp;D group
- Falling in love with that guy
- Visiting various cities and trying their food and craft beers
- Letting my Grandma know how much I love her
- Trying Donald's Donuts
- Learning from the bad times
- Appreciating the good times
- Meeting Michael Nesmith (this was a lifelong dream of mine since I was a kid)
- Feeling total empowerment when I received an elective sterilization as an unmarried, childless woman under 30 (this is surprisingly difficult to achieve)

Don't get me wrong, life isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There are still dark times, but honestly, there are so many good things that I'm glad to have stuck around for, I can't even begin to list them all.

I'm glad I took the very real and scary step of checking myself into a facility that one awful night. I'm glad I stayed an extra day. I'm glad I called my brother and told him what was going on. I'm glad I spoke to professionals. I'm glad I quit hormonal contraception. I'm glad I continued to see the therapist I met while in the mental health facility. I'm glad I started regular therapy, including an antidepressant. I'm glad I took my therapy days off work so that I could spend the rest of the day feeling, processing, and healing.

I really love your question, and I love the reasoning behind it. I'm glad you don't want to follow through with such a permanent solution. I hope you can find what you're looking for, and I hope you heal and come through the other side and find a happier place here amongst the rest of us.

"I actually disagree. Peeta has his strengths but, unusually, they were not the typical alpha male strengths. Of the two of them, she was the superior fighter. His skills lay in being funny, charming, reading the room, making friends. I liked this reversal. They suited well together, but of course he was emotionally invested since he actually liked her before they met through the Games, whereas she didn’t. So throughout the stories in private they were not anything near a real relationship, and he accepted this and left it at that. By the end they had gone through so much shit together, it made sense to me that they would find solace in each other. She is a brooding introvert who needs his more extroverted optimism, and he is traumatised and needs her toughness. "

When I was 21 I was living with a boyfriend and we broke up. I slipped into a pretty major depressive episode, during which one day my mom came over, saw the state of my apartment, and forced me to move home with her. I use the word forced but it was in my best interests and I credit my mom with helping me out of this dark period. Anyway, as an attempt to get me to do something other than lay in bed all day, my mom offered to pay for an art class at a craft store. I signed up for a cake decorating class and got the list of materials I would need. They sold a kit that had everything and then some in it. But because the class was popular, they were sold out. This poor, poor guy around my age was trying to work with us, telling us which items we definitely needed and which ones we could pass over. And when I found out I couldn't get the kit, I just lost it. I started ugly crying right there and threw a fit about how the whole class was dumb and I wouldn't be any good at it anyway and I didn't even want to decorate any fucking cakes, MOM. If I recall correctly, I actually started my foot at one point. Mom was the best though. She made me go sit down and put in an order for a kit for me. A few weeks later when the class started I showed up but kept my head down the entire time I had to pass by the registers in fear I'd see the same guy working. I was probably his crazy story of the day lol"

Pretty much any time I need to kill wasps I get the stuff that sprays about 10 feet and empty too much of the container on the wasp nest.  Even if it's the start of a paper nest that has like five paper nodes on it and 1 wasp.  I _hate_ wasps.
"True, but the reason he got the girl is because he became a better version of himself (and i don’t mean becoming human).  She didn’t date him hoping that one day he would stop being so angry.  In fact, she utterly refused to interact with him until he started growing up.  They became friends, and then had a date, but she didn’t fall in love with him until after he freed her, and after he showed mercy to Gaston."
"hahahhhaha me. 

I graduated with a failing GPA. In Australia they don’t really give a shit about GPA . 1.8 /4 I think. Mostly happened due to extreme depression and lots of laziness. I got halfway through a course, decided it was too hard, and dropped out of the course. Meaning an automatic fail. 

I worked part time in retail the whole way through uni, which gave me a shit load of work experience over any of my peers. I worked my ass off at that job, and always put my hand up to do shift management, rostering, etc. any experience I could get.

After graduating, I took the first full time office job I could get (which wasn’t at all related to my field), worked my way to a promotion, then used the skills I’d learned to get a new job in my field. 

I’m now working a job in my field (in a not-for-profit) 2 years after graduating, and managing a team of 30.

Not bad for a failing GPA. "

   I'm sorry, but you don't get to pretend to be dead for YEARS and then get pissed off when you come back and find out your girlfriend got engaged to somebody else. And you definitely don't get to call her a liar and threaten to slap her (I think in the book he might have actually hit her, but I don't remember for sure) when she says she still loves her ""dead"" boyfriend. So not cool. I'm glad he rescued her from the kidnappers and the prince, but he's still an asshole."

"[Meal kits](https://www.hellofresh.com/). $10 single serving kits that you can get for $2-4 if you shop on your own.

This stuff comes RAW so you still have to cook it. I ask...DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO CUT AND TO SEASON? Sure, they include a picture pamphlet of how to add heat to precut and preseasoned food...DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW TO READ A RECIPE?

They charge 60-80% over supermarket prices which they for sure invest in all the wasteful packaging it all comes in. I saw one that had an individually wrapped FUCKING CARROT.

By the time you get every individually wrapped ingredient unwrapped and set aside and gazed over the instructions of how to add heat to food, you could have prepped and eaten a far better meal for far less."

"So many things: 

Seeing Prince perform live in Oakland, 1999. 

The birth of my baby sister’s beautiful younger son (he’s now eight). 

The surprisingly beautiful last week of my Dad’s life: he and I were very close, and my younger brother and I were the only two of his children he still knew at the end. 

The premiere of *Sing-A-Long Sound of Music* at San Francisco’s Castro Theater in the 2000’s, complete with a costume contest, party favors, and special guest Charmian Carr (Liesl!), R.I.P. 

Election Night, 2008, in Oakland, California. 

Getting to visit the monkey enclosure at an animal rescue site in Costa Rica (also in 2008): being swarmed by monkeys is the cutest chaotic thing that has ever happened to me.  

A long, emotional, ultimately very silly dinner with my husband and two sisters, just last year. 

The night I caught my middle-school students trying to TP my house, and dragged them inside to feed them Oreos. 

A friend’s baby girl climbing into my arms, putting her head on my shoulder, and going to sleep. Her little hand on my back: *pat, pat, pat.* 

I’ve struggled with mood disorder too, for more than 25 years. I’ve lost good friends and family members to it, and I still fight most weeks against the low tide. 

Do the best you can. Reach out to your loved ones, and let them help you. I wish you love, and many, many better days. &lt;3"

i worked in cosmetic retail for three years so my entire life was dealing with adult temper tantrums over discontinued products. one of the most annoying was a lady who started fake crying for an uncomfortable amount of time when i told her something was discontinued. she was like “haven’t you ever just been so heartbroken over something like this?” and i was like “...no.”

"In my experience, generalised: 

 - Men expecting women to be open to butt stuff, whether that's fingering or full anal, but not being open to receiving it.

 - Men expecting to receive oral sex as a standard, but either refusing to reciprocate, or acting like they deserve a medal on the rare occasions they do.

 - Men not wanting to wear a condom, but not wanting her to get pregnant, so leaving her fully in charge of contraception.

 - Men wanting every hair below the eyes removed on women, but the thought never even occurs to them to have a trim now and then. 

 - It's seen as normal, or more acceptable for a woman to be self conscious, not wanting to take all her clothes off, or wanting to have sex with the lights off, but it's viewed as odd or weak if a man does the same.

Those are the main ones I've encountered, and then there's the ones that aren't necessarily in bed, but still related, like men watching porn and masturbating is seen as normal and healthy, but a woman doing the same is dirty (sometimes good dirty, sometimes bad dirty, depends who you ask), or women being expected to be open to the idea of a 3 way with a man and another women, but men recoiling at the concept of a 3 way with a woman and another man.

"My mother *really* does not like it when people don't do exactly as she says. She once flipped out on my aunt for picking us up in her car and bringing us to a church event. Apparently she had wanted to do it herself upon coming home from work.

So, she ends up running into the street, sitting on the ground, screaming and crying hysterically. She starts making these really dramatic choking gestures and starts being like ""I should just kill myself!""

Someone goes up to her to give her a paper cup of water, and she grabs it from the lady and hurls it to the side.

People are standing on the side praying to god to help this disturbed person. People are telling me that I should go and give her a hug. I'm standing there like haha no, it's not my job to calm her down when she's being unreasonable.

I must have been around 9 years old. At the point, my mom had thrown temper tantrums so often, my main reaction was annoyance, exasperation, and mild amusement.

Haha, classic mom. "

He was suggesting different places that would be open at that time that had them, which ones were best, which had to-go options or did i want to dine in. I was so confused why he was going on about waffles so much. Turns out that when i mumbled/yawned he thought i had asked for waffles and was just trying really hard to give me what i wanted. I thought that was so sweet. Seeing that determination to make me happy over something i didn't even actually ask for, coupled with his impressive knowledge of waffles made me realize he was the one.

"I learned three years ago that I’m infertile and my husband and I will never have children without major assisted reproductive technology (and tons of money). We elected not to move forward with IVF for many reasons and I was really depressed about it for a year. Since then, honestly, I’ve been a little glad to have dodged that lifestyle. 

I’ve since gone back to school and now work in a career I love. I’ve been applying for jobs around the US and we’re game to move anywhere. We frequently vacation and can leave town at the drop of a hat. Mostly, I’m grateful that I get to stop putting my life on hold for a potential, future child. 

The frustrating thing to me is I can’t tell anyone about my infertility without them immediately thinking I’m sad about it. The response is always a story about their friend’s cousin’s sister’s miracle pregnancy or they bingo me by saying something like, “Ooh you can ADOPT” as if the concept of adoption never occurred to me. 

It wasn’t the path I’d originally chosen, but I’m excited to be able to live my life for me. Unfortunately, *no one* ever wants to hear this outlook on infertility."
"Definitely not saying this is the case for everyone, but I thought I had an extremely high sex drive for years. It’s actually not especially high — to be honest, it’s probably close to average. It was really just a combination of insecurity and rejection sensitivity. 

My first sexual experiences were absolutely fucked up (to the extent that I still suffer from PTSD as a result), so I came to view my own worth as equivalent to my function as a sex object. I felt I constantly needed that kind of validation from the men in my life and felt panicked and worthless when I couldn’t get it for some reason. It wasn’t a physical drive — I didn’t even have my first orgasm with a partner until I’d already been sexually active for five or six years. Rather, it was an emotional hunger that I wrongfully expected others to feed and tiptoe around instead of addressing it myself. The problems caused by the “discrepancies in sex drive” were actually just caused by my own insecurity and, frankly, unwillingness at the time to investigate why healthy sexual boundaries were so scary and foreign to me. 

No one likes to feel rejected or unwanted, and people do vary in natural drive. But Reddit circlejerk wisdom basically dictates that sex drive is woven into your DNA and it’s a relationship death sentence if there’s a discrepancy. In fact, it’s pretty likely there are some (fixable!) psychological reasons why one partner wants a lot more sex than the other. Approaching this issue with a healthy, respectful attitude and sense of boundaries makes all the difference. If your relationship is otherwise deeply loving and secure and the only problem is that one partner wants sex a bit more than the other, you’ll be able to fall back on your relationship’s solid foundation to mutually understand that it’s not personal and not feel resentful, pressured, or personally rejected when one partner wants it and the other doesn’t. After all, simply having a higher physical drive is a problem the higher-libido partner can easily fix themselves. It’s when this problem is a component of a toxic dynamic that it becomes insurmountable — the “dead bedroom” is often just a symptom, not the disease itself.

So, to answer: I’ve taken the time to personally reflect and have mostly resolved my issues. I guess I’d say my sex drive is pretty similar to my SO’s in general, but it can vary a lot depending on the circumstances. He has stretches where he works 60 to 70-hour weeks and is too exhausted to be in the mood, and I have stretches where I’m struggling a lot with my PTSD and can’t be sexual with him. We both realize that it isn’t personal when one of us can’t “put out.” The other one will take care of the physical side alone, and we will both make sure to express love and affection in other ways until we’re up and running again. 

Edit: Ahh! Thanks for the gold! I really appreciate it! "

"Peeta in the Hunger Games.

Katniss Everdeen is shown as this strong, badass character throughout the books, but Peeta is almost the opposite.

 Every instance she is almost always saving him. I hated their forced relationship in the media. If that were me and some guy was seriously saying we were dating, getting married, and/or pregnant, I would cringe myself away from the situation. I felt their relationship was pretty forced and the ending..they ended up together because Katniss needed a ""bright flower through the dark days,"" or something along the lines. 

It was just a weird, weird relationship.

I am not saying she should have ended up with Gale, but I think she should have ended up alone."
"This is a weird one. It happened on reddit, actually.

There was a thread about some case of the cops getting called on a parent for something like, letting their 9 year old play in the park alone or something.

People in the comments were talking about independence in children and I was talking about my own ""free-range childhood"". 

I responded to a few questions and started going into more detail and eventually started mentioning stuff like, being on my own in the house when I was 4-5 years old, having to make myself food at that age, my parents leaving and leaving me alone for hours where I didn't even know where they'd gone.

And someone responded and went ""Holy shit man, that's not free-range, that's just neglect."""

"&gt;People remember Hermione as being perfectly capable and brilliant, because her movie depiction emphasized this.

Yes! This. She's actually a really interesting character in the books. She's not nearly as emotionally intelligent as the movies make her out to be. She's actually a little awkward and steps on people's toes a lot because of it. Ron is awkward, too, but not in the exact ways she is. They seem to meet each other in the middle.

Personally, I've always thought it was really funny and endearing that Hermione canonically only dates jocks. I think that's one of the more realistic aspects of her character. She isn't looking for someone just like her, and a lot of people argue that Ron wouldn't be intellectually ""challenging"" as a partner - but I don't think she *wants* that. She doesn't like being challenged! She likes being *right*. She never demonstrates any love of debate or discourse; I think she's perfectly happy studying and engaging with ideas alone. "

Because we were within 5 years of age to one another, it doesn't count on things like ACE scores but it was **absolutely** abusive in nature - possessive, physically abusive, deliberately humiliating and panic-inducing so he could essentially get off on my distress, you get the idea. 

It gave me really strong opinions on how we should respond to things like rage and poor self control in children and I honestly truly believe that we need to acknowledge as a society that some people are truly dangerous from birth... and more should be done to identify them when they are young. We absolutely should be compassionate to all children, just not to the detriment of those they victimise. It's possible to do what's right for both the victimiser and the victim but only if we acknowledge the problem. "

"My sister has what should be a very standard, normal name, but for some reason my mum decided to go the ""unique"" spelling route. Think Genifyr instead of Jennifer.

I made a little single-flag stand that stood high above desk level so as to be seen from a distance so I could put up flags to indicate my current state: green meant work was normal, yellow meant I had a project, and the reds meant that I was doing something really really ridiculously important.  In particular, I would use the marine life flag, which is usually used for dangerous bacteria in the water or jellyfish, when I was in the office while sick (due to the nature of the work, there were some days I was sick as a dog but *had* to be in).  We had two people at work who had compromised immunity who appreciated my warning system."

* When they are either friends with or on friendly terms with their exes (or most of them). It shows they can handle conflict without burning bridges. And if things didn't end well, how they talk about their exes speaks volumes too. 

* How they treat and talk about their family says a lot about their character. If they are on good terms, that's a good sign. If things are dysfunctional but they have healthy boundaries, are still kind and can talk about bad things in a way that is healthy, that's also a good sign. 

* They are proactive about taking care of themselves. If there is a problem, they either solve it or get some help solving it. 

* They have hobbies, interests, goals and friendships that take place outside of a relationship. Having balance is good. 

* They are able to enjoy themselves without needing alcohol, drugs, videogames or television. They enjoy being engaged in conversation and are willing to step outside of their comfort zone. 

* They are happy for others when someone shares good news. They are kind and listen to those having a hard time and don't try to one-up them or make it all about themselves. 

* They are respectful of your personal boundaries and do not want to make you uncomfortable or feel pressured. 

* They can communicate openly and handle disagreement and setbacks gently and gracefully. You don't walk on eggshells around them. 

* They don't place you on a pedestal where *you are not like other [fill in the blank]*. There is no love-bombing, nor is there pressure to have the relationship unfold at a recklessly fast pace. "

"I have a horribly unphonetic name to the English language. Long story short my parents thought I was going to be a boy and had some biblical name picked out for me. Turns out I'm a girl and my parents have nothing. My dad decided to name me after a perfume ad he saw in a magazine. Ajee, pronounced like ah-zhay. But literally no one has ever saw it and pronounced it correctly the first time. If I lived in a French speaking country it might be a different story but it's a pain. When I went to school I didn't even know how to spell my name and didn't understand why those letters made those sounds. Having substitute teachers was the worst bc I knew they would loudly butcher my name only for the whole class to laugh. I've had people who refuse to learn how to say it correctly as if it's not only two syllables. Wearing a name tag is basically useless because it confuses people more than anything. I get less callbacks when I use my first name on my resume than when I use my middle name. When I went to college I adopted my middle name and I have plans to legally change my name so that my middle is my first and my first is my middle. I'm all for unique names but do some thinking about what you name your child."

"Cutting toxic people out of my life.

I grew up in a culture that treats me like they own me and I must do everything as they said, and that I owe them just for having been born or having married their son. It got so bad that I would have nightmares from their abuses. I finally had enough and said that I don't care if my whole community ostracize me and say all kinds of terrible things about me, I will no longer have anything to do with both my parents and my in-laws. My nights have been peaceful ever since then."

Eragon from The Inheritance Cycle. It made no sense for her to be interested in him; he was a teenager and she was like a 1000 year old elf. It also doesn't make sense that they would have even been together at all because at the end of the book he just fucking leaves to never return. It was a  super unnecessary romance in the first place and made the books worse than they should have been.
"I'm a cashier at a hobby lobby and it can be a bit depressing.

Right. Hyde basically forced her to check herself and she actually became a really cool person. I loved her before but she toned down the alpha tendencies when she hooked up with Hyde. And she didn't have to babysit him like she did Kelso. And he seemed oddly devoted to her. 
"The ""garter ceremony"" in weddings. Yes, let's have the bride and groom's closest family watch as the groom feels her up under her dress. Now let's drag all the single men in front of everyone and throw the bride's undergarment at their faces.

**Me:** so about you promising to eat me out and finger me now? 


**Him:** honestly it takes too long (5 minutes) to get you off. That means you are over stimulated and pretty much a whore. So we should train you to vaginally get off. It’s wrong for a woman to not be able to get off when she is fucked. You need help from me....

"In my experience adult bullies are a lot like childhood ones. They don't know how to react if you aren't afraid of confrontation, or, as tends to be my go-to, if you act like their very existence is boring and that they're wasting your time (which they usually are, so it's not quite an act for me lol). It helps that as I've gotten older I've gotten less likely to put up with other people's bullshit, bullying included."
"Ginny+Neville is a yes but I actually really like Harry+Luna together, Hermione+Krum and ron+idgaf. 

Harry/Luna were cute as hell, both lost parents and were social outcasts, went to slughorns party together etc. I feel like they understood on each other on a whole different level from harry/Ginny. I know hermione wasnt super into krum so I get why they're not together, but I thought he was good to her (or at least better than Ron) - super supportive, stayed in the library just to be near her when he was too shy (a huge famous quidditch player! shy around hermione!), wrote to her afterwards, etc.  I dont hate Ron at all but I don't think he has a good match the way the rest of them do.

I doubt I ever will. I don't care. But omg....if I say that out loud, they are all appalled. I didn't have the mom they had in their youth. The vibrant woman who owned a farm, horses, and had her shit together. I got the mom who lived in poverty, sold everything my grandma bought me for booze and ciggies, and had a hair trigger temper.

"I finished, but with a miserably low GPA and zero work experience or networking contacts in my field, which I guess is what happens when you have to work 35 hours/week as a full-time student. 

Went into retail after graduating because I couldn’t do anything else, but when I finally got sick of that, I signed up at a temp agency since I was a good typer. Got placed in a local University working at the front desk for their education department. I quickly developed a reputation for being a good employee, which the administrative higher-ups caught wind of. I tried to capitalize on that by applying for a Masters degree, which I surprisingly was admitted to and did really well in. 

From there I applied for and won a national scholarship to work abroad. When that was over, I got the crazy idea that I would do a PhD. Got admitted to a couple of places, Cambridge being one of them, but decided to return to the University I worked for, since that was where I started. Just finished my second year. 

Some of the things I learned: Your performance as an undergraduate doesn’t mean shit when it comes to your potential. That, and working at a temp agency can open up a lot of doors for you. "

When they asked her for her name (simple English name), she didn't hesitate. It made me realise that I have a low-level apprehension for people asking me my name, because it's such a faff to spell it out, and explain why the spelling doesn't match the pronunciation! Now I just say my name is Emily whenever I'm asked for it for things like that. 

That being said, it's a great name, and it tends to mean that people often remember me!"

"They address that though and at least are honest about it - when they're on the ferris wheel (IIRC), they're kind of dancing around delicate subjects and the teacher starts sharing personal details, then he stops himself and says he shouldn't be talking about it with her; he tells her that when she's older guys will be ""lined up around the block"" to have a chance with her. She says he has to tell her that because he's her teacher, and he says, ""No, I shouldn't be telling you that *because* I'm your teacher.""

Doesn't excuse it, but they don't go the whole movie without acknowledging that it's not exactly kosher either.

But the feeling I always got from the movie was that they were trying to imply that the teacher had a ""vibe"" or ""suspicion"" about her from the beginning, that maybe somehow he intrinsically ""knew"" that she was older, and that is straight-up bullshit for sure."

"I worked as a cashier at a grocery store in college. A couple times a year, the store would partner with local non profits for in-store fundraisers, and the cashiers would be responsible for asking for the donations. 

One year, it was the local chapter of Boys and Girls Club of America. I asked an older man coming through my line if he’d like to round his payment up to the next dollar amount as a donation. What followed was one of the most ridiculous conversations I’ve ever had:

“Would you like to round up to the nearest dollar for a donation to Boys and Girls club of America?”

“Do they help colored people?”

“Uh...excuse me?”

“Do they help colored people? I don’t donate to charities that benefit [racial slur], [racial slur], or [racial slur].”

"Soooo much this. For a main storyline that involves some of the most aggressively uninteresting characters in the history of words on pages, that series also has a background character who, upon being turned into a vampire, did her hair, put on what was going to be her wedding gown, and went psycho-Valkyrie-avenging angel on the asses of her former fiance and his friends who had gang-raped her. It's just so confusing to have such memorable background stories in the setting of the blandest flour-flavored Mary Sue protagonist and her white knight whiny control-freak love interest. THINGS COULD HAVE GONE SO RIGHT but instead Breaking Dawn was unleashed on this world and that's a wrong that can never be righted."

Also the guys are either assholes or so „perfect“ that it becomes pathetic. Trying to make us believe that a dude has to read our minds has to stop.

"Agree with the above. To add a few:

* Women having sex on first date are sluts, meanwhile there are men who are having sex with them. Some men who do this also don't view those women as 'relationship material'.
* The number of 'acceptable' partners for men and women. Guys who can't get over a woman's past yet his past is more colored.
* Men wanting to do facials but also refusing to date women who allowed men to do facials on them because they 'allowed others to degrade' them by doing so.
* Men wanting a virgin (e.g., little to no partners) with sexperience who are 'slutty' in bed.
* Women not masturbating to know about their own bodies and expecting the men to know how to get them to orgasm so he is a bad lover if he can't get her there, but if men can't get there, there must be something wrong with him (e.g., erectile dysfunction, death grip)."

"I don't know if I'd call it trashy, necessarily, but I find it to be at least distasteful when people brag about being unable to do adult things. ""I'm bad at adulting"" makes me immediately think less of someone. People should know how to budget and cook and change a tire (if they drive) and do taxes.

"I don't think it's selfish to not want kids so you can enjoy your life, it's not as if the child has already been born and you're still maintaining that attitude. You don't owe an unborn child your freedom, so don't feel bad that you don't want to take on all that work. I feel the same exact way."

"Well, he's the star of his own comic series! That's something.

In all seriousness, I grew up reading those. Archie's clumsy, not particularly smart, and perpetually broke, but Betty and Veronica seem to find him cute, and he usually comes out of his stories as an unlikely hero and/or a loyal friend. He seems to have good character and is adventurous.

Meanwhile, Reggie is completely self-absorbed, Jughead isn't interested in girls, Dilton is super-intelligent but physically unappealing, Moose is already taken and dumb as a post anyway... who's left? Maybe Betty needs to get out more often. But your reaction is especially valid with Veronica, who is always meeting other guys and yet never lets go of Archie for some reason. Something something true friendship/destiny/it's just a comic book???"

I like the theory that Palpatine was slowly killing her because it was the thing that would finally push Anakin to be Darth Vader. That also is the only thing that would make that better because come on Padme you're better than that. 
"I went to therapy for eight months to learn how to set personal boundaries. It really helped a lot and I am in a much better place. If you don’t have the means to do that, here are some of my best takeaways:

1) before asking someone a question or offering to do something for someone, ask yourself first, “Do I *really* want to know the answer/do the action? Or am I just doing it because I feel I should/it’s the right thing to do?” If the answer was no, don’t ask/offer. 

2) do not *invite* others to cross your boundaries. I learned that often it wasn’t others who were smashing all over my boundaries, it was that I was inviting them to step across out of a sense of obligation and duty. Once I stopped extending the invitation, I found that the people in my life tending to abide by fairly healthy normal boundaries. 

3) create a mantra for yourself and remind yourself of it many times a day. One of my most helpful was “I can only do what I can do, and I can be okay with that.”  It was a reminder to me to not attempt to do too much and stretch myself too thin. I set a limit for myself that I would attempt to only do things for others that I was comfortable with and that would make me feel good. It the action didn’t meet that standard, the I worked on being mentally okay with just not accepting or offering that task. 

Hope that helps a little!

"That Asian women are quiet and submissive. I know so many Asian women, both born in Asian countries and born elsewhere, and I can't think of a single person I'd consider meek or submissive.

But most are just generally outspoken, ambitious women who don't take any shit."
Giving birth is probably one of my biggest fears and it baffles me that more people don't feel the same way.

"This would drive me nuts! I had a female manager at an old job in a somewhat male-dominated industry. Both her first and last names were common male first names - think Pat Ryan.

"I was with my at the time boyfriend at his apartment when his crazy ex girlfriend shows up at his doorstep. We go outside because he lived with his brother and we didn’t want a scene disrupting the house. I proceed to watch this 28 year old adult woman drool, dry sob, and have choking coughing fits in order to get my boyfriend to baby her. In front of him. And me. And the random people walking down the street. Oh yes did I mention this was at like 3 o’clock in the afternoon? People walking their dogs while Gollum is crouched on the ground heaving and grunting. When my boyfriend didn’t respond (after about 40 minutes of grunting, choking, and coughing) she paused... stood up...and took another tactic and began screaming at him. It was like watching a two year old tantrum coming out of an adult woman. I couldn’t help but laugh. "

"For some reason in fiction, male characters always have more male friends than female characters have female friends in the same story unless it's marketed chick lit (and even then it sometimes holds true).

I think you're analysis is spot on. They compliment each other well. He never forced her hand and always liked her for her. Peeta is underrated. 
"They deliver the exact portion of ingredients you need, and it saves you shopping. There's not much point in buying a bag of carrots if you'll only use one and the rest will go bad because you only cook like twice a week. Often they come with ingredients that people may not be able to find in their city. Plus, they started in areas that are food deserts without easy access to fresh ingredients. *I* would never use one because I cook daily and have gotten good at figuring out how to roll my leftovers and extra fresh ingredients into the next meal(s), and have both a grocery store and good vegetable stand within 5 minutes walk of my apartment, but not everyone can do that or even has the option to.

I can see how they are popular for sure. I don't anymore, but I used to have a rawspicebar subscription and it was fun using new spice mixes I wouldn't have thought of, and new meals and cuisines I don't usually cook."

"I 100% agree with these green flags. When I met my SO, he was genuinely interested in getting to know me as an individual. He demonstrated active listening. He showed interest in but he didn't smother me, or tried to downplay how much he enjoyed hanging out with me. Another thing that I truly appreciate about him is when I have a concern or some feelings I need to share he was says ""thank you for sharing"" followed by a comment which validates my feelings. That was a huge difference that I saw in him from previous guys I dated. We aren't married, but we definitely are on the same page that we feel are soulmates. While we have different personalities we do share major commonalities but more importantly he accepts and likes me for how I am! I'm not always patient and when I slip and lose my patience he doesn't tell at me or try to berate me, he talks to me about it on more about how my temper made him feel so that I am more about being mindful and aware. He isn't expecting an apology but he does hope that I learn and grow from the experience. We're both this way with each other. "

"* He always spoke 100% respectfully of the romantic/sexual partners he’d had before me. There was no trash talking or comparison. Certainly no body shaming, sharing their secrets, or anything like that. 

* He’d spent his college years and early twenties in one long-term (5-year) committed relationship, which ended on relatively good terms about two years prior to me meeting him. 

* He had an actual career. He seemed to care about it. 

* He had close friends of both genders. 

* He was always on time unless he had a very good reason not to be. I remember our first date was set for 7pm. I arrived at the restaurant at 7:01. He was already there. To me, his consistent punctuality showed conscientiousness and genuine respect for me and my time.

* On that note, I think he only flaked on me like once in the first six months, and it was because something had come up at work. I never really had to question whether he would do what he said he’d do. 

* He was extremely polite and gracious both to me and to strangers. 

* He was transparent and authentic from the get-go and encouraged me to be the same way. I don’t mean that he overshared or pushed me to talk about things I wasn’t ready to discuss, but he welcomed vulnerability. It didn’t make him at all uncomfortable, and it certainly didn’t make him bored. 

* He introduced me to his friends as his girlfriend within a week. They were really nice, well-adjusted people I could see myself spending time with. His mom lives out of town, but I met her within three months. She’s also really nice, and they have a solid, healthy relationship. 

* Never, ever pressured me to do anything I didn’t want to do, sexually or otherwise 

* And sorry for TMI, but I have a really hard time climaxing, especially with new partners. The first time we ever had sex, he must’ve spent an hour helping me get there. There wasn’t even a hint of a complaint; he just cared about my pleasure. And for the record, it takes a lot less time now. :)"
"Going vegan. My binge eating disorder is close to cured, I'm losing weight, spending less money on food, my blood pressure and cholesterol shot down (I'm only 20), and I feel 1000% better about my choices.

"My boyfriend of 7 years was out of town. I was taking our new puppy outside for a potty break before bed and had a very scary encounter with one of my male neighbors. Puppy and I were okay, but I had a friend come pick me up so I could stay at her place because I didn’t feel safe in my apartment. Called up my boyfriend to tell him what happened. The first thing out of his mouth was “what were you doing outside that late at night?” and he proceeded to blame me for what had happened even though I lived in a safe and well lit area where there was little to no reason to expect walking outside with your dog would be unsafe (it wasn’t even that late at night).

This basically shattered any sense I had that he could be a source of support in a time of crisis. My friends and family are still shocked at the things he said that night and during the weeks that followed. When we finally broke up, I was crushed at first because we really were planning on being together forever. But pretty quickly I just felt relief. I wish him the best but I’m so glad to be away from him now"

After about 2 years of me playfully harassing my boyfriend, he bought me 23 ice cream scoops for Christmas. He said it was the most fun he’s ever had with a gift and could hardly hide his giggles while I was opening. 

I totally could have bought one. But I’m so glad I didn’t and let the joke play out, because now I have a box of various ice cream scoops to give out as gifts and for back ups. Have used one of them once... he was right, we didn’t need one. "
"I hope you don’t mind if I ask you a question. 

I looked at it a while ago, thinking it was like Netflix for audiobooks. But then it said you can only download one book a month. So you pay $15 a month, and you get one new book a month. But you could also just pay $15 to buy an audiobook when you wanted, instead of running on that monthly schedule. So what’s the point of paying for the subscription instead of just purchasing the audiobooks without it?"

"Have you tried seeking help from a therapist about ED? Just because you’re not super frail and thin doesn’t mean you don’t have an eating disorder and need help forming a healthy relationship with food. 

I was the opposite side of the spectrum in some respects with food. There was always junk food in my home and it wasn’t out of the ordinary for my brother and I to eat an entire bag of chips before having McDonald’s for dinner and drinking a six pack of Pepsi. Then my dad remarried when I was 8, and we moved out of grandmas house. My new stepmom restricted food to the point of ‘if you don’t like what I made, you don’t eat’ so I spent a lot of days not eating or sneaking upstairs to grab a popsicle or something else she wouldn’t notice missing. 

Once I graduated high school, I didn’t know how to form a healthy relationship with food, always eating what I wanted on impulse. I still have issues at 27. I think it’s worth it to seek help from someone whether it’s a dietician or a therapist to help you form that healthy relationship with food and to help you understand what is and isn’t healthy. "

"Not “trashy”, but being thankless with people you’re close to. I always saw manners as an incredibly classy way to validate the existence and effort of another person.

For example, a BF’s friend came over and wanted him to go down to the coffee machine in the apartment lobby with them . He had things to do in his apartment, so he offered to show them how to use the machine before we went up. They pitched a fit for him not validating their anxiety and called him ableist. 
We get upstairs, and I say to them, “okay, let’s go down, I’ll come with you”. And they in full kid fashion, they say “no”. I insist because I can feel their frustration and i know hot drinks help me when I’m upset. Again, a very child-like no. So I go, grab it for them, They drink it all without a thank. 
I offered to let them stay for dinner because they haven’t been able to afford food.  They ate it all, but again, no thank. 

They also insist on coming over to my BF’s place to use internet, almost every other day. They feel entitled to it. They will insult and belittle my BF, and never thank him for anything. 
So yeah. A person with no manners is just trashy to me.

"This is a big, big problem I have with DBZ in general. Chi Chi was a legitimate fighter and strong character in DB, but becomes an annoying stereotype very quickly in Z. Same thing happens to Videl, even worse after the show spent so much time setting her up as competent just to throw it away. Chickification in full swing. The only female character to maintain a semblance of cool factor was Bulma, and even she devolves into recurring extra.

In fairness to Toriyama, this happens to almost the whole ensemble outside the most central characters. Sidelining isn’t exclusively a problem for his female characters, but the way it’s implemented is still frustrating as hell."

But as he ages and matures and listens to her, he understands her. And even when he gives her a hard time (and vice versa) they still care about each other. High school kids (and adults) can be petty.

Hermoine is understandably very guarded and feels immense drive to get good grades because she (falsely) believes that will quell some of of the horrible comments about Muggles/her parents/her. It doesn’t- but at least they can’t use her an example of “stupid” Muggles easily. Hermoine can’t win and she’s guarded, as a form of protection. And this comes across poorly to Ron at times. Ron can be mediocre in school; if Hermoine was she’d be used as an example of what’s wrong with “Muggle-born” students. As her and Ron grow together, Ron grows up and Hermoine learns to trust him."
But the memories will last for hours.
"So if you are dating, burner phone apps are totally worth the price. 

There are tons of them for various subscription prices but you essentially get a whole new phone number to use for everything and it won't be tied to your name. Helps prevent creepers/stalkers, you don't worry nearly as much about giving out your number since you can silence someone easily, and you can use the new number to sign up for any number of other apps and services. 

Most apps offer a free trial or limited use but paying for the subscription gets rid of the adds, secures the number for you, and accepts texts from automated systems that send codes for registration (like snapchat for instance)."
"There were a lot of weird casting decisions in movies. According to the books apparently the Potters had Harry when they were like 20, so theoretically Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew should have been in their mid-30s, but then the movies cast these craggy 50-something actors and it's hard to unsee that. "
"Ehh, I have to disagree with you on that one. While I agree that Anne Hathaway’s character is a workaholic I didn't think she was a crappy mother and her and the husband's relationship seemed pretty realistic for a busy working parent and a stay at home parent. Just the traditional roles were reversed. And I think that was the point, also the husband completely cheats on her. 

Now I agree that the ending was a little disappointing, I wanted her to learn to make work less of a priority. 
But honestly, the whole thing seemed like a pretty realistic portrait of a successful businesswoman and mother, and I can't think of many other movies that highlight that. "
Or the guy who suggested bras should be made out of hundreds of adjustable straps. What an ordeal that would be.

"Make up. I have all kinds of make up. Lipsticks, eyeshadows, eyeliners, various blushes, etc... 

I hate makeup. I buy it because I always convince myself that *this* particular product is going to be the one I love, the one that makes me feel good about doing my makeup. 

I only ever use a little powder foundation, a touch of bronzer and mascara. That’s it, every day. "
"I’ve noticed quite a few comments about finding people who are sexually compatible or leaving to find someone else who is, but this isn’t always the most realistic option. If the lack of sex is a symptom of other problems in the relationship, then it warrants a deeper look into staying or leaving. But sometimes, libidos just rise and fall naturally and are not a comment on the status of the relationship. 

When my husband and I were dating and first married, we were both once or twice a day type of people. We enjoyed challenging and exploring with each other. Small touches and glances during the day led to the best nights. It was safe to say that we were compatible. 

But life happens. We’ve gotten busy, battled bouts of depression, kids, jobs, stress, medication, the works. Currently, his libido has dwindled down to almost nothing, while mine has remained the same. It’s hard. It isn’t personal, but if feels like a complete rejection and effects my self esteem. As much as I hate being beholden to something so vain, not feeling desired has taken its toll. 

We talk about it. I try every time to make sure that it is not in a manner that comes across as blaming him or making him feel bad for something that he cannot control. Since expressing how I feel and how my needs aren’t being met, my husband tries hard to make sure he verbally compliments me every time the thought crosses his head (which tends to be any time we are in a room together.) If he notices my ass look good in a pair of pants or after coming home from the gym, he states it. If he likes the bra I’m wearing, he makes sure to say something.  We have found ways to incorporate intimacy into the mundane parts of the day so that neither of us feel like it is missing entirely. 

As for the bedroom, I’ve gotten a lot more familiar with toys. There are several times where my husband and I are cuddled and he just watches and caresses me while I get myself off. 

The biggest thing is don’t neglect yourself or your partner just because there is a lack of sex. Talk. Talk about what you need and find new and creative ways to meet them. While sex can nurture intimacy, they are not the same thing. Be sure to create intimate moments with each other when you can, even if it’s just cuddling and caressing each other. "
"I have a feminine name, but the shortened version is masculine and it's what everyone calls me (think Allison - Al).

Several years ago, I ran a division of a small company and we mostly dealt with clients/affiliates over email. The owner of the company was doing a deal with a client and told them that once he got the data from Al, he would send it along. Fast forward to meeting the client face-to-face... I introduce myself as Allison and we go about the meeting, until the client (who was trying to pull a fast one) says to us something along the lines of ""that's not what Al said, _he_ said X"". That's when I realized this client has no idea that Al is short for Allison. We got it all cleared up and didn't end up actually doing business with him."
"I don't have a desk job per se (am cop) but I do have a desk, and on it is:

\- hand cream

\- coffee mug (bigger than work kitchen coffee mugs)

\- $1.85 in change 

\- four bobby pins 

\- a chapstick

\- a library book (about a library), so I don't forget to return it"
The fucking silence ! Ahhh. I love this comment.

I also encountered a Tequila but she pronounced it Tay-Quill-Uh. I feel terrible for her.

Indeed. It's a small world after all.
