"A list, of things, for me and you.

* How'ston, not Hue'ston.
* Step aside when stopping.
* I'm happy to give you directions.
* No turn on red in NYC.
* Speed limit is 25mph unless otherwise posted. 
* The subway map represents the most optimistic path to your destination. 
* If a stranger talks about anything other than directions, it's because they want money.
* Empty subway cars are empty for a reason. 
* The empire state building is open until **2am**.
* The Staten Island Ferry is free and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty
* ""La Maison Du Chocolat"" on Wall St has really good hot chocolate.
* It's ok to be a tourist!
* Please, no selfie sticks. You look ridiculous.
* Don't block the whole sidewalk.
* You're probably a slow walker relative to New Yorkers, so be aware of the people behind you.

"Maybe I'm a jaded curmudgeon, but I say 90% this is a panhandling tactic."
"biggest one is get the fuck out of the way.  if you need to stop to do something (tie your shoe, check your phone, open an umbrella), don't just stop in the middle of the busy sidewalk to do it.  and if you stop at the top of the stars leading out of the subway, you might get stabbed.  

this holds true on the subway too.  step in, as far as you can.  take your bag off and don't put it on the seat.  let the people off the train before getting on, etc.

"New Yorkers, myself included, have a very angry and visceral reaction to the thought of living in Jersey. Hoboken is great, but the commute would bother me over time, personally, but if you don't care go for it."

"Don‚Äôt stomp up or down the stairs. 

Your neighbors most likely have no interest in knowing you. 

You don‚Äôt have space to store all the things you want, and sometimes even things you need. 

No matter how fit you are anything above the 4th floor in a walkup is going to suck after a month. 

Multiple small trips to the grocery store every week as opposed to one big trip every 2 weeks. 

At some point you are going to hear your neighbors, fucking, fighting or crying, it‚Äôs best to mind your business. 

Street facing apartments below the 5th floor are loud, even if it‚Äôs fine during the day those late night garbage pickups will get you. 

Don‚Äôt expect your neighbors to be as courteous as you are. 

When viewing apartments bring a cellphone charger and test every outlet, run all plumbing fixtures simultaneously and monitor the water pressure, measure the doors for your furniture and the windows for an AC, also measure any turns in the stairwells (RIP my old couch). 

Pay attention to any businesses that may be on the ground floor of the building, living above a karate studio can be worse than living above a bar. 

Before signing a lease look on google maps for the nearest, grocer, laundry and pharmacy. 

Everyone always forgets a plunger in their first apartment. Avoid places with weird light fixtures, calling the super to change a lightbulb just feels wrong. 

Space is more important than views, no matter how cool a view may be, don‚Äôt fall into the trap.

This probably should have been a series of bullet points, but I haven‚Äôt had coffee yet.

Edit: it‚Äôs now a series of bullet points, without the bullets."

"They are a scam to get you to switch your energy supplier (which you are able to do in NY, say, if you find a company that provides ‚Äògreen‚Äô power to the grid or whatever).  They try to convince you you‚Äôll save money, and may even act like they are in some official roll with ConEd (they are definitely not). 

When they come to my door I tell them I‚Äôm not interested and close the door.

But then I usually hear them knock on all the neighbors doors (who don‚Äôt speak English) and try to tell them they are from ConEd and need to see their bill. This is the point I call the local precinct to get the d-bags out of our building (we have a pretty big building). The police are very familiar with them if you call to complain about the ‚Äúpower company people‚Äù

Total scam, never show anyone your bill as it has your account number and other info for them to ‚Äòswitch‚Äô you. Usually your power bill jumps dramatically. It‚Äôs the new version of phone slamming. 

One time these two guys pushed their way in through the lobby door as we were having a tenant meeting in the lobby (regarding the other building d-bag, the landlord).  Just ask them if they are guests of anyone in the building and if not you‚Äôre going to call the cops. They don‚Äôt like that. "
"There are two answers to this, but they both point in the same direction:

1. It's New York, it's basically impossible to be weird here. You will never be weirder than some of the people who live here; they're world-class in that category. 

2.  You're already walking 32 miles around Manhattan just to say you did it, which is plenty weird on its own.  No reason not to use the trekking poles; the die is cast regardless."
"&gt;They said they would send the apartment keys in the mail and that he is with his wife and daughter in Texas, but also that there was a caretaker to show us the place. This of course is all after a $400 deposit lol...

"[Public Transit Time Map](https://www.mapnificent.net/newyork/#12/40.7290/-73.9980/3060/40.7290/-73.9980)

This is a map that estimates how far you can travel by public transit from a particular point.

You can drop it on your work, and pick a time amount you don't mind commuting, and then browse neighborhoods on that basis."
It's the fucking 456. 
I saw my reflection once.
"Over 50% of my monthly income goes to rent. It‚Äôs not that bad because I work too much to have time to spend on crazy things. I live in an area where groceries are a lot cheaper and I usually just eat a lot at work anyways for free. For fun my friend and I will just do cheaper things like walks in the park and museums that are pay what you want and such - no broadway shows for us but that‚Äôs fine. If I can happily glide through NYC life barely over 30k a year, you‚Äôll be fine buddy. "
"When on the subway or bus, your lifelong view of ""personal space"" is suspended.

"If you divide a closet in two, you too can advertise 2bd."
"1. Get used to accounting for subway and transit delays when you're on your way to work, you'll find your rhythm but always budget an extra 10-15 minutes when you can. 
2. As has been said a ton here, on escalators walk on the left stand on the right. Same goes for the sidewalks, move as far right as you can if you're not walking the same pace as everyone else. 
3. Don't rush the subway doors, stand to the side to let people off. 
4. If you're standing right next to a door that opens and the train is super packed, walk off and let people out. People on the platform will budge a centimeter (mostly) to let you do this. 
5. Try to get the rhythm of a subway swipe down! One of the biggest pet peeves is when people swipe and do it terrible and when they don't have enough money on the card, especially during rush hour. If you're a regular commuter look into the expresspass, it's NYC's auto-reload card. 

Other than that, enjoy!"
That mother fucker! Yes it‚Äôs the same guy. His name is Tim I guess. Can this be reported to some sort of law enforcement? Anybody know how that works?
"Staten Island ferry -- good way to get views that would normally require walking around.  Also free.

I would avoid museums.  Even for people in good shape they tend to be exhausting due to the amount of walking involved."
There used to be an H and K train that ran over the 8th Ave line. I and O were never used because they look similar to the numbers 1 and 0. 
"IÔ∏è lived in Hoboken for 5 Years (now bk). It‚Äôs great if you‚Äôre early to mid twenties, preferably working on the west side. Expect to justify to people you meet how nice Hoboken is (it really is an awesome town), but don‚Äôt expect anyone to come visit."

"Not exactly on topic, but my husband got into a confrontation in the taxi line at LGA with two guys who tried cutting in front of us. One of the guys just kept telling my husband to back off, because he (line cutter) was so much more ""New York"" (than my husband), since he's been living here for 15 years. It was just as ridiculous as it sounds. "
"Someone pissed into a bunch of wadded up napkins like an oversaturated sponge and threw it at the forward-traveling door leading to the next train. Whenever the train began to accelerate, piss would dribble from the pile of napkins onto the rest of the train floor and break off into individual paths of piss like a river delta."
Often.  Was at Barney‚Äôs and Tom Ford earlier today.  Would be odd if I did not because the glamorous lifestyle of the city is what brought me here in the first place.  Nothing better than walking up and down Madison and swiping the fuck out of my Amex then popping into the Polo Bar for a few drinks before being whisked back to my TriBeCa residence.
"At Fulton St, you can get to WTC from the J/Z train by going down the stairs to the ACE platform, doing a 180 and walking to the next set of stairs, then going up, walking down the hall, hanging a left into Fulton Center, and walking along the left side and going through those turnstyles. Then you hang a right at the fancy water stand, walk down that hallway past the chocolate stand and emoji pillow stand, until you reach the glass doors of the oculus. Enter the oculus and walk down the stairs, cross the open part of the oculus, and when you get to the Apple store, you can go up those stairs to the second floor or take the escalator to the right of the Apple store up to the second level, go to the end of the oculus opposite the one you entered and keep going up, finally emerging through the glass doors that lead to outside. The memorial is right in front of you as it the wtc. "

"I can't give you advice on life generally, and how to make the adjustment from a small town, but I will caution you about something I call ""Manhattan middle-class poverty"" or what others call ""rent poor."" 

Ok, so you paid the rent, bought a Metrocard, and whatever else. Great. (Side note: and extra $3,000/mo is huge. That's like a $50,000 bump in base salary, which even in NYC can really make a difference.) But what you may not have budgeted for are the things that you can't Google from Minnesota and which don't show up on a chart in a magazine. Household goods are expensive ‚Äî Windex, toilet paper, electrical tape, potted plants. That shit adds up!

Furthermore, the ordinary household tasks that you take for granted in most parts of the US are a damn hassle in New York. Groceries, house cleaning, and laundry are all a fucking fiasco. Having laundry in your building is a perk that not all of us enjoy. On your floor, even better, and in your unit is straight up luxury. Same for a dishwasher or a storage space in the basement. 

Consider the ""reasonable luxury"" of having someone clean your apartment, even if it's only once a month. Try to get your groceries delivered (especially if you have a front desk person who can receive packages and deliveries for you), and shop around for bargains online for ordinary household shit. Not sure how much you travel, but if you can budget for a taxi or shuttle bus to the airport vs. the Subway, your entire travel experience will be improved. 

These things do cost money, certainly, but they save a ton in sanity. If you fail to budget for this, though, you'll find yourself living a very frustrated and lean life, even in a great city, having gone right to the wire on rent. 

***

Another piece of advice, and one I've heard from others who've moved from faraway cities or countries, is that you should do anything you can to live in Manhattan for the first year.

Part of it is simply for the real ""New York experience"", but again it's a major investment in your personal sanity to have a short, straightforward commute. I would even suggest moving how ever many mountains you can so you are able to walk to work. It may be expensive, but you did not come all this way just to find yourself stuck on the Subway for hours on end. 

And personally I think living in New Jersey upon arrival is a ridiculous idea. There's an isolation that can't be overstated, and you should only make that choice once you've figured out the other elements of your working and social life. (And this from a guy who grew up in NJ).

You can always move after a year, but my advice is to try your best to live a local existence, with ""reasonable luxuries"" thrown in there."
"This is is a little different but - if you are trying to go uptown on either the F or M line from Essex/Delancey, you can take either train. What is annoying is that you can‚Äôt see both trains at the same time regardless of them being very close to each other (they are right on top of each other and separated by two flights of stairs). However, at the top of the stairs (Uptown M train) and bottom of the stairs (uptown F train) there are people waiting and watching both platforms, and using each other as indicators of which train is coming. It‚Äôs funny to look at and be apart of, but most of all it‚Äôs a great system. "
"Depending where you work, the commute is shorter than from Brooklyn.  I lived in Hoboken for 20 years, and Brooklyn now for 5."
You will come across crazies from time to time on the streets. Your best bet is to ignore them and definitely don't make eye contact.  
"If you want to experience a fellow new yorker blowing a gasket:

1. Ask someone for directions to hue-ston street
2. Correct them when they read it back to you as howsten
3. Repeat #2 slowly with a little stank and impatience
4. Finally, give up and apologize for assuming they were a NYer and wish them a nice vacation in the big apple.

"My boss aways ribs me for being ""from upstate"", despite me moving down to the city when I was 16 (I'm 28 now) from the Hudson Valley. He thought that because I was from ""upstate"" (literally only like 50 miles north) that I liked guns and knives and knew how to build shelves (???)

He always tries to one up my ""new yorkness"" by saying things like ""Yeah, but did you grow up with DR BROWNS SODA?!""

Bitch, I drank Dr Browns fuckin Cel-Ray soda growing up because that's all my dad (who is from Marble Hill) would buy.

It's not a God damn contest."
"I will never understand this subject.  Do you need reassurance that you‚Äôre making the right decision by leaving?  NYC is not going to disappear no matter how loudly you complain and how many people you get to agree.    It will always be a very desirable city and someone will quickly take your place.  That‚Äôs the nature of NYC.    Quietly pack up and leave if you want something else.

I will never understand why people who leave NYC leave so loudly and dramatically."
