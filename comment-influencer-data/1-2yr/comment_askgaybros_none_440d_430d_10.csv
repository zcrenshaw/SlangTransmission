"u/TreyTheGay did this happen today/yesterday?

And are you on PrEP? If not:

Please go to an urgent care clinic or your personal doctor or if nothing else is available an Emergency Room ASAP and ask to see a doctor about PEP (post-exposure prophylactic). You are not obligated to explain what happened (I encourage you to do so, however), but PLEASE explain you had a high-risk, possible HIV exposure.

Please understand that the doctor will ask you a few questions and will probably want to do a cursory visual inspection. It's mortifying and embarrassing but he's making sure you don't have some serious tearing, for your own safety.

What's important right now is that you get put on a PEP regimen ASAP. Not tomorrow, not Monday, **right now**. It's HIGHLY effective, but the window is only 72 hours after exposure.

Please go, please protect yourself.

You will need to do a blood test at 30 days and again at 60 days to make sure you're still negative, but the medication is a 30 day regimen.

#You need to go right now. If you are told there is nothing that can be done at an emergency room, demand to speak to an infectious disease specialist. They will back you up and ensure you get the treatment necessary.


I'm so sorry this happened to you. I had something not dissimilar happen when I was younger. It's hard to deal with, emotionally, physically, mentally. There's a lot to unpack.

#But right now, you need to protect yourself. Please go get PEP.

Edit: You mentioned elsewhere regarding your parents. Please understand your parents may be upset right now, but it will be FAR worse if you contract HIV and they find out that way. PLEASE seek medical help. **RIGHT NOW**."
"Yes, you were raped. Consent can always be revoked, even during sex. So as soon as you you said no or stop and he went on, it‚Äôs rape."
"WTF?! Dude, that's like the ultimate nightmare! I'm so sorry! I will never understand why some people are such shit human beings. I know the knee jerk reaction is to never trust people again and to close yourself off to any future relationships, but just know that there are still decent, trust worthy, loving guys out there. The guy you're with isn't worth shit. There's no excuse for that. Kick his ass to the curb."
"It‚Äôs not shallow at all, it‚Äôs sad that her true gender might not be compatible with your attraction but it‚Äôs no ones fault. Just say to her that you‚Äôre super happy she‚Äôs taking steps towards what would make her happy and you love her and want to stay friends but you‚Äôre attracted to men."
"I thought the next step up was ""sissyclit"" ü§¢"
Your boyfriends sounds like a douche dump him.
"Bi man here!

The first generalization I'd make is that there's a social script for a heterosexual relationship. Obviously these things vary, but in general there's a procedure of ask her out, go on a date, kiss goodnight, plan another date, next date go somewhere nicer, make out a little, plan another... There's a sort of traditional approach one can take.
Homosexual relationships don't really have those same expectations, so people seem to say ""fuck it"" a whole lot more. Guys will jump straight to cuddling, banging, and deeply personal conversation if the interest is there. Gay relationships move much much faster in my experience, or at the very least are more comfortable amping up the intimacy. Seems like guys are more likely to have a more gluttonous approach if that makes sense. Wanting to spend all your time together, have sex, snuggle for hours out of the gate.

Sexually, it's easier with a woman in my experience. Let's face it, that's what the equipment is made for, there's a lot more potential for spontaneous, full blown sex. And for the most part, you know whose parts are gonna plug into whom. With men, there's a bit more to consider. If someone is able, willing, or enjoys being a bottom. Will they have to clean up, is there lubricant in the vicinity, how prepared is their body for this today. If you both prefer to serve a similar role, who is going to compromise this time, and how are you going to get both of you where you need to be.
However, sexual attitudes with men seem way more casual. We're wired the same way, so it's very easy to empathize. We know what it feels like to be a man who is horny, it isn't treated as a very big deal, and frankly guys are just bros about it. Your partner is in the mood and you aren't? I gotchu bro, you take care of things and I'll be right here while you do. I finished first during sex and you wanna keep on? I gotchu bro, prepare to be held and snuggled and kissed on until you're all good. Hey everyone likes BJs, you want one? I gotchu bro.

Women in my experience are socially easier to date long term. An ongoing relationship with a woman can mean talking about whether we want kids, does her family like me, ""Excuse me sir can you take our picture in front of this fountain? * kiss *"" With men of course that's a different ballgame. Do we adopt kids? It's lengthy and expensive and we'd be sentencing a child to a life of explaining to their peers about their two dads. Can we even have each others' families in our lives? Did his family throw him a party when he came out, did they throw him in the street, have they spoken in years, are they going to accept having a male partner in the house? There are only certain parts of town you feel safe expressing any sort of behavior that would lead a passerby to suspect you're gay. Don't walk too close, don't touch, certainly don't hold hands. Plus the ongoing nature of ""coming out."" Bringing your boyfriend to a christmas party and your heretofore unaware coworkers reevaluating you as a person, walking on eggshells, hyper aware of everything they say, or being over-enthusiastic to the point of unintentional condescension. That sort of commiserate experience can draw you closer to your partner in a way heterosexual relationships can‚Äôt, you have each other's backs constantly in a very tangible sense. But these same experiences make commitment much much scarier.

On a lighter note, women on average seem to be more naturally adept at kissing. I'm pretty sure guys fall out of the womb with no idea what to do with our mouths and women are just born with it.

However, from men it is nice to have incontrovertible affirmation that someone finds you attractive. Heh heh, he's got a boner he thinks I'm pretty."
the booty call is coming from inside the house
"Finally someone who actually asks the guy instead of reddit üòÅ Good for you, man. Well done"
"I'm so sorry for you.

There are those of us who, like you, stay loyal to the end.

Best wishes. :)"
Already done. Now just packing things to stay with my parents until I can decide what to do next. 
"If he‚Äôs cheated in the past he could be projecting. He thinks you‚Äôre going to do what he did. He can‚Äôt trust himself so it‚Äôs hard for him to trust you.

That doesn‚Äôt at all make it right just what I‚Äôm gathering. 

Hope you guys can get to a better place :)"
"when he said ‚ÄúI love you mate‚Äù and I thought it was a joke but he actually did love me.

saddest story of 2017"
Talk to him. Letting this boil will do neither of you good in the long run.
"rather than what would be a totally romantic gesture (guys like getting little gifts just as much as anyone!), it might be better off to start out by talking to him and just admitting you have ""feelings"" for him rather than simply dropping a clear romance shock-bomb that he wouldn't be expecting from his ""straight friend."" He will be able to quickly tell you whether he is interested in pursuing more than a friendship or not. 

Don't worry about the ""what am I"" in terms of sexuality. Just roll with it if it feels good/right and see what happens later with labels.  "
"I think it‚Äôs different for women. Lots of straight men when they get off are done, and don‚Äôt spend time getting their gf/wife to orgasm. 
I feel like with gay guys there usually is a mutual understanding of getting both guys off "
"The heart wants what the heart wants. 

That said, he cheated and even wants to have your permission to continue cheating. On TOP OF THAT, he only wants the open relationship for himself!?!? How can someone be that selfish!?

I know you‚Äôre in love, but IMO I wouldn‚Äôt be able to remain happy under those conditions and would seek a divorce. 

If you think you can remain happy knowing your man is out there fucking other people, then maybe you can make it work. I for sure would have a hard time ending it, but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm agreeing to that shit. 

"
"&gt; I am 16 years old and so is my twin.

This made me laugh :')"
"There was a really cute guy who worked in the cafe at my old job who kept making eyes at me when I went in. One day, out of the blue he said ""what time do you get off work?"" I was so taken aback as he'd never said anything beyond ""hello"" before that I just said ""5"" and carried on walking to where I was going. It wasn't until the next day that I thought maybe that was a thing. "
"I call my asshole the maw of the abyss where nothing, no light, no hope, no joy can illuminate it. "
"You did good.

Next few weeks are going to be hell as reality sets in and you'll be reminded of him in all sorts of little occurrences like something as basic as going to the grocery store.

I went through similar shit about two months ago -- also a 5 year relationship.  Lived together, no kids, engaged. Watched it happen in real time thanks to facebook messenger.  Post breakup there was a lot of internalization and replayed months worth of events/conversations over and over on things I could've done or said better.  And somewhere between the mental gymnastics of self defense and the truth of the matter, I've come to the conclusion that **even if I did everything perfectly, he's still the piece of shit who shat on the relationship.** 

""People say"" it'll take somewhere between 6 to 12 months before you're emotionally ready to date again.  Last week I met someone that was a welcome awakening -- someone who I realized I could legit get into a relationship with despite all this previous drama.  You'll get there someday.

May your heart remain breakable, but never by the same hand twice."
"a friend from college was in town for work, and on the one night he had free, we met up for drinks.

after a few cocktails, he asked if I wanted to see the city skyline view from his hotel room... I laughed and said that I'd rather keep drinking, because I get to see the view every day.

after I sobered up the next morning, I face-palmed realizing that the invite was meant to get me into bed, not to actually look at the view.

today, we still live in different cities and we're both happily married, but a little part of me will always wonder what might have been (or at least, what his dick looks like and how he'd be in bed)"
Agreed. I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you.
"Sometimes it is a little surreal because i basically think ""I like what I like"" just like anyone else (e.g. someone straight) would most of the time. Or really I don't think about it and that's the underlying reason; it's just instinct really. In a way it also hits me that so many other people are straight ""oh right most guys don't want to pound/suck other dudes, like that one over there. *WEIRD*!"" 

Sometimes I'll think ""hey you're kissing a dude right now!"" And get turned on AF when I kiss my boyfriend lol even after being out 12+ years and being a couple for 6+ years."
"You need to prioritize your safety here.  What your father is doing is at the very least psychological abuse.  I would move apartments, or at the very least invest in a good video monitoring / alarm system.  Tell a friend you trust what is going on, provide him / her evidence, this will give you leverage if somehow he ever did try to follow through you could let him know he won't get away with it.  If he keeps threatening you, call the police; I know Bosnia is a conservative place but from what I understand it's not like Saudi Arabia or a country like that culturally so being gay is legal and police should still be concerned about violent threats. 

 I'm sorry this is happening to you; please prioritize your own safety over worrying about your relationship with your father.  I would just unilaterally cut off all contact with him for at least 6 months to a year.  If there are cousins / siblings / family members you can trust, you might also want to let them know what is going on.  "
Call the police and report him on grindr.
They say gay guys might appear if you walk on long grass patches. Don't forget to bring your Pok√© Balls in case you find one.
sorry to tell u this but ur infected with big gei
"Is this because he didn't use the correct terms?

Tell him he should say ""fuck my shitoris"" "
Congrats on the sex 
"*Screams into your ass*

"
"Sorry for what's happening, know it's not your fault and the guy is just an ass. I'd say dump his ass,  I know it would be hard considering it's been a long relatipnship but let me remind you of this: This is the first time he's been caught by you, you have no clue how many other men he has been with. It is a major blow to trust that cannot be redeemed because you'll never know if he's telling the truth. Leave him, it'll hurt of course, but it's better than pouring your time and love towards someone who can't be faithful."
"As a bi dude in an open relationship, this fills me with rage. 

He wants a harem, not an open relationship. Sorry this happened to you. "
Dump his ass. Honestly those kinds of unhealthy jealous controling issues over you are seriously not okay. Especially if he's cheated on you it sounds like he's projecting his self consciousness to portray you as the untrustworthy one. If he feels the need to control you like being upset and trying to guilt you into not having friends it will only get worse. My ex was like that and ha kept promising to do better but it never lasted and the longer we were togegher the more he projected his shame onto me. The best thing i did was leave him
"High school. Sat down next to me. Alone. Very nervous. Legs shaking. Asks, ""so you're into girls right?"" I say ""what yeah."" He says ""haha just checking"" and leaves."
You shouldn‚Äôt be jealous of him but mad at your family for not understanding that your boyfriend is just as valid as his girlfriend.
I'll put dating on hold for now. It sucks that he gets to move on so soon because he had that guy as a back up.
"I mean, how good of a conversation can ""I dont like who you are becoming"" can really be..."
"Dear Diary, "
I‚Äôm on the same boat. I‚Äôm baffled how guys meet other guys outside of apps. Like I can‚Äôt even tell if someone is gay unless it was painfully obvious.
"He grabbed my hand as I was drunkenly shaking a bottle of tequila, he asked me for a shot with his puppy eyes and a kind of gay but cute voice.

But at that time I was so deep into the closet that it kind of freaked me out, i pushed him away and kept getting drunker.


"
This cute guy bought me a drink and wouldn't stop talking to me at a gay bar. I was so focused on who my ex was dancing with and if he was having a good time that I neglected to see someone else interested in me. Went home alone that night and never saw that guy again.

"You were absolutely raped, and frankly it's disturbing how many people on here are saying you weren't.   This isn't your fault, at all.   If you're up to it, contact the police, get yourself tested, seek therapy if it becomes too hard to reconcile what happened.   You.   Are not.   At fault. "
This boy is a bottom
"I‚Äôm so sorry :(

If it was my petty ass, I‚Äôd have recorded the whole thing and sent it back to him in a text message. Don‚Äôt reply to anything he says and never talk to him again.

Good job. You made the right decision. I hope you get a good guy next time instead of a cheating liar.
"Already taken several screenshots, still doing it. This is insurance"
"Doesn't have to be a ""good"" convo but it's better they have it. "
There's something weird about my radar. I can only detect gay guys which I am not attracted to.
"The exact same thing happened to me. My partner and I have been together for about eight years now but for the first five years, she was a boy. When she told me that she was trans, it was pretty surprising (she was pretty fem as a boy but the trans element seemed to come out of nowhere). I'm not really attracted to women at all so it was a difficult decision for us (what the situation would mean for our relationship). Ultimately, we decided to stay together, and even got married a year later. There are some unique complications though. For one thing, as attractive a woman as she may be, I'm not nearly as physically attracted to her as I was before the transition so we have a very open relationship physically (this was the case before the transition though so it wasn't a challenge for us). Our particular situation has been working well for a few years now but it's definitely not for everyone and not always easy. Feel free to pm me anytime about it."
"This is called Rejection Therapy.

You are still in your 20's leave him and laid the bitch out.
He won't truly be able to move on until he confronts why he felt the need to cheat.  You are better off than he is because you at least know yourself.  He doesn't.
"Trey, you must tell the authorities and go to an Emergency service and ask to see an post-exposure prophylactic doctor. You're in a high-risk to possible HIV exposure. "

"Yeah. I wouldn't want that to be a surprise. Like, it wouldn't be a dealbreaker for me, but I'd probably want to ask a few questions of a practical nature."
"I mean, just ""ass"" seems fine to me "
Thanks 
"Tactic I learned many years ago in college:

Don't ask someone if they're gay, ask if they're straight.

One, you don't want someone who is bi to feel put on the spot and having to explain something they really shouldn't have to a stranger.

More importantly, though, two ‚Äì you run the risk of offending some straight guy (they can take it as accusing them of being gay and some can get really huffed up about it), and if they ARE gay/bi, they may take it as a compliment.

Granted, a lot has changed in the last 15 years. Still, I've found it's pretty solid."

I think the only reason he would be asking permission to cheat is to invalidate the prenup and if there wasn‚Äôt one then he wouldn‚Äôt be asking permission. If he says during a future divorce that OP knew about the cheating and allowed it by opening up the marriage then the prenup can potentially be thrown out.
He tried to finger me.

"That's very sweet of you. Any chance he's sensitive about it because it's true and he's closeted too? If coming out won't make your home or school life difficult for you, it's generally best for you to do that early. If it'd truly impact your brother's social life then it's up to you -- we don't know enough to fully understand your specific community and how it'd play out. You could definitely own being the gay twin, since if one of you is out then the other one has no reason to hide being gay. In any case, definitely come out to your brother asap."

That's just cheating with extra steps!

Take that sweet, sweet support money and go back to school! Further your career, build your life into what you want it to be!

Anyway. Sorry that happened, people can be dicks. Try not to blame yourself. Whatever excuse he has, it's just an excuse. Being unfulfilled, whatever. He cheated. That's on him, not you."
I've been asking myself for many years why we're such bitches to each other.  I read this article last year and it reminded me that I need to do be more kind.  We are one community that needs to be more supportive of each other.

"Neither. I plop my ass down right onto the floor and scoot around like a dog until I'm done, then I just stand up and saunter out without washing my hands, whistling casually with my hands in my pockets."
Yes. I usually stopped myself before reaching orgasm because I didn‚Äôt know what that feeling building up was. I thought it was like pain or something from too much wanking. One day I decided to push through and here I am all gay and shit.
"That means ""get to work!"" "
Of course we do 
"True, I definitely understand why it would be frustrating to women. But as a gay guy, I often find exactly the opposite is true. Many gay guys take forever to cum, or can't cum at all from getting sucked off. There's just something about the idea of a guy who is so easily stimulated to orgasm that I find highly enjoyable ;)"

On the other hand I think it could be valuable to assess what you deem to be masculine and feminine and examine where your own thoughts come from as well, those types of views are not created in a vacuum.

It sounds like you have a ton of good advice flowing in here from the community, so I guess I'll just say, it's ok to be mad and scream, but it's also healthy to be peaceful and quiet, especially in times like this.  Personally, I find it helps me focus on my truth, and see what is truly going on.  

Mourn the loss, to be sure, but don't lose yourself in it, either.  Remember that the universe put you here to be awesome.  While you probably don't feel so awesome now, the rest of us can't wait to see you come back to us with a vengeance.  Don't lose heart, bud.

it's not just in porn. japanese people (homo and hetero) have this notion that when you are the receptive partner, you are feminine (i know, it's terrible sexist idea) and crying, wimping, screaming, make the active partner satisfied. it's submission kind of thing. 

not just in sex either. females at workplace tend to use higher-pitch voice because it's more respectable. bosses..the higher the rank, the lower the voice. "

If they're in California, OP will owe him damages + 100/day (minimum 250).

Oregon, two months rent or twice the actual damages, whichever is greater.

New Hampshire is particularly harsh, it's 1000$ or actual damages, whichever is greater. If the court can tell OP broke the law knowingly (see; this thread), then OP will be liable 3x that amount. And every day that his BF is locked out is a separate violation. E.g. OP would be on the hook for 30,000 dollars, minimum, if he kicked him out and didn't let him back in (and served him a 30 day eviction notice at the same time).

So yeah. Don't follow shitty advice. Don't do anything stupid. OP's boyfriend is obviously a piece of shit, so don't give him the satisfaction of taking you to court for an easy win. üôÑ"

"For me, ... a little fucking goes a long way, really. Like, if I get the sense a guy's trying to stop himself from cumming, I'll usually encourage him to nut. Now, there was one boy .. every time he got on my dick, I could only get a few strokes in before he was cumming all over the place. I wasn't mad, and it was kinda hot, but a *little* more fucking would've been nice. (he did claim he usually takes a long time to cum, and that it was something about the way my dick hit his prostate .. so I'll take the compliment)."
"I suspect the people doing this might have some gender dysphoria and be nonbinary. That the sort of thing trans women to do minimize dysphoria.

"**Call the police** and let them know. Tell them everything you have written here. **Do it now**, do not wait or hesitate.

Inform your father that you have notified the police and they are aware of his actions. 

Inform him you will no longer be in contact with him. 

It is not a conversation. You will tell him these two things. You will not explain yourself, you will not reason or rationalize with him, you tell him the reality of the situation and then you immediately cut all contact.

If you can, inform someone in your life who you know well and can trust about what has happened.

Edit: If you see him, immediately call the police. Again, do not hesitate, pick up the phone right where you stand or head to the nearest police station. Do not talk to him. Do not engage with him. Safety is your number one priority."

"This hit home so hard, especially the rejection part.

We grow up expecting everyone to reject us, so we reject *ourselves* in the hopes that they won't. 

We try so hard not to be gay.

Then we reach adulthood and accept the gay, face the world so eager and ready to make friends after *years* of isolating ourselves. 

And we find that we can't, because friends require common experience to talk about, and straight people didn't experience such self-rejection, didn't throw themselves into something they're good at just to cope (this shocked me to read, I thought it was just me and had nothing to do with being gay, but it makes a lot of sense now)

And people wonder ""Why do you have to make every thing about how gay you are?"" It's because our entire headspace was defined by it at an early age, and that mental warping is *still* fucking with us"

"I'd put something passive agressive in the chat, sense he has access.

And don't get drunk, that leaves you vulnerable. Don't cry or get emotional (I know that's like saying ""hold your breath for 30 minutes"", but you can do it) because if you cry, your defenses go down and if you get angry he can call the police. 

Be a gay Vulcan, suppress your emotions for logic. Crying and punching walls can come later.

Be ready for baseless accusations of you cheating on him too, there's a mental gymnastics that happens where they will make you the cheater in their mind. There's nothing you can say to make them believe otherwise, just take it as confirmation.

Don't accept an open relationship or that he will change ether. It's a car crash, the man you love is dead, this isn't that person."

"I remember debating with myself about whether I was gay, and then I'd get distracted by a hot guy walking by."
"I don't date fem guys, so there is a huge difference between dating men and women in my experience.

Firstly, dating men is much more straight-forward. In fact, sex usually comes before the actual date in many cases. With women, you could be 3 or 4 dates in before you realize that she has no interest in fucking you.

Secondly, women tend to be much clingier and sinkier. They require a great deal more praise and attention to keep them in a good mood than men do. By sinkier, I mean in terms of resources. Women are a huge timesink, cashsink, and emotionalsink compared to men.

Thirdly, you tend to know exactly where you stand with a guy the majority of the time. With women, they'll just randomly stop communicating with you and leave you to figure out what wrong you've done on your own. Women are terrible communicators in a relationship compared with men in my experience.

Lastly, when it comes time to break up, if the female is not the one to initiate it they tend to become very mean and vindictive. They'll do things like ""lose"" whatever property you left with them and ""accidentally"" tell all of your friends how you wronged her. With men, a breakup tends to be much less emotional. In fact, I am still friends with most of my male ex's and none of my female ex's."

I don't think some of the landmark decisions such as Obergefell v. Hodges or United States v. Windsor will be overturned; some LGBT rights issues have already been settled. But I do think that we won't have anymore landmark decisions of that nature. Employment protections for LGBT people? Not gonna happen anytime soon. A federal ban on parents forcing their children to go to conversion therapy? The states will have to force that issue. The LGBT rights movement will do the same thing that the women's rights movement did and progress in waves instead of as one continuous flow.

"There's no need for us. 

Straight sex relations are imbalanced, with women holding most of the power due to their higher desirability. This means straight men have to jump through a million hoops to get casual sex, which means finding a way to stand out and get women's attention. The basic one's are humor, physical attractiveness, status and wealth. 

This is also why women slut shame each other so savagely by the way. If you've got a valuable resource (pussy) it pays to control its price through manufactured scarcity. "
In the short time I worked there I saw a few guys giving head and there would be cum on the floor pretty frequently. I wish I wasn't closeted then or I would have tried to join in lol
"Different communication styles is the big one I've noticed. Women are socialized to communicate passively-- they expect you to read between the lines and intuit how they're feeling. I go for exceptionally direct women and still see some of that. 

The other big one is that a *lot* of women have baggage. A lot of women have experienced straight-up abuse from previous partners and have the scars to show for it, and even those who haven't have friends and family who have. It generally takes longer for relationships with women to settle down and for trust to really be established. They learn certain behaviors as survival techniques in shitty relationships and it can take a while to unlearn that stuff when it's no longer needed. "

I cancelled for a reason, to which he said ""awww, I really wanted to grind on you"". My roommates were like, oh he's hitting on you, but my roommate's straight, so i was like ""nah, its probably like a gay thing you know? Everyone grinds on each other if theyre gay"". Ended up un-cancelling, and went to the finale. (Best finale ever, #teamsasha). After the ep, the guy takes me outside and awkwardly stutters that he likes me. Guess he didnt wanna grind as friends.

"Dude it‚Äôs for your safety and other people‚Äôs safety, you NEED to contact police your parents wouldn‚Äôt want their child to let someone get away with an act like that "
"Communication is the key to a healthy relationship. Talk to him about what you're feeling. Let him know that you're not wanting to change him but you're only being honest to yourself and to him. 

We're actually the same. My boyfriend asked me one time if I'd be okay if he crossdress or something into that effect. I told him that I'd support him 100% but I can't promise I'd still be sexually attracted to him. He said he was just joking and would never crossdress but at least he knows what'll happen if in case he change his mind. "
"If you don't actually want to ""open the relationship"" it just won't work. This has to be a mutual decision; otherwise, you will just be making a concession that will slowly eat away at you. If he doesn't care enough about you to try and work it out being monogamous or otherwise being ""open"" on terms you can accept, you may as well take the prenup option and get out while you are still young enough to recover just fine. 

If you want to save this one, I strongly suggest relationship counseling. "
"1. the label is not so important but you don‚Äôt seem so straight to me.

I find the 'taboo-ness' of it still a turn on
"Listen, I can honestly tell you that if you‚Äôre only going for ‚Äúthe type‚Äù to find a serious relationship, you‚Äôre going to be very disappointed. I used to be just like you, only go out on dates with guys who are my type and I ended up being disappointed every single time. There wasn‚Äôt any real connection besides the physical one. I usually went for short skinny guys until one day I just decided to go on a date with this pale white guy who I wasn‚Äôt sexually attracted to at all. Something just clicked, his personality was wonderful and he was so nice to me. I am socially awkward AF and somehow, on our first date, he made me come outta my shell and be comfortable around him. found myself not only attracted to him as a gay man but actually in love with him as a person. Long story short, we have been together for the past 3 years now and I‚Äôve never been happier, I‚Äôm actually planing to propose soon.

Bottom line is, you can‚Äôt base your attraction on physical elements only. We‚Äôre human, physical attraction fades away after a while but the emotional attraction lasts a life time. Try to actually get to know people without focusing on how they look like. If you do that, things will get better for you I promise.

"
"Communication style is the biggest difference. Guys tend to be much more direct about what they think and want, and also more willing to take what you say at face value. Women seem to place higher importance on their partner's 'intuitiveness', and consequently expect feats of mind reading to guess their true intentions from dropped hints, hidden meanings and so on, and in turn also enjoy playing ""so what you really mean is..."".

A corollory to this is that guys are often more willing to take responsibility for misunderstandings - ""You should have known"" vs ""I should have been more clear"".

In practice, I've found this means gay relationships can progress much more quickly than straight ones. While the courting process with a woman may take several weeks of subtle flirting, playing hard-to-get, and trials of worthiness before any clear indication that she *actually likes you* emerges, when a guy is interested the entire thing can reduce to ""hey, I think you're hot, we should get a drink/go out/fuck sometime"". It's refreshing to have a prospective partner be so open and honest, but there's also something to be said for the challenge of 'the chase' in pursuing a woman, and the ease of getting into a relationship is reflected in the willingness to break up again later.

Once actually in a relationship, the specific differences between individuals tend to be larger than the overall difference between guys and girls. One thing I have noticed is that gender roles inevitable seep into straight relationships in away that doesn't (or can't) happen with two men. No matter how progressive or independent-minded either party is, the relationship becomes asymmetrical over time in all sorts of ways.

Break-ups are where there is the least difference. Girls and guys can both be equally crazy in all sorts of insane ways. If there's any trend, it's that the *reasons* given for breaking up tend to be more abstract for women, whereas guys can often identify a specific, concrete thing."
"I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. The group of gays I hang out with are very diverse. We are like about 10 friends that are masc, Bros, gays, queens, trans, lesbian, femme boys and we all get along super well. I actually never felt included in my life before until I met them. All the gay guys I used to know and lived with were super judgmental and never actually been to any queer groups, had any gay friend they didn‚Äôt have sex with, talked shit about anything that wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúacceptable‚Äù or ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù and there was I, totally opposite. 

They were bitching about not having gay friends because ‚Äúall gays just wanna sleep with you‚Äù but they were the ones trying to make friends on Grindr and having sex with them kinda like expecting to be friends after sex while I‚Äôm more like the I join gay sport clubs, I sign up for group of gay nerds to viviste museums or do any nerdy activity. 


I don‚Äôt know dude, i feel like most people that complain exist because they have sorta an internalized homophobia and can‚Äôt make up their minds or be a fucking human being without judging people. I even told my roomates that all those faggots they always talk shit about had more balls than them just for the fact of being happier. 

My best bet is to go out there and make friends! You‚Äôll never know your community if you‚Äôre only looking for gays in bathhouses, grindr, scruff, tinder or sketchy places and then blame on all gay people for being freaks when chose to look for them freaks in such places lol.

Man-buns. I just do not find them attractive. 
"1. He is attractive. It is only natural to be aroused by someone you find attractive.

2. It seems as though there is value in his validation. He bullied and belittled you. If he starts to like you, you will receive validation as it plays into the he changed for me narrative. Same reason why people stay in abusive relationships/friendships.

3. The guilt associated with the arousal makes the attraction worse. There is a certain sexiness with taboos. It is why femme fatales are always smoking. By not wanting to be attracted to him, a taboo of liking him is prescribed to him making the idea of sex with him more alluring. "

"At UCSD around 1999 there used to be a mostly unused gym locker room in an older gym facility that had been replaced with a newer gym elsewhere on campus. It was a great cruising grounds, because 1) basically nobody used it and 2) while there was only one entrance in the front there was also a one-way exit through a stairwell in the back that doubled as a private space to fuck in and made it really easy to discreetly flee if any non-cruiser came in.

I‚Äôd screw around there before my Calculus 20A-C classes. It was crazy hot. A lot of grad students and townies would fool around there, including this one older body-builder daddy-type who I played with on several occasions.

Joe grew up, accepted being gay, and then turned into the bitchiest queen you've ever seen, rejecting and insulting everyone and everything. All the other gays laughed and cheered him on. It made him feel strong. Strong like Mark who picked on him.

  Then a guy with the most endearing eyes and smile got off the elevator.  ‚ÄúThat one!‚Äù I said ‚ÄúHe looks stunning.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not shy. Do you want me to invite him to our table and tell him you think he‚Äôs hot?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúNo, no, no! Don‚Äôt make a fool of me in front of him and his girlfriend.‚Äù
  
 So then my friend went to stand in a long line to get is another drink.  The hot guy with the girl sat at the table right behind me.  I felt such a magnetic attraction to him that I found both of us leaned back in our chair little by little until the back of our triceps were making firm skin-to-skin contact.  
  I was so excited just to be near him, and puzzled in my head over whether he even noticed we were touching each other.
  I eavesdropped to hear him say to the girl ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre probably 10 percent of the population but people act like we don‚Äôt exist. You see the bartender? He plays for my team.‚Äù  
 What kind of team? I wondered. Or could he possibly have been saying what it seemed like he might have been saying. 
  I left with my friend a few minutes later and made it my mission for the rest of the year to run into him somewhere on campus and come up with the courage to introduce myself.  Eventually I met many gay friends and I learned that the bartender at the student union building was bi.  
 And I never saw the hot guy anywhere again. "
"&gt; we have a prenup that says if he cheats I get yearly spousal support which would generously cover my rent and car so I would have time to get back on my feet 

Take the win and bounce while you're still young, if he wants to open up your marriage it means it's pretty much over. I'm sorry."
"Being a gay man it's stuff like this that makes me thankful I'm gay, despite dealing with homophobia, the whole coming to terms with my sexuality process, etc. I understand not all women are like this, I also know that in the majority of cases both parties are to blame, but the dynamic I see in most straight relationships just confuses me, specially because some of the unhealthy elements seem to be socially accepted and sometimes even rewarded. I'd rather be alone than put up with any of that to be honest."
"Also, take action now to make sure you can minimize any risk of STD's. Who knows what kind of diseases that person has. 

This whole situation sounds terrible, and I'm sorry. "
I want a fucking werewolf ass. The hairier the better. Gimme that furry ass. 
"You need to stop drinking right now. Don't let it cloud you're head. You know what needs to be done. If you need to talk, I'm here. "

"History teaches us that what is ""hot"" at any given time is hugely influenced by culture, and that masculinity is as much a moving target as anything. Masculinity means something different in 2018 compared to, say, 1990, or 1825, or 600 BC. People used to like pale slender men because those features meant you probably were rich enough not to have to do manual labour outside for a living. These days the ""ideal"" is white men with beards and gym physiques because:

1. White people are the dominant racial group, culturally speaking.
2. Beards and body hair are short-hand for ""masculine"" and generally society treats masculine men better/treats gay men who ""fit in"" better overall and accepts them more readily. Interestingly though, this hair is generally expected to be kept trimmed and well-groomed, which would have been considered very femme even 20 years ago.
3. A dude who can spend time in the gym enough to get ripped is probably richer, healthier and will live longer than a fat man, or a man whose muscular physique is acquired through hard physical labour.

All of these things increase the value of these men as mates - you might differ on some of these things, but generally speaking these are the ""hottest"" men in Western culture right now. Sure, there's an element of ""man"" that speaks directly to genetics, but culture plays a huge part. "
Long distance open relationships
An ex once went way out of his way to get me set of particular bass strings. Spent $60 on them and then an additional $15 for a heavier gauge single E string. Knowing I tend to beat the fuck out of them when playing. I ripped his clothes off and made him squeel with all sorts of delight that night. 
You should look into getting a dog.
You‚Äôre not alone... I could never tell if my ex was lying... finally I figured out if his lips were moving he was lying.  Love fools the senses
"My sexy af neighbor in college straight up asked, ""Do you hate me?"" ""No!"" I cried. All year I had been doing that stupid thing you do in fifth grade where you act mean to a boy you like. He knew I had a crush on him and my roommate found it hilarious, but he had a girlfriend and I never wanted to make it weird.

""Do you like me?"" he asked. I hesitated. ""Aww,"" he said. ""That means no."" And he shuffled back to his dorm, defeated.

20-YEAR-OLD ME WAS SO DUMB.

Edited: Dorm is not form. Also, his code name was Abs and he was lifting his shirt up to scratch his tummy during the entire conversation. I can't have nice things."
Yep. We're only 3-5% of the population. I always find it surprising with just how rare we are.
"Pack his bags and kick him out. Make sure you let everyone in his and your personal circle know why and what a piece of shit scumbag he is. If your friends are true friends and they know him they will do the right thing and cut him out out their lives too. Make sure you take everything that is rightfully yours, he screwed you over he doesnt get a say in whats his anymore. Im so sorry your man turned out to be just another using piece of shit slut cheater. Give him a nice big kick in the balls on the way out too!"
"Walk away. There's place for only one bitch in my bedroom, and that bitch is me."
It's like you almost understand evolution but then decided to slam your face against a wall before you got too smart.
He gave me his water bottle when I left for work from his place one day. When should I ask his hand in marriage?
Well fuck him.
This couple creeps my out.
"This.  Considering y'all were together for so long, I bet you aren't on Prep or using condoms.  Who knows how much of an idiot he is when he's out running around town?   Better to go get tested for everything just to be safe."
This whole conversation is gay_irl
Dude it‚Äôs a hookup app. 
"Jerking off, playing Fallout 4, playing Civ IV. "
"If you want to be upfront about it, put it in there.

Also, you sound wonderful, I hope people aren't fuckfaces about it."
"""Try to hard"" as opposed to YAAAS QUEEN "
"He is either still currently cheating, projecting his strong cheating desires on you, or he is trying to separate you from your friends. Anyone of those reasons is a good reason to end a 5-year relationship but all of those together is a great reason to gtfo of the relationship today. It's over and you will have to accept that or stay with him and be miserable."
"Honestly its not that attractive to me...""masc"" guys who  try too hard come across as annoying and cringy"
‚ÄúNo homo btw‚Äù
I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. I‚Äôll just cry while I bench press :(
:( I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. There‚Äôs someone else that will buy you a drink :)
I'm hereby revoking your gay card. 
"This is absolutely something you need to discuss with him. There's really no other effective option, as eventually, he's going to notice the lack of sexual attraction. As soon as he becomes convinced there's no attraction there, he's going to assume the absolute worst, and you don't want that.

You're going to need to sit him down and tell him what you just told this Reddit. It doesn't make you a shitty person to have preferences, and you can't help what you are or are not attracted to. (That is kind of the rallying points of being gay)

It may not necessarily be pleasant but you both need to have this aired. It needs to be addressed so you both can do what's right for each of you."
"Kids still have bikes, right? That bike can ride on down to the 7-11 and turn 20 or 30 of his hard-earned allowance dollars into a prepaid debit card. Voila, butt plug on demand. And he can even have it delivered to the 7-11's Amazon Locker instead of home!

There's never been a better time to be a depraved teenage pervert (or even just a regular ol' gay kid)!"
"Yep

Cat fish him. Get as much info as you can out of him this time. Ask for tons of pics, especially face pics. Have him share his location with you. Ask if he can host and get his address. 

  
Get a really good photo to use, one that you know he will like, preferably of a model or thirst trap or someone already putting themselves out there. 

I usually don't condone catfishing and stealing people's photos, but....idk, maybe someone from here will let you use their photos"
"&gt;u/TreyTheGay 

re-iterating to follow this advice, go to a emergency room and explain what happened asap, or sex-health clinic I suppose."
I didn't intend to come out to a friend and was telling him about a date.  I mixed up my pronouns a few times in my story.  Oops
No man I'm broke af but virtual hugs if you want ;)
Mmm yes. But this guy was pretty and knew he was pretty. If you stare at him too long he would actually smile at you which mortified me. 
"Not really that Im gay but what being gay is to others. Sometimes, I just think ""Wow, people are really killed because they like another guys. Something that literally doesn't matter in retrospect but people like me are actually tortured, disowned by their family, and killed. Will the world ever change."" Dark and sad, but true."
I‚Äôm so sorry :(
"What‚Äôs the harm? He clearly wasn‚Äôt bothered or offended, so no need to stress about it man"
"Seconding those who say to contact authorities, and get Post-exposure prophylaxis.  

Even if you don't want to do it for your sake, think of other people being victimized the same way.   

By the way, it's not your fault.  You didn't do anything wrong.  Do not in any way blame yourself.   

This guy is a scumbag.   Nobody ""forgets"" a condom, and everyone understands ""no"".  It means the same thing in like 50 different languages.  Seriously, make him pay.  

He belongs in prison, where he can be with his own kind."
"I personally love bottoms who are bigger than me. When it comes to porn, I love watching the big, tall, and muscular guy bottom. Guys like Austin Wolf, and Colby Jansen. Your partner is out there, keep looking!"
My twin is 2 years younger than me. 
Take some time. That scum bag hurt you. Dont think about that piece of trash.
"I just lost a friend.  He can't look at me or willing to talk to me ever since he suspected that I'm gay.

I'm just sad.  I remember how close we used to be and I can't believe the same guy can be this heartless."
"That's the first step

Congrats dude :D"
"Unfortunately, I've noticed that gay people are some of the most judgmental folks I've met."
"""full acceptance"" is never going to happen. We're always going to be an anomaly, set apart from mainstream society. And you want to erase the culture that people have built and died to protect for at least 300 years? How can you not call that disrespectful?"
"No one knows what you should do. It is up to you to decide. 

It isn‚Äôt shallow to say that if he transitions then it changes your feelings for him. You fell in love with a man. However, it isn‚Äôt okay for you to try and stop him. If this is what he wants, then you should support them. Maybe not still be in a relationship with them, but support their decision. "
Do you think his boyfriend has a boyfriend?
Twinks
Limo dick?  Is that a dick that fits an entire wedding party?
