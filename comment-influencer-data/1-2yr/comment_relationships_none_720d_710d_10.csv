"So many questions.

&gt;In a very tragic and frankly disgusting ""accident"" my husband didn't notice that one of the dogs had hooked its collar over a slat in the gate and strangled itself to deat

How long was that poor dog there before the neighbor called it in???

Rehome those poor dogs ASAP.  Next step:  Leave your husband.  Depressed or not, he's a hot mess and you can't keep tethering yourself to a person like this.  He's dragging you down and you deserve better.  "
"Well, first of all explain to him how insulting it is that he is implying you were chosen for the work trip to look into this problem simply because you're a female and not because of merit. Remind him you were chosen because you have a great career, and will not entertain this kind of sexist nonsense and he can leave that at the door if he wants to continue this relationship. 

Secondly, tell him you can agree to a level of communication while you are gone - i.e. you'll remain connected everyday, a call once a day, etc.

Thirdly, go and enjoy yourself. Don't let this ruin it for you. You in no way have to justify any of this to him, you don't have to prove you *need* to go so I wouldn't even touch that topic. "

"Emotional neglect is more likely, I think.

I get the sense that your parents have some serious shortcomings from piecing together your comments. Your sister is at an emotionally volatile age, and feeling unheard and misunderstood can drive kids and adolescents to do some weird shit just to feel like someone is paying attention. If your parents are rigid and not great at accepting their kids for who they are...I can see why your sister might be manufacturing situations where she'd get sympathy and a listening ear from the adults in her life. "
Yeah that sounded incredibly weird to me. Even people who work for the president don't live with him. I get that she trusts him more than anyone else but this is excessive. 
"It's not just that he hit on your girlfriend.  He behaved in a sexually predatory way, didn't take no for an answer, and repeatedly violated her boundaries in a way that made her uncomfortable.

I'd make very clear that what he did would have been unacceptable even if she wasn't your girlfriend, that you no longer want to be his roommate, and until one of you can move out, you don't want him alone with any of your female friends, because friends don't abandon friends with a sex pest - which he has shown himself to be."
"&gt;I told her to cut ties with him and never speak with him again, even telling her to consider going to the police or a counsellor (for advice). She said she does not want to make a huge ordeal about it and possibly ruin this guys life (I could give less of a fck but whatever) the guy has texted her multiple times saying how sorry he was, yet I keep saying, do not let him get away with this. If it happens once it'll surely happen again right

You nailed it

&gt;She still thinks they can be friends (but very distant) I personally disagree

I think you are right

&gt;what I should do about it

Be there for your gf. Support her. She was just sexually assualted. Her ""Friend"" sounds like a real scum bag, but this is less about getting revenge on him and more about supporting her "
Another good reason not to tell her about the vasectomy.

"Um, your grandmother assaulted you. She should be grateful that they didn't call the police at the hospital to report them for child abuse. What did you tell the hospital when they asked what happened? "
"This is not about you. Yes, you are overreacting. If you give her an ultimatum expect to break up. What exactly would your ultimatum be--are you planning to tell her to either skip her best friend's wedding or you'll leave? You will lose. Every time.

You are acting like a child here, and you need to get over yourself."
"Girl I cannot even see the comment box I'm typing in because there are so many red flags in the way. 

I am legitimately afraid for your safety. The masturbating to mutilation and snuff films (real or fake), groping you, wanting to ""punish"" you for sitting with other people at lunch, freaking out, hitting your friend, berating you... honestly, gtfo of this ""friendship,"" this is not love, it is unhealthy obsession at BEST. "
"I do. There are 79 recorded calls now. I confirmed with them today. 

The problem is, the cops can only go up to their apartment door (ground floor) so they just hide in their apartment. No way to get onto the roof. I've let them have access through my apartment to the roof but once they're in the apartment cops say they can't do anything. The cops have to climb a ladder so the people would hear them and scurry inside before the cops even get a chance to see the rooftop.

They'll shine flood lights on the roof, they'll bang on the door, the second floor tenants have let them into the first entrance but when they knock on the third floor door they act like they aren't home. Music, lights, everything turns off and they will go dead silent for like an hour if they have to, and even with the patrol, they're quick, like they always have someone on the cop lookout or something.

At this point, I'm trying to think of ways to get them evicted, but tenant laws are insanely strong here so it would take a lot for their lazy landlord to kick them out.  "

Na dude you do not under any circumstances go visit this guy.  You used him and left him high and dry you might not be a horrible person but if you go visit him then you are definitely a horrible person.  You visitng him is just for your guilty conscience.  You are being selfish like you were with thread.  This is the simple truth
2 months. I can't believe she's even asking me to move in nonetheless demanding it
"&gt; Furthermore, he was so determined to give me birthday sex a few weeks ago... I was on antibiotics, which interact with my birth control, so I told him NO. He did it anyway, and now I'm scared that I'm pregnant, because I missed my period after that.

First and foremost, *you were raped*.

None of this is normal or ok. You are not overreacting to any of your situation. This guy is unstable and views you and everything your own as *his*. You need to get yourself to safety and end things. Whatever you do, ***do not break up with him in private***.

It seems like George is a stand-up guy and hopefully he can work with you to get your cat and most important belongings out of the house. I wouldn't put it past John to try to destroy your pet or your property. This is **NOT** the man you need to be settling down with, much less settling for.

Most importantly, don't blame yourself for ending up in this situation. You had no way of knowing he's absolutely batshit, and none of this behavior on his part is remotely normal. You deserve a happy life, and he is not a part of it.

Stay safe, OP."
"Yikes.
I know it's not what you want to hear, but those friends are not your friends if they'll so readily believe terrible things about you without asking your side of the story. 
You might need to start making friends outside the community for now, unfortunately; I imagine this will all blow over in a bit for all but your exes closest friends (good riddance) but right now will be a good time to branch off without them. 
I'd be surprised if in a city of around 1M people, there aren't some cool gay guys who aren't overly interconnected with the community. I'm sorry this happened to you and good luck with your new city!

"&gt; Jacki didn't trust that they were clean, so she ran EVERYTHING through the dishwasher, and kept telling me how dirty my dish towels were

This is a Jacki problem. Don't take offence at other people's idiosyncrasies. Just say, ""Thanks for your input."" or something else dismissive. If water is included in rent, it shouldn't bother you to run the dishwasher again. (aside from water conservation issues)

&gt;there's no reason to be studying in my research area.

You're right, that is rude, but it's also a Phoebe problem. She is not the final authority on what people should be curious about. Let if roll off of you like water off a duck's back. Smile politely and nod then walk away.

&gt;Jacki says it makes no difference

Well, she's wrong. And yes, she does seem to lack a lot of social graces.

What's missing from this whole thing is an initial conversation about boundaries and expectations. You should have that now. There is clearly disagreement among you about how to share space, utilities, and your possessions. It really is best to talk all of this out together. No blaming. Just present a shared issue. Establish some shared values - like we all deserve to be comfortable in our home. Make a path together. Not any single one of you is going to get everything they want. That's not how compromises and collaborative living work. Each of you needs to establish new habits and behaviors to adapt to your new situation. "
"I think he needs to split the difference here - don't hide that she existed, but pare down from 10k pictures to maybe a few dozen, and mostly ones that are about things and with friends. Erasing her is a bad idea, but at tens of thousands of.photos, that's a lot for any new girl."
"Thank you for being so kind. You have hit the nail on the head, I often feel like I have no individual value anymore. I will strive to take this advice. I want to heal and be the best mom I can to my kids."
"Your husband needs to be in therapy yesterday for his anxiety. His fears are going to drive away his partner and have the opposite effect of actually drawing more negative attention to himself. If it's not possible to find a lgbt-positive therapist in your country, then maybe you and your husband can spend a weekend away somewhere so he can have some time to decompress. Failing that, all three of you need to sit down with him and say you will support him and can tell he is in pain. "

"He was charged with attempted first-degree sexual offense, counts of indecent liberties with a child and counts of felony secret peeping. "
"&gt; During the beginning of the relationship, this was brought up to me several times.

Why? What the hell?

&gt;  ""you should get breast implants and I'll help you pay for them, if you get implants I will f*ck you even harder.""

Jesus fucking christ.

&gt; And how I'll be ""crying on my wedding day, not knowing what he did that night.""

.

&gt; hen he watches big boob porn it reminds him of his ex and that's why he looked her up. He said ""I only like big boobs because of my ex, but you can help me get over it."" And he told me that I should ""love my body despite what my boyfriend thinks."" And he apologied about telling me to get breast implants and he says he only said it because he was high.

..


&gt; I'm fixated on the boobs thing

You're not fixated. His friends and him are fixated on it. You are responding sanely.

Jesus, just let this asshat and his friends go."
"Medicine cabinet behind the mirror? I remember someone here once mentioning that they noticed a spot on the mirror wasn't fogging up the way the rest of the mirror was and when they checked on it, it was a small camera."
Go to /r/childfree you will find a lot of people dealing with this. 
"Listen, you're smart. Too smart to stay in a relationship where the guy says shit like 'stupid, retarded, an idiot, too stupid for college'. The stupidest thing you could do right now is tie yourself to him.

There are literally billions of men in the world. Why would you voluntarily stay with one who suffocates you, limits you, tears you down? Life is too goddamn short to waste on insecure morons like him. You don't need to talk it out. You don't need to argue, or make him see reason, or make him agree.

 Go have a dang beer, and then tell him to go fuck himself. "
A letter from a lawyer indicating a potential lawsuit may do wonders for you.  I would think you might even have a case for actual damages since he's sabotaging your career.

"I know two examples of this, and neither turn out well. Both the women that invested everything for their partner to attend medical school were left immediately upon graduation.  

Good luck. "
How do I let her know? I’m serious about going on a second date for sure but it’s too early to tell if I’m “serious about her”. 
"CPS as a general rule tries to place kids with family members instead of foster homes. Please call. Things won’t get better for them until you do, and in fact may get terribly worse. "
"Before you make a decision to do anything, be very very sure the ""secret"" you heard was the actual truth, not the drunken storytelling of a heartbroken, messed up girl. 

If you're confident Maria is on the up and up about her affairs, it's time to decide if these are people you really want to be around. I personally wouldn't want to be in the vicinity when this all hits the fan. I'd be telling Maria I can't and don't want to be in the eye of hurricane infidelity, and if anyone asks me why I'm distancing myself I'm going to be honest. Basically, Maria, throw your cards out onto the table because I'm not keeping your shitty secret for you.

I'd also, definitely, be telling James. He's your primary relationship out of this bunch of clowns, don't risk him thinking you're hiding things from him for the sake of a pack of liars and potentially cheaters. "
"Hey so there's no not-blunt way to say this: if you dress decent and have good hygiene and don't look like Quasimodo but women still think you're creepy, it's because you're doing something that's creepy. 

It's also not necessarily because of aspergers. There are plenty of aspies in relationships, aspies who aren't seen as creepy, and aspies who have never come off ""like a pedophile or school shooter"" to people. Like wise there are non-aspies who ARE seen as creepy. It's not entirely or inherently an aspergers thing."
"My brother-in-law did something similar to his parents and it almost went wrong.

My inlaws always spend 2 months in a sunny vacation destination and invite their 2 kids and their families to join them for a week.

Husband and I were with them, but SIL just had a baby 3 months prior so they said they wouldn't come that year.

He set up a Skype appointment instead to wish my MIL a happy birthday.  What she didn't know, is that they secretly booked the flight anyway. 

So at the appointed time, MIL is waiting in front of her PC when the doorbell rings, she refused to open it since she didn't want to miss the Skype call from her son, DIL and grandson.

In the end, my husband went to open the door and had to call her over ""Mom, I think you better come to the door..."""
"Definitely go and pay your respects. If anybody approaches you and doesn't speak english, google translate should work just fine, but I'm guessing that's not going to be much of a problem."
"I wouldn't go on the trip at all. You saved up money thinking this was a couple's trip, not a friends trip with friends you don't even like. You know you will end up babysitting the pregnant one just because she's female too.. overall it just sounds like a miserable trip. Why would the pregnant gf even want to go? She can't ride any rides.

Save that money you've put away for an actual couple's trip. Don't let him guilt you into going. He was the one that decided the trip and then changed all the terms for it. "
"Agreed. I would not go on this trip either. It's no longer the ""romantic getaway for two"" anymore.  "
you can be formally educated and still ignorant AF. Ignorance is a state of being.
"""How about you mommy your way and I'll mommy my way, and we won't judge each other?""

"Why do you keep disclosing what you do to people you meet? Not that you should be ashamed of it in any way, but it sounds almost like you're just introducing yourself in a way that would make lots of people a bit surprised/shocked.

It sounds a bit like you're overthinking what other people say about you. Have you considered therapy or trying to treat your low self esteem? What others think of you doesn't really matter that much, especially people you've just met, but you seem to be really taking their judgements to heart.

My suggestion: hold back on telling people exactly what you do (you can always just say you work from home, telephone based) until you know you actually like them and get on with them. Try and build up your self esteem, and worry less about what people think of you. It's totally normal to have a job where you have a persona which doesn't match your state of being at all times."

"He could be keeping a secret for her. She might have medical issues or embarrassing debt that she wants kept secret. He could be caught between protecting his sister and being honest with his partner. (I still pay some of my sister's bills, and it's very much not hush money, and more a fear that my sister won't be able to manage without even though she does have a decent job.)"

Did the kennel face consequences? At the very least they need to compensate your bf for the value of the boarding and the value of the dog."

"&gt;The longer you're out of school, the worse it's going to look on an application, especially if the job you've been holding down is in a field that's not related. 

This is actually not entirely accurate. Law schools are not opposed to older students, even those working in unrelated fields. Work experience is an extra perk if your LSAT/GPA are good. There's been a push for diversity, and diversity of experience is a part of that. I had many classmates who had been in other jobs for years (one good friend had been out of school for 12 years)

The actual routine of being a student is a difficult adjustment, but that won't hurt her acceptance chances."
"Yes, you handled this very sensitively.

13 is such a hard age anyway, and struggling with gender identity with a family who doesn't understand is a heartbreaking position for any kid to be in. I wouldn't demonize Sam's mother - my little brother is trans and my mom struggled VERY hard with the transition. She is extremely supportive now, fiercely so, but that is a complicated mix of emotions for a parent when it's so new.

Keep inviting Sam over, use his pronouns, and make it clear that your home is a safe space for him to be himself. Having a haven where his identity is respected is a HUGE thing so don't undervalue it. There really isn't anything you can do to help his parents accept him, but being an adult who looks at him and says, ""I see who you are"" is a precious feeling to give him."
I don't consider checking up on your boyfriend and asking him to not disappear and drink all night to be controlling or abusive.  He's just made you believe it is.
"&gt; I know this hurts and it's hard for you to see

You could have chosen your words better there, surely."
"Financially inter-linked- Most of our savings are joint and in various diversified assets that are hard to dispose of and divide easily, this includes what I inherited from my parents. 

Of course there's our personal lives wrt friends and family. But I suppose that's common in every long term relationship.
"
This was never a dude who you'd be able to rely on. He's an adult and it shouldn't have been your responsibility to help plan his life. You definitely didn't make a mistake by leaving.
"&gt; I keep telling him I want to meet her to clear the air, but he keeps refusing. 

Which is his choice. We're only seeing one side of this but there may be completely reasonable reasons he doesn't want you to meet you. Even if there aren't... you haven't changed his mind so far, so let it go. 

&gt; I feel I have every right to see just what kind of person he’s going to be bringing around my kids.

You might feel that way, but you really don't have the right. They are *his* kids as much as yours. He does not have the right to manage your life either. If you're currently married, you don't have any legal ability to veto his decision-making here. Nor do you have the ability to deny him custody of his kids if he doesn't let you meet with her. 

It is a sucky situation. I'd suggest they aren't being reasonable adults here, but again I'm only seeing one side. 

When you sort out a proper custody arrangement with a lawyer and him you can and work something into the provisions regarding this. I highly doubt you can force it though. 

&gt;  How can I get him to be nicer to me and take care of his responsibilities? 

If you're talking about these:

&gt; I tried to ask him for favors, the kind of thing he would normally take care of (clogged drain, broken dishwasher, changing the oil on my car that I use to pick the kids up from school) 

He isn't your 'man' anymore. He left you. He isn't going to be coming round to fix things around the house. I'm not sure why you haven't caught onto that yet. 

&gt; Did this woman wreck my home? How can I let her know that she is NOT my kids’ mom if she refuses to even talk to me?

It has now been a year... she could have caused it, or he is naturally just moving on. And again, you don't have the right to let her know ""she is NOT your kids' mom"", but this is something that can be brought up in the divorce / custody process with a lawyer. Judges don't look fondly on parental alienation. "
"I think you're going about this in exactly the right way. You're meeting in neutral territory (not either of your home cities). You've known him for years and Skype'd so there's a level of trust and rapport.

Of course there's always a risk when meeting someone new. But there is less risk in this trip than there is in going to a bar and meeting someone you barely know from Tinder. You actually have an existing friendship with this person and it's not like you're going to his house.

You're fine. Your friend is freaking out for absolutely no reason."

"Yeah, there are a lot of concerning things in just that first paragraph, such as him downplaying her feelings as whining and saying he knows she really does want to go. "
"Well, yeah. They never directly told you about the interest they had in you (perhaps out of fear of rejection, perhaps because you believed they would need to win you first, or for other reasons only they know), but you were never seen as a ""friend."" 

This is really sad, but also very common."
"I almost lost a boyfriend this way once too-his sister had tossed her soccer gear in with his gym gear without him knowing and of course he couldn’t immediately identify the sports bras as his sister’s because, well, he doesn’t spend much time looking at her in her bra or looking at her bras. Situation resolved itself when she came looking for her gear in his room when she got home from school that day.

Also.. could the Spanx maybe be his?"
"First, it's awful that you need to live in hiding, and I think that you all have done the best you can at dealing with a situation out of your control.

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer here. Is there any chance he could get therapy for his anxiety with a cover story, like his job is making him anxious? Are there any discreet organisations that provide support for gay and lesbians that you could access?

Another option is using Skype etc. For therapy for him - provided that you're internet usage is unmonitored by the government of course.

Failing that, is there any chance that you could move to a more liberal country? Though this would mean leaving your families behind, so I understand if you don't see this as an option.

Edit: could he use reddit to get some support from gay and lesbian subs?"
"I think it is reasonable for your dad to not want his ex wife at his family's christmas. 

Why don't you drive?"
"I'm confused about why you never fought to see your kids or found ways to do things with them that didn't require you spending money on them (even if Amber tried to make that happen). If you're unemployed you should have more time to spend with them, not less. I'm also assuming you had a talk with the 19 year old about why you were decreasing support when she was no longer pursing higher education, bc at this point as an adult she is the one you should be discussing her support with. I'm really hoping that, in addition to actually spending more time around your kids than your post implies and going to lawyers when the money you gave clearly wasn't being used to support them, you also taught your kids sound financial planning since you knew their mother wasn't going to. 

I'm also confused as to why an adult man is publically posting about his depression on Facebook, especially when you know others in your life are badmouthing you on social media. Lock down your Facebook, stop posting inappropriate overshares, look into resources like free or low cost therapy if you really are that depressed and if it is impacting your life and job search. Sit down with your adult child and have a frank conversation about money and her future where you do not badmouth her mother and where you take full accountability for your own role in this. Talk to her about how you can support her, outside of just writing checks, in becoming a self-sufficient adult. Find ways to spend time with your 16 year old and to set that child up for life as well as you can. If their living situation is really so terrible offer to ask for more custody and go back to court so that you aren't paying your ex wife as much support and instead are ensuring the money goes directly to them. 

It sounds like you're blaming your ex wife for having a poor relationship with your children, while she may be a contributor (and certainly isn't helping), she isn't the only culprit here. At the age your children are at if you've been present enough in their lives, and they've witnessed their mom be as irresponsible as you claim her to be (how could they not have at this point?), the fact that they are still blaming you indicates that they feel they have actual reasons to blame you that are likely based on their lived experience of you not just what their mom says. "
"Yeah you don't whip your junk out and make out with another person next to the other person you're seeing, who hasn't expressed any sort of actual consent.

"I think the fact that it was a deliberate lie (""hey babe, I'm only in it for the SFW stuff"") is the real issue here. As another commenter says, it could have come from his embarrassment over trying to communicate his specific fetishes but he said the opposite which he knew wasn't true.

I think finding this out has it's initial shock value that might be playing into the way you feel about the whole thing giving the oddness of the fetish. If it were a more common fetish that he lied about, what level of upset do you think you would be? I think you might be able to use that to guage how upset you should be, if you're overreacting, and next steps in addressing his lying and the trust questions that it brings up"
Encourage her to seek help and maybe see a therapist. 
"Yes, it's appropriate and now is an opportune time. There's no shame in calling and you're not obligated to do anything you don't want. "
"Not so much the age gap as the age of the younger person. It can hard to grasp when you're still that age just how young you seem to people even just a few years older than you. Most people your age are just learning how to live independently for the first time.
I would ask yourself how comfortable do you feel disagreeing with your bf, whether it's to do with sex or life plans or social events or even just your opinion on xyz in the news.
I've seen a lot of younger women so swept away by the attentions of an older man that their relationship just isn't balanced (something the man would encourage).
I'm not saying relationships like this are always going to be like that, but it's something to keep an eye out for."
"&gt; We are pretty close and I can tell he feels guilty that only he has this money coming to him.

She also needs to tell her parents. They need to know that there is a dangerous man coming into their home. They need to know what he looks like in case he tries to approach them while they're out walking the dog. He could walk right up to them acting like a friendly dog loving neighbor and slip the dog a poisoned treat. They need to know that their windows and doors need to be closed and locked at all times.  
"I hate to say it but r/Octobertwins is right. You are abusing them. It doesn't matter what your motives are, abuse is abuse. All abusers think they have a good reason for what they do.

Give your family some space. Get some help. You're being obsessive. In fact you may have an obsessive disorder or addiction. It's not for me to say but a therapist will know.

You say you want to protect your family but then you mention that you're afraid of them being ""poisoned against you."" This isn't about protection. This is about control. You know what you're doing would drive anyone away but instead of stopping, you're doubling down and essentially holding them hostage.

Do you not see why your in-laws don't like you? Can you imagine someone treating your daughter this way as an adult?

Give them space. Get your head sorted. "
"Okay, so if you don't want to break up with her, sit down and work out a budget with her. Figure out both your incomes, your expenses, what you're spending money on, and try to figure out how both of you can contribute a fair amount.

Protip, though, if she's the kind of person who gets mad at you for not buying her a present every month, I will bet you one billion funbucks that she won't take kindly to this suggestion."
"I disagree, if he was secretive about having a safe I feel like everyone would be jumping down his throat. Sounds more like he knew it would be awkward, he knew she'd think it was odd, so he just decided to come right out with it rather than risk her being angry or concerned when she eventually stumbled across it. I honestly don't know any way to bring up, ""I bought a safe, it's just for my things, nbd,"" without it coming off as awkward or weird. "
"""Oh, not afraid of me? Let me fix that.""

That's not cool, like at all, OP.
And his defenses are all over the place. One moment it's ""I'll show you"" in response to not being afraid of him (which totally contradicts him saying he wasn't trying to make you afraid, since he was trying to prove you wrong, playful or not). The next it's ""he has been frustrated with me"", then it's ""we've played around with light choking during sex.""

These are all attempts at trying to deescalate things so he doesn't look like he's in the wrong anymore. He probably knows he fucked up, but he doesn't want to admit it, and now he's fumbling for the right things to say to make you feel comfortable around him again. 

THAT, along with the pure physical violence that was totally unwarranted is a huge, huge red flag.
You don't need a grip, you need a marriage counselor to talk about this with, so they can stare at your husband like he's insane."
"I get the impression that her mom didn't teach her any of this stuff then, so not sure if she's going to be willing to now... Is your wife competing with her mother?

Did your wife read up at all on chicken husbandry? Maybe get a new book, say that current thinking is different, and go from there?


More generally, does she ever admit she's done something wrong or made a mistake?"
"I'm an amateur entomologist. I've always loved insects.

My boyfriend is deathly afraid of bugs. He HATES them. He's always asked me questions about my collection and will watch documentaries with me and listen to me prattle on about them because he's the greatest, But he HATES live ones

But this week he surprised me! He bought me a beautiful custom made formicarium (fancy ant farm) and a clutch of praying mantis eggs so I could have the live insects I've always wanted 😭😍"
"I will definitely update if this continues. As it stands now, there are several loans (there was like one per school year) she only has the option to be removed as a cosigner from one. I approached her with an offer to pay me for half the outstanding balance of that one, and she will still be cosigner on the rest."
"'Sure, send me pics of you naked with friends. That would be great. But in the meantime I would like to know which one of your creepy friends is stealing your girlfriends underwear and makeup. I don't think you are talking this seriously and that is upsetting to me. Have you even considered why they are taking my stuff? Which friend of yours is getting a sexual thrill from my belongings?' 

I would consider not going back there until he takes it seriously and not leaving anything belonging to you until the mystery is solved. "
Call the bank and tell them you found a purse with $5400 cash in it. Inform him what you did. He won't be able to take the money because that would point right to him. 
"Ah, it isn't that she can't buy the house, she can't get credit due to the loan. You could always offer her release for 50% of the remaining loan. Sure, it is likely to force her to wait a while longer as she rebuilds her capital for the down payment but it ease the burden from you and clears her credit record. "
you're needed at r/prorevenge
"She really needs therapy too. She doesn't have friends, she doesn't have hobbies, she doesn't leave the house. She seems totally miserable, and I don't blame OP at all for falling out of love.

You can break up with somebody and still want to help them. You have to have clear goals and set deadlines, and be kind but firm with them."
"&gt;Who's wrong?

You are. Completely, totally, 100%. She asked things of you, you promised to do them, you didn't, she was smacked with the consequences of it and your reply was to blame her. 

It's so blindingly obvious that you're in the wrong I'm almost wondering if this is the wife ghost-writing this comment as her husband and putting him in the worst possible light. "
"Cosigned about getting the dogs out of there, but not to a shelter-- at least not in most areas. If OP happens to be in the American South (which would not surprise me based on various things in the post) those dogs will be euthanized in a week. Instead, she should immediately contact a rescue. A bloodhound-specific rescue is ideal, but since those are rarer, a coonhound rescue may also be willing to help, since there's so much overlap in various issues between coonhounds and bloodhounds and many people who own/are up for owning one will be equally up for the other."
That's completely her fault. Stop trying to take care of your ex.
"You RSVPed to attend this shower ages ago. It would be rude to cancel. Stick to your original plans and let BF know you don't appreciate being pressured.

edit: also:

&gt;He thinks I'm being ridiculous because, again, his thing is a wedding (that I wasn't even originally invited to) and this is a bridal shower. He also thinks that because the bridal party is so big, I shouldn't feel guilty if I don't help carry gifts or stick around after it ends.

Luckily, you're not an extension of him, so it doesn't matter what he thinks is ""ridiculous"" or not. I happen to think it's ridiculous when men accept invitations on their partner's behalf without actually talking to their partners first, but that's just me. Opinions, everyone has one."
"Ugh. The way you describe it, it sounds very worrying to me. At the very least, he completely failed to support you when you needed him to.

He was the dom in the situation. It was absolutely his responsibility to look out for your welfare, including comforting and consoling you after you had to stop. Turning it around, trying to make it all about him, trying to make that he is somehow the victim? Even leaving aside the whole possibility of emotional abuse, that is terrible behavior. 

Adding in the weird snapping at you over the text and then ignoring you afterwards and.... this does not look good. 

To redeem himself, he would need to be wiling to put some work in to understanding other people's needs and boundaries. Instead, it sounds like he's trying to keep you on the off foot, make you feel guilty so that you'll be weaker and more eager to please.

Danger warnings abound."
"Yeah that's pretty disgusting. So you need to tell him that he needs to carry his end of the share. It doesn't matter if it's his mess, it's your mess because you live together. You really can't make someone change if they don't want too but I would let him know that you'll have to reconsider living together if that's the case. "
"Divorce is hard on EVERYONE. It means adjustments everywhere. My parents divorced 40+ years ago and my sister wanted the big family xmas every year. It was weird and my mother (who is happily remarried for 30 years, as is my father) finally said enough. She  rightfully said ""I didn't divorce him to smile politely and have xmas with him every year"". Now my sister and her family and I with mine stay home and our parents come to us. They float to each of our houses and visit us and the kiddos. Mom and stepdad get a hotel room and come and go as our schedules allow. It works for us. I hope you all find a comfortable way to work it out without leaving anyone out or lonely on a beautiful holiday. Some years we have a party around the holiday or celebrate New Years together without the pressure. As our children are getting older and doing other things we start new traditions. 
Be flexible and talk about it. For us this year will change again as my MIL passed away recently and everyone on that side is trying to include ""Pappy"" this year. Good luck. "
I think you're trying to say it's a silly name for a serious crime.
"This is what I was going to suggest. Set most everything with her in it to ""only me"" for now, so you don't have to decide whether to delete it and you don't have to decide whether to ever re-upload something, you can just change the privacy setting. 

My partner had some pictures of his ex in his social media (a few, not thousands) and it didn't intimidate me or scare me away, so what I'm trying to say is you don't absolutely have to go scorched earth. 

Setting them to ""only me"" gives you time to think about it later. "
"
&gt;If this were a normal roommate situation, the split would be 750 for the person with the entire floor and 375 each for you and your BF with the utilities etc. split three ways. The landlord, your BF in this case, is responsible for ALL repairs of the house and appliances etc

Agree with all of this!"
"The baby and the relationship need to be *independent* decisions. I know it's hard to separate those in your mind right now, but you need to try."
"Your fiance is shady as fuck. If Stacy hadn't known more of the details of your fiance's cheating because she knew the girl, your fiance would NEVER have told you the truth. And *that's* the reason he doesn't like her. She's a GOOD influence because she cares about you, not him."
"Into a new account at a new bank your mom has no idea about, right?"
"I second this - as someone who generally supports women sticking up for themselves and not having men fight their battles for them. Your gf told him to stop and to leave repeatedly, and the fact that he refused to listen to her elevates him from jerk to potential rapist, so any and all backup would be good. He needs the ""why are you hitting on my girlfriend"" talk but even more, he needs the ""when a lady tells you to stop and to leave you gtfo"" - don't make it about your territory (cause that's not a good look on anyone), make it about how skeevy he was towards someone - in this case your gf, in future cases it might be some girl less willing to stand up for herself - who was totally not into him."
"That makes a lot of sense and could well be a case. She might think she can't be close to me and still have  him confide in her  without it being strange. Or who knows. I never really had an argument with my fiance until this, we pretty much resolve problems really quickly. Your words are making me think, they have good logic behind them. "
"I might not drop the friend right away, but I would definitely have a serious conversation about ""Hey, what you did wasn't okay. What's really going on here?"" It's a shit thing to do, and real friends don't let that sort of thing pass without comment.

To me, this feels like a power play on her part. She might feel insecure about ""losing"" him, now that he's getting married, so she pulls something like this just to make sure she can still get him to pick her over you. Which is then spiraling out into the rest of the friends group. So not okay. Fiance needs to have your back. He gets to decide whether he becomes your husband, or your ex."
"Not to mention how unfair it is that she picked up and moved for *your dream*, but because she didn't like it there, you started to resent her?  

She turned her life upside down for you, but you act like a martyr because you had to support her emotionally when she was having a hard time adjusting.  Entitled much?

And you *chose* to move back home, but somehow it's the fault of the engagement.

You fucked this up.  She didn't do anything wrong and you messed with her entire life, then blamed her for your own dissatisfaction.  Get yourself together before you ever embark on a serious relationship again.  

And solo travel and gritty film making?  Do you really think that having a GF/fiancee was what held you back?  Not the fact that solo travel is expensive as fuck and something most people just like to *pretend* they'd do if they weren't so ""tied down;"" and film making is a really hard career to get started in that would - most likely - have just left you a starving artist for twenty years before you gave up on your own?  Don't use the relationship as an excuse - it's not even a good one.  Most people don't do that shit because most people just don't do it.  The ones that do will do it with or without a significant other.

If you *really* want to rebuild this, then you have to have a serious confrontation with yourself.

1) Be realistic and take more responsibility for your own failings

2) See supporting your partner as part of helping the relationship thrive - not a chore within the relationship that just keeps it from withering

3) Commit.  Be 100% sure that this is what you want and will go after.  If you have any hesitation at all, back the fuck up and leave this poor girl alone.

4) Get over your sex hangups.  She was single, you encouraged her, you broke her heart, and you've slept with others before her.  Sex can be meaningful between two people - that doesn't change just because she fucked someone else."

"I disagree, I don't think OP owes his partner an apology

Because of this

&gt; I pushed back, saying that it would be lower paying than what I could make in my field, and that I was worried if I found something better and left that role, it would make her friend look bad. I mean, literally - I had that conversation with both of them multiple times, and each time I was told ""if that happens, everyone will understand, but it's just not very likely so don't worry about it.""


If OP really had *multiple* conversations with ***both*** his partner AND his partners friend who got him the job outlining the fact that this situation may arise and that is why he didn't want the job, he doesn't owe any apologies. They both told him they would understand. 

Now they've changed their minds. But that is not on OP"
"Yeah I can't get my head around someone who just stops brushing their teeth. Like, how are these adults in relationships. How does someone maintain a girlfriend when they can't be bothered for 2 mins to brush their teeth. Even once a day, jeez. Just baffling"
"""Hey, I was doing my laundry the other day and found a pair of black spanx. I don't own any, so I was wondering I you had any ideas where it's come from?""

If you can't trust him to give you an honest answer to that, then that's a bigger issue for you both. 

Does his family do all their washing together? It could be his mum's, and he grabbed them accidentally, and in turn accidentally left them at your place. Or it could even be his - you don't know unless you ask openly."
"&gt;to see if she's a ""princess"" or if she can take a hit.

**Why would any girl he dates need to take a hit.** Seriously, think about it? He gave you a fucking concussion, *on purpose*, to see if you could take a hit.....from him? In case he becomes *more* abusive and decides to hit you in the head again?

"
Sometimes they want it out of spite. Especially when the kid is older and toilet trained etc
Yeah. Not changing your baby's diaper and then getting mad at him/her and being rough or violent is a natural extension of this behavior. 
"If you have proof that someone who is closely connected to this girl, who tried to baselessly get you in trouble with the law, is viewing your social media, I highly recommend you make EVERYTHING private. There is nothing good that can come of it. It really doesn't matter why it's happening so don't waste your time trying to figure out why. 

You should block her too.

There's no way to know what kind of fuckery they're up to. Don't leave yourself vulnerable."
"I'm so glad this worked out! I know a lot of people with anxiety and it manifests in many ways, sometimes negatively affecting relationships. Good on you for sticking it out with this fairly innocent, but I'm sure embarrassing, quirk."
"I would assume the same thing but he’s really unbelievably nice and it seems like he genuinely wants a real relationship, but after reading all these responses, I’m not gonna pursue anything "
"I'd like to say that I would have left as soon as he went to the bathroom, but honestly I probably would have been so shocked by how inappropriate this guy was that my brain would have short-circuited. I'd just sit there going, ""Did he really just say that? No, he couldn't have. He must have meant something else? But what???"""
"&gt;  Apparently they don't spend too much time together, he would just prefer nearly no time with her.

He seems like an ass and I hope they divorce so she can find someone who not only actually likes her and looks forward to seeing her, but maybe is even *passionate* about her."
I sense a lot of hate for this women when you were the one who had the affair. Maybe she lied and said it was fine knowing she would later tell people you and her husband had an affair. Can't say I blame her. I don't blame you either though. You were caught in the middle of another couple divorce. This is why most people wait a year or two after divorcing before they jump into a new relationship. Be wary of this guy your with. 
"Dude I just had a hyst myself. My fiance was there every single step of the way, in doctor's appointments, driving me 5 hours one way to get 2 surgeries. What your boyfriend is doing is utter bullshit and he just doesn't care. If he did, he'd be there helping. "
"Yeah I don't think there's much hope here, you've described a pretty insane level of codependency. He's devoting his life to this woman without really knowing it, or even being aware of the problems that might cause. If you do leave him I think you should speak your peace on the way out, if only for his sake. It's not only unhealthy but it's also relationship kryptonite - no monogamous partner will put up with that for long. 

Then in 10 years when he's tired of having no romantic life, that line might point him in the right direction. Or he'll be married to her."
"Ah. Wow. Okay. 

So here's what you do. 

1. Call your grandparents. Let them know that your mom and sister are completely out of control and have banned your fiancé from their thanksgiving dinner for reasons that are absolutely ludicrous. Apologize to them for missing it, tell them you love them, and you and Fiancé will come visit them soon. 

2. Email your mom and sister with a simple ""my fiancé has not done anything he needs to apologize for, and I will not go where he is not welcome to come with me. We will not be attending thanksgiving this year. I have already let grandma and grandpa know."" 

3. You're engaged, you're starting your own family with the person you love soon anyway. *Start your own Thanksgiving.* Rather than enduring a holiday with your worthless mom and sister, do a dinner at your own home. Invite a couple single friends and someone who has nowhere else to go. (If you go to church, maybe there is someone in need you could ask to invite over, or maybe you have a neighbor whose wife died and is all alone.) Turning what would otherwise be a dramatic tense event into a new tradition with the man you love and a way to serve the people around you will make it a much more memorable and special holiday. 

Source: my narcissistic asshole dad hates my husband and refuses to be in the same room with him. He has tried to ruin many a family holiday by banning my husband from dinners *my grandparents* host. We have taken to either showing up anyway (my grandparents love me and my husband and totally have our backs) or, if we don't feel up to the tension, starting our own family holiday traditions instead. We are now expecting our first baby and I can't wait to introduce him to the art of the intimate Thanksgiving dinner with a stranger in need. "
"First, I will say your obsessive behavior is unsettling. This guy called the cops on you, you were warned but yet despite the implications that could come with him calling the police again if he sees fit you began talking to him again. He baited you, and you took it hook/line/sinker.

Then there's the manipulation on his part. Constant manipulation, calling you delusional, etc. That is just not right. I understand the act of intimacy is big, and giving away everything to someone is huge....But you can't let these people get under your skin any more. It's time to block, and I mean block on everything and move on. There are plenty of other people out there to talk to and it might take a while but you'll find people who aren't manipulative and crazy. Best of luck to you. "
"Why do you believe it was just a joke? Who the hell jokes, no, LIES like that to be funny? No one. 
It honestly sounds like he cheated and even if he didn't he clearly has no respect for your relationship and that would be enough for me to be done."
"&gt; he's never indicated he's capable of this before.

But he has indicated it very clearly now.

Use that information to save your life. "
Really? I view it as a big red flag if they seem like they've scrubbed their social media to erase his exes. And what about female friends?

"OK, this really pissed me off. 

I'm a mom as well. Have worked part time for years, and have had a number of friendships with other moms where we each call on each other to help from time to time when things come up outside school hours. 

First off, the fact that she is policing you, trying to ""validate"" the reason for your request (when she didn't even accommodate it!!) is just absurd. She owes you, period! If you wanted the afternoon off to get a pedicure or go grocery shopping without dragging your kid along, or even to just take a nap, she should say yes without question. Something is really, really off about her trying to investigate your request this way. 

Her comment about you ""not working"" speaks volumes. Over the years, I have done both full time SAHM, part time work, and full time work. All are demanding and hard in their own ways. Anyone that is this judgmental about another woman's lifestyle is not someone you need in your life. 

Also, trust me, is is not how these relationships go! I've never had to verbally formalize it with anyone, but there's like a ""mom code"" when it comes to things like this.  You find someone that your kid gets along with, and you invite them over after school and get to know the mom a bit, and at some point, one or the other of you calls up and asks ""Hey, could X go home with Y after school for a while on Tuesday? I have a thing and won't be back until 6."" 

And you, or the other mom, says ""sure,"" and is happy to do so, because then there's someone you know you can ask that same type of favor of in the future.

I've never found it to be precisely 50-50; sometimes my kid has spent a bit more time at the other house, or vice-versa. But I never let it get terribly out of balance. If my kid has been over to the other person's house 2 or 3 times in a row, it's on me to make sure I offer to have their kid over a.s.a.p. 

When another mom calls and asks if their kid can come home with me, the only way I'd ever say no is if I genuinely had another conflict that day. And I'd be very apologetic about it, and offer to do it another day if they could reorganize things. 

If things were starting to feel out of balance, and I was having the other kid over at the other parent's request more than the reverse, I would probably make up a reason to ask the other parent to take my kid after school one day, and see what response I got. If I got one like the one you got from this person, I would immediately shift my understanding of the relationship. 

With someone like her, I would suggest that you have her child over ONLY if your kid enjoys having her kid over, and then only at your convenience and when YOUR kid asks if they can have their friend over. If she calls and asks for a favor, oops, that just won't work that day. 

"
"Get the kids vaccinated. That's not negotiable. She can choose whether or not to get the flu shot for herself.

I'm a proponent of vaccinations...but I don't do flu shots."
"&gt;  I firmly believe that men who get angry at being refused sex are dangerous.

They are, signed, a guy"
"If your partner is doing something that isgenerally considered socially unacceptable, that they know turns you off and affects your sex life, and on top of all of that is super easily fixed - and yet they still continue doing it - then yes, yes it is a dumpable offence. 

Still, it doesn't mean that you shouldn't talk about it before drawing your line in the sand. Perhaps you haven't been as explicit as you can be in explaining how this affects your relationship. Perhaps he is having issues with depression or work exhaustion that make this difficult for him. So sit down and talk about it. 

And if at the end of all of it he says he won't try to change his behaviour, or his behaviour continues not to change, know that that's your signal to leave. And leave. "
"The boyfriend has made some poor decisions and is lashing out because of guilt.

I'm predicting that a while from now, he'll be blaming his friends for going on the backpacking trip with him and thus causing his girlfriend to leave him. "
"""Until you take a shower like a goddamn adult, we're on a break. You're fucking nasty."""
"she wanted his parents to answer her saying ""he doesn't have cancer??"" so that she could act all shocked and she could post the screenshots down the line when her lie started to fall apart, 'proving' that she really believed he had cancer and only found out he was lying through his parents.


this isn't your regular, every-day manipulation.


this is


*advanced manipulation*"
"It’s not so much that I expect backlash, I was just wondering if maybe I wasn’t thinking about this clearly. It’s good to know that people can understand my point of view though."
"I'm really, really surprised there are so many people putting OP down. 

I'm divorced, married for 13 years with an 11 year old. Ex and I are still friendly, we coparent amicably, hell even grab a drink or lunch together sometimes just to catch up. My house needed a ton of reno and he's done at least 60% of it for me, without asking for compensation.  I still consider his family my family, and I know he still talks to my mom. For our daughter's birthday, we took her out to dinner together. That said, it would be wildly inappropriate for me to go on a vacation with him. Especially to my ex-in laws' place. It would just be weird. Crosses some sort of boundary I can't even put my finger on, not just with him, but out of respect for my boyfriend.  It's the same boundary as not letting him sleep over my place, or always taking one car to school events, or keeping our personal lives entwined. 

I think OP is right to be upset about it, and the suggestion of a hotel was a very fair compromise. If the in laws can't understand why that boundary should be there, it's not his problem. It sounds, however, like he'd rather stay there and the in law thing is an excuse. "

"No you're not wrong, but consider that if you push this it may cost you your friendship. Personally I agree with you, she should replace it and the fact you make more money is irrelevant."
His angry reaction really caught me off guard and made me feel like I was being this crazy controlling person. :/
"This dude let himself into your house. File a restraining order immediately and I highly suggest carrying some pepper spray on your person at all times. 

Make sure all the doors are locked and the windows secured.  "
He was born an omnivore. 
Right.. but the hundreds of texts are where the emotional affair seems obvious 
"You need to get therapy to deal with your grief over the loss of your son. The way you're expressing that grief is not healthy--not for you, not for your wife, and not for your kids.

&gt;It's the same with my daughter. She's not allowed to go to friend's houses. I don't trust other parents. Her friends can come here. 

I grew up with friends like your daughter. Do you know what happened when they went off to college? They went fucking crazy because they had zero idea how to cope with the sudden freedom to do what they wanted, when they wanted. Raising a child is about raising a person who will become a functional, healthy adult. That means letting your child have some amount of age-appropriate freedom, so they can understand how to make good choices. Part of learning that is sometimes making bad choices. Your job as a parent is to provide spaces where those bad choices are low stakes and not catastrophic. Something as minor as letting your child spend the night at a friend's house or go to camp is a low stakes endeavor. You and your wife are exponentially more dangerous to your daughter than any of her friend's parents, from a purely statistical standpoint. What is it that you think is going to happen at her friends' houses? The fact that you're worried about her drowning at a licensed summer camp--I get it, but what about how dangerous cars are? Or crossing the street? You yourself identify that you're a step away from keeping her locked in the house all day long. And that you're already actively isolating your wife and children from the rest of the family. This isn't healthy. It isn't sustainable. You can micromanage your children until they hit 18 and then you're SOL. The problems is that that makes *them* SOL too, because they will have no idea how to cope in the real world without you standing over them 24/7. 

I don't know whether what you're doing constitutes abuse, but I know that what you're doing is damaging to everyone involved and that if you continue ramping things up, it will certainly become abusive. You need therapy. ASAP. "
That's something someone *without* a minor in psychology would say.
"A couple is supposed to be a team. *Especially* as marriage is on the horizon. He isn't on Team couple right now, he's on Team Self and is seeing himself between two ""crazy"" women who he just wants to ""chill"" so the issue resolves itself without any effort or difficulty for him - even if that means a *lot* of effort and difficulty for you. 

On Team Couple, making a huge load of work for one side would also be a ""lose"" scenario and he'd be looking for ways to share that load. On Team Self, as long as it's not him having to do that work, it's a win. "
"i kind of wonder if her mom used to refuse all help and that's where some of this is coming from.

she hasn't/doesn't read up on anything as far as i know.

no, she doesn't admit to mistakes.  she either dismisses them or turns them around on me."
[deleted]
"Spot on all of this, with the addition: I think, given her outrageous response to the suggestion of a cooking class as an activity together.. She knows. She KNOWS she's terrible at it, she just can't face it. All of this smells like nose in the air, protests too much insecurity.

She's not ignorant, she's just not willing to face it. Accepting help would involve accepting the truth she's avoiding. I don't think any of this is going to be a matter of making her aware and dealing with anger and embarrassment.. I think she's already actively refusing to listen even to herself.  "
"I have been roofied, and if I heard someone make a ""joke"" like that I would take it as a serious cry for help and be looking up domestic violence resources for them right about now.

Maybe my attitude is a black-and-white one, but /r/relationships consist of actual people so OP's relatives out in the real world might have the same reaction.

It's not about whether anyone is right or wrong about whether the joke is funny or not; it's about whether they believe it's actually a joke or not."
"That's really weird and creepy. I'd treat it like a joke and use that to call her out in a really obvious way.

""Hah! I know you're joking, because otherwise you'd be trying to emotionally blacknail me into going on a date with you. Which is emotionally abusive, and I know you're not, so you can't be serious! Good joke friend!""

She'll probably be pissed off, but frankly, sounds like you'd be better off without this friend."
Why wasn't this settled during the divorce?
Nothing says love than bragging about how your then girlfriend almost kicked your ass lol i love it 
"&gt;It seems like the discerning factor in this is gonna be whether your wife is willing to discard her strong opinions in favour of your marriage

My problem is she might say she's willing, but as she's proven in the past really isn't. I can't really trust her, she almost feels like a different person lately.

&gt;Stay strong, and I'm sorry this has happened to you man.

I will, I really appreciate it."
"You are an idiot.  Period.

If you want this marriage to last how about you work on yourself.  Get into some therapy and learn how to adult.  Scaring people in showers is immature and dangerous.  Also for women, it can be terrifying.  It is NEVER the start to making out.  Then after you start crap YOU pull an attitude???  Dude...do you want to be divorced?

Based entirely on your story...I give you 95% of the blame.  Grow up past a 16 year old level and learn to communicate."
My sister's husband did this exact same thing to her cat. He ended up being abusive to my sister too. I think this is a massive red flag. 
It must had been difficult for you. Your mom asked a priest to heal you? I am glad your mother has changed.
Yeah am I crazy or is that red flag material? Because that to me speaks of really intense insecurity and a misguided view of what marriage is.
"Man if they don’t understand the difference between 50k and 100k there is not much you can do.

Companies fuck You over with no remorse but you are supposed to lose one years wage to make it “look ok”.

This a stupid discussion. Sorry."
I get that he's behind the curve on emotional intelligence but I also think you need to step back and take stock too. It doesn't sound like you respect or like him at all.
"Since my old comment was banned because I can't call you a pervy idiot, then I will say this. When you date and marry an 18 year old, she is immature because that's what people do at her age. You are trying to build a life with someone that is in her first year of being an adult. In comparison to your dozen years of adulting. 

Then you are surprised shes off having fun and you are stuck with a kid. Well yes, teens are people in their early 20s do that. You not only make life complicated for a teenager, but you also produced a child with said teenager and will now have to raise it in a broken home because of your mistakes.

Move on, get therapy as to why you think an 18 year old is a good idea to date as a man near 30. Seek a lawyer and do right by your child now."
"This really is a discussion between you and your fiancee. If your fiancee's priority is to raise any potential children as Jewish in the community and you are 100% against your children growing up with religious education, then you two are incompatible. The Jewish community is just like any other: diverse even within the community. You'll definitely encounter people who are uber into making sure children are JEWISH and some that are more lassiez-faire and more open to celebrating the diversity of the children. 

I get where your wife is coming from. I'm a secular Jew myself, but I find myself flirting with the idea of joining a reform Jewish synagogue just for the community and cultural aspects. It's a very important part of who I am and I definitely want to pass on my Jewish culture to my children (if I have any) in the future, especially with so few Jews in general. Jewish tradition comes from the religious aspect of the ethnicity and it's really hard to separate the tradition from the religiousness. 

At the end of the day, if you have children, you'll be the ones making the ultimate decision on how to raise them. You and your fiancee have to get on the same page on this or you will end up having fights on this later on."
My husband does the same thing. It doesn't bother me. I know he means it in an affectionate way. 
What if he knows they are related and he is dating OP because OP resembles her aunt? It would be super yucky.
"I used to do this often and wish I would've just been more straight up. It doesn't have to be anything harsh, even just ""I had a really nice time but I'm just not feeling it romantically. I hope you have a good day too and it was nice meeting you."""
"Fuck that. He's choosing her over you and that's not ok. She sounds toxic as hell and will probably try to destroy your relationship even if she doesn't have an interest in dating your boyfriend.

I definitely wouldn't marry this man and frankly I would reconsider being with him at all."
"Play the long game and lie through your teeth to get to work tomorrow and explain your girlfriend is abusive and blackmailing you with wrecking your career unless you do what she wants, and you want to appraise them of the situation before you break up with her in case she follows through on the threat. It is ok to lie in this situation. Please please please put your safety - physical, mental, emotional and financial - first."
Cut all ties with the 'one that got away' or let your fiancé go. You're not being fair.
"While I understand while you feel bad, you have nothing to be ashamed of. Your mother and father failed you with your education - and you are in a much better place then a lot of people who have no education. 

If you never told him you graduated, and he assumed, you didn't do anything wrong. You haven't done anything wrong. Just be honest. 

""BF, I don't think you understand the extent of the neglect I had growing up. While I've been able to make a life for myself, I never graduated high school. I'd like to get my GED and go to college now that I have the chance to do so, and I'm embarrassed about this whole situation. I hope you understand and can support me on this."" "
This is so brilliant I had to read it out loud to my husband.  He's never wanted to buy a personal safe and now he doubly never wants to.  I can lift more than him.  I WILL have the bigger safe.
"I would check first with the family. The funeral may just be for family. The last funeral I went to was just for family and known close friends.
We didn't want our emotions/ loss bare for strangers. "
"The antivax movement has always had a fucked up attitude towards autistic people. It's implicitly saying your kids are better off dead than autistic. (Nevermind that autism gets diagnosed around the same age whether you get vaccinated or not)

On that note,

&gt; I'm almost positive that if I take my daughter to get a vaccine she will take our kids across state lines back to her family.

Get a lawyer and get your kids vaccinated, OP. We don't vaccinate kids for fun, we vaccinate them because these illnesses can cause disability and death. Don't let your wife endanger your kids."
Seconding this - I would absolutely not let her in the house again. There's a good chance she would steal the items as she is obviously not rational on this subject.
"It kind of took me by surprise because he's the type of person that's really nice to everybody. He opens doors for everyone, is super nice to waiters and people who work in service. He was also really nice to me when giving me fitness tips and stuff he didn't come off as a know it all. It was one of the reasons I liked him. He didn't really come off as the type of person who thought he was ""above"" other people. This whole thing sort of came out of left field. 

I think I'm just going to ask him point blank about it and tell him that it bothered me. "
"This is crazy. I scammed my own father for months by playing on his guilt, I can assure you that sometimes the right thing to do is to tell a family member to fuck off and die. My father had to do it to me, because I was spending all of my rent money on weed and booze, and then calling my father crying, saying I was about to be evicted. What kind of father would allow his daughter to be homeless? What kind of family member would tell his own daughter to fuck off and die? Right? Isn't that what you're saying? My father should have let me spend all of my money on weed and booze, and just give me money forever while I made poor choices month after month? I was bleeding my father dry. I was using guilt to manipulate him into giving me money so that I wouldn't have to get a job. I didn't want to make good choices with money, I wanted to be selfish and buy as much weed as I wanted. I didn't want to budget. And why should I? All I had to do was cry and say I was about to be evicted, and my father would feel so guilty and awful that he had no choice but to send me money. I was being a terrible person, and a selfish person, and I was treating my own father like shit. So when my dad did cut me off, yes, I was briefly homeless. Does that mean my father is a terrible person? No. He set a boundary that needed to be set.

OP's MIL did not just fall on Hard Times. She made deliberate bad choices again and again  and now she is suffering the consequences of those bad choices. No one else should be forced to suffer the consequences of her bad choices. What do you think happens when you don't pay your mortgage? What sane, rational person thinks that you can just not pay your mortgage for months and months and yet you still get to live in a house? Why didn't MIL go to OP, or anyone,  months ago,  too discuss her money problems when there was still a chance to fix them? Because MIL didn't want HELP. I guarantee you, she planned this. She allowed things to get as bad as they are, so there is NO CHOICE but to let her move in with OP and her husband to be cared for for the rest of her life. 

Sometimes you simply cannot enable people, even if they are family. "
"Yiiiiiikes.

I have anxiety, too. So I totally get feeling uncomfortable with this. I even understand needing to take a breather away from people. I have to do this, too, with my family. 

That being said. Your reaction was way out of line. All these people *love* you. They wanted to help you celebrate your special day. There was nothing malicious about the party at all. I think leaving the party without saying anything was childish. And now you're ignoring your poor, sweet mom who thought she was doing a good thing? Jesus. Listen, OP. Your mom isn't going to be around forever. You should cherish things like this. This was your mom showing you just how much she loves you, and you crapped on it. You need to make things right with her."
"So your wife told you that this friend was disrespecting her and overstepping boundaries years ago... but you didn't even bother to find out what those boundaries were and still seem to have no respect for the reality that this woman, on her own has hurt your wife several times. 

Then you didn't have the decency towards either of them to be honest with Lindsey when you finally did decide to cut her off. I feel really bad for your poor wife. She must feel completely disrespected and ignored. Lindsey is still calling because you *still* haven't set the boundary your wife has been begging you to set. Still. Just ghosting someone is not drawing a line. It's cowardly. Pick up the phone, call Lindsey and tell her that your friendship is dissolved and not to call you anymore. Don't blame your wife, but also don't care if Lindsey's going to. She can decide to be upset at whoever she wants. The important part is that you honor your marriage, your wife and your promises by doing what you said you would do and ending this relationship. It is literally that simple, it is the least your wife could ask and the fact that you won't just do it is hurting *my* feelings on behalf of your poor wife. I mean, really. If she had some other man around disrespecting you, I bet you would know exactly what she should say to that guy. So say that to Lindsey. Come on."
"Not to mention they said that they moved there for cheaper rent. If the neighborhood gets totally gentrified they're going to be priced out of it, too. "
"I don't see why your self discovery mitigates the conditions of your relationship.  Virtually *everybody* has sexual attractions outside their relationship.  We just don't act on them.

Why would you expect your relationship dynamic to change based solely on the fact that your list of ""people other than my wife I'm sexually attracted to"" happened to get bigger?"
"This read like a ""Justnomil creation"" story "
"Tell him that if the phone does *not* arrive, then either 
#1 - He spent the money on drugs. Obvious assumption, and he could very quickly clear that up by telling you the truth. Which brings us to
#2 - He spent the money on something that will get him in more trouble than drugs.

All he has to do to get your family to not think it’s #1 or #2 is tell the truth or show you the phone.
If he can’t do that, then #2 it is, I guess. The choice is up to him."
yeah the one about the dead spiders? Holy shit that was so cruel and so so planned out. If I remember correctly the prankster tried to justify it by saying he was trying to cure her of her phobia but holy shit what an asshole!
"""I told her she wasn't good enough for me and now she won't sleep with me any more.""

Really, dude? This shocks you??"
"&gt;He's a year out from graduating, and today he told me all starry eyed about a PhD program he's considering.

Gut response should be: ""cool, how are you planning to pay for it and our living situation?"" Its only a viable plan *if* he is able to contribute financially to the household. Otherwise you both should have a serious talk about him moving back in with relatives because you should not be responsible for any of this, love or not. 

Also, do not bankroll this last year. Honestly this situation has gone on long enough, caused you a *lot* of stress, and has forced you to put your wants/needs/goals on the backburner. It isn't fair and it doesn't matter of thats what you had agreed to, this needs to stop.

You both should sit down and have a very frank talk. Lay out all of the bills and finances so he can see the numbers. Explain how unhappy you are with the current situation and *need* him to contribute or you both need to discuss him living somewhere else. You'll support him emotionally from the sidelines but everything else is no longer an option."
"As someone who had to grow up with parents who completely ignored the health of their children, I would ask you to do something.

My parents couldn't have cared less about my health. They never went to check ups with me, the last time they had me vaccinated was when I was 7, they never went to the dentist with me.
I have quite some food intolerances and allergies, which makes cooking healthly for me a little bit more challenging. But instead of putting in the effort, the gave me junk and fast food. When puperty started to hit and I struggled with hormonal imbalances (common in my family) I went from a skinny little girl to being fat. And no matter how hard I would try of my own accord to lose weight, my parents would always counteract it. 

When became a teenager, this went on. I was refused braces even though I would have needed them badly (and it wasn't because of money, we actually had an insurance to cover the costs, but my parents refused anyway), my mom never went to the gynecologist with me. My hormonal imbalances and my vitamin deficiencies went untreated. My knee aches too. I also have congenital dysmely syndrom, but they never let a doctor check on it, no prosthetic, no disability support. They just didn't care.

I'm just as old as you now, and still stuck with my parents, who try to thward any of my attempts to work on these issues myself, especially my mother.
She gets angry with me for cooking my own food, trying to lose weight, trying to get healthy.

I wish someone would have stepped in at some point and helped me earlier. If I lost my weight much earlier, got my braces and hormonal imbalance dealt with, I probably wouldn't have been bullied so much in school. I would probably have a lot more self-confidence and have less issues. But my older siblings, all my uncles and aunts, cousins and grandparents watched on an noone said anything.

It won't make you very popular with your brother and his partner, but the children will thank you for it one day. No one should have to live like this."
"So he says he feels bad, but not enough to stop his behavior? He can't handle his anger to such an extent that he takes his rage out on baby animals and even tried to strangle one of them? Not to mention the fact that he can't handle simple chores like scooping the litter box. 

It sounds like you're in a bad situation here. I would insist on therapy asap. He needs to learn to be a supportive spouse and manage his anger. These are definitely red flags that I would take seriously in light of your pregnancy. "

"I would just frame it in a way to be like ""You know you're highly thought of and a valuable employee. Saying this is difficult but I have no other option. People have noticed at times that you might not be coming to work cleaned up. It can bother some patrons. I want you to put your best impression forward and this might be an area for improvement.""

You're not being 'superior'. If I walk out with egg on my face, I want people to tell me so. "
"Perhaps you could just tell her that then. Don't directly accuse him of anything, but lay out his unhappiness and use that as advice against buying a car. Let her draw her own conclusions.

""Look, brother has been complaining to me about you being at home more often. Something's up with him, and I really think that surprising him with a car is a bad idea."""
"so because you're insecure, you're gonna dump her.  

Classy."

"&gt;William and I decided to get back together in June, got engaged, and began planning a wedding

That seems really rushed.  You got engaged within weeks of getting back together, after you broke up so he could date his ex wife.  What's the rush?  

&gt;. During the group text convo where I addressed her inability to step-back

I actually don't think it's your place to set his boundaries for him.  It's William's job to set and enforce boundaries with his ex wife.  You can totally support and advise him on the backend, but he needs to confront her on his own.

&gt;at this time we keep his two kids for a week, every other week, but their custody arrangement has not been legally adjusted and Britney could (and has threatened in the past) to just go back to the original custody order where he only sees them every other weekend....

I think he needs to do this ASAP.  Stop planning a wedding and use that money for his lawyer.  Definitely not what you want to hear, but it should be the priority right now."
"You've been together 4 years and didn't bother trying to include her? And you think her reaction is controlling? Man, I hope you really like your family... And being single."
"&gt; Maybe I'm trying to make him change too much, and that's wrong? And I should have just left him where I found him, like I had to with all the other pretty but interesting ones


Yes, that's wrong. You marry someone accepting them as they are, not who you think you can make them become.

And man, the way you worded that... That's so disrespectful. In fact everything you've said about your husband goes beyond incompatibility and just comes off as, quite honestly, mean and snobbish.

You look down on him. You may not realize it and from your comments it sounds like you don't see it but your post literally oozes with it. So I think you should let him go, because you're not good for him and he's not good enough for you, apparently.

I feel a little sorry for him, to be honest. I hope he finds someone who loves him for him."
"""Dad, I've helped you for about 8 years now. You have a stable job and should be able to afford a flat on your own. I need to take care of me and my future. We won't discuss me ever giving you more money than your salary from now on."""
"This guy sounds awful. You can't even disagree with him without him belittling you and ""making you feel small."" Your words. He doesn't apologize. He doesn't show any empathy or remorse when he hurts you. Then he expects you to ""respect his wishes"" and sleep in bed with him while you are upset?

You are an adult and you can choose to sleep on the couch if you feel you need emotional space. Him badgering and belittling your decision is kind of abusive. He clearly just wants you to be compliant and not a ""problem"" for what he wants, and doesn't respect you as an individual with feelings. 

I'd be so out of there, this whole situation is just a NOPE for me. I'm going to guess there are a lot of other instances, not just when you argue, where he demonstrates a lack of respect for your thoughts, feelings and opinions that you forgive him for in order to keep this relationship going, am I right?"
"Exactly. Every paragraph was OP refusing to take responsibility for his role. He is the one who gave in to her demands. He is the one who stayed with her time and time again. He is the one who accepted and put up with her awful behavior. But oooooh, she trapped him with sex and charm and he had NO CHOICE at all, poooooor OP! "
It sounds like he may have a problem with Codependency. Read up on it and see what you think. He probably needs some therapy to deal with how his life went.
"What do you get out of this? You cannot do this motivating for him. If something medical like depression is going on, he should've sought help ages ago; else he should be doing it tomorrow. At this moment, he's in a pretty happy position, there's no reason for him to make a change. Your annoyance is irrelevant. Also, that client is going to sue him, unless he performs soon.

What does this guy have that's magical to you? If he really is that perfect person for you, then you'll have to accept that you will be paying his expenses always. That's just the price of being with this guy.

Perhaps wonder: if you break up with him, what's going to happen? Surprisingly, he might actually suddenly get a fire going or he'll find a new gf to mooch of off. But as long as you pay for him, you're enabling his position and nothing will be different. "
"&gt; Others will see this as evidence of your wishy-washy moral code.

A lot of us had wishy-washy moral codes at the age of 16.  I dare a single person here condemning OP to honestly try to state that they were perfectly moral little angels at that age.  "
"If you don't want people talking to you, wear headphones. 

That being said, your doorman is asking because of the type of building you live in. You've said yourself it's high security. It's his job. It also helps him know what to do if you get a package or visitors - he knows if he should bother getting in contact with you at your apartment or not. 

"
Yup. Money issues is the #1 factor in divorces. Ahead of infidelity.

"&gt; how do I know she won't do something stupid again.

Well, you don't. The only option now is to trust her. The thing is, she did something to break your trust. She put you through a ""test"". 

It sounds like, after she realised that her ""test"" had fallen really flat, she realised how messed up her actions were and she apologised. That's a good sign. 

Now, the two questions that remain are: do you forgive her? And, will you be able to trust her again?

If you are willing to forgive her, and are willing to stick around and let her win your trust back, you might be able to get your relationship back on track, especially if she has learned how wrong her actions were (and it sounds like she has). On the other hand, if you don't think you can forgive her, or if you don't think you'll be able to trust her again, then that's the end of your relationship. 

If you're still hurt and feel like you haven't properly articulated to her what hurt you about her behaviour, it might make you feel better if you communicate this to her."
"The confusing part isn’t that your stuff is missing. The confusing part is why your boyfriend is outright lying to you. He is clearly lying to you and doesn’t respect you or your things. Best to worst case scenario:
1. Cross dressing and afraid to admit it. 


2. Friends come over with their girlfriend who use your things. Boyfriend doesn’t want to seem uncool so he lets them have them or use them. He knows it’s not right so he lies to you about it. 

3. He is cheating on you and hiding your items. Gave the dress to his other girlfriend as a present or threw it away. 

Again, the mystery isn’t that a ghost is stealing your items. The mystery is why your boyfriend is lying.  Focus on the lies. "
Even if she did drugs or was a sex worker her parents would still have no right to her dashcam footage.
"&gt;So my boyfriend tells me that he has to drive her

&gt; They ended up having dinner and then going to a different place to drink

He basically took her out on a date"
Thanks for the update :3 glad things worked out
"Seriously, you already say you have a pretty rocky history, he singles you out for certain shit, then pretended he was going to hit you just to see a reaction? Like at what point are you going to move on and just stop dealing with this person?"
"This is the right answer. Discourage the wife from spending a ton of money, and encourage the brother to be honest with his wife."

"COBRA is interim health insurance. Someone already said that above, but you still seem to think it's related to your car insurance.."
"Goodness me, that was quick thinking. "
"Maybe this is a dumb question but..do you actually like her? I know in framing the question you're only going to talk about the problems, but I also am not seeing the reason for being with this person. Does she make you feel happy? Do you each give and receive and feel fulfilled in this relationship? 
I did pre-marriage counseling to work through a few kinks with my husband and just generally check that we were in a good place for marriage. Also super great for the ""annoying"" bits about each other that would lead to bickering or all out fights. It worked and now I recommend it to everyone I know heading into marriage. It sounds like you both could benefit from a third party check in."
Trust me I have no interest fighting over cats. At this point I want all of them to get out. 
"Your boyfriend is an abuser. You need to get out of this relationship ASAP. Hell, I would move back in with my parents. (I actually did this when my ""wonderful"" boyfriend beat me black and blue.) "
"My grandparents (also Asian) will similarly leave everything to my uncle, and nothing to my mom or aunt. I've always known this growing up but sometimes I still get angry on my mom's behalf - it isn't about the money it's just they favor my uncle so much over my mother no matter what. 

All their grandkids are female, and only their daughters had kids so it was always known that my uncle will inherit everything. I never really thought until now if it might be different if one of us was male instead. "
"Yes! Good thinking. Then she'll be like ""Eww, the neighborhood can see my DAD naked!"" and it'll probably make a bigger impression on her, lol. Nobody likes to think about their parents nekkid!"
"How should you be feeling? Everything you already are, plus relief tied with guilt. So, anger, sadness, bewilderment, shock, fear, guilt, relief, and a whole lot of numbness slowly seeping in. Any other feeling is also ok, just dont let them overwhelm you for too long.

Now, it isnt your fault. Codependant, mentally unstable. Still, his actions, his consequences, not yours. If he comes back, tell him to leave by a certain date.

Take care of the cats. If you can, pet them. Itll actually help you a bit. Maybe talk to them, just to voice your concerns."
"I get the impression he was into her at first - hence the hookup - and then over time developed an image of her as a symbol of his mistakes/“missed opportunity”. The ways in which that comes out are usually gradual and subtle, to the point that by the time things come to a head neither party has noticed it explicitly."
"I wouldn't even feel like going to be quite honest! I understand how you must feel about this. I would say this is not the typical or usual ""American"" wedding. How am I supposed to dress well ,accordingly for the event and bring food with me at the same time. I have never in all these years in this country heard of a pot luck wedding. I have been to many weddings by now. It puzzles me the fact it is in a mansion/estate? , maybe most of the guests are all also wealthy, so they have servants to prepare the food and carry it for them? This is why they are wealthy...cause they are cheap.....I already feel sorry for the bride. I know people like this. If you go save yourself from this mess bring wine some pastries. I don't know this is ridiculous. Anyway my dear, bridal parties are little boring bring a present for the home get togethers, they usually open the gifts one by one... just like baby showers (first born, before they are born party in which you also bring a gift)Sorry everyone I just dislike so much these events, and I know many people do.  "
"&gt; I'm seriously thinking of taking the kids and leaving, and going to stay with my sister until he figures it out?

I think you should do this regardless, either stay with your sister or in a hotel for a set amount of time.  Tell your kids honestly that their dad and uncle have some stuff they need to work on, so you're going to give them some alone time for a while.

Next, decide and communicate what specific concrete actions you need to see from both of them before coming back.  At the very least I would expect to see a mental health evaluation, a booked appointment with a therapist, and a spotlessly clean house when you do return.  Beyond this, if the brother can't be helpful, he needs to at least not be disruptive.  This means doing his own laundry and dishes, buying and making his own non-dinner food, and respecting the quiet hours of the house.

Your husband wants to help his brother, I applaud that, but he doesn't get to do it by foisting this off on you and waiting for something to magically happen.  Trust me, he is doing his brother no favors right now."
"I really suggest you look up Imposter Syndrome. It sounds like you're suffering from it (a lot of people do, no matter their formal education level!) and reading up on it might help you tackle some of this. "
"&gt; I feel like a loser. 

You feel like that because this guy has been wearing you down for the last 2.5 years and ripping your self esteem to shreds. Once you get out you will feel so much better.

I'm sure when you tell your family everything that's been going on, they will welcome you back with open arms."
"This is great advice. Op, you have become complacent in a very dangerous situation. Move as soon as possible to a more humane country, and in the meantime do practical things to make things more secure. Panic and fear make people do stupid things - everyone needs to take a deep breath, and then plan. "
"Personally, I’d be blunt af. His insecurity is going to end the relationship and I would tell him as such. 

I’d say he has two choice. Either work on his insecurities and understand your profession or he can get a new girlfriend.

You have an awesome opportunity and it’s been clouded by his judgement. Enjoy life. Screw his issue. It isn’t on you to fix it. "
Good comment. I ended up in the same situation first year and first semester of college and handled it by just not going and becoming majorly depressed - took a lot to swing myself around and became motivated for the next year and I'm currently really enjoying college. Creating momentum for yourself is a very difficult thing to learn if you were always just academically successful in school 
You don't have to be married to or in a romantic relationship with your ex to be a good parent.
"Absolutely. 10 minutes is not enough for anyone. If he cares about you he will try to win you back if he doesn't than you have your answer as well. I'm going through a breakup as well, I wish you the best!"
Do pre-marital couples counselling for the both of you. Don't rush into anything...
"&gt;she should have revealed this to you a million years ago. Like, before getting married. 

Maybe she didn't realise it would be a problem for her until now? Don't get me wrong, I'm as happy to pick up a pitchfork as the next random redditor, but it's a possibility."
"DNA or not it is known that he shirks responsibilities. Fulfilling his genetic ego does not guarantee it will change who he fundamentaly has proven to be.

He is a Hallmark Moment Dreamer. As attractive as it sounds to be with a sentimental dreamer, the burden of maintaining that dream usually falls on the mother. I would not gamble on a different outcome. "
"&gt; on the ONE TINY THING that was not fucking awful

I think you're being a bit disingenuous here; he's heard an account of how Brad was abusive in all of these ways, but the the *sole* reason you stuck with him was the sex. If the sum is:

sex - all this abuse  = still a positive result (as you stayed with him)

then he's going to view sex as a very big thing in your previous relationship. Now that he's learnt that it was so important to you and that he's worse at it, he's going to feel like he's failing you in some way and therefore feel like he's a huge failure and inadequate.

I don't think his reaction is necessarily desperately immature - men are socialised to often connect a lot of their self-worth with their abilities in the bedroom, and this still holds true even for more mature men. However, he probably already feels a bit infantilism finding out that he isn't as good in bed and that he has a smaller dick, so you outright telling him that he was really childish and that he should go is just compounding his view that now you think of him as less of a men.

Look, I appreciate that honestly is very important in a relationship - however, as this shows, tact can be just as vital.

I think that you should apologise to him for comparing him to your ex (yes, I know he pushed for it, but still you were involved in the situation) and tell him that you recognise that it's understandably a difficult topic. I would say that you didn't know what you wanted back then, and that your idea of a good relationship was so twisted that you clung to the only thing with Brad that gave you some sort of pleasure - even though it never had the same meaning or emotion or joy behind it as sex does now. Tell him that being in this new relationship has opened your eyes to what a partner and being a partner can really offer, and that you've been ecstatic with the many aspects of your relationship.

Frankly I have no idea if it'll work as it was a sore point and you didn't handle it particularly delicately once it had blown up (which isn't necessarily your fault; I know that previous abusive relationships may well be a difficult area for you to talk about). Best of luck!

"Best post so far. OP is in deep denial about how quickly she could lose her husband and family doing these kinds of things for such a terrible person. Technically, her own mother stole from her granddaughter, OP's child. OP's reaction is concerning that she's not grasping just how much damage is being done to her own kid while she tries to keep this mess she called ""peace"" at bay."
Wow. You should seriously consider cutting your mother out too. She's a giant POS. 
I talked to him a couple weeks ago. He is hard to talk to half the time I talk to him he doesn't seem that interested. I guess I don't call as much as I should but it's not like my brother calls him everyday or even every week or two. They don't have a very strong relationship or anything.
"It's easy to feel entitled to our parents' money.  However, that sweet gravy train stops eventually.  The real issue I'm picking up on is your resentment about having to work harder than your sister to get the same level of attention and support she gets from your parents. 
Have you ever talked to them about this?  I mean, have you really sat down with them and told them how you feel? Don't bring the money into it, just tell them how the family dynamics look like from your perspective and how that makes you feel. "
"Wtf. And you're insisting on them experiencing new baby excitement?  No.  Back off. 

Also, saying it was ""just"" that he wanted kids and she didn't, and then acknowledging that that's normally a deal breaker in the next sentence makes no sense. "
"&gt; Canceled the credit card in my wallet, ordered a replacement, stole the replacement from my mailbox, attempted to activate it, but was stopped when my bank asked for my verbal password

I actually did get an email alert from my bank when this happened. That was why I was able to take action quickly. I canceled the new credit card and ordered an even newer credit card to be delivered to my workplace.

"Kids running around in an active restaurant kitchen is recipe for disaster. Close family friends owned a Mexican restaurant for many years, and it was very common for one or more of their four kids, and also myself and my brother to be at the restaurant for one reason or another. We were always told to stay out of the kitchen and to get an adult first if we needed/wanted anything to eat/drink. 

However, even with these rules (which were usually always followed) their youngest son, about 4-5 at the time, got really excited about something (don't remember what it was now) and ran into the kitchen to tell his dad at the exact time that he was cleaning  the main griddle/cook top and some hot ass oil ended up splattering all over their son's face causing 2nd degree burns, he was incredibly lucky he didn't lose his sight because he had instinctually closed his eyes, and that he didn't have significant long term scarring.

It is even more dangerous for this kid to be in the kitchen, based on your description of his behavior."
"you should just tell her the truth.

""i did a stupid and embarrassing thing, for a stupid and embarrassing reason. i hoped to just keep it to myself as i feel like i have already learned my lesson and certainly won't be repeating this. but now i can imagine why you are worried and i do appreciate your concern, so i will explain it, even though its REALLY embarrassing and i already regret having done it. what happened was: [story you told above].""

but also please listen to your sisters response!!! 

it is not entirely clear if this is two high schoolers being dumb *together*, or a GF who manipulates you into hurting yourself and might escalate this behavior. 

so really don't leave anything out. if you try to take 100% of the blame and cover up your GF's input, it will just make your sister more suspicious. either thinking that you are still lying, or that your GFs involvement is troubling enough that you felt it needed hiding. 

keep in mind... it is a little troubling!

if your GF is starting to be a bit weird about getting you to do things, your older sister could be a really good resource for giving you perspective on whats normal goofy experimenting, and whats getting creepy and inappropriate.

"Ironically, this is kind of how my first ""therapist"" appointment went. My mom dragged me to a Christian counselor with a list of things that were ""wrong"" with me (including the gay thing), and he laughed and told her that she needed him more than I did. I'll never forget that dude."
"It happens. I dated a dude for a month in college who tried to get me to come check out his rent-to-own house in the suburbs where we'd ""raise our kids"" on the fifth date or so. We didn't date long.


I really dislike the way this guy is completely ignoring your personhood and decisions in this fantasy future life he's constructing. Like, he didn't even ask if you want kids—he just knows you're gonna have his. Blech.


You deserve someone who is SO interested in you that (rather than get all sexually aggressive and weird) they work to be in tune with your boundaries, sexual interests, and comfort levels, and work to make sure you're comfortable so as to not fuck it up, because you're too great to risk otherwise. Find someone who wants you and your body but will see you as a whole, not just the sum of your sexy parts/the blank canvas of their future.


Firefighter dude sounds uncool at best."
You'll probably thank yourself more if you do this in the long run.
"Totally agreed. I used to go for the dark and mysterious type as well, and it always sucked. I was best friends with my current partner for months before I realized he'd make a great boyfriend. It took me forever to even think about it because honestly, he just wasn't my type at the time. He was stable, considerate, affable, responsible, and compassionate- basically the opposite of the last guy I'd dated. I totally have a similar pro/con list hidden away in a notebook somewhere, trying to get it through my own thick skull that dating this person was a good idea. We are a great match, but he didn't have that bad boy edge vibe or whatever, so I wasn't really drooling over him initially as much as I liked him. Now that we're together I can't believe I didn't see it earlier."
"I had a friend say something similar to me when I was younger. Then shortly after he tried to start a relationship with me. When I declined he was upset, thinking that since he lowered his standards I should be thankful and accept his desire for a relationship.

Now that I am older I get that he was tearing me down so I would consent to date such an asshole because I was honestly out of his league emotionally and intellectually. Looks had nothing to do with it. 

Find a new friend. Develop some new interests to meet new people. I used to use meetup.com to find groups like that and ended up hanging out with some pretty cool people for a while.

Don't worry about it, when you meet someone it will click and you will realize what a jerk your 'friend' is. "
"^

All these people confused about this part of the post can't possibly understand the housing programs that are out there right now for first time home buyers. At a time when most young people are so far in debt, additional help was needed to entice these people - who otherwise have decent incomes - to stop renting, which often costs roughly the same amount as a mortgage anyways depending on where you are; the barrier for them was the initial cost. We used a hybrid FHA loan and our mortgage is like $300 a month more than what we paid into rent and we doubled our space, my travel time (and gas) decreased by more than half, we can more than afford it, and we are no longer throwing money down the shitter for a 2 bedroom apartment we don't own."

"Your boyfriend, who you've only been dating for a month, is obviously fed up with dealing with an obsessive ex who you've done very little to cut out of your life. Why do you keep letting this guy call you? Why do you answer the calls? Why do you let him text you? 

Block his number. Change your number if he still manages to call you from a different number. Go to the police and file a restraining order against this guy. Leave his stuff in a box on the curb for him to pick up, or drop it off with an escort. *Do something*. You're letting your ex ruin your life and your boyfriend is starting to try and find a way out ... leaving the relationship is undoubtedly the easiest solution for him right now, especially considering you've only been dating for a month."
"Agreed, I'm French and we don't really do the whole casual dating thing. You're either going out with someone or you're not, and the whole exclusivity conversation is something that's arrived really recently / is still pretty rarely used. 

But as u/Tianmeihua said, you can explain to him that although you do like him, this is a bit much and you'd like to get to know him a bit better before deciding to date exclusively (if that's the way it goes). Whatever works for you!"
OP's boyfriend isn't obsessed with his ex. OP is.
"When someone gives you a compliment, just say ""thank you"". Even if you don't mean it, and you don't believe the compliment, just say ""thank you"". Deflecting it is just plain rude, and someday you'll piss off a boss with that shit and end up fired. Just fake it for a while, and it will become easier to hear. 

If somebody says ""thank you"", say ""you're welcome"". Again, fake it until you make it! This one is really weird to me, and makes me wonder what your childhood was like. Do your parents never say ""thank you""? 

For the gift thing, gifts are just a part of life you need to accept. I think you should see a therapist. Learning to accept gestures of kindness and politeness will make your life a lot easier."
"Thank you, I see your point! I am also thinking about it..."

Tell her that she has 5 days to address this issue and if she would like to talk about anything with you she is welcome to do so. "
"Interesting. Vanessa gets a name but your gf remains nameless. Florid, flattering description of Vanessa, not a word about your girlfriend. One hundred reason why cutting Vanessa off would be impossible, no reasons listed about possibly ditching your girlfriend. So basically;

Are there any women here who are tired of dancing around to protect the fragile male ego?  Do you see a man as less than a man if he's super worried about his dick?

I'm a guy.  I have no doubt that my girlfriends have been with guys both larger and smaller than me.  **Big fucking deal**.

If she has chosen to be with me, it's because the sum of all my parts is a net *win* for her.  

I seriously don't understand guys who are destroyed if they find out a woman has been with a hung guy.  It's not the primary attraction for many women. And if a woman wants a huge dick, she's free to find that guy - it's no impact on my ego.  There are plenty of women who like medium.  Some even like small.

There is a lid for every pot.  Guys need to stop worrying about this.  I think women see guys who are so consumed by this as weak and insecure.

I blame porn for so many guys being shattered by this.

"He sure sounds like he is *entitled* to sex. 

OP, you're telling him that is okay. "

"Personally, I think you just need to move on from this woman. She's made it clear that she's not going to prioritize you and the relationship over her mom. "
"This is reasonable.

There's a difference between accepting that the kid is a priority (as it should be) and accepting that the ex-wife and ex-in-laws are a priority, too.  A two week vacation staying with the in-laws and ex-wife and not inviting the long term SO is out of the norm. I can even see it as being damaging.

But, I'm not the parent here. OP, neither are you. That leaves you only able to control your side of things.

You do sound checked out of this. I would urge you to go ahead and check out completely. I wouldn't fight this issue with him as it does involve his daughter and it's not your place to ask him to change what he thinks is right there, out of the norm or not."
"It speaks very poorly on you that it took a lot of input here for you to go through with what you should have from the beginning. She never should have been given that key. But when you did and it went to hell I mean you had protecting her in mind in the face of her destroying your unaware girlfriend's belongings. You could have compromised much more than paintings and brought a lot more trouble into your current girlfriends home and life without her even knowing. And you still haven't contacted authorities. 

Nobody on earth is worth my SO's safety. Least of all some person I went out of my way to have legally kept away from me at one point....who then drove that point home by destroying property of another.

"The silent treatment is a straight up deal breaker for me. I will absolutely not put up with that shit. If I were dating this girl the relationship would have ended waayyy before she'd have the chance to pull a 3 day long silent treatment.

"I suggest your brother reiterate that BF has not been included to make her miserable or to target her in any way, but because of his anger issues and general treatment of her. She's trying to compare apples to oranges to get her way. IMO your bro should hold his ground. 

In general, you'll have to decide whether shunning him is the best way to get through to her if she is in an abusive relationship. "
"Hey OP my best friend had an abusive husband who claimed that he did what he did because he wanted to protect her. Her put locks on the doors in the house and would lock her up. Do you feel like that's something you want to do? To lock them up?

She ended up leaving him because he made her terrified and with good reason. 

You're not their protector. You're their jailer. "
"He's grooming you. The reason he asks out 17 year olds is because he can't get with anyone his own age. As people get older, problems stemming from age differences in a romantic context kinda get diminishing returns. But right now it's too much, my advice is to ghost this guy and forget about him."
He was probably just going to have her cosign the loan and then break up with her anyways and run off with the money and leave her with the bill. Her not consigning the loan means there's no reason for him to stick around and pretend until he can cash in
"&gt;How do I stay firm without disrespecting their rights as parents?

"&gt; I'm scared this won't be the first time he blows up like this.

Yes it will be. Because you are leaving and never, ever coming back. No one ever gets to do that to you and stay in your life. Period.

This person is violent, abusive, controlling, and has a frightening anger problem. This is the type of person who beats or kills their spouse. Under no circumstances should you see him again. Take someone with you when you pick up your clothes/belongings for safety."
"Yeah, I thought at least a discussion would be reasonable. When I tried to reopen the topic, he told me it didn't matter and that we need to break up.

I don't know what to say."
"Dannnnnnnggggg, that's wild. I'd be hurt too. I would talk to her, it maybe a messy talk but it's necessary for your relationship and the future.

She's been with you for 2 years and wants to move in, it doesn't sound like she's settling, it sounds more like she was anxious about initially dating you."
"""Dumb work jokes"" and Snapchats do not equate to pursuing a relationship. If you want to go out with her again, tell her that. If she's still awkward and cagey after you offer a clear line of communication, then maybe she doesn't share your interest. But you're going to have to come right out and say that you want to date her. She made herself vulnerable to you, she's nervous, and now you're just playing with her (even though you perhaps don't mean to)."

"Uh, dude.

He's only months past being a *teenager.* Are you seriously surprised that 20 year old guy isn't the most uh... Disciplined and dedicated lover? Are you seriously surprised that a 20 year old guy wants to jerk off to porn?

And just a warning.. Most men I know experienced a bit of a drop in their libido in their mid 20s. 

Also, real talk: Don't marry a 20 year old. Wait a few years. 20M - 29F is basically the Grand Canyon of age gaps when it comes to maturity levels, life experience, sexual/romantic experience, etc. His brain literally isn't done developing yet and won't be for a few more years, while yours has been fully cooked for awhile. He is going to change *a lot* in the next few years. Just wait. 

Side note: He bragged about his high libido? Really?? To who? Their eyes probably rolled right out of their skulls. That's like a dog bragging about how much they love treats. No one is impressed by a 19 year old guy with a high libido.

Edit: A redundant bit.

Edit 2: For every time you know he masturbated because you found evidence or he did it in bed thinking you were asleep, there are 5 more times you don't know about. Also, he may be getting death grip syndrome, which makes regular sex less pleasurable. And seriously, don't marry a 20 year old. "
 She's your ex gf. She ghosted you. 
Report him to the police.
You might write a quick few sentences about how you knew him and have them translated so if someone asks you can give them a basic explanation. I'm sure they'd love to know how he touched your life.
Especially one that demands an engagement due to her own trust issues. 
"&gt;Can I call the police on someone who's also on the lease?? 

Yes!! It's your private room.

&gt;I thought he'd be legally entitled to this space as much as I am.

To common areas, **not your bedroom.** That is 100% **private, personal space that you are LEGALLY ENTITLED TO.** No one can enter your bedroom for any reason without your consent: not the landlord, not the other leaseholders. No one.

&gt;I'm also scared for my cat when I become more firm with my boundaries. He's shown violent inclinations towards her before, and I'm genuinely scared that he'll hurt her. I love my cat more than anything :(

Not sure if this is feasible but some options for your cat:

- Can you keep her locked in your room when you're not there? Is it big enough?

- Can she stay with a friend/family member until you can move out?

- Can you afford nannycams or something similar to keep an eye on her when you're out?

You must be able to protect your cat.

&gt;I'm really glad that he seems crazy to other people as well, I was worried that I was reading into things too much and freaking out more than was due...


If anything you are underreacting. There is no reasoning with or negotiating or explaining to someone like this guy: that is why you **must** establish and hold firm boundaries in all things. Including your bedroom privacy. And YES that means calling the cops. IDGAF if he walks out immediately when you call and it's awkward whenthe cops show up and he's just acting normal in his own room: make the report. Have your other roomie back you up. Show them the video. Start a paper trail. This will also discourage him from doing anything to your cat or your belongings (or you) because he knows that this situation is now on the radar of the police, even if it's just a ""minor"" thing like refusing to leave your bedroom.

This is not normal or safe. Trust your instincts.

"Wooooooah, let's hit up that paragraph about your boyfriend for a moment! 

He is being emotionally manipulative, using your insecurities and fears against you, in order to win arguments. That is *not* healthy and *not* ok *at all*. I would *seriously* reconsider your relationship with this guy!!

That being said - just the fact that you're self-aware enough to worry about being like your mother means you're *not* like her at all. Your fears about ""becoming your mother"" are a good thing, because that means you're *not* becoming her. 

Narcissists like your mother (I'm not a psychologist, but my own mother is a narcissist so I feel like I'm pretty good at spotting them in the wild) are not self-aware enough to realize what they're really like or how they treat people. They never have a moment of self-reflection to think ""gosh I hope I'm not like that/don't turn out like that"", they think more along the lines of ""wow aren't you glad I'm not like that!"" whilst being *exactly* like that. 

So to reiterate - you're not your mother and you won't be like her to your own children. But if I were you I would *seriously* reconsider being with a boyfriend that throws your fears and insecurities in your face like that just to win arguments. "
"She probably offered you money to try to keep control of the situation and because it was cheaper than what she stood to lose in the divorce. Now she's lost her meal ticket and she's mad. Marriage is a partnership about more than just sex. She didn't care about the sex, but the rest of the life they built together she obviously did care about.

You did break up a happy marriage, it was happy *for her.* "
"&gt; I feel incredibly guilty even thinking about depriving my kids of a two-parent home

Your two young daughters are currently bathing out of a bucket in a house with no hot running water, no central heating, and a partially constructed front room that is still reasonably open to the elements, with a severely mentally ill father who is more interested in breeding/hoarding animals than taking care of his children. And you're concerned about ""depriving them of a two-parent home,"" as though living with one sane parent is somehow worse than the living nightmare they're trapped in?

Quietly build up as much evidence as you can (photos of the house, diary entries of your husband's behaviour), and see a lawyer in secret. I'm not sure if how your custody battle would work with your citizenship status, but I find it hard to believe any sane person would give full custody to your husband when his presence is actively harming your children. 

Visit a lawyer, speak to the US consulate, get their advice, and find a way to get yourself and your daughters out of the nightmare you're in. "
"So his friend gets to be slowly educated so his feelings don't get hurt while making everyone around him feel like crap.

"When you're in a relationship with someone, it is extremely important you support one another and be upfront about things that are so serious. Especially if it's so bad it's leading to self harm 

I would be upset too if I were in her shoes, you should never hide such things from a partner and you should allow her to support you. Sorry man, I know it's probably embarrassing or scary to tell others, but I've had a troubled past with my mental illness too, it's so much better to inform your partner as soon as you can. 

Even if they react negatively, at least it shows them who you are, and you can't hide that kind of thing forever. "

Bringing that up could help, and approaching his mental health less from a ""hey you say weird jokes"" space but more of a, ""hey, I've struggled with this, what's up with you?"" might get a better response"
"This. **All of this.** She did this on purpose, OP. There is not a doubt in my mind.

But I understand wanting her to leave before you break up. Unfortunately those things are likely to happen at once; when you force her out, you will end the relationship. 

I suggest you tell her that she has one week to find and lease a new place. She has a bounded problem now: she won't have much time to go through your stuff if you're out because she should be busy trying to avoid being homeless.  

You'll have to adhere to the deadline firmly. *It's going to end the relationship.* But you have a right to live in a home not filled with allergens; you have a right to a girlfriend who doesn't take advantage of you and manipulate you."
I'm french and I find that totally normal.
"I don't see this anywhere else, so it bears mentioning - you are not at all wrong with the boundary you set, and I think you set it well, but the way you're describing it comes off as very pedantic. Essentially, your wife came to you in a moment of frustration asking you to do this thing you said you would never do, and you, fairly, said, no. Now, instead of checking in with her about what else is on her plate that she's getting so frustrated about this litterbox thing, you, after a reasonable exposition about why you would not do it, did not invite further conversation but doubled down into a statement of ""no I'm not doing it."" That's your right, and it's fair, but it doesn't seem to have made her feel heard or understood.

Sure, it's also your wife's responsibility to communicate about her own needs, and she should have done so. But you also didn't say something like, ""Hey, you seem stressed out about this - what's going on?"" allowing her to talk about that something else if it exists (and it likely does). We on Reddit can guess and speculate about the division of chores and baby related tasks and work frustrations all we want, but we can't accurately know what's going on in your wife's head, and it sounds like because you dug in your heels, and she didn't express her needs, you're having a crazy communication breakdown about a damn litterbox. 

I'd reach out to her with a request to tell you about any other frustrations in her life that are making this a big deal, and to tell her that you love her, and are her partner, who wants to be a team with her, so this is important. Let her know you are on her side, but you need to have your own boundaries respected, too, and that you want to work through this *with* her productively, even if you don't want to clean the litterbox.  "
"OP, I'm sorry you've lost those people.

"I'm curious if you really are talking too loudly, or if this really is just your bf's social anxiety. Have you ever measured how loud you were talking?

I did a quick google search and there are multiple apps which can measure decibel levels. It might be worth it to download the app and measure the volume of your voice and compare it to the average.

If it's in the average range, then you have solid proof to show your bf that your volume is completely normal and it might help him.

If you're way above average volume, then you would also be able tell based on your results.

Just in case it is the latter, try this first when you're with another friend, not with the bf."

"If your husband is the kind of guy to roll out of bed, shower, and grab his keys, then it also makes complete sense that he would be the kind of guy to not want to drive somewhere to eat and would instead eat at this establishment on a near-daily basis. He takes the easiest route.

Unless your husband has given you any solid reason to believe that you can't trust him around other women then I think maybe this should be a discussion you have with yourself. Ask whats really making you feel insecure about your relationship because it probably isn't Hooters."
"Housework chicken usually just ends up with you living in a sty. When I was with my ex, and too depressed to clean, we went a month without clean dishes. Once all the dishes were dirty, he started ordering takeout. He also had a huge laundry basket full of socks because he would buy a new pack when he ran out of clean ones. A lazy slob will stay lazy. There's a reason he's my ex."
"As another bi person in a relationship with a bi person, third to this. 

What's even worse is the gaslighting and attacking of  his emotions. Been there, done that- she did something shitty (but not terrible, breakup level if they talk it out) but her disregard for his feelings is breakup level. Classic coverup is worse than the crime."

This is bullshit and you do **not** have to go on any date with anyone, regardless of their gender expression. If they try anything, get evidence and post it everywhere. I mean EVERYWHERE.

"Your fiancée is struggling to separate out the ideas of ""when someone physically backs my partner into a corner &amp; raises a hand to him, he will get physical"" with ""when my partner experiences conflict, he will himself escalate the situation to getting physical."" And I'm gonna give your fiancée the benefit of the doubt that it's not a ""men should never hit women"" thing. Having grown up in an environment where people don't get physical, I think seeing an alrercation like this would be upsetting to me &amp; would take some logical mental processing of ""this is not the same scenario as us getting into a disagreement about the dishes, this is someone that was being physically aggressive toward my partner &amp; him defending himself."" So, if she is typically a logical person, I think she is experiening a new situation &amp; is not processing it well. I'm not trying to excuse her - the accusation that you'll hit her during an argument is a shitty one regardless - just saying that she may need some help getting back to a logical place here. Do you have access to attend a counseling session or something to discuss this? Again, if she's never witnessed physical aggression before (or if she came from a background of abuse that you may not be fully aware of), she's likely having trouble putting this event into context. "
I would call the call the cops.  I know that's harsh but $5400 is a lot of money and even more for a senior who is likely on a fixed income.  Finders Keepers if fine if you find a dollar on the sidewalk not what could be someone's life savings in a bag with their ID.
"It's not likely that he will be able to leave the gang but what you can do is express your fear for his well-being and let him know that you care about him. Hopefully, this will spark some kind of feeling in him that for him to continue running around with this gang is to be letting you down. 

I wish both you and your brother the best of luck in dealing with this issue."
"I ageee with this so hard. By her friend's standards, I'd have a hard time finding anyone.

I'm also 36, divorced, with 2 kids... And I have a guy I'm dating and 2 others I keep telling to buzz off. (one is 12 years younger than me, wtf. No way.)

So no. Looks don't matter that much. Look at the people who have horrible hygiene, bad breath, severely overweight, odd features (and not in the fascinating or exotic way) who have no problems finding a relationship...

Her ""friend"" is a Shallow Hal, and kind of an asshole."

"No, no, no.  NO salvaging.  This is a total dealbreaker.  She has possibly permanently damaged so many of your relationships.  You need to dump immediately and let the people she offended and violated know that she's dumped in no uncertain terms.  Have some self respect, man.

And I agree with the other poster who says she likely cheated.  "
Petty advice engaged. He should suggest they also get an egg donor.

"Agreed. Re-homing the dogs is an absolute must no matter what happens. If she can't take care of herself, she can't take care of another living thing. "

"Your response is awesome, but he's gas lighting you. He sounds emotionally abusive, and that is more devastating than people understand. As you said, he's given you anxieties and insecurities that you feel you'll carry with you for the rest of your life. However, 

I think you CAN overcome these anxieties and insecurities if you leave him. Part of the reason you can't rid yourself of these worries is because you don't trust your husband not to be thinking these awful things during sex. You don't trust your husband not to say more awful things. And his failure to take responsibility means it would actually be stupid to trust him in this way. However, if you leave him and see that not all men need to make their partner feel low in order to keep them, I think you'll be able to overcome in the end. 

Moreover, I think you need to think really carefully about whether staying with a man like this is actually good for your children. Do you want your children to grow up thinking that the role of a man is to malign his wife and be entitled to good treatment in return? That kind of thing really sticks. Moreover, if you want your husband to be a better person in general, for his own sake and that of the children, real consequences for his behavior may be your and his last hope."
You married someone and don't feel safe telling him what's on your mind?  How'd that happen?
"OP, this is a you problem. You need therapy. "
"Yup. The context here (not bringing it up until she asked, 5 years into the relationship) and the vagueness make me think this isn't a sincere concern but just a convenient goalpost he will move if needed."
"Wtf? What's with all the choking, arm bars and double suplexes everyone does? Never had any of this in my relationship."
"&gt; The fact that I'm engaged doesn't seem to worry her.

This isn't romantic. It's underhanded and nasty. She had plenty of time to express interest when you were single. The fact that she's waited until now makes me suspect that she just misses the attention you gave her and is jealous now that you're in a real relationship. 

I can guarantee that if she ""wins"" you away from your fiancée, whatever relationship you have with her will be short-lived. She doesn't respect other people's relationships, there's not much chance that she'd respect her own."
"This:

*He claims his intention was not to scare me or make me uncomfortable, and that he just wanted to play around because we had been drinking and smoking.*

doesn't jive with this:

*John got extremely defensive and said he was just joking around, he wanted to see me flinch, and that he does that to everyone.*

He wanted to make you flinch. The reason people flinch is because they are scared and/or uncomfortable. He intended to do that to you and is now backtracking on it. Make of that what you will, OP."
"So you can't go on vacation with your girl friends, but he can take another woman out for dinner and drinks all night?

He's projecting. He's a hypocrite and untrustworthy."
"He did cheat. You guys had a deal, he not only betrayed that deal but he did so at literally the worst possible time for you. He doesn't give two shits about you. 

Anybody who cared about you would be trying to support you through your father's death, not trying to sleep with somebody else.

He does not care about you. The relationship is over. But first go bury your dad, and then when you get home, call a lawyer."
And then burn his village to the ground.
Is it weird that a group of kids wanted to mug me before one realized I used to be his math tutor and they were like hey cool what's up man
"The fact that he goes everyday makes him a regular.  As far as the nuts-and-bolts of just getting his lunch, this actually works in his favor, too.

 The staff knows where he likes to sit, what he wants to drink (probably water based on his total bill) and might even know what he wants to eat. This makes the whole process go very quickly. They know they don't need to sell him on this or that, they can just start getting his order ready and get his bill ready, which they like because they can turn his seat quickly and get the next customer in there. 

So it's a win-win for both the customer and the staff. 

I wouldn't sweat this."
"This tells your everything you need to know about him.  There's nothing wrong with wanting to be attracted to the person you're dating, obviously.  He's making it VERY CLEAR that he wouldn't have been attracted to you 2 years ago, before you got into fitness and lost the weight.  It has nothing to do with appreciating your health or how you spend your time now.  This is basically all superficial.  He's not wrong for feeling how he does.  But you're not wrong if it makes you feel uncomfortable and want to consider this a deal breaker.

I'm a lady who lost 165 lbs, so I know a little bit about this.  Personally, I wouldn't date this guy.  You weren't obese before you lost weight, but you're clearly more active and fit now.  But maybe consider you're not out of this guy's league - not because of how he looks, but because of who he is and how he judges people as a person.  What would happen if you kept dating, committed, got married and had kids.  Would he suddenly up and leave you when your body changed?  What if you had a injury and you couldn't work out for a long period while you were healing.  It you put on 5-10 lbs back.  Where would his LINE be to find you acceptable to date?  I say all these things....to make it clear how CREEPY the things he's said to you are, because of what they imply."
"You have a right to be hurt, but I see where she's coming from. I don't necessarily think this is about you. I think it's about her fears for her potential child.

She's terrified of bringing a child into the world and watching it suffer in a way that she can't fix. And she's not alone. Lots of people choose not to have children because they don't want to pass on their mental (or physical) illnesses. 

Remember that you have an aspect of control over your illness that she won't have with a child. You won't always know what's going on with him, and when you try to guide him he won't always listen. 

I have to ask--has your wife had experience with your issues? Has she seen you depressed or acting out? Has she seen your pain or your bad moments, or have you told her about how hard it was? 

What's more, you have the benefit of hindsight that everything worked out. Me, I have clinical depression, and looking back (now that it's well managed) I appreciate all the suffering and hardship it caused, because it helped me grow in ways I now appreciate. But that was never a guaranteed thing. It could easily have pushed me into drugs, bad relationships, addictions, etc. I was lucky that, other than depression, nothing too terribly traumatic happened to me growing up. I was lucky that I never was encouraged or pressured into drinking when I was a teenager, or that I never met the wrong kind of boy, 'cause I sure as hell would have fallen into those traps. Even as much as I value what I've learned from my depression, if I had a choice to pass on the depression gene to my kid--even if I was willing to let them suffer for the sake of gaining wisdom, even if I was warned and well prepared to help them through it--no, I would not do it.

You are in the best position to tell whether she respects you or not. But she has an absolute right and responsibility to worry about the circumstances of any child she gives birth to.

That said, just saying ""We should use other sperm"" is a terrible way to go about things. She should instead talk about her worries about raising a child who might have your mental illnesses, and then you can talk to her about why those things don't worry you, and how you could mitigate the risks. She is not you. She doesn't understand your illnesses as well as you do. You should not assume that she does."
"Okay, thank you very much. I'll talk to them."
"Probably an FHA loan, it's only 3.5% and for a house in the 100k-120k range that sounds about right. "
"How much longer is she staying?

Just tell her flat out: ""You're a slob. Enough is enough. Clean up after yourself or you can find somewhere else to live."" If she doesn't,  take her stuff, put it outside with her,  and lock the door."
"Yeah..no not okay. It could have been any girl, just happened to be your sister that’s her own choice she’s 20. 

Fact is your bf sends girls money to watch them and decided he wanted to secretly text them too. He is cheating or planning to. I wouldn’t be okay with this period. "
I mean. What would you tell one of your best friends if she just told you what you told us? 
"It's not clear in your post, do you just want to tell her you'll miss her? Or do you want to ask her out on a date?"
"*Dad.  She tried to blind me.  Because I have a color of eyes that she doesn't like.  I don't want to see her ever again, nor anyone that sympathizes with her.*"
"hey so, when your parents come, have them help you move out and go stay with them wherever they're living for the winter. your BF is an abusive piece of shit.

"The reason your MIL took that boundary class was to learn how to manipulate boundaries. She took it to abuse it. 

So you need to get the same page as your husband. Lay it all out on the table, make sure he's on the same wave length. Then the banning of the in-laws. 

They will respect your boundaries or will not call/respond when they try to ignore it. If they try to crash your house unannounced, do not answer the door. Lock doors (change the locks if they have a key) and tell them to go away. Do not JADE, period. 

But if your husband doesn't have a spine nor willing to stand up to his parents. You may just want to find a trusted family member or friend to stay with with your baby every time your MIL is coming to town. If Husband ask, tell him when he learns to put family first, you'll trust him. But you'll not risk your sanity and health for his mother any longer."
"Since when did being an inconsiderate asshole become a mental issue? 

Listen, we can run circles with speculation, ulterior motives, all kinds of things really. What it comes down to is that you were taken advantage of, disrespected, and then had sand thrown in your eyes by your fiance. This friend of his is a piece of shit, its that simple. 

Your fiance, is a chickenshit. I wouldn't dream of treating someone I love as terribly as he's treating you. He just put up a big wall in his life and said that you can't cross it. This is someone who is supposed to be sharing their life with you. 

The reality is that you can and will make new friends, and your fiance is more replaceable than he thinks, in fact as it stands you'll probably meet someone better than him. If he wants to be a coward and throw little temper tantrums over his friend treating you like shit he can just fuck right off. 

I hope for your sake you drop he, this guy is a joke, coward, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near such a loser."
"So because he has a high profile/high paying job and you want to be a stay at home mom/wife you’re willing to contemplate accepting a guy who hangs out with nazis.

"No one will care about your employer's poly relationship. It seems like it bothers you more because you believe they have ""loose morals"" but I don't really think it's right for you to cross your professional boundaries and give unsolicited relationship advice to the 18 year old. If everyone appears to be happy and consensual, there's really no reason for you to cast judgment. Also if you're that concerned regarding being judged, find another job."
"I'd recommend you find yourself a girlfriend that doesn't lie to your parents to manipulate them into paying off her debt then guilt trips you when you say you're not ok with it. 

Also, all this talk of ""our"" future and ""a positive event"" are just gaslighting. It wasn't about her doing something good for the both of you. If it were, then there's no reason that she couldn't have had a discussion with you first. She saw something she wanted and took it. She knew it would damage her relationship with you and with your parents as well as risking your relationship with your parents, and she did it anyway, because unloading her debt onto someone else was more important to her. Is this really who you want to spend your life with. 

Also, is there anyway for your dad to cancel his payment and get his money back?"
"Agreed. She has a BF that can stay with her, who is the one that got her pregnant."
"Leave him be. You literally left the guy at the altar. All you'll be doing by trying to get ""closure"" is suck up his valuable time and remind him of a terrible thing you did to him. 

Closure is something you give yourself. Don't try to get it from him. "

"If you don't need that service from her, you can offer to hold her spare if you want but tell her your bf has yours and you don't need to have another copy out there."
"Like the others have said, this is entirely on her trying to alleviate her own guilt. She doesn't deserve this. **Closure is a myth and doesn't exist.** Nothing will good will come from maintaining contact with her. She cheated, you left, it happened, you're moving on. Dragging it out is just going to re-open the healing wounds on your part and give her catharsis that quite frankly she doesn't deserve. "

"As a married lesbian, I have to stress that OP's GF is not being close to logical right now. If kissing another woman is cheating on my wife, then it stands to reason that OP's GF cheated on him. 

Is it not cheating if I kiss a *man*? If you think ""no"" because I'm a lesbian, think again. My wife doesn't give a flip about what the gender is. Cheating is cheating.

OP, your GF can't have her cake and eat it, too. Most people wouldn't make up excuses for cheaters. Why are you? "
"It doesn't matter if you have feelings for her, you're prioritizing her way above your girlfriend. It sounds like you've never met either of these women (correct me if I'm wrong) but you made plans **two years** in advance to see the one in Latvia. 

You can make plans two years from now but can't make immediate plans to see your own girlfriend?"
Just stop cooking for him. 
"Okay you've been dating 2 months, and are already doing family dinners with his family, without him? And you call them family? Holy rushing batman. 

IMHO if you can't be yourself with your partner without them judging you, you probably shouldn't be with them. "
"Exactly. It's time to pay the piper. One of these ladies are going to vanish from his life. One by choice and the other will just leave. Better choose fast. I know who he oughta choose, personally.  "
Send me one. I'll wear it to parties and such.
"Your mom isn't the one who blew up in front of the kids. I would call her and tell her how violated you feel that you trusted her not to say anything, and she did anyway. Acknowledge that he deserves it, but that's not the point. The point is that you asked her not to say anything, she agreed, and then she did anyway.

Your marriage sounds a lot like my parents' marriage. My father was the primary breadwinner and the primary TV watcher. He did the laundry and the grocery shopping on the weekends. My mother worked full time and did everything else. We kids had chores to do, but I see now that the chores we did were barely a dent in the overall workload. My father also didn't handle criticism well (understatement of the century). You have my complete sympathy. The good news is that if your marriage continues to resemble my parents, you will divorce the sorry bastard when the youngest is in college and finally live life the way you want to."
This same exact thing happened to an older lady friend of mine. She's now in her 50s and stuck working a job she hates because her ex husband left her for a friend once he was done with school. She had been planning to go right after but never had the chance.
"You could say something like this:

""GF, I love you, but now you look almost exactly like a relative of mine. I know I can't tell you what to do with your hair, but holy shit. Having sex with you feels like incest. Is there anything we could do about this?""

Then, try fucking with a wig on. 

(This is a serious suggestion. It helped a lot when I noticed that my husband strongly resembles our daughter and strongly recoiled against having sex with him for a bit.)"
"I would be 100% with your BF here. I am very uncomfortable with people being in my home when I'm not there. I don't like people having unfettered access to my stuff. I don't like people feeling they have a sense of ""ownership"" in my home. It is important to me that my home be a sanctuary for myself and my husband, and having someone else come and make that space their own is very uncomfortable to me.

That being said, I am absolutely willing to compromise on that to an extent. If he or I have family coming in to town for an unavoidable reason, then they can stay at our home and be there alone while we're at work. But in your situation, it sounds like there was no reason for your dad to be in your home other than he wanted to take advantage of your absence to have a free place to stay in the city for a week. That is not really a necessity at all. I think you were absolutely right to side with your boyfriend and his comfort in his own home over your father's idea to barge into your personal space for his own entertainment and convenience."
Then they should be getting you gifts as well. Your mom is applying different expectations to you than to them.  
This is interesting.  Does your brother spend more of his time talking to your grandfather?  How often have you spoken to your grandfather in recent memory?  Could it be that your grandfather just feels closer to him?
"Addendum, what does the rest of you family think about this?  Social consequences to your mom's behavior from the rest of her family might be a useful tool for you.  If the rest of the family are all vegans and agree with her, that's going to be very different than if, for example, they all eat meat.  Your mom couldn't very well condemn you for behavior she tolerates in the rest of her family.

Perhaps a stay at your auntie might be a good opportunity to sample the pleasure of us meat-eaters, and once your mom settles down you could go visit her on more equal terms?"

Love words are cheap. Judge him by his actions. 
"OP, I think that is the end of that so-called friendship.  

It sounds like this guy is a typical Nice Guy that thinks that being nice to a woman and trying to be her 'friend', means that he's entitled to have sex with her.  That his behavior was so emotionally coercive and over the top?  It's time to cut ties.  

It's a sea of red flags when someone doesn't respect a no.  I think you handled this well by leaving.  His behavior was legitimately bizarre and potentially threatening.  Don't let him weasel his way back into your good graces.  This is nothing you need or should deal with.  

Honestly, you have every reason to ghost him.  If you want to give an explanation, text him and say that his behavior was completely inappropriate and you can't be friends with someone who doesn't respect your right to say no.  Then block.

As they like to say on this subreddit- bullet dodged."

"I don't think this is more PPP, so don't scare yourself there. I have a sister that is 'stuck' in an abusive relationship and she behaves exactly the same: running away in late night drives, being incredibly upset but then still defending her asshole husband and running back to him.

She is acting this way for a lot of reasons: she's ground down by him, she's ashamed, she doesn't think she can change her situation and she feels stuck.

The best thing you can do is be there for her. Don't attack her or the husband. Just express your concern and say that you'll be there for her when she wants to change things. 

When the baby comes, keep a close eye on her. Her doctors should monitor her more closely since she's already had PPP once, and you're right next door so you can help with that.

If she's open to reading you could get her a book to help her see her own situation more clearly. ""Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay"" is a good one. I also like ""When Love Goes Wrong"". "
"Kid aside, he obviously doesn't love her. That's more than enough reason to pull the plug.

He didn't have to marry her to be a good dad, and she doesn't have to stay with someone that treats her this way to be a good mom."
"Come up with a key word or phrase to indicate you are noticing her doing it. Do this with her, in good nature, try to make it something that is funny - a little in-joke, even. ""Roger that"" is an example of something that won't sound unnatural in a conversation with other participants, but could be enough to clue her in to her behavior.

Relationships (not just romantic ones either) tend to naturally develop cues like this - sometimes intentionally, sometimes not. It's like how your mom asking ""How are you?"" In the right tone can set off waterworks, or how a friend saying ""hey bb wussup"" is all you need to hear to know they want you to go out that weekend to dance and eat too much pizza with them. My wife and I have a 'learned' cue for when we want each other's undivided attention to talk about critical topics, and it absolutely makes life easier."
"&gt;  I thought I'd go to my mom and explain the situation. I told her she hurt my wife's feelings and **my wife was only impressed by her cakes and wanted one for her dog.** My mom then said that she said no in the beginning (because she had no interest baking a cake for a dog) but my wife kept pushing and pushing. 

It's not for the people; it's for the dog. 

Which, okay, I guess. For each his own. Personally I wouldn't bake a fancy cake for a dog to eat since they can't appreciate what makes a cake fancy. And it's a lot of time and money. But maybe if she had at least asked nicely . . . 

This cake was OP's mother's gift to her grandchild. A time consuming and expensive gift, I might add. OP's wife went to her MIL at her neice's party and asked if she could make her dog the same lovingly crafted high effort birthday gift as her grandchild. I love pets but I'd have laughed too. Since it's such an awkward thing to ask. Even if MIL loved her own pets like family and thought dogs could appreciate fancy food equally to humans there is no indication she has any relationship with OP's dog. This is not MIL's dog. She loves her grandchild. She's met the dog. 

The really really bad part though is that OP's wife kept pushing. This is super rude. When you ask someone for a fancy expensive present (cakes like that are worth a lot of money) and they decline, you don't keep pushing them to ""give"" you a ""present"". That's socially atrocious. Maybe this was an accident on the part of OP's wife due to assuming they didn't understand, but honestly that just makes it worse. Now she sounds *condescending and entitled*. Oh this stupid foreigner doesn't want to make my dog an expensive cake she must just not understand what I'm asking. I'll keep telling her again and again.

Your wife owes your mom an apology if nothing else for pushing. I don't know if I'd hold your breath on it happening though. "

"This is the most elaborate, complicated fantasy I have ever heard. 
I try not to kink-shame, but this would be hard for me to listen to with a straight face. 

You had already agreed that the open nature of the relationship would be about building trust, and strengthening your bond. If that's what it is about I think your partner using the ""open"" argument is off base. If anything its counter to that since it makes you uncomfortable and is something your partner is doing alone. 

I don't know what rules you have in place re: veto, or the need for agreement/input but I don't think you're wrong at all to express concern. (on a completely practical level this sounds like a myriad of injuries just waiting to happen.) "

"Your options are to get married or break up. There isn't some other magical solution.

I don't see the problem with getting married given your ages and the length of time you've been together. Were you planning to stay together for the long run anyway?"
"&gt;She yelled at me over the phone for 10 minutes about how I got her in trouble

...how does a 24 year old 'get in trouble'?? Are you guys actually 14 and not 24? because how she's acting is how teenagers behave and her 'getting in trouble' is not something adults would say, even those who still live with their parents."
"Can confirm, lobsters are a great gift. "
"Why do your parents even know about the off-brand uses for a Hitachi magic wand if they're that uptight about sex? Anyway, I think it'd be better to play ignorant. You have no idea why your parents think you would use a massager for that sort of thing and you're mortified by the accusation. If you can play it off that you had no idea that anyone uses them for sexual purposes, that's even better."
"Seriously. Engaged one year in, at 21 and citing being cheated on as the reason?  C'mon. She is obviously young but she's also naive if she thinks being engaged will have any bearing on cheating. 

OP shouldn't be getting married for lots of reasons. "
"I agree with this one OP, you were in a panic situation and acted. Unfortunately he got hurt but he sounds like he's got a pretty good head on his shoulders and doesn't want you to feel anxious about this any further.

It's up to you to handle yourself with as much grace as he has and move forward. You've apologised with words enough, take him out for a wonderful meal or take him away for a weekend. Take some time in a relaxing environment where you can both talk about other things or talk about the issue and then move on.

He sounds like a keeper to be honest."
"OP, your husband has been raising children non-stop since he was 27. 

I mean, at some point, you had to recognize that he would want an end to the parenting, right? And he's almost 50, with another 14 years staring him down right now assuming nothing changes ... 

I'm not saying that you're wrong, but given the age difference and the exhausting nature of parenting, I'm amazed this conversation is only happening now."
"Man I'm telling you right now, I'm a massive Patriots fan (check my post history), and I would never hurt an animal over my Brady Jersey. You're giving him way way too much sympathy over the jersey. Ya they're expensive as shit, and ya as a Brady fan I'll tell you that my jersey is special to me. But there is no way in hell I'd even consider reacting that way over what's literally just a piece of clothing. I get he worked hard and it means a lot to him, but that's life. Harsh to say but shit happens that's out of your control and a real adult would handle the shit better. Dump his ass and find a different guy that knows to to react to things. Seriously, have some respect for your missing cat and end the relationship. "

If you say “grandma, you forced me to do things that made me uncomfortable and therefor won’t ever watch my child” is that going to change anything you do? Your mom already excused it away when you brought it to her as a kid. Who’s side is your mom going to take?  Or do you just say “oh that’s so sweet of you, I don’t need alone time, I can’t get enough of my sweet baby I’ll never leave her!”

"&gt;I worry that one day I will find his body. I'm tired of living with someone who just seems to be marking time until he is dead or kills himself with drinking. I understand why he is depressed, but doctors and medications and therapy hasn't worked for him, and I can't force him to find a solution.

Harsh truth is that one day you will find his body. If you stay. Whether you will or not is up to you.

I don't have any advice for you, because you know the options and the costs of each. You leave, he'll likely die soon after. You'll both need to move. You won't get any pension or social security (not a lawyer, unsure how divorce affects things). You stay, you keep dealing with this, potentially for years and through worse and worse. You keep the house until he dies, then maybe need to move anyway depending on what happens after. 

There's no ""good"" answer here. You just need to decide which is less ""bad"" to you.

FWIW, I sympathize. My aunt went through a similar conundrum with my uncle, who finally died early this year. He was a day trader during the 90s and made a killing. After 9/11 and the economic shock, he started losing on a lot of trades. Times got tougher. He had to sell my grandmother's house (which he owned and had let her live in since the 80s). When the recession hit, things went from bad to worse. He started defaulting on their house, being late with bills. My aunt knew hardly any of this happened because he paid most of the bills. He finally told her he lost the house the day before they had to move out.

As the debts grew, so did his drinking. For the past several years he had been unemployed, drunk more often than not, and just miserable to be around. Two years ago my aunt found him unconscious in his own filth. The doctor told him straight up ""You need to stop drinking now or you'll be dead within the next few years."" He told his family (his kids, my cousins) that he quit. He didn't. My aunt couldn't convince him and so just did her best to ignore it. And sure enough, my aunt was the one to come home and find him lying, once more, on the floor in a pile of his own filth. He died two days later at the hospital. 

My aunt stuck it out for three reasons: she's Catholic and was raised to avoid divorce if at all possible (ironically, my religious grandmother had her marriage annulled with my alcoholic and abusive grandfather); she wanted to maintain the image of a strong home for her kids even as they grew up and moved away; and if she divorced him, she wouldn't have gotten any of his social security after he passed. They couldn't stand each other by the end. 

I was of the opinion that my aunt should have divorced my uncle, but she felt otherwise. I can't say which is right for you, but you have my sympathy. "
"The thing is, if you're really into someone, a lot of these things would be something you're *excited* about. I was in a similar situation (invited to family dinners, friends BBQ to meet everyone etc. early on) and we had insane chemistry, so it made my heart melt. It wasn't creepy or overbearing because we both felt similarly. 

However there are definitely big red flags - the underwear thing, obsessive calling, ragging on all his exes (usually a common denominator problem).

Biggest flag of all, buying a plane ticket without consulting you - and worse, basically saying you can't break up until then because of that - is not only massively controlling but also makes it seem like he's in it solely to showboat his new relationship. Especially with how it was worded it makes it seem like a tactic to make you feel guilty enough to stay (which is apparently working).

Just tell him the relationship moved too fast, you're not interested, and let his mom figure out the ticket. Not your responsibility. Hell you don't even know if she actually bought it or if he's just saying that.

Also wtf ""blueberry boo"" there's a lot of bad pet names out there but that's just painful."
"""But why male models?""
-OP (probably)"
"Don't let him laugh it off, sit down and have an actual conversation about it. "
"""don't remember"" means he doesn't want to tell you."
"
&gt; So I asked him not to text her, but he said he sometimes has to about Crossfit

He obviously dismissed your concern and gave a stupid answer that any person with a brain would know wasn't true.  He was testing your ability to put up with him crossing the line, and you bought it.

&gt; The oldest texts mentioned that he had deleted texts upon her recommendation and he joked about ""having no conscience"".

He has sent her inappropriate texts that they BOTH knew were inappropriate and he hid the evidence by deleting them.

&gt; Then him joking about being old and chubby and her joking about being a grown up and he's not chubby.

He deliberately fishes for compliments from her (is enjoying her attention and flirting, which again crosses the line you set).

&gt;  Before he left on the trip he texted the girl to ask what he should pack

Again, breaking the ""no discussions that aren't crossfit"" rule and fishing for compliments.

&gt; She basically said not to bring many clothes, then joked that could be misconstrued. And apologized. He joked it would have made his night if she hadn't apologized.

He didn't ""joke"" that it would make his night.  He was serious.  He told her via a ""joke"" that he was hoping she wanted him with less clothes on.

&gt; Upon confrontation he claimed that he was horny while he was gone and took the picks and considered sending them to me but then didn't really like the way he turned out and decided against it. Honestly, the idea of my husband sending me an out-of-the-blue dick pick after 10 years just seems laughably false. 

Obviously a complete and utter lie.

Lets summarize:  He got inappropriately involved in texting with someone from the gym.  We have to presume that he flirts with her IN PERSON at the gym, too.  The texting is just a continuation of in person flirting.  When you confronted him, he claimed innocence (a lie).  You set a boundary, he refused to follow it and used an idiotic response of ""have to talk about crossfit"" and you fell for it, so he knew he could push your boundaries.  He continued to text her inappropriate things, immediately crossing the contact lines you agreed to.  He flirts with her and intentionally fishes for compliments and sexual comments from her.  He keeps lying to you.

Demand he immediately cut contact and switch gyms.  Anything else is wildly inappropriate at this point, and should not be accepted.  He's having an emotional affair and continued it even after telling you he would stop."
"&gt; If I were the friends boss I would not ask her for recruitment advice for a while.

Nor should you. She referred her boss to someone who never intended to stay, who was taking a major pay cut to be there; she recommended him to her boss *knowing* this beforehand. You have to exercise some basic amount of intelligence when you make such a referral. For example, a former friend of mine was looking for work. I knew her to be a total flake though. Couldn't get a fucking thing done on time. The one job I pointed out to her, she couldn't even get the application in before the deadline. Then she asks, ""Are there any more openings?"" Yeah, because nonprofits have tons of them! I never once attached my name to her though because it wasn't wise *for me*. Maybe that makes me an asshole but if you know someone isn't a good fit for one reason or another, you gotta think - do I want to be attached to this? If it goes ass up, am I okay with that?

I know it seems rude because she ""saved"" him but when you're in a particular field that required an education to obtain, one that earns you 6 figures, it would be inadvisable to spend a year in a low paying, unrelated field when you have a real opportunity in front of you. It would set him back in more than one way. It was nice of the friend to offer but they really should have considered how it would likely play out. It's not uncommon for someone to be without work for a number of months and then suddenly have an offer put before them."
"You sound pretty apathetic about this whole thing--do you want permission to ask for a divorce? Because you don't need it. 

Personally, if I were your wife and I stumbled across this post, I would probably *want* a divorce. You have a pretty easy time typing out the phrase ""I just don't like her."" over and over without offering a single detail as to what she has done that is unappealing or unattractive to you--this suggests that you are not really very interested in the ""why"" yourself, which suggests you are not looking for a solution here."
"I had a similar lack of education in my childhood - was homeschooled, kind of, through 3rd grade, then nothing until I left home and enrolled in community college. I wasn't exposed to any formal educational materials, but I read my ass off. If you can read, you can absorb grammar and vocabulary."

"&gt; say ""yes we definitely should meet up!"" Then always postpone it until we both just forget about it 

directly contradicts

&gt; I'm trying to not lead anyone on

You are actively leading them on. Please don't do that, it's pretty awful on the other person. Being ghosted sucks, too. 

Honesty is the best policy. Just say something like ""Thanks for the nice evening, but I didn't feel any chemistry and don't see this relationship working. Good luck in the future!"" You can modify it as you like, but that's the basic gist. 

It's good you're asking for advice on how to handle this. It gets easier with practice. Don't worry too much about him having hurt feelings- as long as you are being polite, there's not much else you can do. His feelings are out of your control. Yeah, it sucks to be rejected, but that's part of life and dating. And it's better to be honestly rejected than to forever wonder. "
"I can't believe you are even considering forgiving him. Your missing cat is probably dead, after being dragged by her tail and tossed out into a totally foreign and dangerous environment for *possibly* (since he didn't even know which cat it was) a f*cking piece of clothing. Can you imagine how terrifying that was for your cats? And how unnecessary and cruel it was? If someone abused my loved ones that way it's OVER. Your cats are so small and vulnerable next to huge and violent human, and they are YOUR LOVED ONES and they are dependent on you and your goodwill and care.  You should have gone outside and brought them back in IMMEDIATELY not waited an hour for your boyfriend to leave. Even if by some miracle your poor cat comes back, this is 100% a reason to break up, and for you to find better boyfriends in the future.  "
"Welcome in the cycle of abuse. There are always these honeymoon periods in the abusive relationship. It's harder to dump the abuser when there are these good moments, and then he implements in you the belief the bad ones are your fault and you are pretty much cooked.

"Just go no contact with your ex and stop thinking about it. Why are you letting your ex's actions still have so much power over you?

Let him go and continue moving on. "
"You're not attracted to her now. 

For you to be attracted to her she will have to drastically overhaul her personality.

I think you need to chalk this up to basic incompatibility and more on."
"That's hard for me to accept, but you're probably right. Thanks for the honesty. "
"&gt; It's easy for him to say this because I do not have any male friends.

Yeah, and he apparently didn't want you to go out to Vegas with your female friends either...

He's a jealous little bugger, it sounds like. And yeah, this is dangerous territory because even though he's supposedly ""not close"" with this girl, he's still close enough to air your relationship's dirty laundry to her. And is apparently up for taking her for rides and going drinking even though he knows it bothers you. He is prioritizing this girl over your relationship, minimizing your feelings, and being hypocritical. Sounds like a winner?"
"You've only been dating a few months! You shouldn't have had any arguments, much less ""old arguments."" You're supposed to be in the honeymoon stage, where everything is rainbows, not arguing every few days! It sounds like this guy doesn't even really like who you are. "

"So I would treat this like one big misunderstanding for now. Sit down with your son and tell him that you're scared and confused as to why you go this text and why his ex is posting it on FB. Give him the benefit of a doubt and allow him to explain himself. ""Are you sick? Is there something we don't know?"" My initial thought is that he told his ex a lie in some silly scheme to make her feel bad for him, or win her back, and he didn't expect it to spiral out of control. Let him explain himself and then help him figure out how to fix it. "

"I know it’s serious. She has years of specialized training that make it so that she could easily kill me with her bare hands if she wanted to, even though she’s smaller than I am. Her choking me was a major wake up call – I’ve read that it’s the #1 indicator for domestic homicide, and I’m ready to get out. 

I don’t know what to do when she’s actively having an outburst (I don’t know what to call it, it looks like some kind of psychotic break to be honest) – she’ll take my phone and block the door, hitting me if I try to get out. I’ve sat there for hours before while she screams at me and hits me without me being able to do a fucking thing. 

I’m surprised our neighbors haven’t called the police yet, honestly. You would not believe how loud she is, not to mention the sound of her throwing things and me trying to calm her down. "
"You are asking the wrong question.  You shouldn't be asking about how you can get your sister to accept more bullshit from your mom so that it doesn't get thrown at you instead, and you shouldn't be asking how you can manage to weather the extra bullshit from your mom that your sister will eventually decide she doesn't want to accept.  You need to just stop accepting the bullshit.  

You and your sister both are letting your mom walk all over you, because that's how it's always been.  But you're an adult now, and that means you should be beginning to think of yourself as your own person with your own boundaries that *you* decide on for yourself.  Your mom has committed multiple crimes -- *serious* crimes that would win her some prison time if law enforcement found out about it.  Because as it turns out, the government frowns upon theft of large amounts of money.  Why are you more okay with it than they are?  

I'm betting that you haven't ever even seriously considered turning your mom in for any of this stuff.  I'm not saying you 100% need to go to the cops with a backlog of everything shitty and illegal your mom's ever done to you if that's not what you want (though I also think it would be perfectly fine if you *did* do that).  I'm pointing out that you *can* go to the police with this stuff because I want you to understand that **you have all the power here.**  The bullshit will stop when you decide that it stops.  "
"You don't really have a choice, at this point. Time to hire a lawyer and start looking to protect your savings.

&gt;Financially inter-linked- Most of our savings are joint and in various diversified assets that are hard to dispose of and divide easily, this includes what I inherited from my parents.

Sunk cost fallacy. 

And it's a bit late now, but...this was not a good idea. There's a reason people don't mix finances until after marriage. You want to be on the same page, and have a method (divorce) for separating assets.

&gt;but I do need her co-operation. Our lives are incredibly inter-linked, a one-sided breakup will cause a lot of havoc. Personally, financially etc.

You aren't going to get it. She's dead set against giving it, and there's nothing you can do to change her mind. All you can do now is suck up the damage, and get out before you become more intertwined and it gets harder."
"Sure!

The fact that, instead of being happy about her education, he tried to blackmail her out of it. 

&gt;Brian said that if I left our town he'd dump me.

Now, this may be phrasing on OPs side, but he didn't say he can't handle long distance, or that losing her would make him sad. No, he'd ""dump her"". 

By making her lie to her parents, he's causing a rift between them. She has a scholarship, but it seems to me that her parents pay for the rest (housing at least). He can now tell them how she lied and decieved them, possibly leading to cutting her of. 

The part where he crashed his car and refuses to have it fixed is fishy. How convinient that now he can't work. This causes her stress, and he must be aware of that.

He makes her his maid, causing her stress and time. Studying takes time. She says he's exhausting her. 

He's making her ""guilty"" for this situation. This is weird, because ... guilty how? His car? Or the fact that they had to go to her school? 

Lastly, he has no career. She's getting one, it seems. There are a few men who can not handle this. A woman dropped out of my CS-program because of her jealous husband. It happens.

Edit to clarify: The husband was envious of her getting a degree, not jealous of other guys. Sorry, not a native speaker here."

Yeahhh...this doesn't sound like the behavior of a ""very dedicated mother."" It sounds neglectful. The fact that OP's sister wants to move out and get an apartment at 13 (!!) means that she feels unsafe and unstable in her living situation. OP is under-reacting IMO.

"Again - NOT ON HER. The furniture you bought before you met her and long before she moved in were YOUR expenses. And now you own the furniture. That's how it works.

"Some of my friends used to act like this. I run a small business from home, work between 40-60 hours a week and would frequently be asked to keep sick kids or take over school holiday childcare.

Anyone who was bitchy like this Sarah person got a free pass to never talk to me again, most people just didn't ask again when I explained this, and the odd one would but they'd usually offer to bring groceries or have a sleepover for mine over the weekend or something. You told her, she was rude, let her pay for childcare somewhere else."

I really don't like that your two choices are seemingly ""Dad,"" which is so intimate and which lots and lots of people find uncomfortable, or ""Mr. Lastname,"" which is oddly formal for someone who's technically family.  At the same time, though, it sounds like he may be genuinely uncomfortable being called by his first name for whatever reason.  To be real, if it were me, I'd just avoid calling him anything, haha.  I've never had to call my in-laws anything."
"Yeah, maybe he actually means, ""well, you do you!"" Or ""let's agree to disagree."" Like, ""I think cold stew is gross but hey, if you like it then do your thing.""

Can you ask him to change his phrasing to this? Because I agree that he's making it sound like you're combative and he's right, but keeping the peace."
"Preeety sure its illegal. If they expect her to pay back for FEEDING her, she can call a lawyer if it gets serious, or go no contact."
"Sorry, I didn't mean to sound defensive there, I do agree with you about sexuality and social norms. I think the fact that she was 22 and still a virgin is a sign that she was indeed waiting for the right person, so the guilt was certainly not diminished, in fact probably increased.

When I told her I was interested, it was 3 days later, so it wasn't a ""I'll call you"" kinda thing. It was me saying I cared about her.

I'm not too sure about the flowers thing, but I'm 100% going to follow up with a gesture. I don't want to come off too strong too quickly, since that already spooked her."
"NOOOO no no no no no. Do not. No do not do that. 

&gt;He has a history of debt, unpaid loans, and has a bad credit score. 

He won't pay off that debt and you cosigning means you're signing on to be the person who gets to pay it when he doesn't. 

Doooooo noooooot. "
"How are you going to be a psychiatrist if you can't interact with women under 50? Why do you react to women under 50 so differently than women over 50 or men? It seems like you put them in a separate category, ""potential romantic interest"" rather than ""human to interact with."" And that will hold you back in nonromantic areas of life as well. Women are just people. Even young pretty ones. "
"Sifted through your post history - he sounds awful and you sound like you've been unhappy for a while now:

&gt;He belittled and critizes me about every little thing. Nothing I ever do is good enough. I used to say nothing and just take it but I can't anymore but standing up for myself makes it so much worse. He threatens to call my mom at 1 in the morning. 

&gt;Yesterday I spilled some water on the bar. With how he reacted you would have though I killed his family or burned the place down. I was called every name in the book on top of being told that he wasn't attracted to me, he is only with me because we have financial obligations, I'm fat, ugly, retarded, stupid worthless, immature, I've never done anything important in my life and i'm only where I am because of him. He went on for a good few hours.

This is an abusive relationship. This is your first ""grown-up"" relationship so you didn't know any better, but they are not suppose to be like this. This is why a 32 year old ""man"" would want to date a 22 year old - because he can treat her terribly and she won't have enough life experience to leave. You deserve so much better than this. Hell, having no relationship would be better than this - this man sounds like poison."
"She really wants to get married just so she can be ""sure he won't cheat on her""

Wtf"
"This is a lack of respect issue. Sometimes it's selfrespect, but in this case, it disrespects you. He has no influence, the planet conspires against him and you should tolerate his lack of power. It's especially interesting indeed, because he's on time for his friends. 

Perhaps it's time to change your strategy. At this moment he's counting on you to lie to him so he's on time. Start by giving him a time and if he's not there after 20 min., leave. Go do something more useful with your time. No fuss, just don't be there.

So far, he's trained you well. You wait, you lie, you make special arrangements and you're so good at it that he's annoyed by that effort. To him it IS a joke and a game. It's your own fault you're mad about it, he's having fun. Him being on time is only important to you, it's not to him. Stop giving this energy. If he really sees a future with you, he really wants to continue the relationship, he'll manage to find a way to work his alarmclock. "
"Thank you, this is a really cute story. Hopefully someday we can look back on this and it'll be funny. "
"The only way you will know is to check your dad's phone to see whose number it is, or check your girlfriends phone to see if she sent that message. "
"To follow this up, if he does threaten to hurt himself to try and convince you to come back, call the police and ask for a welfare check on him rather than.going yourself."
"I'm half Asian, half white. I am not sure where you live but I don't think that mentality is as predominant as you think. There are definitely unhealthy relationships that have a racial/power imbalance but I doubt every Asian man you walk by is judging you. "

If the GF has sold paintings in the past they could try that route on valuation, but OP would need to decide on if that amount of money or teaching a lesson to the ex is worth the filing fee and time of taking the ex to court.  Also collecting a settlement might not be easy either. "

You should have access to marital assets to pay for a lawyer. 
Best damn metaphor for nature/nurture I have ever heard.
"I guess I would give him the opportunity to explain himself. He doesn't know that you know about the $55k. Perhaps he has earmarked that for retirement. Who knows. But if he deliberately hides it from you, the conversation goes like this:

&gt; Dad, is this everything?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; The whole picture?

&gt; Yes.

&gt; You're not leaving anything out?

&gt; Nope.

&gt; Okay. So. If I were a bank, I would be asking you why you've chosen not to disclose all of your assets. But I am not a bank, I'm your son. Right now it looks like you have plenty of money, you just don't want me to know that so I will feel obligated to give you more. I don't know what you are up to, Dad, but in the business world it's called fraud. So, not only are you not going to get anything from me beyond your paycheck, but now I know that I can't trust you. So we're done here.

&gt; But, Son, I...

&gt; No Dad. I gave you three chances to mention the $55k inheritance and you chose to hide it from me. If you don't want  to let me know what's going on, then I can't loan you money. If you had pulled this crap on an actual application, you'd be guilty of fraud. As it is, you're just guilty of lying to your own son in hopes of scoring a fast buck. Like I said, we're done here.




"
"I don't want to sound accusing at all. That's not my intent. But my mother was BPD and...yeah. It was rough. BPD can be incredibly difficult to deal with, both for the person who has it and those around them. You say in your post that you have your problems under control ""now"". How long have you had them under control? If you used to have outbursts and whatnot in the beginning, she may be afraid of having to raise a child who has those issues.

Just trying to offer some perspective on her views, and fears. I do think it's messed up she brought it up after a long time. But maybe consider why? Was she scared to tell you? Maybe she hasn't always felt this way and something set her off- related to you or not. Maybe she has always felt this way. I don't know. You don't know. Talk with her. 

That being said, if it's a dealbreaker then it's a dealbreaker. For both of you. You can't force her to have your child, and she can't force you to be ok with a sperm donor. "
"Just let it go. He asked a question, you gave him an honest, not-rude answer. I don't think you owe him an apology for that. "
"Sounds like he's insecure because you're in a male-dominated field.

Regardless, he is being petulant. You're not running off with another guy, you are on a work trip with someone who is helping with your career. He should be happy that you got this opportunity, not pouting.

I'd have a sit-down talk with him and tell him that this makes you feel like he doesn't trust you. Don't let him pull that ""I trust you but not them"" crap; you work with men and are probably much better at setting boundaries than a lot of people out of necessity. If he trusts you, it shouldn't be a problem to spend time with coworkers or to travel for work with them. If he doesn't trust you, he can kick rocks."
"You don't actually seem to like this person. You just feel like you're obligated by her issues to maintain a friendship with her.

You have doormat tendencies, OP. This 'friendship' should have been over a long, long time ago."
"Abusers always treat the *new* girlfriend well. If they didn't, none of them would stick around long enough to become the *abused* girlfriend."
"I disagree with the earlier answers; what you've described sounds very in line with French culture. Once you've hung out a few times and kissed, it's assumed you're exclusive.

That said, your edit (""I know that even if there are cultural differences, I still have to go based on what I am or am not comfortable with."") is entirely correct. Tell french guy that you've just started dating and don't know him well enough to make your exclusive boyfriend. If he's upset, block him like you would any other guy."
"You are posting about an argument about house guests/in-laws, which are very common things to argue about, even in healthy relationships.

However, your comments reveal that your partner is horribly abusive. Everyone is wishing that you wrote a post like, ""Give me advice about leaving my horribly abusive partner."" We don't care about your parents' visit, we care about your safety and wellbeing.

""Burying the lede"" means that you aren't starting with the important part. It's like saying, ""I'm mad at my friend for staining my carpet... while murdering my dog."" The carpet isn't important."
"Right now it sounds like you don't know much about what happened so your imagination is going wild and you're frightened and confused. Try to focus on what you actually know and what you actually need to address. 

First off, you won't be denied admittance to the US based on looking sort of Muslim, it's entirely dependant on your passport. It sounds like you have UK citizenship, so that's totally fine.

Second, Las Vegas is extremely close to the California border, the fact that he is apparently in California now doesn't indicate that he lied to you about where he was going, that's not something you need to spend energy on right now.

What you do need to do is get a hold of this ""friend"" and get specific information about the hospital where your husband is and then you call the hospital directly. They won't tell you specifics about his condition but you should be able to find out his general state and, if he's awake, you might be able to talk to him.  Start making arrangements to take time off work and travel but don't buy a plane ticket until you have more information.

I hope your husband is ok, you can do this. Good luck."
"Oh god, he must feel terrible. I guess he opened the door by asking but this is going to be hard for any young man to come back from. Knowing that sex was better with the ex will haunt him forever and I can't really blame him for feeling that way. He will always feel inadequate and wonder if you are still fantasizing about Brad. "
"Tried that, told them ""Hey guys, look I have no issue with you partying into the wee morning on the weekends but I would really appreciate if you stayed off my roof."" They told me ""Go fuck yourself snow white"" because apparently they're also racist. I replied ""Well I guess I'll get the cops involved"" and they laughed and said ""Yeah, you do that."""
"I'd just respond with ""until you apologize for physically abusing my dog,"" do not contact me again."
"Hey life gets hectic and we forgot to tend to our sexual selves, especially as women. I'd start by creating moments for intamacy that don't include sex. Start pleasing yourself more often.

"&gt; dumb as a box of rocks

Well, let's put this in perspective.  Functional illiteracy rates in the USA - adult, independent people who get by, but just can't make any sense out of the written word - are estimated to range from 9-11%.

You're not illiterate.  In fact, you wrote a long essay for this post, with no major grammar or spelling errors, and it was coherent and to the point.  Most college grads I interview would struggle with that.  You're not dumb at all; you're quite smart, probably above average.

You're missing some education and are keenly aware how important it's going to be that you go get that education.  Why be ashamed of it?  Your boyfriend's been supportive this far, as you have been for him; why not just proceed by assuming that he will support you in this too?"
"Yup my bio mom convinced my step dad that I was a loser and to kick me out at 17. I moved in with my girlfriend and her parents to finish school and my (then girlfriend) now wife are moving into a nice house soon. I'll never forgive my mom for what she did and her narcissistic ways. I appreciate what my step dad has done for me all my life and I still want him in my life but my mom can fuck right off.

EDIT: To those who think their decision helped me in the end. I've got a lot of psychological problems that stem from my mother and is probably what caused my depression to worsen greatly over time. I'm planning on seeing a therapist soon, but all I can say is I just wish shit didn't hit the fan back then when I really didn't need it to. It's hard going from having a rock solid plan of going to college and having the next few years planned out after highschool to being on the side of the street with nothing but your clothes on your back."
"And not to mention he ain't exactly wrong to be concerned that someone is lying their ass off on the Internet. I imagine I'd have a pretty similar reaction if a friend of mine dropped this on me too when I'd never heard of someone you were this close to and never met. 

He doesn't have the context you have of this that you think proves this guy is real. And for that matter I'm assuming you really do. Seems like it but still. 

Wouldn't you freak out a bit if one of your friends did this exact same scenario to you? It's an understandable overreaction I think.

I mean, my best friend comes up to me and drops an entire long relationship I've never heard about and oh and I'm flying out to visit them. All at once being hit with that? A little freakout is reasonable. Going 0-100 to that to your best friend is a big thing to do."
"Realistically, the pool of women interested in dating a 28-year-old man who lives with his parents because he doesn't have the skills to be independent is going to be quite small. And that's before considering any aspergers-related issues with the actual dating.  
He's highly unlikely to have success on the broad market, and I would definitely suggest looking to a service deliberately designed for a niche market, as you mentioned, which I think has a better shot. Maybe his chances there are low, but surely if it's a formal service, they'd be asking what he's looking for, and wouldn't be setting him up with foreign brides or something. If it doesn't turn out to have anyone he likes, he's not in a worse spot than he is now. I'd encourage him to try that route.  

Does he have friends? If he has trouble meeting people in general, i'd suggest he work on relationships with people period before he tries to work out dating, which is a harder subset of the same principles."
It's abusive.  You know this yourself because you say you feel so low all the time.  It's hard to leave abusers - they make certain of this by their actions.  You need to get a friend or two to help you leave and you need to leave suddenly and to a place he can't find you.
"This is great advice.

I do want to add on, though. If you don't want to put a lot of effort/energy into your appearance... that's okay. I'm 28 and I've never worn makeup except on special occasions, I generally dress in jeans/shorts and a tanktop, and the most attention my hair gets is a brush a couple times a day.

But I also accepted that it ""wasn't attractive"" or whatever to a lot of people. That was okay. I didn't want to date those people anyway. And I found me a man who thinks my plain ass is the most gorgeous thing ever. So it really depends on what you want and how you want to present yourself."
"yup i can confirm I am a Male and did this all the time when I was immature now I value friendships more then trying to have sex, just recently meet a amazing new hot friend yes the urge and instinct kicked in but i did not let it get to me, down the line she keeps telling me the same story every Male friend she makes ends up going crazy lol because they are all trying to get in her pants I am glad i have over come that an just enjoy going out for a drink, dinner and a good conversations "
"This is what's called ""financial infidelity."" It can be hidden debt or debt that goes against good life plans. I'm glad you're not marrying her. It would be a disaster."
"I consider it a dumpable offence.  it shows a lack of self love and self care.  not something i want to have in a partner.

my boyfriend ""forgot' about his personal hygiene when his mom died. I let it go for a few weeks and then ultimatumed him about it.

I cant sit back and watch my partner slowly make himself sick and be more at risk for illness by not taking care of himself. "
"You're going to push this off and push this off and she's going to grow more and more frustrated until it gets to a point where she cuts her losses. Then it won't matter.

"You've had a good relationship where this arrangement has been working for years.

The problem has persisted for two *weeks*, and the only two solutions you've proposed are ""divorce"" and ""cut her finances off completely"".  Nowhere in there is ""talk to a doctor and see if there's a medical reason"", nowhere in there is ""talk to a therapist or counselor"".... I'm not even sure you've talked to your *wife* other than to issue orders.

This is an excellent case of ""You're not wrong, but you're an asshole""."
"&gt; he wants a full year of the 50/50 custody to show the court.

What does he think magically happens when he hits the one year mark that can't happen now? And are you both willing to be held hostage by her until you get there?

For that matter, why didn't he have 50/50 to begin with?"
"I feel like I'm always reading these posts about women who have an amazing FWB who they got the feels for and they do all the things a bf and gf *should* do but he wants to keep it causal for some reason, and the woman is crushed. She always says, ""what is it that makes me NOT Gf material?"". I should know because I was that girl at one point, even. 

Well, it appears you just met that guy and whatever you have, you are girlfriend material. Don't overthink it. If he had 50 girlfriends and they all ended poorly, that's a red flag. He had 50 or so hookups and a good majority of them are still Facebook friends with him...that should mean something, he is probably a really good guy.

I would rather burn the house down and sleep on the streets than live in it while infested. Haven't you tried an exterminator? 
"Isolating you doesn't mean physically blocking you from going to see her.

I'm telling you now, because I lived through it, it'll get to the point where seeing Stacy/that month's friend will be 'too much of a hassle' because you'll have to handle all of his bad mouthing and brooding when you leave/come back, and it's gonna be exhausting, so, 'maybe it's not worth it'. And isolating yourself will feel like your choice.

He should be happy you had someone who cared about you when he only cared about his dick. He isn't.  "
"I'm surprised by all the Europeans saying that this isn't French dating culture, particularly for the age group. 
I'm an American living in France for four years now and I have absolutely experienced this, from the other side. My first French boyfriend, we kissed after a first date, and his next text message to me was ""So do we try something serious?"" With that said, yes exclusivity is not implied, he obviously asked me. But, that conversation still came immediately after meeting basically. Same story with two other guys. 
That's not necessarily representative of every guy in France, and I have certainly seen examples of people dating (aka hooking up) like at home, but I also don't think this guy is a clingy, love bombing, psycho. I vote that you talk to him, lay out that you're looking for something casual for the moment and explain exactly, awkwardly what that means if need be. Like if you plan on sleeping with multiple people, say that. Or if you're waiting on the sex, but want to date others, and, of course, encourage the same from him if he'd like. You catch my drift. Spell out what you are looking for and maybe a general timeline for when you could look for an exclusive relationship. 
If you really like him, give everything a chance. I ever prefer the dating experiences I've had in France, but ask to do you and see how it goes! 

edit: just saw your comment on the incessant texting. That's not particularly French...that's just a personality thing. Again, communicate that that's not your style and you'd like to dial it back for the moment. Or if that qualifies as ""clingy"" for you, then just end it. For the record, I would have considered my current boyfriend as clingy at the beginning by my US standards. Took me awhile to get used to not having to play the ""texting game"" and just sending messages when I genuinely thought of him and enjoying talking to him without having to wait a specific time to hide my interest or whatever. He just liked me and wanted me to know, and now I appreciate that so much. "
Yes I do! Thanks for the reply!
"I call my fiance, my son and our cat my boys. "
Appeal to their religious beliefs and say you feel guilty because Jesus wouldn't want you to lie and cheat.
Of course they think that. It's because they aren't Christians. They just go to church.
Ooooh send him that laundry list and block hahaha 
"He has implied, multiple times, that you put up some bs act to pretend you're intelligent, which means he thinks you're stupid when you disagree with him. That's insulting as fuck, and the other things he does are emotionally abusive. Do not make excuses, and get away from this guy."
Remember: Don't fuck Nazis. Don't fuck Nazi-adjacent people. Don't fuck this dude.
"Honestly, as someone who has dealt with depression and for the past year, anxiety on top of it, I can't stand myself when I know I'm in a bad mood. I'll see myself start to get snippy when one thing to many goes wrong and I will force myself to start acting better, because frankly other people don't deserve to be victim to my bad mood when they didn't do anything. Sometimes it's exhausting to be fake happy all day, but until I can get on medication (at the end of this month!) it's worth it to be someone people actually enjoy being around. "
"Um no - don't do this. BDSM  is a specific kink between people who are VERY clear on limits and the sub is actually in control of the play, since they control how hard or soft the play is.

BDSM is not about ""I'll show you to be scared"". Had this choking been during play then your partner would have stopped IMMEDIATELY you said so.

The number one predictor for spousal murder is choking . This is not something to brush under the carpet and it is definitely NOT BDSM play."
"&gt; And I told him, when you have sex with someone the relationship is over. He tells me he won't do it today. That's it. No promise of time or discussion of when or how, just not today. So now I sit here waiting.

&gt;Now he disappears for 4 hours at a time. Refuses to allow me to go to the gym with him. I can't even pick him up outside or near the gym because he thinks I am spying on him.. 

Dude. The relationship is over. You gave him an ultimatium and clearly he's already broken it. It's time to chalk this one up to another life experience and go back home. He rebuilt his life in Paris, it is absolutely possible for you to return home and rebuild yours as well. "
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them."
"I feel like a loser. I've stayed with him for 2.5 years and I've allowed myself to constantly be blamed for things that I know in my heart (and from you guys) that I wasn't wrong for. Last night he asked me when I wanted to leave and couldn't. I told him that after he choked me in June, I wanted to move out. He dismissed it by saying ""well, I don't drink anymore"" (every time he's hit me has been when he's drunk so he claims that the situation is solved by him not drinking). I've asked him to go see a counselor. He went once, did not tell the guy that he ever hit me, then came back and told me the counselor said that there's nothing wrong with him. I have no confidence left and I don't trust myself. I constantly have to come on here and ask for advice because he tells me that I'm wrong about everything. Even if I show him that other people say he's wrong or tell him that my therapist thinks what he's done to me is wrong, he says they're just taking my side. One time I got so low that I felt suicidal. He told me that I was just being manipulative. He's also told me once that he doesn't care if I die. When I told him that it really hurt my feelings that he said that, his response was, ""well I was upset"".

I'm embarrassed to tell my family because they told me from the beginning not to move in with him and I threw a fit about wanting to be with him. I was supposed to move back home to California after college and I stayed against their advice. Even when I'm unhappy, I feel like I have to make it work because I put myself in this situation when people told me not to."

"A lot of people use masturbation as a tool for relaxation. It doesn't always have a lot to do with sex.

And he's not always obligated to have sex with you if he doesn't feel like it. 

I guess it really depends on *how much* he's rejecting you. If it's almost every single time, then yeah, you have a problem. But if he is rejecting you a normal amount (not everyone is always in the mood for sex) I don't think it's appropriate for you to bug him about this. I mean, sometimes a guy just wants to whack off. 

Expecting him to wake you up when you're sleeping for sex instead of taking care of it himself is *not* reasonable. 

If you're finding his libido or your sex life to be unsatisfying as a whole I do think you need to reconsider marriage. But I encourage you to separate that from the masturbation issue."

"I saw all that. I also saw that:
1. This has only been going on for two weeks
2. His wife is showing signs of depression
3. He's expressing a desire to control when she sleeps and whether she looks at her phone
4. Views her leaving the toilet seat down as passive aggression

...and on all of this he is expressing zero concern for her. He mentioned one conversation in which she expressed that she's tired of doing chores. It's been TWO WEEKS and he's looking for an excuse to divorce her. There is a serious lack of empathy going on. "
I broke up with my last bf about 2 years ago and Facebook did not offer to do this for me so it must be very new.
You need to leave him. Taking pictures of people without them knowing it is beyond creepy. There are certain things that a relationship can survive but this is not one of them.

He's cheating on you. 
"OP - are you seriously doing that for just a boyfriend?

I really hope you’re starting to realize what risk you’re taking by not at least having the protection marriage would afford.  

Taking turns going to school is fine - **but not before marriage.**

I think a date to the courthouse needs to happen now (you’re 3 years late), and if he refuses - absolutely do not continue wasting your life on this.  When you love someone, you minimize the risk they put themselves in, if he’s not going to do that for you, then it’s a bad sign and you need to leave.  
"
"Yes, ask her to change the color. She's probably feeling like you're being super shallow and it's hurting her feelings...but a familial/incestual feeling? That'd ick her out too and probably lead to a higher degree of accommodation. And hair color might be sufficient to snuff out that feeling for you."
"I think it's way more likely that they're using that as an excuse than anything else. Like maybe they know that you expect a really high level of effort from from them and they're not willing to provide it. In other words, maybe you're high maintenance. 

Doesn't mean it's impossible for you to find someone though, don't get discouraged! You'll find someone. At the end of the day, dating is a numbers game unfortunately."
I think she needs to curb her drinking and seek help to learn self control. That should be the first think you say. She needs to not get black out drunk and practice self control. Common. Have a good time and have a few but chill the fuck out.

""I'm going to break up with you if you go to X school"" is controlling and, depending on the circumstances, manipulative. It's designed to make the person it's being said to feel bad about their choice to go to X school, and to potentially keep them from going. In essence, it's a threat of action taken, where ""I'm going to break up with you"" becomes the consequence of ""going to X school.""

""If you move really far away to X school, I don't want to do long distance"" is similar but different. Not wanting to do long distance is very different than breaking up with someone just because they're going to X school or because they're moving away from your hometown. This is a reasonable explanation, and even if it sucks, it's valid. It's part of a larger conversation about the future of the relationship, and is overall a much more mature way of discussing things with a partner. "

"It sounds like if you stopped contacting her you'd never hear from her again!

I hear a lot of people say that they regret wasting their time on people who just weren't willing to show them the same love and effort that they put in. I think youll look back on this and wonder why you stuck it out.

Though if you want to give it another try, communicate that you want a change, not just an apology."

"Let's look at it like this. If this was China, one of your parents might get flack for betraying Chinese people to date a Korean. If you were in Korea, one of your parents might get flack for dating a Chinese person. However, when you are with your parents, does any of that matter? Do they love each other? Did they give you a good life and lots of love? If so, then you have your answer right there. 

Ethnic and racial boundaries always change. What you may feel as a nature identity of ""Asian American"" would make little sense in Asia, where there is not much of a Pan Asian identity and instead national and ethnic identity are what is important. Just look at the stories of Chinese-Japanese children in Japan. If you and your hypothetical Asian spouse from another ethnic were to move to Asia, would you want to dump him for someone else? 

You have to do what makes you happy and be with who makes you happy. In the end of the day, if is your life. Of course, community is important, but within the Asian-American community there is a ton of diversity of opinions, of relationships, and a ton of children from pan-Asian relationships and interracial White-Asian relationships. If is very possible that you are seeing what you are so scared to see.  

It might help if you bring your boyfriend with you to some Asian American events. Will you feel uncomfortable at times? Sure. But, if you want to tame the lion you have to go into the lions den. If anyone is ever rude enough to say anything you can just look at them and say ""I am the child of two loving, cross cultural parents, and I see nothing wrong with cross cultural love. I would appreciate if you leave my private love life alone"". 

But, I think this issue is steams from you not feeling ""Asian enough"". You say that you have never been ""culturally"" Asian, but what does that even mean? You are as Asian as anyone else, and do not let anyone tell you otherwise. You dating a white guy does not make you any less Asian, and it does not make up for past years of not being involved. If you do not speak Korean or Chinese, maybe you can learn? Maybe get involved in a Korean church, or Chinese daoist temple? Or tutoring Asian children? If you get involved in the community in other ways maybe it can feel the void. 

But back to yo and Greg. Date him and be happy. You are not the first Asian woman to date a white man and you will not be the last. "
"I agree with the other commenters who say setting up a camera to set your mind at ease could be a good idea. 

I think you do need to go back to therapy to deal with this doors and locks issue. You can't spend the rest of your life not locking doors, it's just not safe. 

How do you feel your mental health is at the moment generally? I'm not saying you are wrong, it is possible that someone is coming into your room or at least moving the door, but it's also possible that you are being a bit paranoid. Are you under a lot of stress? "
"Well - you've pretty much explained how I personally feel about texting - it's shallow, superficial, slow and doesn't go anywhere.

"This is how emotional abuse works: if the abuser is shitty 100% of the time, most people will be turned off and out of there pretty fast. So, their modus operandi is this: they will treat you like a goddess half of the time (or less, as the abuse escalates) and then, the other half, they will treat you as if you were worthless. This way, they put you in a situation where you think that, since they are fully able of kissing the ground you walk on, it must be something you're doing that's causing them to become mean and insulting. They want you to think they would surely adore you, IF you did one thing or the other, so if they don't, it's because you haven't lived up to their expectations. It's a bait and switch situation really; they show you their fake ""good self"" at first, so that they can gradually manipulate you into doing whatever they like under their own terms, in an attempt to bring their good side out again. 

So, this is what's happening to you. He treats you like his sole reason to live because this makes you more and more emotionally attached to him. Then, once he feels he has you on his hook, he starts mistreating you in order to control you. He's doing this because he doesn't care about you as a partner; he wants a toy that he can play with and control. You are being abused and I hope you can get out of there asap. "

Until this is resolved I would go NC outside of larger family events, why would you want to subject yourself, your husband, or your daughter to this. If you do not seek justice through the courts, you need to find a way to effect that aim for your spouse. He trusted her through you, and due diligence was not done. 

You have some repairs to make within your marriage as a result. In future I hope you will remember this and always keep her at arms length, through this she has shown a complete lack of regard for your marriage, finances and her own grandchild. Good riddance. "

"Honestly? That one joke about wives wouldn't be a big deal to me - it's a stupid comment which frankly I might make to my own fiancée and she wouldn't think twice about. BUT everything else you've said paints a much more complete picture of him not being a good partner at all, so while in a vacuum that one comment of his doesn't seem like much to get mad about, all the other stuff paints it in a different context. 

Ultimately, if you feel like you're done with him, be done with him. That feeling doesn't come from nowhere - loving, mutually supportive relationships don't end because someone makes a bad joke. But strained relationships which are nearly at breaking point absolutely do, because that one comment is the tipping point that's coming on the back of a lot of other related bullshit. "
"If a 28 year old sexually active man gets grossed out by period blood and is anything but a gentleman about it? Not okay!!

I honestly think you're just worrying for no reason. It's totally fine. Didn't even get in the sheets! "
"When I was younger I had this problem. I'd lie about dumb things, basically habitually, to avoid any sort of discomfort that the truth would bring me. I haven't thought about it too much for quite a while, but I'd say it was the result of social anxiety, so perhaps a therapist would help.
 
I didn't seek therapy back then, but I did stop lying. One day I realized that no-one trusted my word anymore, and I really couldn't blame them, I was ruining my own relationships by lying. I stopped completely. I would take a long time to think before I spoke, and when I didn't and a lie slipped out I immediately corrected myself, even if it was completely ridiculous. ""Yes I filled out that application-- oh wait, no I forgot."" I stopped even the tiniest of white lies, and I stopped making sarcastic jokes that could be confused as the truth. 
  
It was definitely difficult at first, and I felt very embarrassed when I had to correct myself, but it's breaking a habit and sometimes you're going to slip up. Stopping lying has really improved my life. It's been almost 8 years since I stopped and most of the time I don't miss it. 
  
Not lying has allowed me develop social skills I never would have been able to before. I can frame things more diplomatically, I can connect with people better, and I can figure out what information to share and what to withhold. I can express myself more genuinely, I can empathize with other people better, and I don't have to spend any of my mental power on keeping up any lies.
  
I'd say the most important tools for quitting lying are these:
  
**1\.** Immediate self-correction.
  
* People are flawed, people misspeak, and people need to correct themselves all the time. Your family and friends will much more easily forgive a lie that is corrected seconds after it's spoken than one that is left to stand. ""Sorry, that's not true, actually..."" and ""Oh wait, I meant..."" are phrases that can save you often.
  
**2\.** Know when not to share. 

* A. If someone asks you a question and you don't want to tell them the truth, just decline to answer. This doesn't work with all questions, especially if the asker is depending on the answer, but it works for many. If someone asks about something private, or embarassing, or just requires an elaborate answer it's fine to say, ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" or, ""I'd prefer not to say,"" or ""That's a lot to get into right now."" Or if you're feeling cheeky, ""It's a secret!"" or ""I'd tell you... but then I'd have to kill you.""

* B. Another part of this is giving limited information. Say you have a fight with your girlfriend and someone asks why you're down but you don't want to tell them. You don't have to come up with a fake reason you're sad, you could say, ""I'm having a personal problem lately, and it's on my mind."" For the most part, if you say something is personal, polite people will let the topic go. If they push the issue you can always fall back to one of the above, ""I don't want to talk about it right now.""
  
**3\.** Apologize. 
  
* Sometimes you'll mess up. Sometimes someone will reference a lie you told a while ago. When these things happen the best thing is to admit the truth, apologize for what you've said, and tell them you're working towards becoming a more honest person.
  
Let yourself become someone new. You've lied a lot, and if someone called you a liar right now, they wouldn't be wrong. That hurts. You want to be trustworthy. You have good intentions. Letting go of the past needs to happen to get better. Allow yourself to be the person you want to be, focus on truthfulness. Every time you lie by reflex and have to correct yourself, focus on the *correction* and not the lie. The *correction* is the sign of progress, that's the symbol of you getting better, that's the symbol of the honest you. As time goes on you'll find you're correcting yourself less and less... until one day you'll realize, you haven't lied in over a week, and you can handle the situations where you would've lied before honestly. Eventually, you'll rarely feel the urge to lie, and when you do have that urge you'll have the emotional tools to deal with it.
  
I do think getting therapy is a good idea if you can. Also having a conversation with your girlfriend about your efforts to be more honest and stop lying habitually. Same with your parents if you have a good relationship. 
  
Best of luck, man!"
"&gt;One thing I've noticed is men will usually stop if ONE man tells them to but it takes a minimum of two women for him to stop.

almost always. "
"The only reason she didn't fuck him is because you caught her first.  (At least you don't think they've had sex yet.)  Anyway, there are worse things for children than growing up with parents who live separately. How do you feel about arguing on a regular basis with a wife who's sneaking around fucking other guys?  Do you think your children need to be exposed to that growing up?"
"Okay, thanks.

I think this is pretty clear then. Sit him down and come up with a rule that he agrees to honor. My husband and I have an agreement that any purchase over $200, we have to clear with the other person. This has worked well for us for over 15 years.

If he refuses, then you guys are going to need couples counseling. What he's doing is incredibly disrespectful. He's not acting like your marriage is a partnership."
"I bet those ""we have fun with your GF on the weekends!"" Comments sting like hell now.

I could never get over that. Literally mocking cuckolding him to his face."
"This would definitely be breakup worthy if I were in your position. He was not only abusive to your cats, but he was abusive to you as well. There is no excuse for his behavior. His response when you told him about how your cat had gone missing is inexcusable. The safety of your cat is more important that a jersey.

ETA: I hope your cat is able to make its way home."
"From your comments it seems like you want to try and save this relationship, so I'll tell you my story:

I used to be similar to your girlfriend in that I'd get extremely frustrated over small things. This frustration stemmed from the fact that all my life I was dealing with a disorder that has no treatment and living with my emotionally abusive parents. But I digress.

The important part is that my anger was often directed at my boyfriend, even when he made an honest mistake or when it wasn't even his fault. It wasn't as bad as what you described, there was some communication there to go off of (the part about your birthday was honestly heartbreaking), but it created a lot of tension. It was definitely not my proudest moment. I felt ashamed of what I was doing even while I did it but I felt like I couldn't stop.

What helped me, as cliche as this sounds, was therapy. I was getting angry because I couldn't control my life and therapy helped me gain some confidence. I learned to keep calm, trust my boyfriend's intentions were good and say things in a constructive way. I was taught how to stand up for myself in other situations so I didn't have to overcompensate when I was with my boyfriend. He was very patient with me and I'm immensely grateful for that.

I don't know your girlfriend, why she acts this way or if she'd be able/willing to fix her behavior. It's definitely wrong and it's on her to change this, not on you. You'd be completely justified in leaving her, but if you stay the condition should be that she HAS to change. And that's not going to happen if she does not get to the bottom of the issue. With a cool head, explain to her what you're feeling. Tell her that treating you like this is not okay and she has to see a professional. If she doesn't see a problem with the way she treats you, gets overly defensive or is unwilling to change, it's over. If she won't put in the effort to be in a healthy relationship with you then she's not mature enough for a relationship."
"&gt;He already has you second guessing yourself and saying that he knows you'll be happy together which frankly seems off putting.

Yeah, this is key.

""He does something I hate, but he says it's normal and harmless. I'm sure he must not be hurting me on purpose, and if he says it's normal then that must be true, so how do I learn to live with the abuse? Or how do I get him to understand that I don't like it?""

We see these posts all the time with age gaps. The younger partner assumes that: a) the older person loves them and has their best interests at heart, and b) that the older person knows best because of their maturity and experience. 

So when they see themselves being hurt and disrespected, they flail around trying to find some explanation, like that the person doesn't know the harm they're causing, or that they themselves are overdramatic and need to behave better.

It's already happening with you. You FEEL and KNOW that you're too young and don't want to date him, but he counters that by saying it's actually okay if you don't have sex until 18. So you start to think, ""he must be right""??

I disagree that it's purely about sex. He may well want to move in with you and marry you and have kids with you. But with him in charge while you don't even realize it."
My only comment on this as the husband of an ex LuLaRoe seller. Do NOT let her get tied in with that company to be a seller. That ship is sinking fast and screws over its sellers regularly. They will have a mass law suit against them I'm no time. 
She was the cause of your break up? And then they dated again? That is alarming. 
We definitely need counseling if we are going to work. This is definitely something she should have brought up years ago. 
You aren't terrible. You were being honest. You shouldn't force yourself to stay in a relationship with someone that you aren't attracted to anymore. He knows where you are mentally with the relationship. Now the ball is in his court to see if he wants to do anything about it. 
"It doesn't have to be a confrontation. Why don't you just say something like, ""I really miss you and wish I got to spend time with you more often. You've never come to visit me and there are so many things about my life here that I want to share with you. Couldn't you take 1 week off to come spend time with me? It would really mean a lot."" "
"Let go of convincing her. If you have to put this much effort into getting her to take a vacation, the actual vacation itself is going to be miserable. People have to want to do things for the things themselves to be at all enjoyable."
"**Do not let her move in**. Fortunately, it sounds like your boyfriend is on your side with this one. All of your worst fears are totally legit. She won't get a job. Her dogs will destroy your home. And she will never leave.

If your boyfriend really wants to help, he can try to find shelters or something in the area. But she's an adult and it's time for her to help herself. She has to get a fucking job and clean up her own mess. **Do not let her bully your boyfriend into moving in**. I'm serious. If he caves and moves her in, you have to pack up and go."
yep
I'm a traveling nurse and was gone the week that it happened. I pulled up from the airport to the cops and animal control in our front yard. 
People want someone to blame. You're a target because you've allowed it to happen. That being said - I don't think you're at fault. I sympathize with your situation heavily. Even though some of the advice here has been hard to hear - I absolutely would get rid of the dogs immediately. And ask yourself if you can continue doing this for the next 30 years. I wish you all the luck in the world. You deserve to be happy!!!
"She's emotionally abusive to you and is blaming you for her behavior.

Unless she has a come-to-jesus revelation that she is the problem and is willing to go to counselling with you to fix her behavior, then no she isn't going to change."
"This is absolutely foul, and what's worse is that she is attacking *you* for being upset. She's not apologizing. We all do stupid things, and this I could probably forgive if my boyfriend had done it and been open to learning why it's so gross. But the fact that she dismisses your feelings and attacks you for being overly sensitive, *and has repeatedly since you left the house* (as in, it's not a knee-jerk reaction) shows that she doesn't respect your boundaries."
"It sounds like your roommate is a bit homophobic. You're not doing anything wrong, and her behavior is unfair. This is a *her* issue, not a you issue. 

You need to sit her down and tell her that since you've got an agreement and you're not breaking it, that you will not change your behavior for something she needs to get over. "
Get another one. Try individual psychotherapy with a qualified and licensed person.  With a baby on the way and a dependent parent you don't have time for 'Barnes and Noble.' ;)
"First of all. I would consider changing the lock on your bedroom door to one that has a lock and key. 

Second, when you're not home, kennel your pup in your room and, yes, lock her in there when the doggy daycare isn't open. 

Third, make a note to the management company that your roommate is threatening theft of your property and per your lease agreement, what's the penalty for breaking your lease? Additionally I'd look at asking about the definition of a nuisance animal. 

Honestly, it sounds like these girls are being petty to drive you out intentionally. Are these girls partiers? I mean, that's the only thing I can think of reasonably besides them just being petty. I would think if they're college aged girls in their 20s maybe they thought you, another 20-something girl, would be down for parties or w/e and now that you're not or you're on a strange sleeping schedule they want you out. It's a stretch but not improbable. 

We had renters next door this fall/spring that were all softball teammates. Except 2 girls of the 5 went rogue and threw house parties that actually caused damage to the rental and theft of their roommates stuff. The landlord didn't renew the lease and a family has since moved in next door. "
"it's never a good sign when, upon being called out on disregarding consent, the individual responds by saying it's your fault for ""making them feel like a predator.""

"From an outside observer with 0 emotional investment (I.E., I understand that life is a bit more complicated than a 1 sentence suggestion):

"Dude, let it go. You've changed your status, everyone who matters knows it's off. She's just making herself look like a crazy person and it only gets awkward if you go to ever more extreme lengths to make someone *you are no longer dating* act in the way you want her to. What's the worst that could happen? Someone thinks you're dating, you put them right and roll your eyes at your crazy ex. **This doesn't matter.**"
"""Am I overreacting to the situation?""
Yes and no. I don't think it's unreasonable to be UPSET about this news. Breakups are hard, and it's difficult to picture your ex with someone new, especially someone you know. You aren't just mourning the loss of a particular person, but the loss of a particular future.

BUT, I think that your ANGER is unjustified. She's not dating him AT you. The fact that you are upset doesn't mean that she did anything wrong, or is a shitty friend.

""Is she a bad person?""
No. She is trying to find love and happiness, just like you. Someone she is very close to is single, and a drunken hookup led them to see each other differently. 

What if they end up getting married? Would you really expect a friend to pass up the potential love of their life for your comfort?!? If so, I think that makes you the shitty friend. You're settling in to a new relationship, but expect her to make a big sacrifice for you. You two don't even talk much these days! Your expectations are unreasonable and unfair.

""Any suggestions for how I should handle it?""
How about, ""Thanks for letting me know. But I'm sure you can guess that the news is a lot for me to process right now. I'm going to need some space for the time being, but I look forward to celebrating so-and-so's wedding with you, if we don't cross paths before then. Best.""

"If the main concern is having some random in your wedding photos then I would tell her you're happy for him to attend the full day, but that he will not be included in family photos.


I know your SO wants to take a stand against a sibling who seemingly always gets her own way, but sometimes you have to decide whether this is a hill you really want to die on - you said yourself she'll be moody and distant all day if her boyfriend's not there. You did have a place free for her to have a plus one. I would take the hit on having him there - I doubt you two will really notice his presence on the day. But, word to the wise - tell other people that he's not to be in the wedding photos. Warn your photographer, so they know not to let him muscle in (or to let your sister drag him in) and ask someone like an understanding parent to also keep an eye on the situation, just in case.


At the end of the day, your wedding photos are going to be subject to change - I took my ex to my sister's wedding, and we'd been together 6 years and were engaged, but that didn't work out and now he's in those pictures despite not being in my life. There's no safe bet here, regardless of who she brings (I mean, if she'd waited till after the wedding to divorce her husband then you'd be in the same boat of having photos that no longer reflect reality!)."
"This is not, nor ever was, a relationship. I don't even know what to call this, but it's all kinds of fucked up. I wouldn't even be surprised if he was dating this Susan woman the entire time, and is saying similar things to her about you, that he has said to you about her. You literally have no frame of reference, so it's hard to see it, but there are relationships that start on a good/not weird note, ones that have trust and honesty and not other strange women hanging around. Go get some better references.

When you're writing a paper, do you just open the first book that lands on your lap, and refuse to read any other ones? No, and one book would seriously warp your sense of reality because it gives you a narrow frame of mind. Go read other books. Lots of them. Big ones, little ones, skim through them, read ones a few times over. But don't for one second think that this guy is special or cares about you because he was your first. Firsts won't matter a few years down the line. Go NC, work on yourself, and meet new people. "
" The way you word things consistently paints some bad thinking patterns that make it seem like a break up is best for both of you.

&gt;I do want to be with her. I am willing to help some, but, why does the visa suddenly become my responsibility? 

It's not your responsibility, but she's obviously facing some important decisions she needs to deal with. Either you are there for her or you aren't, and she needs a partner who is. 

&gt;I won't get into details, but I have done way more than my fair share for her, so that isn't in question.

This is creepy. Look, I fully support not marrying when you don't want to, but that's not how serious relationships work. You don't do 'enough', so that you don't have to be there for them when they need help.


&gt;Why be concerned about mentioning the legal system favoring females? It's not a big deal. It's just the way it is.

...said everyone with prejudiced and ignorant views. Yes, there are some ways that the judicial system tends to favor women over men, and some the other way around. But that's not a good reason for opposing marriage, and it's a weird thing to say in response. ""I don't want to marry"" is a good answer, ""because females are priviliged"" isn't needed.

&gt;I am just trying to be intelligent about it. I dont know anything about pre-nups, hence why I asked for help.

So maybe look into it first before rejecting marriage and helping your partner because of all the favoritism 'females' get.

Its just more polite to give a response back. Just not responding is inherently rude. 
Agreed. Ghosting isn't for when you feel awkward saying no; I think ghosting is only appropriate when you feel unsafe maintaining contact with someone. 
"Wow.

If I were your daughter, I'd cut your wife completely out of my life, and you, too, if you couldn't muster some decent showing of spine to support me.

I urge you to visit r/justnomil. See if any of the stories resonate. Then see what you can do to rein in your wife. Otherwise, you may lose your daughter and grandson forever."

"Wow... Your wife really crossed several lines here. 

&gt; they started to argue about my wife thinking she is the boss of everything 

It sounds like she does think that. 

She is nothing but the grandma of that kid. That gives her no authority over that kid. Specially not authority that surpasses the kid's mom authority. 

What the hell is wrong with your wife? 

The only one that gets to decide if that toys is ok or not for your grandson is his mom. 

Your wife needs to apologize and understand that her daughter is the only authority over that kid. 

She needs to get a grip before your daughter decides it's best to simply cut her off completely than deal with her gross disrespect.

"You didn't do anything wrong, but that's not the same as not causing harm. I've reflexively hit my husband a few times when he's startled me (I have PTSD so I panic if I'm touched unexpectedly), no harm no foul. We negotiate around my hypervigilance and startle response. 

But your boyfriend has a history of being abused by a partner, so like with my husband and I, you need to be aware that things might happen that trigger responses in him he can't control or doesn't want to show/admit to. Showing weakness is to be avoided when that weakness can be used against you.

I think this is something you need to discuss with him. Other people have given good suggestions (ignore the ""do romantic things"" stuff because that mimics the cycle of abuse), and it would be good to get this out in the open and make sure you guys are on the same page. "
"There are so many people commenting here who are very sweet and apparently more concerned with showing empathy to her than to you. 

This really really really sucks. For YOU. I'm really sorry this happened. And you don't have to magically be okay with this.  You didn't do anything wrong, it's not a fuckup you're responsible for. 

You found out your girlfriend didn't find you attractive and it hurts like hell. You are allowed to be hurt and upset.

"It seems like he's an attentive and caring husband. I think it probably really is about the kitty litter.

"The impression I get is you have emotion, with no social structure to utilize it in practical ways. That results in lots of vague expressions, where you're envisioning magnificent drama, but you're alone dreaming. 

In reality, despite all these feelings for her, nothing useful happened. Why would it be any different? Seems like your loneliness flared, and you got motivated, but there's no path, no outlet to fuel anything, so you're expressing it into text that goes nowhere. 

Since you mentioned being a longtime outcast, this might be a fundamental part of you, not easy to overcome. You can express anything to her, but when it doesn't do anything, you should pay close attention and ask yourself why. Is it possible to change? Can you succeed with different people, on different paths? 

Something seems wrong here, but it doesn't sound like you've clearly identified it yet, and are still lost in feelings of love that aren't actually doing anything useful for you yet. "
"This is a chihuahua and a pit bull situation. In this scenario, the chihuahua keeps yapping at the pit bull, and eventually the pit bull chews out the chihuahua's throat. 

Dump your boyfriend considering he's been physically abusive with you in the past, and stay single so you can mature a little on your own, because what you did is behavior expected of a 14 year old in their first relationship, not a 27 year old. "
"I completely sympathize with the need to protect your child. But, no one is going to stop your mother from approaching you in a public space. And you know why? Because you can't control the vaccinations and health records of every single person you encounter in the store. Taking your child out is enough of a risk to circumvent your argument against her. 

She isn't breaking the law, but I'd start looking into leaving baby at home while you shop around. This should prevent unruly mothers- and germs from being passed around.

In addition: your child not yet being vaccinated makes baby a potential carrier for illnesses, for those with weak immune systems or the minutiae of individuals for whom those vaccinations don't work. Even if baby doesn't get sick, baby can pass around unruly things. It happens. 

Best bet is to leave baby at home until they're all caught up. For baby's sake, and everyone else's "
"I agree with u/Aeitra says here, but I would also add that you should give a little bit of thought to the future. In 12 years time, when you are 30 and in your prime, you are going to be married to a man who is 75. He's likely to have health issues and you may be his caretaker. If you can't commit to that, and all it implies, you shouldn't marry him. Also, if you have kids with him, think about your kid growing up with a father of his age, and all that implies. 

I'm not saying you should end it, but if you are seriously thinking long term with this guy, think long and hard. You are likely only going to get 20 years out of a relationship with him (assuming an average lifespan) and some of those years at the tail end of the time frame may not be so fun. 

Edit: sorry my math is way off, I thought you were still 18, but you get my drift."
"Not only is he responsible for this, I'd argue he fully saw it coming. 

He turned down OP's money _just_ to spite her, because he didn't want her ""feeling good after turning his dog away."" His dog could've been much more comfortable, much more taken care of, much safer, but he actively chose the alternative to spite OP. 

For someone who claims to love his dog so much he pretty much sacrificed him to win an argument. Who willingly puts an animal in subpar conditions when there are obvious alternatives? It's like he did this on purpose to have the final ""I told you so"" to OP. "

False. Only #1 &amp; #2 are uncompromisable. In fact, really, none of them are. If her cats are non-negotiable, she can work a second job to afford a more expensive apt.

"OP, please go see a lawyer asap and talk about this at least. Whether you stay with him or not, he's going to have to support all three of his children. But perhaps if you separate from him now, you can protect your own income, so that you aren't helping support his love child. I don't know, IANAL and I don't know what country you're in."
"&gt; I am SO disgusted. With both of them but obviously

No, that's *not* obvious.  From your description, your sister has done nothing wrong; your boyfriend has.

&gt; There's no way this could be innocent, is there. 

Define ""innocent"".  Your boyfriend has clearly given money to a cam girl in exchange for some flirtatious chat with a girl in her underwear.  That would be totally fine for some people (no nudity, no touching), but it's also totally fine if you decide that crosses a line for you.  And to the extent your boyfriend knew that it crossed a line for you (and his apparent attempts at hiding it suggests he DID know), that's bad.

&gt;  What explanation could he possibly have that isn't about wanting to hit on her. 

Well, no, that's not a very likely explanation.  More likely he wanted to jack it to pictures of a young woman in her underwear.  It's a *porn* thing; that's why people give money to camgirls, not because they want to date them (which wouldn't happen anyhow).

&gt; She's apparently a very popular streamer and has a ton of guys hitting on her, and she gives them all the same flirty routine she gave my boyfriend. 

Right, your boyfriend means nothing to her.  This is just business for her, and the business in question is getting money for horny guys in exchange for a flirty text and letting them see her in her underwear.

&gt; She has NO REASON to solicit money from dudes 

But probably every reason to solicit attention and compliments.  I'm sure she probably gets a lot of money from her dad, but probably not a lot else, no?

&gt; My [33F] boyfriend [31M] of a year was maybe going to cheat on me online with my sister

If flirting with and sending money to scantily clad camgirls is cheating to you (and it's okay if it is!), then he was already cheating.

&gt; How do I deal with this with both of them?

Your sister has done nothing wrong; she didn't know it was your boyfriend.  As for your boyfriend, you now know he likes to give money to soft-core camgirls on the internet.  If you're not okay with that, then you shouldn't put up with it.  If he knew you weren't okay with it and did it anyhow, then he clearly doesn't respect your boundaries; dump him."

Why on earth was your wife's first thought ""I need to also get cake from your mom because dogs are like my kids?"" What? That's oddly competitive and selfish. 

Also, it was NOT a fuckup to mention your mother's background. I think everyone on here is on your mother's side here. Your wife sounds nuts. A lot of people like their dogs, but I think they all understand that not everyone is going to ""get"" a dog birthday. I mean I LOOOOVE dogs but I don't go that far. 

Being a spouse is not about literally always backing up your partner no matter what, despite what this thread says. You should of course present a united front, but if you can't even present a reasonable explanation of your mom's POV without ""siding"" with her, that's weird. Get a spouse who knows that people think different things. "
"When we do paid bar tabs, we set it to a limited number of drinks per person AND set the type of drink. For example we'll pay for beer, house wine, and well drinks, but not premium liquor. OR we'll have a special drink mixed up for the occasion in a set amount that's available, like 8 pitchers of top shelf margaritas or sangria.

The other way we do it is pay an amount (say $300) and when that money is gone, everyone starts paying for their own drinks."

"Thanks for responding.  Talking to a lawyer is a good idea.  My pay is quite small and a lot of it goes to cover my part of the employer-provided health insurance.  I don't earn enough to continue to pay my part of the current mortgage, health insurance, and the rent and utilities on a separate place for just me.  The same is true for him.  His small social security disability check isn't enough to cover the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities on the house.  

I think I've accepted the reality that he is never going to quit drinking.  Never.  I'm trying to figure out what I should do next."
"""I don't know how"" and ""My family didn't do this"" are pretty poor excuses.  He's been married for ten years to someone who does ""do this"" and has pretty well demonstrated ""how"" so...

Tell him in advance that you'd really like him to plan something, not just tell you to choose something you'd want to do, but PLAN something.  It doesn't have to be the moon and stars, but pick a thing he thinks you'd enjoy and arrange to do it. It's not too much to ask a few times a year.  Let him know that things you might enjoy are trips, trying something new together, cooking classes, or whatever.  Let him know that you plan things for him because you want him to be happy and feel appreciated, and you'd really like to be on the receiving end of that.  Being sad the day of is too late.  Let him know now that you'd like to ""surprise each other with something nice/fun"" for Christmas and start talking about it.  

Good luck.  I really dislike this whole ""helpless"" thing where one person just can't POSSIBLY plan something nice for the other. It's not super hard to make dinner reservations or plan a weekend.  If the money isn't there, fine, you might have to be more creative, but if your SO goes out of his/her way to plan things for you that's a PRETTY BIG CLUE that they find those things important.

"This is an incredibly toxic situation. The car thing shows that, quite frankly, they do not care about you.

Get through college. When you've graduated, give them a list of all the ways you can remember that they favored her over you. Circle this one, where they pushed her to go to her chosen school and forbade you. Remind them of the car and timing.

Then you tell them that you will not speak to them again until they have fully explained and/or apologized for their actions AND come up with a measurable plan to make it up to you. And I mean a real, introspective apology, not a ""I'm sorry you felt hurt."" 

This favoritism will not stop and you will always feel like an outsider in your own home. If you have children, do you really want your children to feel bad because their grandparents so obviously favor one or the other? The only hope of a healthy relationship with them in the future is to make them understand there are consequences for their shitty parenting that they have to fix to prove they will not do it to the next generation."

"On the contrary, when he moves out you will be able to essentially start healing. You need to get away from this person asap. As for him having sex with others and flaunting it, one, he can't really flaunt anything if you cut contact and block him everywhere, so that you have no way to gather information about what he does. And two, big fucking deal. If he can't treat you like you deserve and appreciate you, he better go have sex with other girls and see who will put up with his pathetic crap. I skimmed through your previous post and it looks like this man was abusive to you. He is doing you a favor by leaving you. If a vile human being hates you, you must be doing something right; I would find it more concerning if an asshole thought you were his soulmate. I would wonder what part of his sorry existence he sees in you.

"It's not that I think she'll think it's normal for her parents to be staying in the same house, obviously she knows they don't live together and that dad lives with you - it's the potential to innocently manipulate. 

""All I have to do is ask and my daddy will come stay with me and mom as a family at grandmas house!"" 

She's at that age where the manipulation is real if a co-parenting father lets his guilt guide him to accommodating every whim of their child, instead of being able to say ""well sweetie, we can't do that, but how about I fly in for a few days to go to Disneyland with you guys while you're there?"" and helping her understand that she'll have to be okay with realistic compromise, because the world is bigger than just her.

""Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together and she couldn’t do anything. 'Are you feeling all right?' I asked her. 'I feel all sleepy,' she said. In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.""

"It sounds like this guy is not the one for you. You're 27 and have so many years ahead of you to fill with doing things you will enjoy with people who'll make you happy. Don't spend another decade in this unhappy situation.

"You're not being forced to move as punishment for them not believing you. You're being offered better options far away from those awful people so you will stay, which tells me that they do believe you.

"Leave.

Look, you know you are too vulnerable to the users so you need to protect yourself by staying away from predators.  This is a volunteer position not a job.  Go volunteer with cute kids or animals until you get your boundaries fixed."

Your boyfriend is abusive. Full stop. Nothing about this relationship seems worth it. Just end things and move on. Your boyfriend will deal like any other person who's been broken up with.
"So, start documenting the cigarette butts on your balcony. Set up a camera directed at your skylight - even if it's diffused, it'll show that there are people up there. 

Record everything you can. Documentation is your best friend. 

Can you ask your landlord to put up a camera on your roof? Can you put a camera up? I feel like that's pretty much bulletproof evidence. "
"I'll try to do this without laughing

"Your husband isn't helping you. He's being cruel, and I have a hard time buying that he doesn't know *exactly* what he's doing when he terrifies you and then asks what he can do to make you feel better.

"I like this idea a lot.  The first one sounds like an excellent way to PTSD myself by shooting my husband.

"&gt;Guy is putting me through an emotional roller coaster by refusing to actually stay gone and stick to his word that he never wants to talk to me again.

Guess what: It is YOUR job, not his, to make sure he stays gone. Block his number, cut contact on all social media, etc, and get on with your life. 

&gt;How should I approach things if he comes back again?

If you arrange your phone and social media properly, he won't be able to come back. 

If he, I dunno, writes you a paper letter or shows up on your doorstep: Do not respond in any way. Total no contact. 

You can choose to make healthy decisions for yourself or you can choose to keep allowing yourself to be treated poorly and yanked around forever. 

Totally your call. "

"Yeah, she's probably upset because she's either assuming you're self harming or someone else is harming you. Just tell her the truth and admit that it was stupid, and never do it again. It's not worth lying over something like this. "
"I think a lot of people have a tendency to freeze when confronted with a situation so far outside the bounds of reasonable human behavior. It's so far beyond the pale, I'm sure a part of your brain was going ""If I just act like everything's normal, it will go back to being normal.""

"You are only in love with them because they are safe and due to their commitment to each other, they cannot hurt you.

I know this because you claim to love them, but you do not even bother to separate them into individual human beings in your op. 

We know nothing about these people that would reflect why it is you are in love with each of them. Think about it. Are you? Or do you admire them and envy their relationship with each other? 

If this infatuation is more about admiring the relationship they have with each other, then consider what it is you admire and look to implement that in your own future relationships.

If I'm totally wrong and your infatuation is with the individual people, break off your friendship for all of your sakes as it is not healthy for their relationship or your psyche.

Edit - a word"
How she bought this one is beyond me.
"If you are adamant about not wanting a kid, and he is adamant about wanting one, you really only have 2 options.  Either you divorce so he can seek someone to have a kid with or you go to couples counselling to see if you can find some common ground here.

I recommend you try the counselling first, but this isn't a deal breaker, it's THE deal breaker.  "
"I actually had a very similar scenario happen to me where I was absolutely SURE that some supernatural monster was real in my hallway. I just heard random growling near my door and a girl crying and yelling, I just laid in my bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking ""the horror movies were right, demons exist"".

It turned out I left my door open, and the neighbors dog came in and was at my bedroom door growling. The crying I heard was my neighbor in my hallway, crying for her dog back because the door shut behind when the dog came in. 

Anyways, I know the feeling of absolute terror in that situation. Don't feel bad. I had a million horrifying thoughts run through my head, it felt like a nightmare. "
"To build off of this, if your BF can afford it, look into a very cheap apartment he can rent for her."
"Get used to it. The more people you reach and like you, you also expose yourself to more people who won't like you."
"Surely you mean ""she gave your dad money to pass on to you, to keep you from calling the police to report the very serious and easily proven crime she committed"" ? ;)"
"I think you need to call him out on it, tactfully. Sit him down, tell him the message you received and give him a chance to come clean with all the details of the lie: who did he tell, why he did it and then come up with a plan of action. First and foremost, he needs to go around one by one to the people he lied to and come clean and apologize. Then he needs to get into therapy again to work on his need for attention and sympathy and his compulsion to lie."
"My parents were overprotective of me for a very, very long time, and one of them still is. It isolated me socially and eventually made me socially anxious (I'd worry about getting in trouble if I left the house or met with friends, and this ended up making me generally hesitant to go anywhere—this has remained in my life even now and is barely getting better after some therapy). 


You need help. Your wife needs help. You're trying to save your kids, but you're only doing them harm in the long run—not to mention that you're destroying your relationship with them because they'll just go behind your back for everything. It's rather unlikely that something will go wrong when you let your daughter go out and have fun, like every other child, but it's pretty much guaranteed that you'll damage her mental well-being and your relationship with her by trying to protect her from that unlikely danger. "
"This is one of the biggest automatic deal breakers for reasonable people, whether they want children or not. It's a fundamental incompatibility. Whether it's a ""phase"" or not, none of us know, *her included.* Only time will tell.

You're perfectly justified in breaking up with her over this."
"&gt;It sounds like he's always been cold and distant from OP with no honeymoon period.

That's because he got with her for the baby. That's it. It's very clear to me? She was a one night stand/hookup. He did not care about her beyond that. He wanted to be with his kid, thus he married her. like in the ""good old days."" At least on his end, it's very clear to me that this marriage is for the kid, nothing else. It sounds like he moved out there and in with her barely knowing her."
"&gt; I'm now pushing him to be more outgoing

I don't know if that's a good idea...

&gt;His sister has told me I need to be more feminist 

She can butt out. Has she been telling your SO that he's too masculine? Her critique is irrelevant.

Honestly it sounds like his family picks on him and maybe even scapegoated him. 

&gt;One thing he's always said he loves about me is that I allow him to be himself.

This is pretty telling. It implies that other people he loves do not allow him to be himself. I think that's what you're seeing."
"&gt;Well here is where I fucked up. I told my wife that my parents come from a culture where dogs are RARELY kept as pets and only as working/guard animals, so having a party for one is seen as strange and unhinged.

Yeah, I don't have that background -- dogs are very much loved pets in the US -- and I think having a birthday party for a dog is absurd!

I would have the same reaction your mom did when she laughed. You're wife needs a reality check. She had a very unusual request. I don't see how your mom did anything wrong. Wife was being to sensitive by demanding an apology."
"&gt; My SO doesn't want anyone at the wedding that neither of us has met.

This is perfectly reasonable.  Your sister is being super entitled.

Do you REALLY want some random in your intimate wedding photos she will probably break up with within a month or two?

Do you really want him sitting on the head table with you?  Where else could he sit?

&gt;  I want to find a compromise.

Why should there be a compromise? It's you and your SO's wedding, not your fricking sisters.  Just say no and make sure bouncers are there to eject him if he turns up"
No written proof unfortunately. I think you're right about telling my boss even though I didn't want to bring any of this into work.
"That and NYC now looks VERY different...it might be hard to picture OP's childhood on a street lined with shiny new luxury condos. (Every time I visited friends where my mom used to live in Manhattan it's kinda mind blowing that it's the same place as in her stories...)

But the weird thing is, anyone over 40 would remember the city in the news, right? If they're having these conversations in front of friends his age, they're nodding along and not questioning him, right? Does she think she's the only one who sees through his bs and everyone else is fooled, or what?"

"When you worry, you borrow trouble from tomorrow, but start paying interest on it *today*.

He picked *you*.  Despite your perceptions of yourself as being below average, this guy you perceive as being super-amazing picked *you*.  Don't second guess his reasons for doing so.  It's clear that he sees something in you that you do not see in yourself.

Look for what that is; I would guess that you're a lot more special than you realize."

"&gt; and after much retrospection I came to realize that my ex exhibited all the trademark signs of borderline personality disorder.

don't play armchair psychiatrist.  attaching a personality disorder to your ex isn't going to help anything.  But you should seek out help, yes. It sounds like the first therapists you tried weren't helpful; you may have to shop around, as it were, to find one that fits you.  But don't lead with ""I think my ex-girlfriend from 3 years ago had BPD""... just focus on you."
Has he ever thrown out something of value to him and only him?
"This, your kids need  your support, financial and otherwise. I believe you when you say your ex always has plans when it's your time to see them, but in that case, why didn't you fight back? Why didn't you insist and demand that you get your time with your children as you are entitled? Can you see how this behavior might make you look like you have abandoned them? Ok, your ex is difficult, I get that, but what effort can you honestly say you have made to keep a close, affectionate relationship with your kids? Even now it doesn't occur to you that their bitterness may have more to do with the fact that you've been absent than the amount of money they get from you. You sound so fixated with how your ex is useless and her spending habits, but what about *them*? What is *their* role in your life, and yours in theirs?

Yeah, this isn't your ex being manipulative. This is your kids feeling abandoned. For all you know, they harbor similar feelings for their mother as well, seeing that she's this irresponsible. "
"Just leave it alone. Focus on keeping your own nose clean and don't worry what other people are doing. It's the professor's job to prevent cheating, not yours. 

The ONLY reason you should feel obliged to report this is if it were a high-level class in a medical, engineering, or a related field where people could die if someone fucks up. 

A gen ed course at a community college? It's not worth it."
"Support your wife, FFS. This is a no-brainer.

Your parents are 100% not allowed in. It's a stressful, lengthy, dreadful ordeal to give birth. Who the hell wants to be naked, crying, vomiting, pooping, and peeing with their legs up in stirrups **in front of their in-laws who have frequently been rude to them???**

You alluded to your parents ""not being nice"" in the beginning, and honestly the way you write this post really downplays your wife's feelings and focuses on your parents. You need to stop that. Your wife (and child) are supposed to be your priorities at this point in your life, **not** your parents. Even if your parents were the nicest people on earth with an amazing relationship with your wife *that would still not give them the right to be present if she doesn't want them there.*

Stop putting these decisions on your wife and only your wife. No wonder your parents aren't friendly to her. Any boundaries that your wife establishes are also your boundaries. There is no ""she says"" it is ""we say."" DON'T say ""she doesn't want you there."" SAY ""**WE** are choosing to only have XYZ present at the birth."""
"You've only dated this guy for 2 months and he's already making you feel insecure about your body?? 

I can only imagine that it would get worse from now on if you stay longer.

You mentioned he is a nice person?

Many times narcissistic/abusive people can seem like the best people on Earth to those they do not target. So be careful with his smiles and friendliness. "
"It's hard to get these guys to see reason. I'm currently divorcing my husband who just turned 65, because he's been giving thousands of dollars to a 26 year old stripper who lives in the Bahamas, and he's running up his credit cards in the process. I snooped in his texts, and it's just like your brother. My ex pours out his hopes and dreams, and she's like ""Baby, can you send me $300? Love u"". Yeah, sure. 

I suspect that he's going to move her into his place, and then he's never going to get rid of her. My last piece of advice was ""Dude, get a vasectomy"". "
"Nice catch.  /u/kakelgrgy, I was going to suggest that you have more of a confidence problem than attractiveness problem.  Perhaps some therapy is in order."
"I think you fucked up on this one. Sure, he kept persisting but that is not something anyone you truly love wants or needs to hear. To hear you say that such a shitty and abusive ex of yours is better than him in ANY way is a gut wrenching and heartbreaking bullet to the chest. 


You told him he's better than your ex in every way EXCEPT the sex. Even though it is the truth, it's such a shitty thing to say. He should be better than him in every way because an ex is an ex for a reason.


""I'm better than him in every way except at sex? Wow. Sorry I can't satisfy you like he did."" Is what he's thinking. It's a normal way to react to something like that. Most people wouldn't be happy if their SO tells them something like that. Would you be okay if he told you his abusive crazy ex fucked better than you? Was a better fuck than you?

He is not acting ""immature"", he is extremely hurt, and you need to forget about everything else and focus on his feelings first. This might be unrepairable but it can't hurt to try fixing. "

Call a professional exterminator. I'm not even afraid of stink bugs but I still hate them.
"&gt; I felt sooo right about this, for sooo long, and when it hit me that I am being abusive, I was crushed. 

Begging your partner not to lie to you and engage in destructive behavior when they have a history of doing so is not abuse. I don't know what he said to convince you that up is down and day is night, but if you're increasingly convinced that *you* are the problem when *he* is the one lying, disappearing, and disrespecting you, it is past time to run.

"&gt; Many perfectly healthy adults watch paid porn without their SO present

That is completely different from sexual interaction online with a live person and acting shady and denying it when your partner comes in from work.

"My sister asked my college BF, who wanted to marry me, what exactly he DID for me. He said he sometimes didn't smoke pot in my apartment because I asked him not to.

Education =/= intelligence . 
A fully staffed commercial kitchen at dinner rush is more like an old timey factory or forge than a home kitchen. If you don't have a specific job you just don't go in. Some places don't even want their servers going to certain areas of the kitchen during dinner rush. Maybe OP's place isn't that intense but still. 
"You should tell Sam.  Don't lie to her when she asks if you had fun. 

The wedding may be perfect, but her groom is cheating and dragging you into it.  Your family 
feelings aren't as important as saving her from marrying who is unsure and cheating."
"So if I'm reading this right, you want her to stay in a relationship with you for a full year knowing that it has an expiration date if she can't get a visa. You also want her to enter into a fake marriage to get a visa, something that would have *serious* consequences for her if it's found out.

Do you want to be with her? What are you willing to do to make that happen? Because from how it reads, you want her to be with you at your convenience and aren't trying to do anything to help her. 

I'm also concerned with how often you say the legal system favors ""females."" If you're concerned about your assets you can get a pre-nup.

That being said, you shouldn't enter into anything you don't want to, but if you want to stay with your girlfriend you need to find other ways to help her secure her visa. Can she find work with another company that will grant her a visa? Are you willing to move to be with her? Are you going to enter into a long distance relationship if she has to move? You need to figure these things out before you string her along for a year."
"For your own privacy, perhaps look into things like frosted stickers for on windows. You can cut those to size and they still allow light in, while somewhat protecting you from peeping toms. Home improvement stores usually sell them and they are pretty cheap and come in cute patterns.

As for Carla, do let her call the cops on you and then explain her problem. You have covering so they need to make an effort and are doing that. Perhaps post in /legaladvice to get specific info for your location and if it's something you could make a report about yourself."
Don't get a house with him yet until this is resolved and you're married. It's just a bad idea financially.

"I had a friend go through a similar situation not too long ago. The biological sister knew about my friend from the father's perspective. It was a tale of the ""evil"" first wife keeping his oldest from him and that poor child never knew their ""real"" siblings. The bio-sister had this whole Lifetime movie idea that Friend was desperately needing family and their daddy.

From Friend's perspective bio-dad had left to move to the other side of the country, life was still good, and they had a great family unit that was loving and supportive. Bio-dad's other family was just a 'thing' that existed but not important.

Friend had to be very firm when a bio-sister reached out. They were very clear, and did feel bad about being kinda harsh. Friend had to speak clearly that they appreciated the contact but wasn't particularly interested in being involved or getting to any closer. Friend told bio-sister that they would keep them appraised of any health issues and asked the same of them, but wasn't going to decline, nor invite, any visits."
"in your words, say F it.. and move on. "
"&gt; Her first time wasn't exactly her choice. Her boyfriend at the time just decided it was time.

JFC, OP. Your girlfriend had never had consensual sex. She was raped. Are you unable to understand the difference? 

She's got emotional and physical issues, and you're clearly not the man for her. Please break up with her so can work through them at her own pace.

Eta: She told you she wanted to wait till marriage. Rather than respecting her wishes, you pressured her and ""convinced"" her to give in. She clearly didn't enjoy it and put a stop to things. You pressured her more, became resentful, she told you it was painful, you actually fought with her until she went to see a doctor.

Now *she's* cutting contact with *you*. She's stopped going out with you and your friends. Her mother doesn't invite you over any more. Get the hint. She's breaking up with you. You have not been kind or respectful to her. You've been, frankly, a massive jerk.

Next time a woman tells you she doesn't want to have sex, tell her it was nice meeting her but you two are incompatible and you'll be moving on."

"Okay, first of all, your teacher is a moron if he or she doesn't know that people are sharing info and looking up the answers during this intermission.  I don't even see it necessarily as ""cheating,"" since it's so obvious that is what's going to happen.  Yes, it's unfair that some people are getting better grades, even though they haven't worked as hard, but that should be the teacher's responsibility to correct.  

I would write the teacher (or maybe the principal) an anonymous note telling them what's going on.  No names, but just that these two-day tests are leading to a lot of ""cheating"" and you think it's unfair for those who are actually trying to learn the material.  "
"Adopting you wasn't something you tricked or coerced them into doing. They wanted a child, they adopted a child - and they knew going in (probably even moreso than parents who get their kids the old-fashioned way) that it was going to be expensive. The cost of raising you is not something they get to hold over your head, now or ever. 

Feeling grateful to your parents is one thing; feeling a lifelong debt that can never truly be paid off is something else entirely. 

If they want to know where you've been driving, they can ask. And in a kind, thoughtful 'How was your day' kind of way, not 'and now is the hour of the interrogation' kind of way. "

"You don't work anywhere near 50 hours a week. You live in a home with two adults and zero children. It's been seven years. If your issues are deeper than grieving, you need to get more medical help and get on disability. "

"I have casual acquaintances I haven't spoken to in decades. If one contacted me to announce a pregnancy, I might question why to myself, but the only thing I would actually communicate is an enthusiastic congratulations.

"Honestly, this is a great post. Especially when you bring up stuff like this:

&gt;I got the same vibes off this post that I get off my own mother still sometimes - that I'm a cute dress-up prop in her life.

This is a real concern and a *real relationship killer.* It's largely why my relationship with my parents is strained.

OP: If you're seeing this, be aware that you're pushing your children away from you."
Agreed.  There's zero incentive for him to change.  He's got a cook/maid he gets to use as an emotional punching bag.  He knows he's got op too scared of him to stand up for herself.
"If he's behaving like this, frankly, I wouldn't bother keeping in regular contact while you're gone. He's already decided what this trip is all about, and no amount of facts or reality is going to change his mind. Go fix the broken thing, see the sights, enjoy the professional boost and being in a new place. Don't worry about Cody, because there's nothing you can do to fix this.

Let him stew in his bile for a couple of weeks. Either he's going to pull his head out of his butt and be apologetic when you get home, or you'll break up. Either way, your life is going to improve."
"That doesn't change the fact that when you take your newborn out in public, you run the risk of exposing them to people whose vaccination status you can't control or even know. So if your baby truly can't be around unvaccinated people, you should probably find a way to keep her at home as much as possible until her risk is reduced and/or she can safely be vaccinated. Your mother touching her in public *is* disrespectful of your wishes, and understandably frustrating, but she doesn't pose a unique risk and is this isn't even remotely abuse. "
"I don't have BPD but I am diagnosed bipolar type II. While I don't agree with your wife Op I do understand her concern. While you BPD doesn't sound terrible how badly each person gets it can vary (my grandmother and one of my cousins for example have bipolar quite severely while I am on the more mild side.) She may not want your child to have to go through the rigors of trying to find the right balance of medication. (Not to mention that heavily medicating a child can alter brain chemistry) or she may be afraid that they'll be ostracized or that, if they're own theoretical BPD is terrible that they'll need to live in a group home. It may even be possible that while you see yourself as stable the more she lives with you the more she sees things that she'd fear your child inheriting.

I know several people who've taken themselves out of the future gene pool for exactly these reasons. Not saying of course that you need to follow their example, just demonstrating that it isn't an unheard of choice.

Again, I think the way she told you was shitty. It should have been talked about before marriage but I guess it's possible that she's been doing more research lately as the time to have a child draws nearer. 

Either way I'm sorry."
"Yeah, I came into this expecting ""boyfriend is upset about my unpredictable schedule frequently cutting into our time together,"" at which point I would have advised OP that it's okay for her bf to be upset at the situation as long as he doesn't take it out on her/recognizes that they're in it together.

But what we got was ""jealous and insecure boyfriend will never be supportive of his girlfriend's career, so unless gf wants to deal with this controlling bs all the time she should just probably walk."" Hate it when that happens."
"Yes. As I was reading the post, I thought of my great aunt. She helped put her husband through lawyer school. They had a kid. He finished, and she was looking forward to things being better and slowing down. Husband showed up with divorce papers, and she was so upset she signed then and there. He only had to pay 50 bucks a month for child support. His son, my cousin, spent most of his life yearning for his daddy,s love. Never got it.

My great aunt is remarried with a good life, at least. All this happened 40 plus years ago."
"&gt;Was I in the wrong here? How do I approach talking about the situation?

This is a pretty common boundary in monogamous relationships, you're definitely not in the wrong here man.

Especially since she asked you about it, it sounds like she was really hoping you'd say ""yes"". She wanted to sleep in the guy's bed without feeling guilty about it, and when she didn't get the answer she wanted she fought you on it. Gotta wonder why she wanted it so bad? Had to have been a pretty uncomfortable couch, or..."
"That's so incredibly disrespectful of him, and he seems to mean it since he's said it multiple times and defends it.  

He has literally told you that he is with you because you're young, hot, a sorority girl, and the type of girl who wouldn't date him unless he was a rich doctor.  He is dating you because he can show you off as a young sex symbol he can parade around.  It's revolting and incredibly sexist.

What do you think will happen when you finish college and aren't a sorority girl?  What will happen when you get older and don't look as young?  What would happen if you had an accident that disfigured you, or you gained weight, or somehow else lost your looks?  He would leave you for a newer, younger, more attractive trophy wife.

If you have any self respect, you will leave him.  He's keeping his ex on the back burner in case he decides she's a better option.  He doesn't see you as an equal partner, just as a pretty young thing to flaunt around that points to his wealth and status.  He is disgusting."

They aren't themselves, but another group that the founder of Operation Werewolf founded is Wolves of Vinland, which SPLC designated as a hate group after one of their members burned down an African-American church.

Incidentally, ""Operation Werewolf"" shares the name of the Nazi plan to establish resistance groups in Allied territory. I'm not sure that's exactly a coincidence... 

I dunno. At best you can say he's in an fitness group founded by white nationalists and dedicated to cosplaying as Norsemen. That alone makes me want to back far away from it... YMMV. "
"I'm still not clear on how you got here.  

Is she really hot and made a lot of money and that's why you were okay with her?  Because even if I didn't see someone like you're describing all that often, I'd know I wasn't really that into them, and wouldn't marry them."

Of COURSE you were terrified, you're 17 and thought you were in a horror movie! And the glass breaking noise! What did he expect?!

I think your parents will realize this, and your brother better fucking back you up on it. Once they calm down, you should try and have a reasonable discussion with them. "
Honestly she might have jumped into another relationship too soon. It sounds to me like she has some emotional baggage from the last one. Agreed with the comment about taking it slow. 
"&gt; he started asking me if I had read/finished such and such book. If I hadn't she'd immediately tell me the ending, no matter how often I asked her not to.

She sounds awful, but I have to admit this made me really laugh. That is one of the most wholesome ways to be shitty to someone I think I've ever heard. Book spoiling! Lol."

"It's the same in my state (Im in the US). It's considered a felony, I believe. I was too shocked last night to fully realize the gravity of the situation, but I appreciate your response. I need to remember this. Mentally healthy people don't choke their SO even in jest. "

"All other things aside, ""completely nude"" implies that the hunted will not even be wearing eye protection.  If that's the case, then this isn't a ""fetish"" concern, this is absolutely a personal-safety concern.

Getting hit, even on sensitive areas, with a paintball is only likely to cause pain (possibly pretty severe; I've been hit in the crotch when I was foolhardy enough to play paintball without a cup), but is unlikely to cause permanent damage.

Getting hit in the eye, though: that's a *very* likely possibility of blindness.

Please tell me that ""nude"" doesn't mean ""not even eye protection""."
"In my humble opinion, you are treated pretty unfairly. You are made to blame for your sister's fuck up. What exactly were you supposed to do as a sixteen year old *child*, get out there and tell everyone you knew that you caught your sister with her side piece? You were put in an awfully hard and, again, unfair position by your sister and you handled it the best way you could as, I repeat, a 16 year old *child*. 

Look, to me you are not to blame. Morals are awesome and all, but in real life, even the strongest moral compass can't always give you clearly cut solutions in dilemmas like the one you faced. I also love how your family thinks they would have stopped her if you'd told them. I am curious, how they would have made her unfuck her side piece and save her marriage. Once that was done, what would they have helped her with? Hide it better? Come clean to the hubby and spin it in a way that would make it somehow look forgivable? Once your sister made the decision to cheat, the damage was done. Nothing you or anyone could have done to stop or reverse it. 

As for your ex, she's being a 18 year old girl, it's all black and white to her with no in between shades. You didn't tell on a cheater, so you must be a cheater yourself. 

This whole thing is just so fucked up, and your sister is also to blame for having put you in this kind of position. It's good that you are standing by her, but she has played a very big role in your falling out with your family. I really don't know what to tell you, hang in there. I hope it blows over between you and your folks at some point. As for your ex, let her go. "

God I really hope OP gets help. This is just wrong and honestly a little creepy. "
"Thank you for being open to it. I have a lot of relatives like your mother and most of the time the best thing you can do for them is allow them to screw themselves into rock bottom. 

Your childhood sounds rough and a lot of abusive/shitty things might be normalized to you. Consider individual counseling to work through that and family counseling with your husband so he can learn how to support you as you learn how to find and enforce healthy boundaries/recognize when you are being taken advantage of.

Keep your daughter's future and well being in mind. She will learn to normalize manipulative/shitty behavior if you repeatedly excuse/accept it in your own life. "
"I kind of can't believe I""m the first to say this: buy a copy of Gavin de Becker's ""The Gift of Fear."" It's a book about stalking, and it is good (I had a stalker before myself). Trust your gut.

Good luck. "

Another person with depression and anxiety checking in. Even at my worst, they are *loved.* I may not be able to feed myself or shower. I may spend 90% of my time on the couch. But those dogs are fed on scheduled, bathed, scratched, brushed, cuddled, and played with. Walks may go down from daily to a couple of times a week, but it still happens often enough that they're okay.

I read a lot of posts on here where people are upset about something concerning their SO. That's why this space exists. But rarely have I read one so condescending and lacking in respect. Maybe you should try naming your emotions about your husband better.
"Wtf. Your brother is a fucking asshole. And your parents are assholes too.

This will blow over. They are probably in shock and are looking for someone to blame. I would write a letter to them so you can get your point across without interruption. 

Lay out exactly what happened from your point of view. Explain that you acted in what you though was self defense in a moment of sheer panic. Make sure that you're clear that had you known it was your brother playing a truly tasteless and idiotic prank on you you wouldn't have ever hurt him. But you DID NOT know that. What do they expect from you? For you not to defend yourself when you believe your life is in jeopardy? Yes you're sorry he was hurt. But this wasn't your fault. He's a fucking idiot and he honestly deserves what happened to him. He learned a lesson. Don't fuck with you. 

Okay don't say that last bit but you get my drift. Make it very clear that you would never knowingly harm your own brother, especially not with a knife, especially not so seriously, because you love your brother and you would have never ever imagined he would put you in this position. How should you have known it was him? Explain all the lengths he went to scare you. 

They might be pissed for awhile. Stay at your friends house. If your parents are normal functioning sane adults they will eventually realize that their son is a fucking idiot and their daughter was only defending herself against what she though was a violent attacker. 

Good luck. Seriously. This one really gets me. I cannot believe your parents are defending him. Maybe cry some crocodile tears for their sake. "

"u/cman_yall I am thinking that, too. She might have read something online or has been talking to someone who thinks that it is a bad idea. I'd be asking her where she got the idea, how long she has felt this way etc. Going in there and getting angry immediately isn't productive and in her eyes might prove her ""point"" about him having ""outbursts""."

"&gt;3) not respecting the time/cost/talent to make an elaborate cake

I think a lot of folks who produce art of any kind can sympathize. There are _so_ many randos out there who think they can just put in any order and receive 1 art on demand. 

A few years back I painted a huge oil portrait of my late grandfather for my mother's family. It took 7 months to paint and SO much work. I still remember the day I posted it on social media-- so many messages like ""lol 1 painting for me too but not too big how's $100?"" or ""can u paint me one but of my dogs and my tv and my favorite beanbag?"" 

Granted online messages are easy to ignore but if someone confronted me in real life with such an inane request AND was pushy about it then I'd definitely laugh in their face."

"It's so bizarre to see the tally suggestion pulled up to show how LITTLE people game compared to spending time with their SOs!

Honestly OP, I came here expecting another thread from someone saying 'my partner says I game too much and sure I do five hours every night and a ton on weekends but...' It sounds like you have a good balance and do plenty to spend time with your girlfriend. I hope a tally that includes her own private time will help out. 

Do you ever invite her to play with you (or could maybe find a game you could enjoy winding down and playing with her)? If you live together, it could be that she feels left out and maybe the transition to your private time is a bit cold. My BF and I are both gamers and have a nice dynamic where we're quite happy to say, watch the other play Fallout 4 for freaking ages as long as we have our phone or a laptop maybe with another game running. Or we'll be on computers and BF will pickup a game I don't super enjoy (but have and could play) unless I ask to play a game specifically (and I'm usually pretty safe in knowing he'll switch cos it's a game he enjoys too) or one of our friends suggests we all play a game I do like. It's still wind down time even being together just because the activity itself is relaxing, not so much the being away from each other (cos hell we're away from each other about 8 hours every weekday). So finding a game that works for both of you might be great... I am not super up on what games are on Xbox, but Portal 2's Co-op has been one of my favourites to play through with my BF. If GF feels like she COULD be involved in the game if she wanted to be (same as she tries to involve you in her baking recipes - honest to god I subject my BF to Great British Bake Off once a week and he watches it with me and gets involved in yelling at the screen with me even though I know it's not his thing - it's super nice he makes an effort to be interested anyway), it might help her a bit? Honestly though - I think you're doing well and GF needs a perspective check.

"You've been together for FIVE YEARS. If you can't commit to her, let her go. If you do want to commit for life, get a prenup and get married already!"
"If he were with a 27 year old woman, she would not put up with this for an instant.  His ass would be on the curb.

Also, he took not wanting to introduce you to his mother as an opportunity to slight you.  Focusing on your studies at 18 is a perfectly acceptable, even admirable, place to be.  He is simply concerned that his mother will call him out for taking advantage of someone younger than him.

Take a break from this.  Take a month or two off to find your feet and focus on school.  Then try to revisit it from a more logical place.

You have lots of time and love ahead of you."
"OK, I think that in this case, it is OK if you don't tell your mom that you've been lying about the aux port, and just tell her that ""the damages have recently got worse"", because that seems to be exactly what has happened.

"I think he probably did this expecting it to be the end of the friendship. For him, this is sort of a way for him to feel like he pushed you away, rather than you choosing someone else.

By doing something he knows is wrong, he gets to feel in control of a situation that otherwise makes him feel helpless.

Just go NC, as far as he is concerned your friendship is over now. Let it be and have a great time for the rest of your life with what sounds like a very patient husband for not reacting at the time."
"At least you recognize that your feelings are foolish! A little self-administered CBT in the moment will do wonders. When you start to feel jealous, remind yourself that it was over a decade ago, he wasn't interested in her, and he married *you* not anyone else. Then turn your mind back to your TPS reports.

Another strategy is to acknowledge the feelings, but ignore them. When you start to feel jealous, tell yourself, ""Huh, looks like I'm feeling jealous right now."" And then get back to your TPS reports.

When you see her, smile, and give her the same casual greeting you would give any other co-worker. ""Hey, Co-worker, what's up? Glad to hear it. I'm going to get back to my TPS reports. See you around!""

With time, and by addressing your emotions, the feelings of jealousy will fade. It does take time, though, and they might crop up at odd times when you thought you were over them. Just keep using the same strategies.

Good luck!"
"It really wasn't your mother's place to butt into your marriage. If you have issues with your husband, it's up to you to figure it out with him. Personally, I think it's really unfair to your SO to go to your mom with all of your issues about your husband. It ends up with your husband always being a bad guy in your mom's eyes. 

You need to figure out things with your husband and stop going to your mom with all your marital problems. If you are so bothered with your husband being so lazy, then talk to your husband and figure it out with him. Seriously. Stop going to people close in your life with issues in your marriage. You've been planting the seeds for this to happen for years and I'm surprised that it hasn't come to a head sooner. 

Married couples can have disagreements within themselves, but it's always best to appear to the world as a united front. That way you don't end up in the middle of fights between your SO and the other people in your life."
Yup. She isn't your friend. Friends own up to their fuckups and try to make it right. If I were OP I would end the friendship and then take her to small claims court over the cost of replacing her phone.
"You offered him money to help put his dog in a better kennel, I say you did what you could to a rational degree. Apartments can be ruthless about violating pet rules, I don't blame you for not wanting to risk your place. It is grief that's causing him to lash out like this, and he might want to look into counseling for it, but if you don't want to continue to put up with it I don't think anyone would blame you for wanting to move on - but you might want to talk to your boss about the situation to get ahead of any story he might come up with, though."
"As someone who also experienced significant parental dishonesty/manipulation, I just want to say I'm sorry and that it gets better.

In a sense, you're grieving right now: you've lost the dad you thought you had, and you're coming to terms with the one you actually have. A child shouldn't have to be in this position... but here you are.

I'm sure it hurts right now, but I think eventually you'll be grateful for the lesson. I know I was, though all I felt initially was betrayal and hurt. That's all part of it.

Take the necessary steps to protect yourself and your life (as you already are it seems), lean on your *true* friends and family, and you'll make it through. Good luck my friend."
"It's true that a really colorful bowtie is not a gift a lot of people would use, but I'm kind of surprised anyone actually said that to OP's face. Whenever I get a weird gift that doesn't suit me I still say thank you and act like I enjoy it. Isn't that common courtesy? It's hard to find the perfect gift for someone, usually there are more misses than hits, but you don't need to tell them that! Then again, maybe it's just a really frank group of friends who are honest about this (but if that was the case, OP should have expected that type of reaction). "
"I kinda like the move OP is thinking of making, next time she asks OP to watch her children OP says 'sure, I'll send you the bill!"""
"Naw, it's your friend who isn't thinking rationally. And any moral person would hand over the personal effects of their grandfather to other family members if they honestly weren't comfortable with having them. Can you imagine how they'd feel if you threw them out? Honestly, I wouldn't have this new friend to your house again. You explained the history behind the objects, but she insulted your home, your family, your values,  and treated things sentimentally precious to you like garbage. I would trust her with neither my emotions nor my belongings. "
"That's fucking beautiful, thank you. I also saw a quote recently that said ""Man searches the world in order to find himself, and then returns home to be that."" These are the sorts of things I need to keep reminding myself, it **IS NOT** a failure. Just another step. I can rebuild. Thank you.."
"This stood out to me, as well. While it would hurt to have a partner decide they want something opposite of you that is a dealbreaker to your relationship, this is *not* the way to handle things!

You can't harass someone into not wanting kids as much as you can't harass someone into wanting them!"
"love does not equal attraction. You can *love* someone, and simply be unable to be attracted to them. Maybe attraction means nothing to you, but it does to OP"
"Same here. My boyfriend went from a creative and driven individual to a lazy and passive child. If I wasn't nagging him to help me with chores, I was cuddling him over some minor issue he felt he couldn't cope with. It felt a lot like being a parent to a child, so when he would try and initiate sex, I found it *really* hard to be enthusiastic. 

When we broke up (after way too long of me swallowing my feelings), he asked why I never told him the truth about my feelings. He said that had he known how seriously his behaviour was affecting my attraction to him, he would change. I pointed out two things: 1) that I *had* told him, I was constantly asking and begging him to help out more around the house, to be more resilient to life, and 2) it was too late. It didn't matter that he was willing to change and become more house-broken. It didn't matter that he was willing to do whatever he needed to do to fix the relationship. *It was too late*, and I wasn't interested in trying anymore. It's too late to water a plant after it's already died. 

OP, don't trap yourself in a marriage where you feel like sex is an obligation you have to suck up. Life is too short for that shit. You don't have to regret getting married at a young age, but I think you should really ask if staying in this marriage, with a man you hate having sex with, is the right choice."
"Uhhhh that sounds like bullshit. The ""fine"" just happened to be nearly the exact amount she got back from the bail (and didn't want to return to you)? She is probably lying about this, just like she originally lied about needing $5K."
"Thank you, that's why I'm quite scared though, I needed someone to reassure me I'm not overreacting "
"I had a very similar experience with my highschool boyfriend. I actually cringed during sex, I hated it so much, because of how passive he was about everything else in his life. It didn't go over well. "
"You are NOT over-reacting, if anything, you're under-reacting. His response is incredibly alarming. If he had apologized, and maybe not realized you were completely out cold, ok, then his behavior while wrong, was maybe at least a little more understandable. But the fact that he KNEW you were sound asleep, and he said, ""you probably wouldn't remember it anyway.."" Uuuhh what!?!?!

 He sexually assaulted you.

His defensive response is because he knew he did something wrong, and when you confronted him, he knew he had been caught."
How often does your grandfather call you? A relationship is a two-way street.
Just curious as to what she does in order for her to justify you doing exactly what she wants instead of what you want?
"Saying ""thank you"" doesn't have to be fake. If I'm genuinely grateful for something someone has done for me, I say ""thank you"". If my husband pours me a cup of coffee in the morning, I say ""thank you"". Not because I feel obligated to, or because he'll be mad if he doesn't hear it, but because I'm grateful. Most people do this, and it is expected of us all. I guarantee you, if you make a habit of not saying ""thank you"" to people, you are coming across as ungrateful. "
"Your father was tormenting your dog to get even with you for being successful at your job when he is unemployed.  Total asshole behavior.  

It may be rude of me to say this to a stranger, but I think that you should never, ever let him in your home again as long as you have that sweet little dog.  I actually hate him for what he did, and I don't even know him.

It's time to ignore him, to stop contact for awhile or permanently.  You would probably benefit from the subreddit r/raisedbynarcissists."
Maybe he's not as fantastic of a communicator as I am!
"This is a matter of respect.  Both women feel disrespected.  You...you need to figure out boundaries and stop triangulation.

Base facts = your wife is out of line.  She asked for a favor and was refused.  When that happens...you say ok and move on.  She didn't.  Throw the cultural part in and your mom's pride in her baking and this turned into a drama.

We all tell people to support their spouse.  But your wife needs to be the bigger person because she needs to learn to hear a no without arguing or taking it personally.  My girlfriend is an amazing baker and has made my kids cakes before.  But if she said no to my incredible kids...I would still say ok and move on.  Because it is a favor."
"&gt;I woke up several times to strange people coming in and out of our hotel room several times.

"I would spell it out to her like that. He will be meeting your entire family, without you, in a stressful formal setting. I mean, that’s likely to put a big strain on a new relationship, that level of pressure. Wouldn’t he rather go do some other activities in the day? Give her a list of fun relaxing things he can do that don’t involve him being mad that she’s put him in this position. "
"I think so as well. Kinda sinister actually. If OP is looking for a more traditional/serious relationship, this guy definitely not the one for her."

"&gt;You should break the relationship off completely. Only consider getting back with him if he offers to cut ties with her of his own volition. You should not even suggest he cut her off, just leave.

I know that this may come off as really snarky, but in order for you to do that though, you would have to have some self-respect. I would never choose my friends over my wife and I have gotten into fights with them when they disrespected her. Perhaps you would be better off finding a man with an actual spine."
"Usually when people post here, I can understand the motivations of the people involved even if they're doing things I personally wouldn't. I can typically see what their reasoning is, even if it's skewed reasoning. 

This? I have no idea what the hell her deal is. Honestly I'd leave if she refused to work this out or address it candidly. "
"Right?? It would have had to have been there for a bit of time for it to start smelling, even in warm weather. Did they not notice only two dogs were coming to eat?? I just don't understand how anyone could be so neglectful as to not notice that one of their giant dogs is ""missing."""
How? HOW? How did neither of them notice that the dog was dead??
If she can't afford to pay off the whole phone ask her if she could pay you a certain amount monthly to help you pay off the phone that she lost. I don't know the circumstances in regards to your friendship but it's not worth losing a friend over.
How long have you been with your boyfriend? It seems pretty intense to move all the way to Cambodia while battling depression and alcoholism. Do you have the support network you need while abroad?
"You said he still lags behind your peers and friends, your words. When you say stuff like ""Now, are you actually angry right now or are you expressing anger because that's safer than expressing that you're hurt etc"" sounds like you're talking to a child. in the beginning you said that marriage material type guys are wealthy country club type men. And that your husband isn't that. Then you proceed to list like 2 of his good qualities plus like 5 of his flaws with an etc attached to the end like you could go on and on about them given half a chance. When he straight up expresses to you that you're acting like a martyr and he doesn't feel good enough for you, you don't seem to look at yourself and wonder if there's something you're doing to make him feel that way. So I don't see good communication or consideration of his feelings. At the very least I see a total lack of self awareness. I don't know how you've managed to convince yourself that you're respectful of him. 

I grew up with people who were country-club-ish and would never in a million years talk about my SO the way you described yours in your post, even though she grew up rough. It's not your job to make someone into the best version of themselves. That is trying to change them. That is controlling. "

"I'm extremely pro marijuana.

&gt; At least I don't believe marijuana can cause such behaviour especially over a sustained period of time 

This is not entirely true. It won't *cause* anything, but marijuana usage, particularly in the late teens and early 20s, can promote symptoms of problems like schizophrenia. 

To repeat - pot absolutely does not **cause** any kind of mental problems like this. It can, however, make the symptoms worse. 

If your brother is starting to develop psychiatric disorders, marijuana usage can definitely make it worse. "
"It's not about OP having a right to the money. It's about the grandfather NOT having a right to expect that he can treat two people very unequally and still retain the affection of the one he treated worse.

"I'm going to give some against the grain advice. The advice you're getting - most some combination of ""you dodged a bullet"" and ""she made her bed, let her lie in it"" - is definitely not wrong. But if I saw my own partner, who I plan to spend the rest of my life with, leave me after her abusive and narcissistic parents gave her a cruel ultimatum, and then start making a string of further destructive decisions, I would not let it go so easily. What I would do, personally, is write her a letter. In the letter, I would say something along the lines of this:

I love you. I miss you. I want you to know that, while I obviously cannot wait for you forever, if, in the next couple of days or weeks, you feel as rotten about this turn of events as I do, I will be happy to get back together, put this all behind us, and resume our engagement, on the condition that you stop or at least extremely limit contact with your parents for at least one year, see a personal therapist, and join me in couples therapy, so that together we can heal our lives and our relationship. [She does not have to give up her parents forever, you are not saying she has to give up her family - you are just insisting that she give herself the space so that her and her therapist can make sure that when she resumes contact with her parents, it is on her own, healthier terms]. Of course, I understand and respect if your decision is final: in that case, I will have to focus on moving on with my life, and limit my contact with you. 

And then, I would follow up. Give her some time, limit your contact with her, let her think. After a few weeks has passed, move on with your life and go no contact (or, of course, if she agrees to get back with you, make sure you both stick with the therapy and limited-parents conditions). 

I could not watch my partner self destruct without at least trying to reach out and help. But you can only extend the offer, show her that her decision does not have to be irrevocable. You cannot make her accept. And if she doesn't accept, then, truly, the rest of the posters on this thread have shown you what you need to do."
"So... you described your symptoms to a medical professional, the professional prescribed a medication, and when you take that medication your symptoms go away. And your SO has a problem with this because...?

Don't sacrifice your physical or mental health on the altar of an SO's untrained, unfounded opinion. If she gets unpleasant about it, that tells you what her priorities are.

Hopefully she can just aceept that she said her piece and move on."
"&gt;  May I ask why?

Because you don't force your believes upon other people, including your kids. It's rude and bad parenting. "
"r/legaladvice

document everything"
Isn't infection the biggest killer after human error in hospitals? I feel like supervisors would like to know that their staff is endangering patients' lives out of sheer laziness.
"I don't see how you're being unforgiving or hypocritical. You did the right thing staying with her and making sure that she would be okay, but now is the time to have a direct conversation. You might need to be harsh with her so she knows you disapprove, because it seems that you've been softening it by saying ""It happens"" and ""I just want you to be careful."" You need to let her know that this is causing you undue frustration and it's unfair that she makes it obligatory for you to take care of her when she gets plastered again and again. Don't just suggest that she not drink as much. Make it an ultimatum that she either limit her drinking, or you walk out on the relationship and she find someone else to take care of her. You're not her babysitter and you're not obligated to be on call."
 I'm glad I'm not the only one who had that thought. I feel like that happens all too often and OP should immediately cut this person out of her life for her own safety. 
No it really isn't. And they're his kids as well as yours.
"She cheated on you twice, saddled you with the bill for her tuition, and then actually had the balls to ask you this? No way, fuck her. I think your response was absolutely reasonable - you don't owe her anything. She can pay the loan in full or she can suck it up and not buy a house for a few more years. "
"Where does she expect her boyfriend to sit? On the table with the bride and groom? That’s way over the line. If she was going to be sitting elsewhere with him, that would be uncomfortable but ok. I wouldn’t have him on top table. Does he know anyone else who will be there?"
Where is she from? This is extremely common in some cultures. 
"If you read r/relationships often enough, you'll see that it is all too common that someone that ""wouldn't do that"" does, in fact, DO that. Withdrawal from these meds is very serious. Please consider at least keeping a backup/emergency supply somewhere he cannot access. "
"If you feel very strongly about not having any children, ever, get a vasectomy now, period.

Because you could date the most liberal pro choice woman on the planet and she could want to keep an accidental pregnancy"
"I mean, I'm happy for/proud of you, if that helps, because it's awesome that you got accepted and have worked so hard. 

Unfortunately, it sounds like your family is more concerned with keeping your mom happy (do you come from a family-centric culture?) than celebrating your accomplishment. "
"Remove all your items and don't leave anything behind.  You said he wasn't worried which means he knows who's doing this or is doing this himself. 

How is the relationship otherwise? Is this a weird way to trigger a break up?"
Get away from this person. He's just using money as a means to control you. You are better off on your own.
"&gt; I mean I didn't say the words ""I promise""

These words are the least important part of a promise"
"I was a server for ages and I always entered people's orders for tables or parties under seat #'s so if they wanted to do separate checks, or pair up for payment, they could. I could put different seats together at the end. Does your system not allow you to do that?"
"Holy shit, this exactly. I even have said to her ""Dude, are you collecting this stuff like baseball cards?!"" She has unopened packages in her drawers!"
"You know this isn't healthy, right? I know others have commented on the fact that you two have really poor communication. Sex should never be used as a reward/punishment mechanism. Did she enjoy sex with you in the past, before the baby? Did you have a happy and mutually satisfactory sex life?"
Please listen to this OP!! Your boyfriend is being such an immature creep about this whole situation. I would ditch him so fast.

"&gt; an extended stay hotel may be a good option.

Contrary to expectations, those are NOT CHEAP and can easily cost as much as rent at an apartment with considerably lower quality accommodations. Just fyi. The lack of a lease or commitment could be good, though, I suppose. "
"What I get from your post is low self esteem and a tendency to attribute your entire being to things or people beyond your control. It sounds like you need to re-script your life narrative. You're putting Alex on a pedestal, but you are the one who chose to see those things in him that ended up helping you. And you are the one that went out and improved your life. 

And you attributing everything positive in your life to him is just not healthy at all and it seems to be impacting your self esteem even now. If you knew that all of the good things you did for yourself were under your own control, you'd know that you deserve a good and happy life, to love yourself, and to have someone else love you. You are awesome and you will meet someone equally as awesome that will treat you how you deserve to be treated. Forget Alex!!"
"She is invalidating your health concerns so she can.continue in a.living situation that she engineered in the first place. She wasn't irresponsible about getting a new place; she did this deliberately in otder to spinge off you. 

You don't matter to her. Your health doesnt matter to her. Her wants matter to her. Let that sink in.  

Furthermore, if you rent, you may be violating your lease by having pets and by letting an unauthorized person stay for more than 5 days. Check your lease. You may be putting yourself at risk for eviction. 

She is a grown adult. If she cant afford her life, or if her pets make it impossible to find a place, or if her means of living isn't adequatebto support herself, or if she has ienated everybody emse in her mife and still not learned her lesson, *none of that is your fault or your problem*.  These are the result of choices she has made. 

Know what is your problem? You and your wellbeing. 

Step One is you ask her to leave. If she says she can't afford it, you answer that nonetheless, you are breaking up with her and you are asking her to leave. 

She will probably makenup a million excuses and refuse. Therefore you may have to legally evict her. . You need to do a search on *landlord tenant laws* &lt;your state&gt;. 
First, find out how tenancy is established. It is often established once a person has lived in a place for a certain amount of time or is receiving mail there. You could talk to the police about that. 

If she has lived there long enough to have establish tenancy, you probably have to give her 30 days written notice to leave. Make sure it is signed and dated. When the time period is up, you go to the courthouse and figure out what to file. You will get a hearing and the judge will give you a final move out date. 

Edited to add: before giving the notice, get renter's insurance. Take pictures of your stuff and the interior of the apartment and send them to your insurance company. Then remove all valuables and put them into safekeeping. If she damages the apartment or your stuff in any way, take pictures of that and show the before and after pictures to the police. 

As you can see, this will take awhile, so you had better start the clock ticking now.

"This sounds like a great time to get into marriage counseling. There are a lot of stressful things going on for both of you, and the relationship got committed very quickly, so there's a lot to sort out.

At the very least, you have a fundamental love language that's lacking in your relationship. Him not being affectionate might be anything from past trauma to a neurological issue to simply believing it's only necessary for foreplay. Getting to the bottom of it will help you know where you stand and whether this can be resolved at all."
"I've been in your girlfriend's position before, in terms of being with a guy who was in the process of ""developing"" his feelings for me. Let me tell you, your girlfriend can sense your hesitation, your misgivings about her, and your inconsistent attraction (or lack thereof) to her, and that's not fair to her if you're trying to encourage confidence in someone. My situation made me second guess everything about myself, and after I smartened up and left my own shitty situation, it took a long time to undo the damage of that relationship. Let your girlfriend go so she can be happy on her own or be with a guy who finds her flaws lovable and attractive. You're hurting her more than you're helping, OP. "
"Your boyfriend probably assumes that working things out when he cheated would have been faster and smoother if your friend hadn't been with you and supporting you. He resents her for exposing more of his cheating.

He won't ever like her because of the past history. He is definitely wrong in treating you with silent treatment. "
"I don't think you're being unreasonable, but I could also fully understand you looking past it and forgiving. It just seems like a messy situation.

Your girlfriend may want to work on having enough sense to not get blackout drunk with coworkers though. 

Edit: I'd like to point out that it's nice that her coworkers seem to have your relationship's best interests at heart."
Also happy baby time would be salt in his wounds. 
"Pft. Sure there is. Just tell her that her attempts at sounding smart is a ""facetious catch-22."" 

"
"Yes. Her team played a major rival to his team today. That's 100% why, he was rooting for his team's rival to lose. It's a complete coincidence. "
"You won't let your daughter spend time with her ""if"" she relapsed but you will let your daughter spend time with her after she stole $5,000 from your and your husband?

I don't think there's any point in taking her to court, but your husband is not wrong that you enable your mom's lousy behavior."
Some people are just slobs.
Are you familiar with the term narcissism? Your mom is a textbook case. Check out /rbn. I have no answers for you other than that. Good luck.
"I feel like there's a lot here we don't know... So did you walk in and ask them to have sex elsewhere or did you walk in there and flip out right away? Why does all your anger seem to be directed at the guy you don't know fucking your friend and ignoring your friend not respecting your boundaries? He didn't know you, she did. It's like how victims of infidelity always blame those their partner cheated with.

I mean context could change things. If I walked in on a platonic friend having sex on my bed I'd either say ""really dude you're changing the sheets"" or ""can you fucking not, do this shit elsewhere."" I wouldn't have to be held back from the person my friend was having sex with. 

There's something we don't know here...
"
"Yeah, that's a huge problem, no weight joke intended. After what you've said, I think you need to have a come-to-Jesus moment with him. I mean, I'm 26/M and recently noticed I've been eating like shit and not exercising for the last two months after a series of depressive episodes, and I put on 5-10 pounds. As soon as I noticed, I started walking more and limited my junk food intake. 

Your guy's situation sounds a lot more extreme than mine was, and I completely empathize with the difficulty of dealing with depression, but 50 pounds in 6 months is crazy unhealthy and could continue to snowball, especially with binge eating tendencies and no exercise. It's a lot easier to convince yourself to be ""body positive"" than take control of your habits, and I'm sure that's what he's dealing with now.

It's going to be rough, and a breakup could happen here, depending on how set in his ways he is. At the same time you deserve a partner who wants to give you the best version of themselves."
"I am an anxiety sufferer too, and I communicate similarly to this. I also have the added misfortune that my current relationship is the only healthy one I've had in my life, period. I don't know how to communicate effectively or healthily because I was not allowed to have an opinion or share my feelings until very recently. So I'm constantly fucking up, constantly afraid of fucking up again, overly explaining because I'm afraid of fucking up even more, fucking up even more because I over explained and said something wrong, and the vicious cycle continues until I'm a confused, accidentally offensive, mess.

It's hard to snap out of this cycle when there's not only zero reassurance to let me know it's okay, we're okay, but also just no feedback period. Listening is nice, until you're stuck in a cycle of digging yourself into a hole. Then listening, without any feedback or reassurance, is just being offered a nicer shovel to dig that hole faster.

I don't know your gf's past, and I won't pretend mine and her communication issues are the same. Just offering a perspective that might help at best, amount to me just venting at worst. Best of luck to you either way, OP."
"Do you know how annoying it is to be with someone who is;


1. Extremely opinionated

2. Debates unfairly (rants, doesn't listen..)

3.  Thinks they are always right

Not fun at all, in 4 years of dating her I was never right in anything unless I agreed with her. I stopped having opinions because it was easier"
"I don't think it's strange that your dad got a little upset when you ran for your uncle instead of him. I also think you're *absolutely right* in going to someone who is actually in law enforcement, but I kinda get your dad; it must have hurt to see his daughter go to his BIL instead of him when she needed help.


What I **don't** get, however, is why your dad (the adult in this entire debacle) didn't just get the fuck over it and still moans about it **more than a year later**. He comes across as jealous, spiteful and less of an adult than you.

Have you spoken to anyone else about this? Like, your mom or your uncle? What do they say?

Have you actually sat down with your dad and talked this through, asked him what the deal is?

 "
"It was for the best?!! I literally gasped out loud, god damn. How fucking callous. "

"She wants to get married. You don't. 

Fundamental incompatibility. This is over. Say your goodbyes."
"Step 1: Return the toy to the kid if you haven't already.

Step 2: Sit your wife down and ask her why she thinks her opinion is more important than the opinion of the kid's mother or the actual feelings of the kid. 

Try and find an instance where one of your parents or in-laws disrespected her parenting. Ask her how she felt about that and take it from there.

Tell her firmly that you take your daughter's side in this.

Ask her if she would rather be ""right"" or have a relationship with her daughter and grandson. This is what it comes down to.

Step 3: Have your wife read some stories on r/justnomil. It's a support sub for the victims of disrespectful, boundary stomping mothers and mother in laws.
"
"Yeah, I'm definitely starting to realize what you + others are saying is true. Sadly, I just think I needed to hear it from someone else to truly believe it. I actually sent him a text this morning ending it for good + have blocked him on everything. Thank you so much for the advice. "
"&gt;However I'm puzzled why my GF feels SO strongly about this

Puzzled over why she's bothered by a woman you admit you find beautiful, who you spend long hours each day with, who gets touchy and physical with you, who you spent all your time with before your relationship, and who you defend to your girlfriend when she tells you that these things bother her.

You might be able to negotiate keeping your working relationship with Vanessa if you start enforcing some boundaries.  Things like ""No flopping in your lap"" would be a good one, and no getting drunk and saying ""I love you"".  "
"I also don't trust people that rate others with a 1-10 scale.  It just seems so childish and immature.  I like the comment that attraction is more like flavors than a linear scale.  
My husband is always toting his best friend as a total ladies man and super attractive to all women.  I don't see it.  I never have.  I think the guy is ok but we don't have a lot of common interests.  If others think he's great more power to them.  He's like a carton of karamel sutra and I'm just not a fan though plenty people are.  
Husband is amazed by this.  I'm still over here being amazed that in a world that seems to prefer Cherry Garcia he's attracted to a weird Phish Food flavor like myself.  "
"&gt; Is it sad from a human perspective that she's living on the street? Yes. Is it in any way your fault? No

It's OP's fault for not following eviction procedures. You can't throw someone out on short notice. His user name suggests he's British. A few seconds on google is saying he owed her 21 days to find a new place."
"Yeah no. That's not how that works. The SO would be SF, unless OP plans on becoming a beast physically and being separated from her SO for a few years to get to SF. "
"Not single, but I'd think the opposite. I understand that people have a past. I think it makes more sense to erase things of them as a couple/individual shots, but I wouldn't erase group shots."
"I truly, truly sympathize with your sister. Although behavior right now is really unbecoming, I 100% understand just how rigorous University is these days. It's that much more worse when your parents see you as an investment. Your sister sounds completely *burnt out.* It happens to *a lot* of really smart people. Also, sometimes, you get really comfortable in being known as smart that you never really push yourself anymore and you sort of lose that groove a bit. And when you *do* end up failing at something, you just feel like shutting down completely. I seriously used to get anxiety attacks over this; I really feel bad for the sister, but I know why it's coming out the way it is. :( Hopefully things get better for her, I'd let the parents know the truth."
"Honestly, the only thing weird about this is how weird *you* seem to find it. Your secretiveness and obvious discomfort about sharing it are what would twig me as off, where as if you shared this from a position of confidence as a fun hobby that you enjoy participating in, I wouldn't even blink."
"I don't think he's being unreasonable at all in standing firm on this, I just think it would behoove him to figure out what the hell is *really* going on with his wife, because right now she's acting pretty irrationally based on his descriptions of her. 

But I have similar ""hard lines"" on relatively small things, so I sympathize with OP. If I say ""I hate surprise parties"" it doesn't mean ""I hate surprise parties except this one time you wanted to throw me a surprise party because you love me so much you don't care what my actual preferences are"". "
"I don’t really have any advice, as I think you already know this is wrong and you’re just looking for internet strangers to validate your bad decisions. 






I just wanted to chime in and say I feel bad for your boyfriend. He deserves better."
"Look, I had a dog I LOVED. And I get the grief, my dog has been gone over a year now and I still feel sad thinking of it. :( But this isn't fair. 

I would NEVER have left my dog in a sketchy place. I had to kennel him several times and I paid a lot for it. Private kennel, private play times, snack days, groomer trips, etc. So he didn't get bored. Yeah, it was expensive, and it did effect how long we went or whether we went or where we went. But that's what you do when you really care about your pet. 

Your boyfriend chose this place and your boyfriend turned down your ""pity"" money because he was being a passive aggressive asshole. This is in no way your fault. He could have taken your offer to pitch in for a nicer place. He could have NOT gone on his trip. This was HIS choice and he needs to live with it. And why I don't go out of my way to fling painful truths in people's faces, this is a case where I would absolutely point out that he's the one that failed his dog, not me. And then I'd dump his ass. "
"Maybe another option is to find what the state law says is required for proof and just show them the law and what is actually required.  If they press it you can either get the government involved for discrimination since you are showing what's legally required, or rat out your neighbor.  

Under no circumstances should you be required to cough up a cent because of another persons lie.

Edited to add one more option.  Knock on your neighbors door and let them know you are being told to provide this proof.  Your animal is legit, hers isn't but you don't wanna make it so that she gets in trouble, does your neighbor want to just pay for your certificate?  It's not fair to burden you with this, but now you're giving her the option of saving her cover story."
"Yes, she was dumped suddenly. That would make sense. Thank you."
"Exactly this! His thinking might be that he says goodbye to her *last thing* out of the door, so he's probably putting her above the dog in the goodbye hierarchy, but he just needs to switch up the routine a little if she's not okay with dog spit.

Or he might be concerned about OP's immune system and hopes that exposure to good dog germs will be of assistance. Science!"
"Your girlfriend just doesn't have the luxury of declining to have roommates. If that's what she wants, she needs to pick up an extra job to get her income up. 

Does she have a full time job?  You mentioned her sitting at home while you're at work. "
"Your brother is 24. He's not having a midlife crisis.  He had a ""I don't respect others homes and will being strangers into it to rummage through and use their personal belongings with no remorse"""
"&gt;Tell her you'll involve CPS if she doesn't do her duty as a guardian.

Oh yeah. That will DEFINITELY help mend the broken relationship that OP CLEARLY cares about. Op should tell his mom that he'll call the authorities on her. 

BTW I don't think this is a case CPS will go hard to handle"
"Think very carefully about marrying into this family. Absolutely not worth it. The fact that he didn't hold her accountable for how she treated you tells me all I need to know about him.
"
"I think she's freaking out because she thought she found someone young that felt like her. Now she's older and his feelings have changed as he's matured. She's being a child about the whole thing, while trying to act like a mother who knows best. It's incredibly ironic. 

OP is young enough to find someone and move on. She's probably thinking she's not going to end up with anyone. Most men her age likely have kids.

Makes me wonder if she's had other relationships end for similar reasons. 

They've basically been acting married, without any of the legal protections. Not sure why she's not seeing that.  "
"Agreed. Crushes happen, and for non-impulsive, level-headed people, it IS possible to turn it into a normal friendship. Have done it, have seen it done. But of course it's not possible for everyone or in every situation. 

I think a crush is merely a sign that you have someone awesome in your life, which is inherently a GOOD thing. "
"Potluck by itself doesn't strike me as off. It's the fact that they're doing a semi formal event for 200 people and want it to be potluck is the tacky part. If it was a BBQ in a park, I'd get it."
"I don't have a psych minor, but I do regularly read this sub. Same thing!"
"&gt;When I met my wife and then became serious enough to be marry, we both agreed that we are marrying each other AS IS.

I think this is exactly it. You can really care about their well-being and want them to get healthy because you love the, but if weight is stopping you from committing to them, that ain't love. "
This is the best answer I've seen on this sub. 
Yes! My boyfriend has to stop and be like 'lol it's fine I get it' or I will keep scrambling to get my foot out of my mouth!

"Wow, she sounds like a real piece of work. I can't believe she would speak to her daughter like that. Does she speak to you like that too or just your daughter? "
"I think there's also a secondary problem with this ""joke"" that at the very least, made it a real dick thing to say. By joking with uncle that her husband must have roofied her to get her to come along, OP's wife has just strongly implied that she needs to be drugged to agree to a visit!
All well and good to joke between spouses but wouldn't make me feel great if I was the uncle! Even if she didn't say it in so many words, it isn't hard to connect the dots. "
Get out before you get pregnant. Just end it. Give it some time and start dating women.
"&gt; i was told i was being too restrictive and not in keeping with commitments i had made in the past regarding presuing an open relationship.

That's not how this works.

That's not how any of this works.

Agreeing to an open relationship is *not* equivalent to immediate ""anything goes no holds barred"". You're still allowed to have boundaries, you have just *consented* to having them more relaxed than traditional monogamy. It's not ""0 or 100""."
I would so buy a safe just to keep my snacks away from my husband.
"In one submission, a victim of physical, financial and emotional abuse came to the thread for advice. She wanted to get out and she noted that, even though it was wrong, her new emotional affair gave her some strength to do that. People fucking got on her case about that. Like???"
"I am not at all intending on diving into the dating pool immediately. I just tend to be an over thinker and planner so I know down the road it will be an issue. In the immediate future, I think I need to remove at least some of our photos for me. But I know that it may be wise to remove her for the other reason for down the road. "
"&gt;and frankly, it's insulting when a parent says something like ""this is not really you"" or ""you don't act like this"" to their adult child, because it implies that the adult child doesn't know who they are. that you, their parent, who doesn't see them very often and who doesn't live with them, know MORE about who they are than they themselves know.

Yes, not to mention that a parent's perception of ""who you really are"" is from when you were a child. Or at least, several years out of date. That's very infantilizing.

Sure, your essential nature as a person may have been formed in childhood. But that doesn't mean others can't see it. And your experiences as a kid inform your experience, and it's nice to hang with people who understand where you're coming from. But parents can focus on the wrong ones. Or not realize you've processed them differently now.

Your maturity and interests change a lot at that age. So it's very frustrating when parents are like, ""Oh, you're my shy little girl who's obsessed with Sailor Moon!"" or what have you."
"I hate to pile onto this but was she drinking a lot on this trip? I ask because she is prone to extremely impulsive behavior when drinking.

This is tough because I imagine you'd like to work through things but at the same time she has hurt you majorly. So you're between a rock and a hard place of do you just break up or do you stay with her but essentially there is little to no recourse for what she did. I think you're going to have to come to a conclusion about 

1) did she cheat, which might be tough to come to a conclusion about

2) Is this a one time thing which is a total mistake or is this who she is

3) do you think her style of fighting is OK 

And for number 3 I think you should focus on how she talks to you and treats you when you are fighting as well as how she approaches the fight. The idea that she doesn't like admitting fault would be a bad part of how she approaches things. Arguments and fights should be about working together to find a solution including accepting you might be at fault. If it becomes about one person being right or wrong then its not a healthy productive fight."
"Does anyone else not find it odd that the parents are seeing a therapist to ""help fix their toxicity,"" but when OP doesn't bow to their every whim they go and do this?  

Sounds to me like the parents aren't using the therapist for themselves, but to make the children fall in line. GTFO."
"every person has the right to define cheating as they wish. i would say *most* would include this in their definition cheating. it's ok if she doesn't as an individual and it's ok that you do as an individual, but you have to come to some agreement as a couple.

personally, your girlfriend is being a little biphobic in not considering this cheating. can bisexual people avoid cheating on their partners as long as they only hookup with people of the opposite gender of their partner? her logic is just so flawed to me..."
"Hey, I'm glad you're feeling introspective about your actions, but I find it concerning that you **completely trampled this lady's boundaries, ignoring multiple soft 'no' signals**... and your post shows no awareness of that.

&gt;Sat down with her and asked her out. Her response was very logical. We need to get to know each other so let's just meet first. Great, perfect.

This is not 'Great, perfect'. This is a gentle 'no thank you' -- yeah, I know, it sucks when you're neurodiverse and people use indirect language. A good rule of thumb for people who struggle with subtle signs is: **anything other than an enthusiastic yes is a no.**

(I'm probably going to get replies about how absolute rules are bullshit, and some hyberbolic examples, but fuck that noise. When you have a history of being bad at reading people, it's always better to be overly-cautious than not.)

&gt; She has always been very busy. Despite being eager to meet, she took a week to find time. 

Another indication: she's not into you.

&gt; Despite it going well and enjoying ourselves, she took 2 weeks to invite me to an event. 

Another 'not into you'.

&gt; so weeks and months passed, we laugh and share stories together, but never enough to make her want to see each other more frequently.

All of these were signs she wasn't into you.

&gt; I had to do something, my crush turned into something way deeper after getting to know her. But she wouldn't allow frequent communication. Even online messages she checks only once every 1-2 days.

This means she's not into you.

&gt; So I wrote her a letter. The circumstances of delivering it couldn't be topped by the cheesiest bollywood plot.

THIS IS NOT CUTE, OP. THIS IS CREEPY AS FUCK.
She had a boundary and you steamrolled it. She sent you a long-arse e-mail that amounts to 'it's not you, it's me' -- a very gentle rejection, because my god this woman has the patience of a saint, but still a rejection.

And you don't *stop* at this. The post here keeps going and going with you ignoring all boundaries in a frankly terrifying manner.

&gt;  But she is not capable of trusting anybody in such a way. Her life is too self centered. Her last relationship failed because of it. She is too stressed with everyday tasks.

These are all 'I'm not ready for a relationship' statements.

&gt;  despite me (unreasonably) pushing slightly more aggressively to meet

You're suspiciously coy about what this means, but spoiler: THIS IS NOT COOL. NONE OF THIS IS COOL.

&gt;  How do I decide whether to pursue her on not. It may destroy me even further, or it may be a once in a lifetime chance to gain something priceless.

Jesus fucking christ, OP, she has told you a HUNDRED times that she isn't into you. LEAVE HER ALONE.

**SHE IS NOT A 'PRICELESS' OBJECT. SHE IS A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS TOLD YOU NO.**

**RESPECT THAT.**"
"The reason for not getting our daughter her MMR vaccination is because of those reasons you mentioned, ""I don't want to see the light go out in her eyes."" ... aka, it'll cause autism.  She quoted me some bullshit anti-vax website statistics from a discredited doctor as well.

I'm almost positive that if I take my daughter to get a vaccine she will take our kids across state lines back to her family."
"he wants kids and I feel like I take enough crap for his problems, no need to pile another one on. "
"&gt;""It's disturbing because it came out of a fund we were setting aside for my daughter (who is now 4)""


She didn't steal the money from you, or your husband. She stole it from your 4 year old daughter. Let that sink in for a second. She promised to return money which was supposed to go to her own granddaughter, and she didn't. 

She stole from a child."
"I recommend you make a new post in legal advice. Don't talk about the relationship stuff, just write the relevant information such as whether she has paid rent, how long she has been there, information about your lease. If it turns out that eviction isn't necessary at all this will be pretty easy. "
"Does she live by herself? If so, how does her house seem when you visit her? Is it as messy as she's leaving your house? 

If she lives alone and cleans her own house, then maybe she just feels weird about cleaning at your house. Maybe she feels like she's a guest and shouldn't have to clean while she's there? Maybe she feels like if the situation were reversed she wouldn't expect you to clean her house. 

You need to communicate with her and clearly spell out your expectations for her. Not just that she should clean more, but specific things that she is expected to do while staying at your house."
"I don't see any reason *anyone* needs to know the whole truth and nothing but the truth about my entire life.  Keep it a secret, it was 40 years ago.  

Does this guy treat other people right, though?"
"Dude you literally implied in some way you and the other woman are more compatible. The thought that you would be happier with another person hurt her. 


Even if it was a joke about how much you enjoyed Brie, it still in the back of her mind put a small bit of doubt concerning your relationship.



It might not be logical but it's probably the case. Take a step back from your point of view (knowing it was a joke) and put yourself in her shoes. "
"Your boyfriend wants to fuck other people and is using your past sexual experiences against you in order to get you to agree. 

My advice would be to drop this guy because he's an asshole."
"I'm sorry, I have to ask... Do you really think the deletion of his website was truly an accident? How serious an effort did he make to get it back/recreate it? 

I think he needs to hear that it's ok being self employed didn't work out for him, it's ok and there's no shame in having tried and switching to something else. But that being in neutral mode any longer isn't going to work; he has had time to recover from that. What is his plan if something (god forbid) should happen to you and being the financial support of the family lands on him unexpectedly? What happens to you?   "
"&gt; [[Spare me any scolding, believe me I've heard enough of how stupid I was to get married and how my generation doesn't respect marriage.]]

You're kind of a jerk more for not respecting the guy who you knew you didn't love but married anyway, knowing how he felt. Not because you don't ""respect marriage"".

That said, yes, you should divorce him. He deserves better than what you're willing to offer."
"You were dating a teenager and got surprised when she acted like a clingy teenager. Lesson learned? 

Don't have sex with her again, or you might just be a father. "
"Also you need to phase out your so called ""friends"" out of your life."
"Really think about why you want to stay with someone who lies, cheats, and can't have a discussion about those things without losing his shit."
It might not be so much about the past for them but they could just see how much he isolates his wife and kids and hate him for that
your mom sounds like a shitty person. you should make sure there is absolutely no way she can touch your money and then tell her the truth.
"This. It's very certain this girl wouldn't even be a friend to OP if she wasn't getting her free childcare . I mean, she can't even trust her word on going to an appointment for 2 hours? What kind of friend would do that?"
He's also incredibly sexist if he thinks the ONLY reason you were requested to go is because your boss wants to hook up with you. That's just a disgusting attitude to have.
"Agreed, except it should read: ""you will have to sleep at your own place."" No way am I about to ruin a good sofa!"
"I have a ""super hot"" friend (and I mean ridiculously hot, like thousands of instagram followers, gets mistaken for Megan Fox hot) who is also struggling finding a relationship. She definitely has a different set of issues than I do. 

Namely guys are either just in it for the sex and basically to brag about having been with her. Or they worship the ground she walks on and treat her like a goddess instead of a flawed human being. 

Ironically, despite being undoubtedly the hottest of my friends, she has had the least amount of long term relationships and the lowest self esteem. Which sucks cuz she's a beautiful person on the inside too, not that many people have cared enough to find out. I'm actually very grateful to not be as beautiful as her. "
"Parents who are cold to their children and ""don't believe in therapy"" aren't good parents. Just to be clear."
Instantly my thought-I fucking love my compression shorts-keeps everything Gucci whilst moving explosively and I like how they make my thighs look all juicy 
"You're not dumb. You're brother is an idiot and your parents are acting like idiots too. They were probably too freaked out hearing their son got stabbed to hear reason, but text them or send them an email saying he dressed up as a burglar to purposely petrify you and I would honestly refuse to come home until they apologize. Don't back down, you did nothing wrong (I mean you stabbed your brother, but you know...)"
"&gt; I admit I do tell myself that I'm fat, stupid and a real piece of sh** at least 20 times a day. As a introvert, I don't like social settings to much, I am perfectly happy just being in my apartment on Friday night playing video games or working on a project. It doesn't mean I won't go out at times, but I don't find anyone and I'm to shy to bring myself to go up to some random person and start a conversation.

Tadaa, there's your problem. Unfortunately, you're a Debbie Downer. That negativity you tell yourself comes out when you interact with other people. You need to get out more, be happier, be more positive and confident in how you look and act. No one wants to date a pessimist."
Spend Christmas with your mom.  Hopefully one of your siblings will follow your lead.
"No offense, as I don't know you or your intentions, but I dated a guy like you. 

He'd behave the same way, couldn't handle drinking moderately, would go off the rails when drunk and then swear up and down he was done with alcohol. He'd then go a month or two without a drop, all the while acknowledging how much better he felt and how this was such a wake-up call.

Then an event would come up. An event that typically involved alcohol. A party, a wedding, a holiday, whatever, you know how often those happen. He'd convince himself that he could have a glass of wine, or a couple beers, just socially, no big deal, then it's back to not drinking, only on holidays/at weddings/when I'm stressed/when I'm bored/when my friends are drinking/ etc etc...the list of acceptable excuses to drink ballooned right back up again until he was right back where he was. 

It never lasted. He'd forget how bad it felt to wake up after a drunken explosion and have to do damage control. It usually took about 4-6 weeks for him to decide it wasn't that bad/wouldn't happen again. It got to the point where if he ordered a beer at dinner and I looked anxious, he'd get pissed at *me* for ""holding it against him,"" and ""why can't you just relax?"" 

If your ex has encountered this pattern before, in a family member or a friend or a former partner, I can 100% understand why she booked it out of there at the first sign of trouble. At 30, the chances that she's already seen this shit are fairly high. The first sign is never the last. I hope, for your sake, that you mean it this time and stay sober, but she can't read your mind, and I think you owe it to her to let her go. 

She has your number. If she's really interested, she knows how to get in touch. Otherwise, leave her alone, and get your life together so this doesn't happen with the next woman you fall for. "
"Literally this. 

Most guys have a very hard time talking to girls. It's a huge turn on + let's us know immediately that you're interested if you say something like this. "
"I think him watching porn and still being so vocal about his (judgy, hateful, degrading, misogynist) opinions is what would put it over the edge for me. He's both hateful and a hypocrite. "
Cheating seems to be the most deadly and unforgivable sin in this sub. Responses tend to be more emotional than rational.
"He needs to shut this down. It's not appropriate that he's allowing her to constantly reminisce about their relationship, talk about their sex life, and tell him she loves him. He's disrespecting you and your relationship by participating in that. And yes, he is participating by allowing the messages and by responding. He either still has feelings for her, or he's getting an ego boost that she's still on the hook. 

Tell him how this makes you feel and ask him to block her, or just break up if you can't trust him to do that. Don't get yourself stuck in petty, dramatic relationships with disrespectful guys. Not worth it."
"I think that for LGBTQ people it is always okay to not allow homophobic people into their beds, just like it is okay for women to not allow sexists into their beds, etc. If the OP wants to continue an online dialogue with this dude that's her prerogative, and I also hope just as you do that he finds friends and supportive people that help him change his views, but there are few things more soul sucking than having sex with someone who doesn't see you as quite deserving of human rights."
"I'm sorry wait...you know he's cheating, but you're worried he'll leave you if you confront him about it because he's emotionally manipulative? Am I reading this right? Where did you leave your self respect. You need to go back and get it. "
"Every time my schizophrenic half-sister decided that she ""didn't need"" her meds, it preceded a psychotic break.

Your family isn't blind, and they aren't stupid. You need to take your medication."
"Just know, if a rift is creating *she* is the one creating it

This wedding is not about her, it's about your brother. He can decide who he wants to invite or not invite

I agree about doubling down about her leaving the bf"
"Hmm. Sort of both, I suppose. But at the same time, even beyond any romantic interest, I've genuine just enjoyed working with her; she's funny, and she's made it much easier to tolerate the work."
"I'm gonna guess this is probably not actually about the litter box. 

Is she just bored and frustrated? Is this routine grating on her and she just latched onto the litter box because it's the least pleasant aspect of the routine for her? Have you guys had any couples time away from cat and baby lately? 

Maybe it's time for a conversation. "
"Well, as you clearly know, you're not entitled to the money. But the insult here isn't imagined. Either grandpa has a favorite, or grandpa is a sexist who is expressing that via money. 

I had an uncle like this. He was a multi-millionaire. When he died he left his grandsons something like $2,000 a piece, and the granddaughters $1,500. Including the one with a life long disability that would require a lot of care over her life. 

It's shitty and you've learned something very ugly about your grandpa. It's no reflection on you though. It's does shine a bright light on him though. Your within your rights to alter your relationship accordingly. 

As for your brother. This isn't his fault. He can do nothing about what your grandfather did, or why he did it. "
I married a dumb man. Would not recommend.  
"He is lying, because he wants you scared and controlled. OP, this guy is abusive and you need to get your parents to help you pack your shit and MOVE. Don't tell the boyfriend. he could hurt or even kill you."
"Agree. Walking down the aisle is not a huge deal at all, completely overreacting here. OP is out of line trying to ask the bride to change things because he's insecure. Obviously they've picked the MOH and best man for a reason. "
"I think he should join your gym, and use the extra $90 on taking his wife out for a nice evening. Crossfit sucks anyway. (Joking. Kinda.) 

When you reach the point where texting your ""gym buddy"" is a higher priority than your spouse's comfort with that friendship, you're in dangerous territory. If it wasn't an affair yet, it was heading that way. Having to switch gyms is not an unreasonable consequence for crossing that boundary. "
"Wow. Are you really that thick?

Their marriage is splitting up over babies and you want to shove your baby down their throats???

Wtf is wrong with you? I don't come into this sub with the opinion that the OP is genuinely a horrible person that often but you are definitely making a case for it."
"Gee, maybe that's why you've got lots and she's got nothing?

Why don't you split proportional to income?  That's a much fairer approach and would give her more room to save."
"No, being a bad person makes them a bad parent. Your mom is a terrible, awful person and you've been conditioned to accept it as normal. 

"
"Your BF is an abusive asshole and you need to leave.

But:
&gt;after I stupidly downloaded tinder.

Really? If you were looking for a hookup, own up to it.  Tinder doesn't accidentally appear.  Next relationship you are in, leave it before searching out a new one.
"
"It seems he likes to remember the past.

What do you have to gain by having contact with him?

What do you have to lose by cutting contact with him?

Why do you maintain contact with him?"
