"Not to get political, but I was so furious when one of the Trump kids (Eric or Don, idk and idc which one) did something awful and everyone was like “hey he’s a good kid.” No he’s fucking not, he’s 39 and married with children. “Too young to know better” ends at 18 in pretty much all situations."
"It could just be that you need to be more assertive.  Parenting together as a team means that the two of you will notice different things, and you both will notice things that the other parent doesn’t.  You gave your opinion, she stated that she hadn’t noticed what you had.  You are then open to stating that, “oh, I’m sure you didn’t notice because they try to slip these things by parents, but they just said a curse word.”  Believe me, there are likely things your gf is noticing and handling that you didn’t even think of as well. That’s ok.  "

"On your last comment - she's OP's best friend supposedly, did she really have to bang him on her bed while OP is in it?  That's just needlessly cruel."
My guess: Crocs. All the time.
You SHOULD be doubting everything about him. This person isn't your friend and doesn't care about you. He acted friendly to get access to free food. The uneasiness you are feeling is your gut telling you that this situation is deeply wrong. A person is using you and when you get caught you will lose your job. 
Dude. Just ask for It back. It’s yours. Poor or not that’s your jacket.

"Social circles and social hierarchy in HS are very fluid, and the choices and personality of one person can change everything. I broke out of my shell in HS, and I encourage you to do the same. 

If you say to yourself, ""I can't risk this,"" at one level, everyone will see this as safe conformity. You won't get respect this way. Nobody who dislikes you will come to like you. There's a cowardice about this approach that you can smell. 

If, instead, you say, ""I'm bigger than this. I'll do what I like, and be who I want to be,"" you'll have something to be proud of. I also think you'll find that the social pushback is less than you fear, and that you'll win some respect among the more perceptive of your classmates. 

Don't get conceited or arrogant about this, but for what it's worth, *everyone* will think better of you if you behave in a way that is quietly kind and self-assured. Do what's right, don't speak poorly of other people, and act with integrity, and you'll always have the friends worth having. 

But for fuck's sake DON'T treat her like you're doing her a favor. This is like navigating any other crush, so treat her like you would any other girl you wanted to ask out. If you are rejected, take it gracefully. 

And maybe - just maybe - ask her out privately so that you don't put her on the spot. A big public gesture out of the blue on V day is a terrible idea. Get her flowers on the day *after* you've asked her out and *if* she's interested. She's navigating a very difficult thing, transitioning during adolescence. She may not want the attention that a romantic interest would bring, she may not have the time for it, and she may be suspicious of public attempts being tricks to humiliate her. In other words, *think*. Go ask her what she wants and pay attention to what she says. "

It's a very independent job, but I'm responsible for all of the orders that nobody else in the store even really knows how to do at this point. And I need the money . . . "

I would also like to add that OP's wife seems to be the scapegoat of the family, at least to her siblings. Calling her selfish for taking one freaking day off from all that madness is ridiculous and abusive and they are doing their best to make her cave to their demands using guilt. OP may need to insist that all future communications from his wife's family go through him just to mitigate the damage they do to his wife. "
"He’s 43 and still a mommas boy. He won’t change. Divorce him. There’s a big age difference. He probably intentionally dated so much younger because it’s easier to get his way.

Tell him through text/email your leaving because you can’t handle the constant disrespect. 
If that seems hard just ask yourself if you want to continue being disrespected and mistreated in this relationship. "

"? Dude the issue is your wife now views your father as a person who will physically abuse your child if he doesn’t approve of the behavior, as she should!  He had no issue spanking someone else’s child before. It’s safe to assume a 60yr old man will continue his habits. 

It’s fucking 2018 there is no “spanking issue” it’s called child abuse. "
"You're allowed to have porn as a dealbreaker but you should have your eyes open that most men look at porn and you're ruling out 90% (or more... maybe 97%?) of your dating pool.

You can make reasonable requests about types of porn, like don't sext with anyone, don't watch live cam girls. Those are reasonable because they specifically involve another live person.  Porn does not.  Porn is just porn.

In my opinion, it's not a reasonable request to ask someone to stop watching porn. The fact that you didn't bring it up for 4 months means it might not be as important to you as you think. I think if you dump him over it, he's got every right to be thoroughly pissed about you failing to disclose a dealbreaker this major for this long."
"If you're in the UK you can report that you're under threat of forced marriage at any time. Even if they haven't booked tickets or anything yet. I assume you can do the same in other countries.

This is useful insight - but I absolutely think his behaviour is break-up worthy. I don't think OP should have to wait this out. 
an NDA? On what? Dude just break up with her like a normal person. Anything she says to slander you to friends reflects more poorly on her than you. 
"&gt; I was taken away by CPS

So the first thing to really understand is that children don't get taken away by CPS for no reason.  In fact, as a society, we have a STRONG bias towards keeping children with their families even in situations where it's not the best environment. 

Just to give you an idea. A friend of a friend is a foster parent and has children coming and going through her home all the time.  The most recent one was a 3-year-old girl who was left ALONE by her mother on more than occasion.  When the social worker came calling the little girl was alone in the living room watching TV, the mother was upstairs sleeping.  The little girl answered the door but the social worker could not enter without police or parental permission.  Dispite yelling and yelling from the doorway, the social worker could not raise her. She yelled for over an hour before she called the cops so she could go in.  The little girl was placed in the social worker's car during this time. 

Turns out the mother was so high, it was highly unlikely that anything would have woken her. She's not dead, but she was in no condition to watch her child.  Literally, anyone could have come to the door and that little girl would have opened it.

That mom got her kid back in less than a month.  LESS THAN A MONTH!!

So let's be super clear.  You were taken away by CPS.  Rather than go into the foster system you were placed with a relative, and you have been there for 5 years.  There are 3 explanations here.  

Number one is whatever your parents did was SO BAD that they can never gain custody back, and because of how CPS works it has to be pretty fucking bad for that to happen.  

Number 2, your parents genuinely think you are better off with Katie and are making the ""right choice"" by not fighting to take you back.

Number 3, they just don't care.  Most likely this scenario has something to do with drug use.  They know they can never get you back so because they haven't/can't make the necessary life changes so they're not even trying. 

I'm saying all this not to make you feel bad but in hopes of answering this question..

&gt; I just don't understand why.

Your parents have a history of making bad choices.  They have a track record of neglect or violence against you as a child that you may or may not remember.  The point is, they don't have the best judgment.  So trying to recreate their logic to understand basically anything they do is likely to be an impossible exercise. 

Lastly, depending on what they did they may or may not be allowed to visit you.  Just to pull an example out of thin air, an allegation of sexual abuse would prevent any kind of visitation from happening. Wheres if a child is removed due to simple neglect visits are normally allowed.  There is no one size list of rules for child custody issues. 

Having said all that.  You should 100% talk with Katie about what your actual situation is.  Start by saying, 

""Katie.  I want you to know that I'm really thankful for all that you have done for these past few years.  However, I want to know more about the real situation with my parents.  I understand that little 10 years old me was likely not told the whole situation but I'm a lot older now and I want to know more.  

I think it's important because I want to be able to make educated choices about interacting with my parents in the future.  I'll be 18 soon and if they get in contact with me I'll need to understand better what was going on.  

I also heard at school that some parents are allowed to visit with their children even though they don't have custody. I want to know if they have been trying to visit and are simply not allowed to.  Or if they haven't even tried.

I just want to know the truth about my own past and feel like I'm old enough to handle it. I understand if you need some time to think about this but I'd like to go through whatever paperwork and memories you have.  And I want to do it with you because I'm sure to have many questions."""
"&gt; My brother was working on my dads farm and had a part time job in a furniture retailer during that time so he had no other obligations. My sister had a career yes, but no children, she still only visited three times even though she had three weeks holidays a year and had public holidays off. 

I said this in another comment.

"The thing is, you DONT empathize. Your whole post screams ""why can't she get over it?"" You sound like a bad boyfriend honestly. She uprooted her whole life. "

I strongly suggest that you not talk to the police again without a lawyer present. Can’t stress this enough. 
"Breaking up is a unilateral decision. If you don't want to stay him with because he does drugs then don't. You don't have to rationalize it to him at all. Heck, you can break up with him because he picks his nose or his farts smell bad.  "

"I guess I could really catch some shit for this comment. But okay, so I have a question for you... how *do* you look at the notion of people purposely having children they can't provide for? Would you defend them for choosing to bring an innocent life into a horrible situation purely because they wanted to do it? I can't find it in myself to do that. Explain it to me logically.

I don't see having and raising children as a fundamental human right.... I think CPS would agree.

I think the poster refers to the younger siblings that way because their mother acted purely for selfish motivations. She didn't care that she'd be bringing new lives into horrible circumstances; she just did. So that's clearly what they are to her. Not trying to excuse the slang, just explain it.

&gt; I don't let these people know that I think what they're doing is irresponsible, but I think it's okay that I think that. They're hurting their children, who are innocent in this and didn't ask to be born. 

&gt; I'm all for welfare programs, kids need food and heat, and some people need help even when they work hard. Bringing a child into the world that would require welfare to care for on purpose? No, that's not ok

&gt; I can't imagine how frustrating that must feel. I'm really sorry you're dealing with it. How old are your siblings? It may sound harsh, but don't help her. If they're really little than if you want to (since you're under no obligation) you could buy things directly for them instead of giving her money. Or help your mom fill out forms for government assistance if she qualifies for it. 

Yeah, real dehumanizing in the comments."
"For a group of people so fucking desperate for respect about their life choices, they show a disturbing lack of respect to everyone else.

Which sucks, because I totally get the need for a support group like that. I'm hoping there are other places childfree people can go that isn't so toxic."
"This ^
Also, he might just be pissed that you're doing ok and happy without him. Childish but would fit."
Did you pay back the 10 K he put down too?
"I can understand that. I still would suggest meeting in a public place first, even if you're just grabbing a coffee. She is a young girl and realistically should want to meet you in a public setting first. I would 100% suggest that if you're going to follow through with this, meet some where other than the hotel to see if it still works in person. If it does, great! Go and order Chinese, watch a movie, have your intimate chats. 

There will ALWAYS be time to have talks in person, but you should both care about your safety and emotional well being - it's the absolute worst to meet someone and realize they aren't what you thought they were and be stuck in a long situation (especially overnight). It's mentally straining and stressful. I would recommend meeting outside of the hotel first to ensure both of you feel safe and relaxed with the other person (And I'm saying that as much to you as I am about her)."
But not more than sixty seconds! The baby does need the attention. If you leave the baby to cry it will learn that crying doesn't make a difference and it will stop making noise when it needs attention. This is not a good thing...

"Well just because she was dating guys doesn't mean she couldn't still be interested in you. As someone who's also bi, definitely had crushes on my straight friends, I just never blocked them. I think she probably did it for her own sake. It's very immature, but I think that's the reason. You may not see that she's into you just because you don't see her that way and haven't picked up on it. I'd just give her space and I'm sure she'll come around."
"Haha, if you're gonna start like that, you might as well break it off immediately."
"I feel like I can weigh in here as I have a somewhat similar tic. I fold my pillow case and flat sheet edges into sharp points and scratch myself with them. Or just wrap my fingers up in my sheet and pillow case while falling asleep. (I also still stuck my thumb.) I personally developed these tics as a small child during a very abusive time in my life. Things like this are hard habits to break if they need to be broken. Now that being said, sticking things like that in orifices where they can get dirty is not a harmless tic. It's gross and definitely one that should be taken care of. And the sex thing is just baffling honestly. He either will attempt to see reason or will not. And then you have to decide if you can put up with this continuing. I personally wouldn't. "
"&gt;may be he won’t listen to it and he’ll say “who the fuck cares? Why do you care? What do you have to be stressed out about anyway?”

That's not a great way to treat someone. It's abusive. 

Maybe he doesn't really want to have kids right now? Sounds like you're not financially prepared for it anyway. "
"While I agree that she shouldn't delay any further, I really don't think it's fair to characterize what OP is doing as 'leading him on'. She's hoping he finds a way back to who he was and respecting his grieving process. "
"Thanks, any thoughts on how to approach it without coming off as rude or inconsiderate?

I've been trying to figure out what to say, but ""what do you spend you money on"" sounds a bit harsh."
"I'm also just like you in that I am a woman who takes charge in a relationship.  I don't have time to play games and be coy; if I want a thing, I ask for it or do it myself.  So I *feel* you on the fact that sometimes it's just easier to call the shots.  In the past I've had to deliberately pull back on some things just to allow my SO room to take initiative.  It's hard when you're a go-getter, but it's worth it in the end to have a boyfriend who knows they have to step up to keep you.  "

"&gt; She didn't understand that it wasn't about anything physical, more that my emotions let me know I needed someone with a larger bra size.

Maybe his penis is emotionally small, lol. 

I mean, realistically, sexual incompatibility is a perfectly good reason for a break up, but saying it's ""an emotional thing"" in this case is rather disingenuous.  OP needs to be honest with herself here. "

"I dunno, ambition is great and all - but a 'stepping stone' move that would require me to live 3 hours away from my long-term GF (and probably future wife) for *four goddam years* would not be an option. *Maybe* it could be a viable option if I had zero job prospects otherwise - but when he's already got a pretty good job, probably already making damn good money from the way you're talking - it just doesn't make any sense.

Honestly, the only way this makes sense is if he wasn't all that enthusiastic about being with you. Sounds like he's a gregarious fun guy, so he's probably got a very active social life in his new city. So maybe you're good enough to be GF, but not really good enough that he'd let proximity to you factor into his job decisions. I just don't get that. I started my relationship with my GF when we lived 1.5 hours away from each other, so we saw each other one evening during the week, plus all weekend. And 2 years of that was more than enough - so we both put a hell of a lot of effort into figuring out job options so we could live in the same place. I just can't imagine moving that far away for 4 years from someone I love."
"Congratulations! Sounds like you're much better off now. 

You don't have to date at the moment if it isn't working for you. Maybe just take a break until you're done with school."

I was completely blindsided by it (and it sounds like she will be too as you've mentioned her still being in love with you) and it absolutely ruined my birthday, I didn't even celebrate on the day. Even though she may figure out afterwards that you wanted to break up with her prior, at least she'll be able to enjoy the party that she has organized whilst it's happening.

"You just described my cousin so accurately. She has borderline personality disorder and uses it to get away with MURDER (well not actual murder but you know what I mean). She absolutely, 100% consciously knows what she’s doing - she’s literally said to me before, ‘I’m going to act depressed so mum takes me shopping.’ My family coddle her and have enacted absolutely NO boundaries whatsoever - she was an alcoholic living at home (now recovered through rehab, it’s been a few months so hopefully she’ll stick to it) and my aunt and uncle continued to give her a big allowance whilst she would regularly collapse in their own home from drinking. Then they were shocked and distraught when she ended up needing rehab. Her various treatments have never made a long term difference because she gets everything she wants from playing the role of an ‘ill victim’ - if she had consequences and boundaries she would absolutely not act in the way she acts now. Sorry for the rant but it absolutely does my head in. If we as a family were to band together and say, ‘We will help you but this behaviour is not acceptable,’ I think she would have a much better chance at recovery. As is, she gets all the sympathy/attention/excuses she wants. Why would she ever try to change?"
"This is very true, the worst is around 20-25 give or take a few years. "
"Yeah...it is. Move out. It’ll be good for your sanity, and it’ll give your sister a sympathetic family member to visit when she needs to get out of the house. "
"I’m 9 months pregnant. 

Pregnancy isn’t some free for all. You don’t eat 12 donuts. That’s not normal, or healthy. Yeah, your clothes sure as hell won’t fit with twins, but if you’re pounding back ice cream and donuts what do you think will happen? Even with twins, you don’t need that many calories in 12 donuts. Not to mention there’s NO nutrition. 

If you’re growing 2 humans, you need vitamins, minerals, folic acid, protein- stuff that will help form the organs of the babies. Sure, you’re hormonal, but you’re also responsible for life growing. This is reckless, and pretty ridiculous. Since you said that your wife already started out as big, she is not required to gain as much weight as you seem to think. It’s not healthy, and can lead to complications for mom and babies. Especially twins. 

But everyone sees this as normal? You need to focus less on the dress and more on getting an adequate nutrition plan from your wife’s doctor. "
"&gt; This is part of what really bothers me- does he think I'm an idiot?

Ask him. Like I said, I'd flat out ask him if he's got an ulterior motive here. Trying to make you jealous? Or worse, breaking down your self-esteem? I'd assume more of the former than the latter, since you didn't bring up any direct comparisons between you and his exes. There is no reason anyone should be bringing up their exes that much, seriously. If after 2 conversations about it he can't think before he blurts out his ex-gf anecdotes, then there might not be much hope for this one."
You were the one in the wrong. Let them decide if they want to salvage it with you. 
"Your mother is enabling your brother's behavior.  He needs to go.  These are my rules if I ever have adult children live with me.

They must be doing at least one of these:

1) working fulltime to get their own place

2) going to school fulltime

3) actively seeking employment

Above all they must be respectful to me.  Its ok to disagree or even argue with me....but be respectful.  As soon as you lose respect for me you lose the privilege to live with me.

Your mother has done her part, she needs to let him experience the real world, even if that means being homeless.  Maybe that will teach him to no bite the hand that feeds him.  He needs to learn how to be a respectable adult and contribute to society.   Your mother is not teaching him that by allowing him to not work, use up her resources and shit talk her on the daily."
 So then the reasonable alternative is as soon as possible. With your actions you picked being lazy over following up in a prompt manner. You were in considerate. Sending a strained check is a pretty clear up yours to him as well. You seem to judge others by their actions and yourself by your stated intentions. 
"Why did you wait on him to reach out after the sushi? He offered to go someplace to eat, I would guess to hash it out, and you never responded. Why would you think the ball was in his court when he was the last to suggest to meet? He should have contacted you over the weekend to finalize plans, but maybe at this point he's avoiding the drama.

I'm also curious about what he did to hurt you. How serious it was and whether it is worth all this might make a difference in my advice."
"I have to agree. I feel that's what's happening to me. I just don't feel it's right - I mean, they've nbeen friends even before I entered the picture. It doesn't feel right to me.

Edit: about those requests, I feel I have no right to ask them of her. They did have a relationship years before I even entered the picture. I did ask her as nicely as I could, but I felt awkward doing it. Like it's something I didn't really have right to do. "
What if it’s dirty talk?
"WTF.   “Feminists” huh.  Looks like you’ve internalized the toxic mentality of your guy friends.  And as soon as this girl does something you don’t like you hate in her and use that as an excuse?  

I can’t imagine being so upset about a hollywood crush.  You don’t *know* Reedus.  This whole issue is juvenile.  You do t know what’s going on in these peoples lives other than what the tabloids.  The basis for your obsession over a man on TV is over the way he looks!  And you are causing drama in your real life because someone actually pointed that shallow aspect out to you?  
"
"Right? Tired of hearing the ""all men are like this when no one is around"". Maybe after this incident something will click in OP's head. Can I also mention that this is crazy disrespectful to his new gf? Bet if she heard him she wouldn't be around either. "
" OK, I'm going to give you my advice from my own perspective because I am a Natalie. I'm on the spectrum and I have severe anxiety, etc. etc.  I have acted in a similar way to her, although not quite as graphic. My feeling is that she's using you for anxiety relief.  Because you know her well, and you spend every day together you were likely her safe person and she's developed a codependent relationship with you. I believe she thinks she can use sex as a way to control or manipulate you into providing even more safety for her by being with her more often.  She wants to spend all day with you not because she is in love with you but because she feels safe when she's with you and her anxiety is lowered. The desire for sex also likely has to do with anxiety and anxiety relief. There's no way you were going to be able to have a functional relationship with this person and this is pretty much going to end in disaster.  Either you end it now and save yourself 10 years of torture or you continue with Natalie and get trapped for however many years it takes you to escape this. Don't lie to yourself, this is a codependent abusive relationship.  Get out while you can. I say this because I trapped a man for 10 years in a cycle of absolute bullshit and if I could go back and tell myself what I was doing I could've saved him and myself a lot of pain. 

Edit: if you don't believe me, try to break up with her and watch her reaction. She will likely go apeshit and threatened to kill her self. If so run to the fucking hills buddy."
"No confrontation until you have the money in a bank account (or investments, or whatever you’re doing with it) that is off limits to her. No joint accounts, co-signing, or anything else like that.

Only then, when you have the money safely tucked away, should you confront her. Then you can go as apeshit as you feel is appropriate. 

You don’t want to risk her “changing her mind” because of your “ungrateful attitude” and just keeping the money herself."

"It was a poorly thought out comment for sure, but pretty clearly not an intentional insult. In all honesty he seemed kind of happy about the idea of pregnancy. 

You personally admit to having a bit of a belly now, so its natural that others would notice too. As you said, it's something to be proud of in your case. I'm sure he loves your body and he's proud of your progress. You can't really ""have a talk"" about a genuine mistake aside from maybe looking for some comfort or reassurance. He has a big mouth but meant well."
A food thermometer helped my kitchen confidence a lot. My mom cooked everything to death and then some so I’m paranoid about drying everything out. A thermometer tells me exactly where I am and gives me more control to ensure I don’t overlook stuff. But it also ensures I don’t kill people. 
"I get different results every time as well. The only part that stays the same is I for introverted, which is incredibly obvious anyway.

Personalities are very complex. There are sort of similar (as in, they're tests/surveys) and much more reliable tools that help to examine certain areas of our personalities, but they are almost solely used by people who work in psychology/psychiatry and know how to interpret the results properly. There is no test that will give a short yet accurate summation of someone's entire personality."

"As per the original, this 'window' of time comes about because it's the time between me doing my son's bedtime and my wife finishing her lessons for the evening. I do generally cook us dinner during this period too. I'm not a saint but neither is this strictly 'me' time we're talking about. "
"This is a lot of guessing on my part, but I have a feeling she's regretting being married to you. Every part of this screams ""fight for me,"" in a super unproductive way, through passive-aggression. Making you jump through hoops for sex whereas before it was casual, ""I have nowhere to be"" ""I have to play by your schedule,"" paying you $100 for an owed $40, all of this sounds like someone who feels trapped and has to assert herself in whatever way she can because she feels like she's stuck. Honestly the way you describe everything here kind of makes me think you're completely oblivious to her too... you said at the top that generally everything is fine except for sex, and called this a ""tantrum"" (2 year olds tantrum, and it's not this), etc. IDK man I think you ought to get counseling or at least sit down and tell her that you've noticed that something is up, and you feel like you've done something wrong somewhere and will let her talk without interrupting. This sounds so much like things are not fine, and that the sex this is the only problem that you've noticed. If she has a lot of anger and thoughts built up and hasn't communicated it yet, maybe if you care, you need to make some space for it"
"Yeah - victory gulp it! 

(Sorry I just really wanted to say it too, is it an american expression or did the two of you just make it up?) "
"You can say this so freely because you have all of the information.  All that OP knew was that her good friend was about to break up with her boyfriend.  Your post implies that one partner draining a bank account and running off is a normal, expected part of a breakup....it isn't.  "
"Okay, try this:  pretend that you're about to break up with your boyfriend/girlfriend.  You tell your best friend that it's going to be really hard, but you're going to finally do it this weekend.  She immediately picks up the phone and calls your partner and says ""thingpaint is about to dump you!"".  He/she freaks out, and instead of a private breakup, you now have a very messy one that involves  other people and torched friendships.


How do you feel about your best friend in this scenario?"
"So you posted 11 months ago about your girlfriend wanting to move in with you but her son was a problem. You admitted he has lots of behavior issues likely due to your girlfriend's poor parenting. You said you're pretty sure he has ADHD but she's an anti-vaxer and anti-medication so it won't be treated. You had tons of people saying don't move in together and now you're somehow surprised that it's a shit show? What?

Edit for spelling."
Who the fuck would want to be married to someone who thought that way though?
"That said, he should figure out what HE wants to do, not respond to ultimatums. 

She should be his support, not his only reason."
His key should not work in their home locks upon his return
"&gt; make my wife not hate me forever

She would have every right to. You should leave, your relationship is over."
"thank you. I was bullied pretty badly most of my school time and he knows that. But since he was always kind of a popular kid he never really cared and especially shook her behaviour off as childish play rather than to defend me. I always looked beyond it. I really don't want any drama anymore and there would be drama if I joined the trip. I told him I would probably spoil the whole experience anyways, oh well "
"If you are only doing ""meaningless bits,"" then maybe you should re-evaluate your life? Why should she want to date someone who never has anything interesting about his day to talk about?"
"He cut contact with you. He chose not to have you in his life. He could have reached out at any point In the last 3 years and yet he hasn't. 

Please respect that choice.

How he came to that decision and how much his wife influenced that decision is not your business.

His wife is about to lose her husband and he is about to lose his life. Try to see past your pleasant memories of him and acknowledge that at least two lives are about to be devasted. Yours is not one of them. Your daily life and your future will carry on pretty much unaffected seeing as you've not had him in your life for 3 years.

Find a way of healing or resolving your feelings without upsetting what little they have left of their lives together please."
"You seem a lot more worried about what your friends think of you and your girlfriend than about your girlfriend’s feelings. 

Different deaths affect people in different ways. Someone I knew pretty well lost a child and I was bummed but y’know, pretty okay. My coffee barista of six months lost her child and I was a fucking water fountain of messy tears for a week. 

Grief is hard to predict. Support your girlfriend and stop betraying her by letting your friends shit on her behind her back. 

ETA also forgot about this but when I was in my early twenties a friend of a friend died and even though we’d only spent one (awesome) evening hanging out I was a wreck. He and I had just clicked and really related to each other and it just deeply affected me when he passed much moreso than when even other people around my age who I knew better had died. I saw myself on him and related to him more than others even though our relationship was limited to six hours and a few Facebook messages. Grief is a funny thing. "
This is what I came here to ask 
"I feel sorry for your girlfriend. You knew it was there and didn't take precautions to stop her from seeing it. This is literally relationship ruining stuff we're dealing with here. 

As the other commenter has said, your girlfriend is never going to be unable to see you having sex with your ex girlfriend. She might not be able to get over it and it could kill your relationship. 

I think even if you did some sweet things to try to make it up to her it wouldn't be enough. She has to be able to come to terms with it herself and that's not something you can expedite with chocolates or expensive dinner dates.

Be more careful in future..."
"Break up with her, you already wasted enough of her time and she needs to start dating NOW if she wants to have a kid. 

You stole a lot of years from her because you didn't bother thinking about the future. "
OP seems to be from England where the age of consent is 16
Fucking their mom the whole time
"SAME. Snoop, you've inspired me."
"Avoid the guy. But talk to a lawyer (legal aid) in case he tries to black mail you later or something 


Don’t tell your parents.  He can’t- what’s he going to say- I watched porn and saw yor daughter?  You should pretend it was someone else who looked like yiu"
"...not really. From his girlfriend's perspective, if OP really wanted to be with her, then he would have also been upset about ending the relationship and not totally chill with sleeping with this other girl. And that's kind of the truth from OP's perspective--while they were broken up, he didn't feel conflicted about sleeping with someone else. Now, he's totally in the right to feel like that, there was no moral obligation to stay chaste. However, being in a relationship means looking at this from your SO's perspective and understanding why she's upset and hurt by his actions."

"You should see a therapist very quickly and consider couple therapy as well. What happened has already happened and he can't undo them. If you want to give it a try, you need to let it go."
"This is a huge red flag for controlling asshole. This behaviour is only going to escalate. He will try to exert more and more control over what you wear, then it will be who you can be friends with, where you can go, maybe what you can eat. If you argue or don't agree to his unfair demands, he might even hit you. He's already ""causing you to have an unhappy day"" by bullying you when he doesn't like what you choose to wear. This is not a good guy and you can't fix him. He doesn't very you as a partner, he views you as a possession. He's a sexist pig. I don't know you but I know you can do better."
"He may get his own place/job but if mom still has her hooks on him it won't matter because she'll be just as intrusive then as she is now. That's why he needs therapy to develop tools to create hard boundaries with what sounds like a mentally ill mother. His mom won't change, so your BF will have to make change happen by being the one who controls when/where/how long he is willing to stay in her presence."
oh good - I really wanted to know how much that was in bananas!
"&gt; My eldest daughter has told me straight out that she wants me to divorce him.

I identify with your eldest daughter. My mom spent 20 years in a failed marriage, being the only one who was really trying to make it work. 20 miserable years because ""jesus"" and ""commitment"". My early teenage years were spent waiting for the divorce so I could be free. Get a good lawyer. You probably think you are strong enough to weather his abuses, but the kids are stuck there with you. One of them clearly wants out."
Your BF should give up his covert body shaming of you that he presents as caring.
"Seriously dude, you can't even imagine how horrible brains zaps are. "
"Even if he wouldn't who is there to stop one of his (john's) to assault him or your kids? He broke your trust, violated your home and worse endangered your children. I understand your wife loves her brother but she needs to love her children who need her more. She isn't doing this and if you leave she might leave them alone with him again. You cannot allow this. Yes schedule an emergency custody hearing stat and get your children out of that situation. If things don't change and she is willing to destroy her marriage and endanger her children go ahead and divorce her, let's she how much the courts think this house is just hers and not yours as well. Sorry that does sound vindictive but I have no respect for parents who don't make their children safety a priority (one of them is a 5 year old for Christ's sake!). 

Never under any circumstance leave your children alone with him. 

I am so sorry, this is very unfair to you and the stress you must have right now must be overwhelming.

I second gathering as much evidence as you can. Maybe the texts from him John and other communications you've had with your wife about this. Good luck"
Really? Don’t think I’d agree that snapping at someone in this context constitutes “anger issues”. 
"&gt; He doesn't have the money to go for a month but does have the money to go for a week, so he's going for a week

So if he uses up all of his money on this week long trip, how long will it be until he can afford a month long trip?  He will have to start over saving money to go there with you someday.  
"
"So, I think it's a little thoughtless. Not a hill I'd choose to die on by any means, but I'd be annoyed, lol. Have a conversation with him. Express that you would like wine related gifts to be consumed together.

My husband and I are like this with shrimp. I'm not sure why shrimp, specifically, but we both love it and a good ring is fucking expensive so we have an unofficial rule that one can't eat it without the other, lol."
"Rejection definitely hurts, and I can understand how it can affect his self-esteem and make him want to initiate less. But with all due respect he sounds like a spoiled child. He's in the 99th percentile of sex frequency, and he's now pouting and refusing to initiate (which is basically putting her in the same emotional frame as him: hurt and rejected) because he dropped to the 98th percentile.

He needs to not initiate more than once per day. She needs to make sure she's initiating at least half the time."
"My childhood cat just passed away and we think she was around 19 or 20. She was VERY old and frail by the time she passed. She was an indoor/outdoor cat and then my mom moved so she lived the last part of her life as an indoor cat. I will say that in the last 2 or so years, she REALLY slowed down and her mood changed a lot. She mostly just wanted to curl up next to the fire and be warm and sleep. You may see some behavior changes in your cat as it gets older, and that may be go-time for trying to have kids, especially because it will be a bare minimum of 9 months before the kid is around. Also when the baby is very small, I imagine it won't be left alone much, especially in the range of the cat, so you may have some buffer time there."
"God, no,

That poor man."

His smell has changed? He needs to see a doctor. This could indicate a physical problem.
"I read it and thought ""Wow, this is packed too full of obvious, over-the-top metaphors that don't end, just get to the point already.""

**BUT** it's a great example of how certain people can have personalities and conversational styles that align very well with one another. I agree, between the two of them, he likely finds this to be a major attraction and she should remember that it's not all looks on either side of a relationship."
"I just think it's kind of shitty of him because op's been putting off their trip for him because he can't afford it even though she can, and instead of saving for the time in the summer that they were supposed to go he's spending what money he has on going now. It sounds like he's been a little dishonest about whether he actually wants to go with her, whereas she was actively saving up for it and planning for it. You're right, they can be individuals but she's making plans based on what seems like disingenuous information from him. "
"Firstly, do not go back for another appointment. You should not ever be alone with him again. Don't confront him either, it's not your job to inform him that he screwed up or punish him. Your safety and well-being is the highest priority in this situation.

Secondly, sit down and try to write down as much as you can remember about the timeline. What was the first thing he did that made you uncomfortable? Can you pinpoint the date that it happened? In retrospect, were there things he did that you didn't realise were off at the time, but you now think were inappropriate? How long after the first inappropriate thing did he escalate? Do you remember the date, or roughly when it was? Can you remember word for word any of what he said, and the dates that he said it? Did he ever send you emails or texts? Do you have a record of when your appointments were? The more time that passes, the fewer details you will recall. So record as much now as you can. Did you talk to anyone about this, or send any text messages? Write that down as well. Be as clear and detailed as possible. Like this:

'On November 14, John asked me about my sex life. I told him I wasn't currently seeing anyone. I felt uncomfortable, but didn't know what to say.' 

'During a session sometime in December, John asked me if I had ever given a blow job. I felt really uncomfortable, and tried to change the subject.'

'On January 5, John sat next to me during the session, and touched my thigh several times.'

The next thing you need to do is figure out what kind of practitioner he is, so you know what organization to make a formal complaint to. Look at his business card if you have it, or go to the website of the clinic you were seeing him at. Usually there will be some letters after his name (something like R.Psych or RCC). Then Google ""(those letters) + (your state/province)"" to pull up the website of the registration body. If he is a psychologist in British Columbia, it would be the College of Psychologists of British Columbia, for example. If you poke through the website, there should be a section for filing a formal complaint about a registrant. That's where you submit all of the information you wrote out. If you run into any difficulty with this, feel free to message me and I would be happy to help you figure it out.

I'm very sorry this happened to you. It's basically the most egregious kind of misbehavior a mental health professional can engage in, because it is SOOOOOO clearly unethical. There's no shades of grey here, this dude fucked up big time, and he absolutely knows it. "
"&gt; It doesn’t mean OP then should be a shit partner

Refusing to be someone's punching bag when you did nothing wrong is not beign a shit partner.

You don't owe it to anyone to explain your past sexual life."
"&gt; ""Primary man""

Yo, is there a sign up list for ""secondary men"" anywhere? See a girl 1-2 days a week, go out on a date and guaranteed sex with no other commitment?"
"This is a great perspective. I was in first class on a plane. This guy sits in the seat in front of me. Later another woman, dressed professionally sits next to him. They obviously don’t know each other. The guy spills his drink and the woman frantically wipes up the mess on his tray and he just sits there and lets her! 

I cringed so hard. This woman who probably has a great job and so subservient to this guy. The guy, who was in his sixties played the sexism role by letting her do it. This was so many years ago and it really hit me how some people can fall into sexist roles, even though their lives may not present that way."
Alternate theory: she is saying these things because she wants OP to get jealous and forbid her to have sex with those other men.
Yeah right. You know that Obama was Kenyan Muslim Commie Dictator. :) 
"In the vein of not being obtuse, let's realize that he was badgering her for sex two times a day over what she wanted and was apparently quite indifferent to the decline in her sex drive. In fact, he did more than express disappointment. They argued over it. "
I'd place a bet that she won't listen; she'll think she's better than the Stanford grad.
"It seems that by making the suggestion that OP and her cat move out and they continue their relationship, OP's bf has made a decision. "
"I'm sorry my initial post wasn't that helpful.

It's really normal for women to require clitoral stimulation. I think most women do. I think you need to explain that to him. It's best to do it some time you are comfortable, but not right before or after sex. Make sure he gets the connection to oral. You might need to strait up explain what a clitoris is because I think he might be a bit clueless. "
"Yes, it's definitely a friend break up. As well, our social circles don't even overlap much anymore, since most of our mutual friends that Nora and I are close with have already distanced themselves from Helen. At this point we're considering a phone call or something along those lines. "
"&gt;  Then that's it! All it takes is a phone call. 

Phones work both ways. You seem to have learned nothing about being in a partnership and what apologizing truly means. You were never sorry. Your apologies were insincere, as evidenced by the tantrum you throw when it's not accepted. "
"Fair, I will tell him so. I think that’s a good point, and it’s come up a lot in the thread. "
"You probably should not get an abortion given your feelings.  Your boyfriend is entitled to change his mind, but he can't change your mind for you, and you deserve to be angry that has done so.  Abortion or not, I think it's pretty likely this relationship is over: either your resentment over feeling forced to abort kills it, or he walks away and leaves you as a single parent if you keep it.  I would urge you to make a decision that is best for you and does not involve an envisioned future with this specific man.  This is happening to your body, and the decision on what to do with your body is yours alone.  He gets an opinion, but no more than that."
"I agree, I had no idea people would actually take that stance."
"Not trying to diagnose her over the Internet but she sounds exactly like my cousin with severe BPD she refuses to try to treat, down to the eating disorder and lies of abuse. Honestly it really annoys me when people justify it by saying, ‘Well that’s her reality’ - I see where they’re coming from but at the same time it’s NOT reality and she’s ruined a lot of people’s lives with her behaviour/lies. It doesn’t help that she seems consciously aware of using her diagnosis to manipulate people (e.g. saying she’s going to act depressed to get her mother to buy her things.) I’m glad people watch out for abuse but some people really do lie about things like this, it’s not always the scapegoat dynamic."
"Good. Because you chastise your SO for doing something that is addictive and use an addictive substance to deal with your feelings/problems.
You guys are done. You love him, but it doesn't seem like you are compatible. It's obviously a big deal to you and a big breach of trust, prob not going to be able to repair that. The thing with breaking up is you let go. You let go of control- what happens to him after is on him, not you. Just take care of yourself- you have mentioned body issues of your own and are using alcohol in a very unhealthy way. Maybe finding a good therapist who can talk through this stuff with you would be worthwhile."
That's what I was thinking too
Divorce. Your marriage is a train wreck. 
You don't want him in her life. People have a hard time accepting that sometimes it REALLY IS better to have NO relationship with their parent then the kind of relationship they would have. Do you really want to make your daughter spend time with someone who doesn't feel warm towards her? Who won't show her the affection she's going to expect meeting her father? 
Nooo. He shouldn't humor her or spend his money due to her being ridiculous 
Your boyfriend is talking about passing you around like a blow-up sex doll and you're still with him?  Where the hell is your self respect girl? 
Per se* and it is most definitely harassment after years of no reciprocation. 
"At 25 and unemployed for six months, you shouldn’t be spending your savings on dates and frivolous gifts. I feel like you’re both old enough to recognize that. "
"Why is that so absurd? Most people have that one friend or acquaintance that just got weirdly bigoted out of the blue on that one subject that one time. I highly doubt he would just sit there, but someone getting really verbally or physically aggressive is going to be scary as hell no matter what. Being a trans woman is dangerous, especially in dating - we don't know her past experiences either. Maybe she's still getting used to dating or something and thinks him telling his friends before would let her know what to expect and weed out the bad apples. I'm guessing it's something along those lines. Should have said something, though. Lots of trans people don't want anyone to know and that would be my default."
"Just be thankful it's your house, and not jointly owned. Find someone who will respect you, you're still young luckily. Sorry to say but she's not committed to you. "
"Okay so delete and block him from everything 

Go see a counselor, there’s ton of options for relatively cheap care. Do not stop looking until you find someone who will listen and take you seriously, and help you (its easy enough but there are a few bad apples) 

Go to the gym. Paint. Scream at the forest or a lake. Be upset and be angry, be hurt 

But also, get up and move along and move on. You’re going to be hurt you’re going to be afraid of men you’re going to hate the world. 

Just let yourself, then also notice what makes you happy. A little flower, a good song, a sunset or a sunrise. A baby or a puppy. 

Be happy when you can and let it guide you. 

You can manage this"
At a catered event? It's a pain in the ass.
"Oh no, a woman with standards! How dare she!"
"&gt; I don't feel I'm being unreasonable in saying we are not attending. I feel like my loyalty is obviously with my wife more, and what choice to they leave me with?  

OP you are overreacting. This stance is when people in your personal life(family, friends) fail to accommodate your wife.   

Expecting your company to do so is plain silly &amp; foolish. Additionally you are new and demanding such things makes you seem out of touch and entitled.   

Others comments have given you workable &amp; reasonable solutions. Either go alone or take your wife but post her finishing her meal .  "
[deleted]
"To me, abuse is a pattern. It's possible that OP has noticed other weird, jealous, abuse red flags without knowing what they were."
"Agreed. It's never the responsibility of the shitty dog owner, just everyone else who has to accommodate endlessly."
"You did not list ""I am 100% sure that I do not want kids"", so.... I'd probably not do one. That's pretty much the first last and only reason. "
Do other co-workers share your assessment of her?
"Fair enough, though I think six beers is significant, even for a tall guy. My ex was about the same size and would be noticeably intoxicated by that point, though not wasted. And people can be jerks without being completely wasted.

I don't actually think OP has a problem, I was more just trying to cover all bases as we only get one side of the story and it's *possible* he's glossing over things. "
"It's not how often you think of them, it's the anger and bitterness that gets stirred up when you do. That shit actually has physical health as well as emotional health consequences. You need to work on letting it go. Therapy would really help. It would also be a sign to your girlfriend that you're taking her concerns seriously."
"&gt;A family of her own

Does she not see your children as part of her family?

&gt;put her life on hold

So the time she's spent with your kids doesn't count?  

Is there a chance she just wants your kids to grow up and go away so she can have her own perfect family?  Things to think about."
"Your daughter is old enough at 14 to decide whether she wants to maintain any relationship with you or to see you. She is not just some possession you have custody rights to. If she decides she wants nothing to do with you (which would be perfectly understandable in the circumstances!) no family court judge is going to enforce visitation or force her to maintain contact with you. You can storm over to your ex-wife’s house and demand to see her as much as you like, but that won’t achieve anything and will only make her hate you even more and think you are even more of a jerk than she already does."
[deleted]
"Ok, how much younger is this woman?"
"TL;DR: Heed your parents' warning. I've been in your shoes and their shoes, they are probably right. They have probably been through something like this and don't want you to make the same mistakes they did. Also, if they're as close as you say they are, they don't want to purposely hurt you. If you think they're biast, ask a friend.

______________________________
So I see your story from so many different perspectives.

7 years ago, I was you. In a relationship with a guy I thought was nice and sweet and just needed a little fixing. Lived long distance, I was the one making the effort to travel. We were best friends. But everyone seemed less than thrilled. As time went on he gave less and less shits about my family (who I'm extremely close with) to the point that if they came over and visited me when BF was living with me, he literally ignored they were there and played video games not 4 feet away from them. And I was convinced that I was the the one not putting in enough effort. It took me getting into a major car accident, breaking my leg, and him being an unreasonable ass for me to realize that he's the problem, not me. But that whole time, I never saw what other people saw so I couldn't understand why they hated him.

Flash forward to 4 years ago and here's the 2nd perspective, the outsider looking in. I saw my best friend go through the same kind of guy I dealt with. I tried to warn her and hint that maybe they're not a good fit and I was assured everything was fine. She was convinced it was her fault things weren't going well, yada yada. No matter what I said, I just ""Didn't know the situation.."". After a few years they finally broke up because he, and I quote, ""Didn't see the relationship as benifical to him since they were no longer living together"". 

The 3rd perspective is of someone who found true love. When you do find someone who is ""the one"" it feels like nothing you've ever felt before. You don't have to fix anything about them because you accept them for their flaws and then THEY choose to change it to better themselves for you. And the person you'd want to marry is a partner, not someone that doesn't tell you they'll be back at 8am after partying all night with men and women. Looking at how you describe your relationship, it looks like a Trainwreck where he doesn't want to try and you're trying way to hard.

I would listen to your parents. They don't like him because they feel that it's wrong. They have no reason to make up these feelings. Even with the complaining, if he was a good guy for you and you were being crazy, they would probably tell you so that you wouldn't drive away a good guy. But he doesn't seem like a good guy. You parents have no reason to lie to you."
It seems like you're just being used. Run and run fast.
"Maybe she’s paranoid and just left it out to not incriminate him online? Should probably ignore it and focus on the issue at hand:

Your boyfriend is who he is and you either love him for who he is or you don’t."
"Newborns are incapable of being ""chill"" or laughing. They only thing they can do is cry and grunt. "
Why wouldn't you want to educate yourself and something so serious before hand? I am a decade away from having kids but I educate myself because I'll need to know some day. Honestly people would be better parents if they would just learn BEFORE the process started
"This is weird as fuck, and also depressing. Obviously they haven't exactly come to terms with his passing and seeing you in his clothes is a way for them to feel closer to him.

But you aren't him, and this is a heavy, unfair burden to put on you. You are a 24 year old grown man, why is your girlfriend and her mom acting like your parents? Politely but very firmly tell them that you aren't being unreasonable, your money is yours to spend how you want and you've been dressing yourself for a long time and don't plan to stop now.

I'd then take Felicity aside and tell her that you're sorry about her father and will always be willing to let her vent to you, but you're not comfortable dressing in his clothes and **will not** be indulging her and her mother's coping habits (word this much more gently than I did) anymore.

Stand by it. Do not give up your freedom of choice for anyone."
"Better than perpetuating the expectation that wanting something for yourself makes you shallow and materialistic. 

I bought my fiancé an Xbox for more than he paid for her ring. Why is one more acceptable than the other? You’ve never spent money on yourself I hope. "
He doesn't owe you anything just because you give him sex.  Either accept he doesn't want to do this or break up if you can't handle it.
"I think he's really quite young. Does he have any sexual experience? I have heard plenty of women, especially young ones, say that they don't find penises attractive at all, or find them funny looking. I don't think that feeling is too weird for someone with little experience. It can change a lot with actual experience. You come to appreciate your partners body parts as theirs.

I would only be hesitant if he wouldn't be willing to try for you. Whether he likes how vaginas look or not, going down on you is about making you feel good. He had to be willing to make an effort and will have to interact with your vagina in order to make sex good foryou."
"He's a narcissist who is in the idealization phase of getting to know this woman.  Once he has her in his grips he will begin to devalue her the way he did with his wife.  It's sociopathic behavior which is why he feels ""empty"" and why he has no empathy for his wife.  His wife is better off without him, he will never change and therapy will simply make him better at hiding it.  "
"So you're married to a master manipulator who legitimately upsets you with her own chosen behavior, then effectively silences you by completely turning it around on you. The language you use all over this post is very revealing. I strongly suspect your wife is the controlling one, and you walk on eggshells trying to avoid her childish inability to accept criticism. "
Pranking a four year old is getting two identical teddy bears and putting them in different spots. This was just cruelty 
"maybe back in the day

but dating around is common now a days

even in the past,the are we a thing question was an actual conversation! "
"You need to start escalating and telling him straight up that he is taking advantage of you, you can no longer serve him and if he continues to show up you will have to call the authorities. I have also been homeless before and his behavior is unacceptable and starting to get dangerous for you "
"Maybe ask your mom if you could talk to a therapist?

It's hard for parents to know how much to share about a divorce - balancing between letting kids know about what's going on, but not bad-mouthing the other parent. I don't know that kids should be told about affairs, I guess it depends, bad husbands are not necessarily bad fathers, but it's also not fair if what a kid perceives is going on is that mommy kicked daddy out, so mommy is mean, but really the mom is trying to not bad-mouth the dad to the kids, so she's not telling them that she's kicking dad out because he cheated and gave her herpes. So, it can be hard for parents to know how much to share. I DO think kid should be told about abuse, though. That you should have been told in an age-appropriate way (when daddy got angry her hurt mommy, and so mommy doesn't feel safe living with daddy anymore).

So anyway, maybe see about talking to a therapist (or school counselor?) to process your feelings about this new info, and to talk about how to deal with your father. And: You did not ""let"" anything happen, and your parents' choices are NOT your fault."
"Try to get in to see a counselor. Be clear about how time-sensitive your need is. You deserve support in making this decision, and it's not going to come from your boyfriend. "
"Thank you. I can't believe that to some ""avoid the trans girl like the plague because people might think you're gay"" is acceptable, if not sensible, advice. I am pretty floored by that."

"First thing to do is line up a new place to live, NOT with your side piece. Then, asap confess to your wife. Agree to continue paying for her and the kids's living expenses. Be generous with child support and alimony- you owe them this. 

Do NOT have any expectations of one big happy family with your kids and your side piece and her kid. This is life altering, soul scarring, emotionally devastating shit and your kids are going to need years to process this. All you can do is apologize and make things as easy as possible for them.

See a lawyer about setting up child support for the baby. Then spend some time single. You need to figure out what is damaged in you that would allow you to behave in such a hurtful, destructive manner to the people who love and trust you."
"Could it 'mean nothing'? Sure. This way: 

He recorded that tape and developed a habit of watching it / finding it arousing before you were in the picture. He didn't stop watching it as the relationship with you began and progressed, probably because of inertia + he did not think you'd know about it.

I will say that having this tape and this habit *three years* into the relationship means that, at the very least, he's kinda stupid."
They ignore you when you speak to them? I wouldn't want them in my house either.
"Yes, I leave it up to OP which areas... the crucial idea is to take charge and take on not just the physical and mental but also emotional heavy lifting.

For instance, though both mom and dad are equally in charge of picking kids up or dropping them off to classes or extracurriculars... maybe dad would be in charge of staying up to date with any change in schedules, holidays, logistics etc. that would affect the execution of those tasks.

My heart goes out to his wife and him. "

You're right that you can't change your sister, but that last bit? The bit about giving  in to her bullshit? That you *can* change, and you can change it right now. Closure isn't something she will give you, so take it for yourself. Honour and own your very reasonable anger, and cut her out until she is prepared to own up to her behaviour and make a change.

"I totally agree with this post.  You are obviously an articulate and intelligent woman and it's awful to hear that the man you love has changed so much,  but for yourself and your children it's important that you stand up for yourself in this situation.  Kids take their relationship skills from their parents and I'm sure you want to show them what a loving relationship looks like.  

I'd also like to say I'm so sorry you had to go through such emotional hurt at the time of your child's birth. If I had been there I would have gladly driven you,  and I'm a complete stranger!  You deserve so so much more xxx "

What kind of safety reasons? 
"It's a mess. You guys should have sorted this before selling. 

Legally, it's your dad's money, that's not in question. 

Your claim has no legal merit, but in a family context you've got a good point. It sounds like dad gave you the gift of $10k of a car, plus he financed the balance for you, which you paid. He didn't give an equivalent gift to your brother, I take it? 

Then he basically asked you to transfer the balance of his gift to your brother, plus asking you to give him a free loan of the portion of the paid-off car you paid for for three years. Brother didn't get a nice newish $17k car from dad, but he got the depreciated equivalent and didn't have to make any payments for it and only had to maintain it (the same way you presumably did when you held it). 

Then it sold for $5k. 

I'd ask dad for my proportion of the $5k based off of whatever percentage of the car you paid for originally. I'd consider the balance your dad's, and that he gifted you the use of it and then later gifted what was left of that that to your brother. You may feel like it was an outright gift of $10k of auto equity, but if he didn't do the same for your brother, you'd have come out seriously ahead in that deal. 

If your dad wants to give his percentage to your brother for a down payment on a new vehicle, that's on him. 

Your brother, though, is an entitled git. His suggestion is offensive, and I don't blame you a bit for sticking to your guns about it. "

"I'm so sorry. When I was in your shoes, I had an abortion, and almost 20 years later I feel fantastic about my decision. I have no regrets. I would have been stuck in poverty forever had I not had that abortion. The abortion allowed me to finish my education, have an amazing career, meet my husband and get married, and live a better life than I would have had. I have no regrets, just gratitude for the 19 year old me that made that difficult choice.
But I understand that's not the option for everyone. And if it's not the option for you, then you need to make your decisions based on your situation.

You're going to have to tell your boyfriend. He Is just as responsible as you are. Your mother-in-law's judgment must extend to him, and if she tries to blame you, point to him, and explain that he is just as responsible, and she should be talking to him too.

You can put this child up for adoption. I know it's emotionally painful, but are you in a position to provide for two babies?

If you really feel that you can give two babies the best life possible, it's going to be hard, but if you have help you can do it. Other people have, and so can you."
"Exactly! Leaving the military isn't up for debate -- it's your career which is beating *you* down day by day, not hers. She benefits from you financially providing but doesn't have to do the grunt work of your job.

Think of the RACI matrix -- Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed.

* You are solely responsible for making the decision to continue your military service or leave; She is to be informed.

* You are solely responsible for making the decisions on which new career your will pursue; She is consulted.

* Whereas, *both* of you are responsible for making the decision of where you will relocate."

"I hate when men claim to know other people's boyfriends better than them simply because they both have penises. Dude, you don't know the guys she's talking about, she does. The only thing I can think when I see stuff like this is that it makes you incredibly insecure that another man doesn't have the same dependency on porn that you do and so you simply must accuse them of lying. You tell yourself that you watch porn because, as a man, it's a biological necessity. Well I'm sorry, but you watch porn because you can, not because you need to. Plenty of men have chosen not to partake, and they're doing just fine."
"Yeah, and the thing about how it's not her fault that she can't work because she's depressed. It all makes her look so bad that it's almost unbelievable someone would post it sincerely.

I also suffer from a medical condition which is why I feel tired a lot of the time and have no energy.

"You're confusing doing stuff around the house with quality time with your partner. A healthy relationship needs both - it needs both partners to pull their weight around the house (groceries, cooking, kids, etc) but you also need to spend quality time together (date nights, hobbies together, having good conversation that doesn't involve chores or the kids, being affectionate, etc...)

It sounds like you're not doing enough of the latter to nurture the relationship. Your partner has tried to communicate that she's not getting what she needs, and instead of prioritizing her you are just making excuses for why you're tired.

You need to start putting effort into this relationship or it's going to continue it's already slow death"

But if you genuinely don't like her, or you feel that a substantial amount of the stuff y'all do in your spare time would offend her sensibilities then yeah you should cut her loose regardless of how quick she is to give it up."

"I really wanted to second this suggestion, and of course I upvoted it.

Letting her go first right after the MC thanks everyone takes away every single reasonable complaint she has that you thwarted her, and allows many, many people to go later and completely erase the bad taste in their mouth she's going to leave.

The MC can even introduce the concept that each person reading today has chosen their own reading, so she completely owns the embarrassment.

Everyone else can also reference each other's readings (not hers!) with, ""I found so-and-so's very moving, thank you for doing that.""

There's so many ways you can raise up the kind words, and simply ignore her cruelty, that you don't need to even address directly."
"I mean, this is a real Sophie's choice. 

You don't say how old the kids are, but I am not sure how much that matters, anyway. I am not a parent. 

You can't go be miserable for the rest of your life. It's a terrible life and a terrible example. You also can't abandon your kids.  So, I am going to spitball a few ideas: 

-can you split your time?  Like, get a small place for yourself and fly back as often as possible? 

-if you decide to stay, can you fly home enough for the kids?  Can they spend summers with you?  Can you feasibly get sufficient time with them despite the distance? 

-can you go back home (without resentment) until the kids leave high school and then go back east?  

-can you, as a family, agree to make going east more of a priority for vacations/weekends, etc. Would that even help? 

I am mostly concerned about the kids, because my mother dumped us on our father when we were 7 &amp; 9, because she wanted to pursue some other stuff. We saw her every other weekend and special occasions. We didn't have a great dad, which makes it worse than your situation, but regardless, we felt totally abandoned. We didn't get a choice, though, and our dad sucked, so maybe that was the real problem. I dunno. "
"These people don’t really sound like your friends to be honest.

"My parents dog was a biter. Food aggressive at first, then my parents made it aware they were afraid. He ruled the roost. He bit every member of my family including me. We all went to the training sessions. Dog learned stuff, my parents certainly didn't.

Long story short, dog spent a couple years on his biting rampage, until he bit one of their friends... Who is a judge.

Don't let that dog go unrestrained long enough to bite a judge. "
"I had a talk with him after I was bitten by the dog and warned him that if anything happened to my cat I would put my foot down about the dog going. I think I was a little too soft yesterday in the initial shock of it all. I mentioned all of these thing to him after he bit me: what if he attacks someone else? What if he attacks a child? What if he kills my cat? I told him that the fact that the dog's violent behavior is so unpredictable is the worst thing about it. He insisted that he would work to identify the triggers and train the dog not to attack. But at this point I'm already scared whenever the dog starts running towards me, even when we're playing in the yard. I've made far too many concessions about this in the last few months and let my boyfriend call the shots without putting my foot down and now my cat has paid for it. Excruciatingly. I'm mad at myself for even being in this situation. I should have prevented it."
"The moment the dog showed aggression to any human a trainer should have been involved.

People make excuses for their pets. He was guarding his person...he was scared...he was abused in the past...etc.  now, yes, aggression does have various root causes and management will differ depending on that cause. But that part is what the trainer is there to help with. For the owner, the only part that should matter is that aggression should NEVER be ignored or dismissed. It MUST be taken seriously and can't be allowed, no matter how reasonable the dog's actions might have been from the dog's perspective. It's harsh and not fair, but it is the trade dogs make to exist in the human world. When a toddler pulls a dog's tail, it doesn't always matter that the parents' should have been supervising better or that the dog was reacting to pain. In many cases none of that will save the dog from being put down. And maybe if the owners hadn't made excuses the first time the dog stared down the kid or lifted his lip, things could have been corrected before they ended up with a dead dog and a mauled child. 

The boyfriend did a grave disservice to this dog by making excuses for the first two incidents. Every aggressive incident that goes unchecked increases the risk of more in the future. This dog may well be salvaged...but it would take a lot of work and heartfelt dedication. And they may never be able to have the two animals safely together. It doesn't sound like the boyfriend is the type who can handle the commitment of caring for an aggressive animal WITHOUT excuses.

OP, if you do decide to rehome vs. euthanasia, you need to ensure your boyfriend is 100 percent up front about the dog's history. No excuses, no minimizing. Personally, I wouldnt be comfortable adopting a dog with history out. At the very least I would insist that the new owner has to schedule with a behaviorist before you turn the dog over, and I would even urge you to attend the first session so you can give details of the incidents."

Do you plan on treating him and buying him nice meals? 

What if your SO simply doesn't have the money to treat you? 

You can find someone who likes to be treated. I'd just like to say I've been with partners who always wanted to be treated and those that I'd literally have to fight to let me pay for stuff and I always enjoyed paying for the latter more because it felt like a privilege to be able to buy them something.

"There are several factors : 

- you guys are young, it takes experience to navigate these kind of things

- the fact that you're in a relationship or in a complicated situation will not stop people from sleeping with you (works with girls too)

- People will develop feelings event if at first they were just friends, and not having them reciprocated can hurt. Most smart people will take distance after that. They don't owe you their friendship either. 

- Can you make it stop ? Probably not, it will calm down in a few years though. Be carefull about hanging out on one to one or sharing a bit too much feelings. Quite a lot of guys will mistake this as a form of romantic interest.

"As a woman on the same side of this, the second your nartner starts prioritising ex's over you is the second you need to get gone. I had an ex basically do this to me throughout our relationship and it made me extraordinarily paranoid. I then found out he was cheating. So there you go."
"You’re not overreacting especially if she has told your friend “I don’t like her anyways”. It sounds like a lot of drama will happen if you and that girl both attend. Best to avoid that. Don’t put yourself in a situation that can be toxic.

However be the bigger person and excuse yourself from the trip. He clearly wants her there and I understand why your feelings are hurt. Explain to him that it’s not an ultimatum but that you feel like it wouldn’t be for the best if you go and that you still want to be friends with him. "

"That's not great, but it's not the worst either. Have you apologized to your girlfriend and shown her that it won't happen again? Have you told her each time a girl flirts with you since then?

The fact is that the trust in your relationship is broken and as much as your girlfriend thinks having access to your accounts will help, *it won't*. I've seen the pattern where it just makes the resentment build and causes tons of petty fights as one partner or another misreads account activity or conversations.

You two should figure out a way to communicate without handing over account access, and find a way to rebuild trust. If it's been 8 months and it still hasn't been repaired then it might be best to reconsider if this is the relationship you want to be in."
"Is there a chance that he wrote it as a way to sort through his thoughts in a moment where he was angry or upset or something and he never intended for you to find it?

My notebooks are full of angry letters and pro/con lists like that regarding quitting jobs or school and ending relationships. I'd probably die if any of the targets of these letters actually found them, so I usually throw them away quickly and strategically, but writing them helps me to calm down. By writing out the thoughts that are upsetting to me, I realise how irrational they are. Trust that if he actually wanted a divorce, he'd get a divorce. "

Telling you that if you loved your mom you would do it is the grossest kind of emotional manipulation.

Please, next time this comes up, tell them ""I am not changing my hair. If you don't want me in the wedding because of that, just let me know. Otherwise this topic is closed.""

"Neither you nor your kids are wrong for feeling the way they feel, but your behavior could cause resentment and distance with your children. It's not fair, but it's a fact. I think there are pros and cons on each side but if you compromise, you would have a deeper, stronger connection with your children and I think that pro trumps the con of feeling a little awkward at a family gathering.

&gt;It would feel like a huge lie to invite someone, pretend they're welcome to a family gathering, when they're not. 

If you invite them over and make them feel welcome, then you are actually making them welcome to a gathering. It's not a lie. You would be hiding your discomfort at the situation but you are not lying about them being welcome.

&gt; I don't care for them in the same way that I don't care for a stranger I might see passing in the street. 

While you feel the same for the half-siblings as you do for a stranger on the street, that doesn't mean they are the same thing. Instead of it being like pulling a random passerby off the street into your home for dinner, it's more like meeting your kid's best friend or spouse. You can't love the spouse the way your kid does, but you can welcome their presence because of your kid's love of them. No one expects you to be a perfect Christlike fount of love for strangers, but welcoming non-family members to a family gathering is generous, warm, and as another poster said, classy. 

It's your choice but if I were you, I would choose the magnanimous route. It is an opportunity for you to grow and for your kids to witness positive model behavior. It seems like all of the pro's of inviting them over are stacked up against the one con of you not wanting to feel awkward. I don't even think it'd be that awkward for you and you might warm up to them. Good luck either way!

Funny how you mention Sam's name ten times but your girlfriend's none. 
I have noticed a trend on this sub where people just lack self-respect completely.

"He didn't tell you because he knew you wouldn't like it.


That doesn't mean he's cheating, or that it means anything more than that he wanted to get his friend a nice gift. Perhaps, seeing how you liked your necklace, he just assumed another girl would also appreciate something similar. But, whatever his reasoning was for buying it, he lied about it to you, and actually went to some lengths to make you think he'd bought something else. He knew you wouldn't like it, even if it were bought for completely innocent reasons, and so rather than deal with that, he made something up.


This is not an acceptable response to conflict in a relationship, and you need to have a serious discussion with him about why he lied (and why he thought expensive jewellery was an appropriate present for a friend, because unless he showers all his friends with the same level of generous gifts, then it IS weird). The problem is, even if he really doesn't think of her as more than a friend, he just broke your trust. If he lied to you about this, what else is he lying about? Maybe nothing, but how are you supposed to believe that now? "

"Yeah there's going to be a lot of fallout if she takes any violent action towards them. My college sometimes gets racist groups rallying on the campus, because it's a public location and they know exactly how far they can go without crossing the line. If any students react to them physically they are recording and ready to push lawsuits for it. They take the video and use it as a promotional tool to show people evidence of minorities acting like animals. It's disgusting and manipulative but legal and, sadly, effective. 

You could potentially talk to your girlfriend about this aspect of it, but I'm not sure that's the right thing to do. It's important that she doesn't ever make this physical, for her well-being especially, but talking to her about why the racist assholes can't face direct consequences from her after they've said those things can easily make it look like you're siding with them and shifting the focus from the main problem, their remarks, to the secondary issue, her reaction.

Since you're in a high school and not a college, I would keep trying to look for support from the school. If you or her have any teachers you trust, it may help to have them listen to the situation. Having your parents back you guys up on this will help too. And if you're not getting the right response, keep escalating. *Someone* will hopefully see what a potential PR disaster this could be for them and take action. 

It's also important that you publicly and privately show yourself to be on your girlfriend's side when these things happen. "
"I think you might be right. The two possibilities I can see here are:

- she wants to have her cake and eat it
- she's insecure and feels like if she lets him sleep with other women that she'll keep the relationship going

"&gt;ask why, if he's a total genius, he can't figure out how to put plates in hot water and rub a soapy sponge on the until clean.

Dear Lord, this. This was nearly a decade ago, but I will *never* forget teaching my then-25-year-old ex-boyfriend how to wash a dish. ""Okay, so you hold the sponge like this, and then you scrub it... *No don't put that in the drainer* there's tons of shit still on it Jesus Christ."" I actually had to physically demonstrate how to hold a plate up against the light at an angle to see all the crap he left behind. 

It made a lot more sense once he told me that when he was in high school, his mother stopped folding his clothes for him... but didn't stop doing his laundry. So his solution was to *throw his clean clothes on the floor* and sort through the piles when he wanted something. Guess what else I painstakingly showed him how to do?

I basically taught him all the things his real mother didn't, and I wish I hadn't. I wish I'd told him to Google that shit, that he was a quarter-century old, and that I wasn't his fucking maid. I mean, Christ, kid, do you want me to wipe your butthole for you, too? Teach you how to blow your nose? Do the airplane noise so you'll eat your broccoli?

Being “prettier” does NOT make her as nice, caring, funny, or whatever, as you! He is with you and not her for a reason (and it’s not because he’s settling for you).

Let's shop together"" or just use it herself like ""ooh a sephora gift card, time to splurge."" No interaction with the guy necessary, just using the gifts. 

Plus she said that he said he wants her to enjoy his fame too. They were together for 11 years. Perhaps he's just doing all of this *out of sheer guilt* and wanting to relieve it? People do weird stuff to relieve guilt but it doesn't necessarily mean they want the person back. 

I understand it must be frustrating but if it doesn't constitute an RO, she's afraid to stand up for herself for her career fame and also doesn't want to move homes, then she should just....accept it and take it in stride? Once or twice a year roses and gifts doesn't sound like the most malicious thing in the world. "
"$5k is about 5% of his total yearly income post-tax. 

Anybody here would freak if their spouse spent 5k on somebody without telling them.

But people in this thread are actually *defending* him withholding this information from the woman he's planning to marry?

Frankly, I'm speechless.

There was literally a post yesterday with a woman who had racked up some credit card debt to help her mom without telling her husband and every racked her over the coals and said her husband should divorce her ass.

But some guy with a too-close relationship with his BFF gives her 5k without breathing a word to his fiance and everybody is hunky-dory with it. I see how it is."

That's just... kind of awkward to expect him to post that information out there immediately.

It seems like if she is really into openly identifying as trans, then at some point she will probably see fit to mention it to these people as she gets to know them, or he will mention it if it comes up. 

I imagine she is just scared that he's only okay with it in a vacuum, and wants to make sure before she gets too attached that he has her back and isn't gonna one day be like ""well my friends found out and now I'm suddenly not okay with it, bye,"" but it seems like she's got to either take a leap of faith or accept that if she wants certain aspects of her identity to be known, it is likely on her to advertise them where she sees fit."

Why?  

See, that's the thing about ultimatums...they only have credibility if you actually follow through with them. Now he has even less incentive to get a job than he did before, because he knows you have no conviction in your decisions.  

As another poster has pointed out, what would he do if he were single? He would b *forced* to get a job, right? So by definition he is using you to live an easy life.  

Not having a job is one thing, and it is somewhat understandable that he wouldn't want to just jump into the first thing that comes along (although a year is just taking the piss, frankly) but the absolute minimum I would expect is for him to take care of ALL housework and chores. If you are earning the money, his ""job"" is to keep the house ticking over.  

If he's not even doing that, just sleeping in and playing video games all day, it's time to say goodbye.

"Ugh, JFC, as a dentist, this kind of behavior grates on my nerves. 

I don't even like seeing family at my practice. I've got crazy family members who would abuse the privilege. It costs me $120-160 overhead to even run one of my operatories for the hour. So no, I don't think it's fair to expect me to do your full mouth rehabilitation for free, Aunt Lily. I've done free work on my mom and dad, and that's because they have trust issues and will not let anyone else touch them.

Also dentistry, like all things in health care, is equal parts science and art. So if you do enough procedures, regardless if they were textbook or not, sometimes things will go south on you. If things go badly for a non-related patient, I can impartially resolve things usually without an issue. If things go south on family, well now it's awkward and then it turns into a clusterfuck of family drama.

OP I would just reiterate that you've already got a great dentist you work with, and you'll let your GF's dad know if that ever changes. No further discussion is necessary. "
"I'm in a multiple partner relationship too and totally agree with your excellent post.

And if I may add, before I was in my current multiple partner relationship I was having mental issues connected to prior abuse and had had awful experiences with men. It often seemed like the only men I met who were nice and kind to me were my friends' partners and it was not because they wanted a threesome but BECAUSE they didn't want to fuck me.

It never ever occurred to me to flirt or proposition or coerce sexual interactions with those men but to welcome their friendship and use it to remind myself I was worth more than just sex with men. They really helped me learn how to go back into dating and have healthier relationships.

Edit: OP also needs to make sure BF is aware of this so he doesn't get blindsided by this chick pouncing on him. At best it'll be awkward for him. At worst she could sexually assault him. I'd be removing her and giving him the opportunity to protect himself.

This is astoundingly selfish manipulative behaviour and the OP should drop her 'friend' like a hot potato. By trying to understand her friend's thinking she enables shitty behaviour and participates in making her BF complicit in something he hasn't chosen to be a part of. She needs to prioritise her relationship because this friend isn't worth her effort."

Once he's settled down a bit, perhaps you can take this as an opportunity to talk to him about some appropriate boundaries (mutual boundaries) about things like this. Perhaps he would have been fine with it had you told him what you were doing, or maybe put the ""throwaway"" items in a basket (not the trash) for him to have a quick look at before they bit the dust. I am kind of that way, especially when my wife goes on a cleaning spree and wants to throw out some of my old ""junk"". 99% of the time I agree with her choices, but I still like to see what is going.

I'm not suggesting you capitulate and vow to never touch his junk again, just that you use this as a learning experience for the two of you to explore and establish some good rules of engagement when it comes to cleaning house.

But, yeah, expired condoms? Definitely in the ""very obvious trash"" category!"
"I'm not so sure she's wary about anything. She's constantly happy to see us playing dolls together or me taking that father role seriously, which I do. She always tells me how happy it makes her. And thus far, I don't put up much of a fight on topics so there really isn't any kickback. 

It's more, I'll give a suggestion ""Maybe we should look for other shows for her to watch. We can do it all as a family."" and she will reply ""I don't see anything really wrong with this show."" and I'll just say okay. Because I FEAR the kickback and fear the ""Youre not her real dad!"" issue. 

I don't want to go into any parenting discussions half cocked. And We've already talked about adopting and we're both in agreement that when we get married I would adopt. "

"&gt; Not only is it far more common in Japan, but rather than framing the act of aborting as ""destruction"" it is often seen as a ""delay"".

"Update: I moved out as much as I could during my lunch break. When she got home from work (she must have seen my stuff gone) she called me about 8 times. I didn’t answer and then hours later got a nasty text along the lines of ‘thanks for abandoning me etc have fun with your dickhead boyfriend’.


I then called her back. She is bawling her eyes out so bad that I cannot hear what she’s saying. I drive back home and then have to comfort her for hours (I’ve just left, shattered). 


She essentially said that the birth of the baby has brought up how bad her births were (she had a few complications with both of us) and that nothing is ever easy for her. She then goes on about how depressed she’s been, how her life has been a failure. Endless shit. 


I eventually left after I got her to calm down. I feel bad for her, that she’s feeling low. But there was no apology to me or my boyfriend or anyone. She is playing the victim here, like I’ve abandoned her when she’s the one that threatened to change the locks. 


Some things can’t be unsaid and I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t think I’ll ever forget the things she said to me last night. It’s scary when you realised your parents are just as fucked up as you are.... "
After a certain point your SO *should* be more important than friends or family. Perhaps your comment made him think that you aren't really committed to him/the relationship because you don't think it's that important. Or you're starting to think exit strategy.

"I’d tell them - especially since you don’t know the guy. They’d be more likely to believe you since it wouldn’t make sense as to why you’d want to insert yourself in this situation / create unnecessary drama in regards to someone you aren’t even affiliated with. 

They deserve to know so they can decide how they want to proceed with this information. Just tell them once and then let them figure out what they want to do. Your sole responsibility is to hand over the information you know. Anything beyond that is for them to decide on their own."

I know in my situation Ive gone back and forth about whether I can keep her in my life, and to what extent. I love her to death we've been close for 7 years.

"I don't think that's true because from what you described in the OP, you shared perfectly reasonable feelings of disgust towards his objectively disgusting habit and he told you to look away. That is the opposite of validating your feelings. That is disregarding or ignoring your feelings.

"your good times were fake.  you are remembering times she manipulated.  everything about the relationship is false. its all an act. she groomed you.  she abused you. shes a predator.  you are scared to leave her because you ""love"" her. but do you?  she falsified everything.

Show stealing at a funeral is not right either tho 😣
"I'll deliver some tough love...

&gt; Everything was all very sudden and I was like a robot through the whole process. I left because I was unhappy.

OK, you left because feelings. You don't say if you talked about it with him or tried to mend the relationship. Did you even think it through? Probably not.

You were ""unhappy"". But did you try to figure out why you were ""unhappy""? I'll bet you did not.

&gt; A week or so after moving, It started to sink in what I had done and I really started to miss my husband.

...then you realized you made a bad decision because feelings...

&gt; him saying I will just hurt him again.

It's the logical thing to say. If you resume a failed relationship on the same terms, it will fail for the same reasons it did last time.

You won't be able to convince him it won't happen again unless:

- you find out why you were unhappy
- you find out and understand why you left
- you find a solution to the problem that was the root cause of all this
- he agrees on your solution and thinks it will fix the problem in your relationship

Maybe he needs to change his behavior, maybe you need to change yours, maybe both, I don't know. 

However, since your relationship failed, ""let's just get back together as we were"" will lead to the same failure unless the problem is fixed. Simple logic.

Begging won't work. It is a nice thing you did beg though, because it puts you in the proper mindset: you'll have to work a lot to salvage this...

TL/DR: you won't get him back unless you both understand why you left, which is the only way to make sure it won't happen again. ""Unhappy"" is not an answer.

"
Exactly this ... guys always find a way to justify it.. you’ve uprooted your life to cater to him and are taking care of his sick father while he’s treating you like crap and seeking the comfort of another woman if not more (and it’s probably more) please be selfish and put your needs first because it’s clear that he is not going to and what kind of relationship is that? Not one you or anyone else would want to be in.. he can take care of his own dad.. you need to take care of you!

"Same. My parents stayed together. When my mom called me crying saying she was getting divorced I laughed. I thought she was messing with me. She asked if I thought it was a surprise and I told her I thought they separated when I was 8. They even asked who I’d wanna live with if I could choose.

It was a horrible way to grow up. They should’ve just separated."
"&gt; And my boyfriend... Well, he ends up fucked
No, OP. He is already fucked in the head a bit. 

I think you’re going to have to accept that the issue here isn’t the friend. It’s your boyfriend. 

He’s not just spineless. But on some level it’s very likely that he agrees with his friend. It takes a certain person to be willing to protect a rapist (even theoretically). That goes beyond lacking a spine. That’s a person who either believes it’s ok, it isn’t that bad, or believes that friendship trumps all. 

And since the best your bf can say about his friend is that they “have fun”, my guess is definitely, on some level, OP shares the same opinions as his friend on enough items. "
"Just to clarify: if he's saying things to his 'online role playing partner' that he doesn't want his wife to find out about, then it's cheating. It sounds like his wife is afraid of 'losing him' so she's going along with it. Problem is she's already lost him, they're just both afraid to take the hard step of divorce. But this is no longer a marriage, and calling it so ain't healthy for anyone."

"I have a 10 week old, and my husband was with me through every step of my pregnancy and birth. There is no one that can take his place. Yeah, ""someone else"" can assemble the furniture, but the fact that your husband does it means a) he Understands the importance of being there to help, b) it's a type of nesting for the him, and c) he's investing in you and your child. Also, having my husband there with me through my labor and delivery was so incredibly
Important. He kept my spirits high and his meer presence comforted me. If your husband misses the birth of your child, he will regret it once he sees/holds his baby for the first time, and that regret will last forever. Even worse, you will forever resent him. He needs to know this - it may be worth having a doctor tell him this. I can't stress it enough. Good luck. 

Edit - also, OP, I'm not one to yell divorce at the drop of a hat, but if you explain all this to him and he still decides to go to Spain and leaves his fatherly duties up to ""someone else"", I think your marriage will be irreparably tainted."
"It's an issue of bodily autonomy to you when someone (like the ex you broke up with eons ago) asks you to not jack it to friends, but when dozens of women (hundreds via upvotes) tell you they want to have the autonomy of not being masturbation material,  your response is that they need to relax and take it as a compliment? Based on the typical rationality of your responses,  I know it is entirely possible for you to use material that is marked for sexual consumption.  That you devote gratuitous amounts of energy to coming to threads of distressed women trying to convince them that it's okay to be used as sexual fodder because other people (or you) enjoy it is seriously disturbing. You come across as saying your right to masturbate as you please takes precedence over how women want to be used.  Your argument is 'it doesn't cause harm'. It does cause mental harm,  especially when you make a point of letting everyone know what you and other people like this are doing.  There goes your DADT. You just have to let everyone know your dick rules above all. 

  I know I'm not going to make a dent since you're convinced you have this right.  It's too bad,  because that sense of entitlement is exactly what keeps people from getting along. Worse yet,  it's a mental breeding ground for the kind of behavior that will get you in the news,  if you have the right predisposition.  Other people will justify what they're doing with your words. 

I don't care what you do with people that have given you consent.  You and your girlfriend and your other boyfriends can jack it to all your sex buddies all you like.  Leave the rest of us out of it. "
"Riiiight, and every cop super-duper cares about the letter of the law and wouldn't dream of abusing their power."
"I’m obnoxious but I would just parrot back what he’s saying with men in the fantasy fuck role and see how uncomfortable he gets.

We get caught up in respecting everyone’s sexual fantasies and freedom so much that we sometimes turn a blind eye to how messed up a lot of this stuff is and how in reality it’s often so far from the egalitarian paradise of mutual respect the idealists describe. HE wants a threesome, HE wants two girlfriends... people in this thread are describing that as polyamory. Nah. He doesn’t want you to have a relationship other than him. I guarantee you the 3 way relationship in his mind is two girls for him and a bit of f-on-f action also for him.

He just sounds immature. The only way he’s going to get a 12 person orgy is if there are also other men in there and everyone’s a lot older than he’d like. The only way he’s going to get another girl in the relationship (WITH HIM, not polyamorists in general) is if she has low self esteem. People are talking about compatibility, but wanting to have a harem and going on about it all the time is not a no-fault compatibility issue. It’s a “him” issue and he’s going to struggle to get someone to stay with him if he doesn’t fix it.

OP, you’re putting up with him being a disrespectful knob because you care about his wellbeing and comfort a lot more than he cares about yours. You’re very young, but I can assure you there’re lots of men with whatever good qualities he has that don’t act this way. If he honestly thinks you are what’s standing in the way of him and a 24/7 sex fest and your relationship’s started to revolve around that, i’d invite him to leave."

"Grey-rocking is much harder in intimate relationships. Don't look at it as failing, so much as missteps while you are learning.

"On a more productive note: you believe the only solution she wants to try is having you give up your preferences, and you explicitly told her that the only solution you want to try is her giving up her preferences. (Another thing you two have in common!)

Here are some other possible ways to ease this tension. Probably at least a few of these suggestions will be unfeasible (after all, I don't know your circumstances) but hopefully at least a few of them will be do-able. Most of them will be directed at your behavior, because you're the one posting here and you can only change yourself.

You are very anxious, and you have sleep issues. It would improve more than just your sex life if you sought treatment. (It sounds like she has anxiety &amp; maybe stomach issues, so maybe she should seek treatment too? But in a marriage you have to start with yourself.)

You could try to switch your shifts or seek a job with a more similar schedule to hers. (I guess she could also try switching to a schedule more like yours....but it would probably be much harder for her, because your schedule is kinda weird.)

Also....she needs to eat and have a break before sex, she gets home at 6:30, you're the one getting up earlier so you're probably home earlier. Why is the default situation that she cooks? I get that she likes to cook, and is probably more skilled and knowledgeable than you are and just better at food. But imagine how she would feel if she came home to a hot dinner ready on the table--even just one night a week. Get her fed as soon as she walks in the door, then there's that much more time to chill and fuck afterwards.

These are just suggestions about fixing the sex issue. I think both of your conflict management skills need to be addressed in counseling."

"I asked my boyfriend out via facebook messenger because a. I wanted to at the time and that was the platform we were using to chat b. you can do whatever the fuck you want as a human adult. He might be too immature for you, but also dating is changing in terms of communication and platforms to do it; he might have felt too nervous to ask you in person and was able to get it out via text. 

If you like him and you plan on being exclusive, there's no reason not to be boyfriend/girlfriend, and just because you are bf/gf doesn't mean you need to get their name tattooed on your forehead- you can still take it slow and be dating as opposed to dating casually.

They all 3 had met the friends and his mom. The mom and friends knew he was juggling 3 girls and didn't say anything bc they're loyalty lies with their friend and son."
"So the wife starts work at 930, so she's home maybe at 6 or 7. She then is the one who usually cooks dinner, and may have gone to get groceries on the way home so say that takes an hour and dinner is ready by 7.30, eaten by 8. Then they need to do some chores or wash up etc, plus the wife wants to digest a bit and not feel bloated or whatever and its 830 to 9.  That gives OP 8 hours until he needs to be awake, and he likes his sleep and says he doesn't like sleep deprivation so he probably wants more than 7.5 hours sleep, which gives 30 mins of sex/foreplay etc, which doesn't leave much leeway.

Saying the wife has an elaborate 4 hour routine when all she wants is a) a shower, b) foreplay and c) to not have sex whilst hungry or still full and bloated from dinner is incredibly unfair. "
"&gt;As long as my boyfriend and I are together, she does not want to be in my life

She's making the decision for you there. She doesn't want the best friend role while your bf is in the picture. Personally I don't treat friendship like that as conditional. She must have her reasons though. The comments are juvenile and should be blocked or stopped altogether."
I think it's the fact that she doesn't trust him from the get go. She's basically treating him like a cheater even though he's shown no signs of it and she's verified in the past that his phone  was clear. It was probably something he said to hurt her back because she hurt him. I doubt he's gonna go out there and cheat because of this. 
This is excellent and you need a get a lawyer. 
"I like this too.  Play dumb.  Play dumber than dumb.  He's being an asshole and a creeper, so don't let him get an upper hand.  If he tries this again and gets no reaction, he's going to have to decide: drop it (ideal) or push it.  If he goes for option 2, there is no way he is going to come out of it without looking gross.  He's going to look like he's fixated on you for some bizarre reason.  Then he's going to look like he's trying introduce sex talk to visits with your very religious parents.  Then he's going to have to admit during these family visits that he's been watching porn and choosing porn that looks like the daughter of his friends.  You deny it, he insists, but in so doing, he is underlying the fact that he purposefully is watching porn that looks like his buddy's daughter for the creeper person of ""outing"" her?  Ugh.  Unless your parents watch it, you can deny, deny, deny, and the more he tries to ""prove"" it, the more you can make him look like an unhealthily obsessed older man.  He's probably smart enough to not let it get to that stage.  He's wanting to you make you uncomfortable and maybe try something on the QT.  Don't let him manipulate you."
"&gt; Maybe she will be able to look past this and appreciate your sexual past?

Appreciate his sexual past? What, like a classical painting in a fine art gallery? WTF?"
"My guess is that she's telling him to do it despite the pain because 1 ) consciously or not, she feels like it's supposed to hurt - you know, her being a dirty sinful sl#t who thought she could act on her depraved desire to fuck her bf without repercussions; 2 ) it's not exactly like religion teaches women to advocate for their needs or that they're even allowed to *have* needs when it comes to sex - she might genuinely believe that sex is something that a man does to a woman, while she endures it because she loves him.

ETA: Now that I think about it, OP is kinda showing her that option 2. may be true. I don't know how he even stays hard knowing she's in pain the whole time."
If you think that's what flirting is you need to stop flirting.

"I don't think you handled it particularly poorly, just maybe a little awkwardly. Maybe just reach out to your sister and say that you are totally fine with her being gay and that you just want for her whatever makes her happy."
"OP, here is a very convincing point

I think your mistake is you are being honest to her.   Like “uh this can’t be true because we were out that night!”  This lets her know what was incorrect and what she needs to modify 

It’s like when a psychic says “I can guess your name!” And then starts trolling you with listing out the alphabet- sees you react to “b” and then starts mumbling common d names to see if they strike gold - if you hit something quickly it builds credibility and then later mistakes are likely to be overlooked "
"As I see it, he didn't withhold the information, he actually told her but not asked her permission. 

There's several differences:
- Credit card money is debt money
- Husband vs. fiance
- Not telling vs trusting. "
Pay attention to this OP. God only knows who that stranger was and your wife is putting her drug addict prostitute brother above her children.
Apparently her internship is only 4 months long. It was a near future thing. 
"&gt; D is a very stern man. He would always ask her who she's talking too or what she was doing

Hell....it may be the only socializing she's *allowed* to do "
"So? He doesn't get to assume that. At that very moment, she wanted to stop. She did not want to have sex. He held her down, ignored her wishes, and kept going."
"Agreed with all the other posters, great hair, nice face from what we can see.  I suspect you're quite the catch"
"Unless that isn't MS Paint, and half her face is just a big red squiggle."
"I know, I'm a woman and I wanna date this lady after reading this post! Girl, you're funny as hell, that's a very attractive quality."
I had this issue with a roomie once. I told her that I wanted to start using a more expensive kind bc “whatever abc reason” and that I was going to start buying my own from then on. I’d take it to the bathroom when we shared one and just kept it in my own when I had one to myself. That might take away the conversation and solve the issue. ?

"This is spot on. My sister is like this, and is now in her 50s and acting the same as she always has, because people allow it. She's on her 3rd divorce because she crushes their souls until they cannot take it anymore."
"They are setting a very bad example for their boy. Just throw money at things if they don't go your way? Scream and shout and throw a tantrum to get your way? I mean, the boy is troubled enough as it is, being abused and adopted at all. I think they are honestly unfit to care for him.

Ask them to adopt Mason in exchange for $1000. When they inevitably ask what's wrong with you, tell them you feel the same about Elle."
"Ah, you are reminding me of one of my favorite stories.  An acquaintance of mine is a professor at a very fancy college.  She is intimidatingly smart, and also pretty, young, fashionable and petite.  As the story was relayed to me, she had a student walk in for office hours once and lead with ""oh my god, professor smith, you are, like, *so pretty* and your shoes are the *best*.""  Professor Smith responded ""why don't you turn around, walk back in to my office, and try that again in a more appropriate way.""  The girl was rightfully mortified and I've held that story near and dear to my heart for years.


I also have a PhD and am young, female, petite, and idk, I have my good days appearance-wise.  Many of my friends are also in the same boat.  Looking at my peers, we use a combination of conservative dress, eye contact, firm handshakes, straightforward speaking manner (minimize ""likes"" and verbal fry, etc), and what my husband calls ""work face"" - we're all really fun silly people but most of us shut that down at work and err on the side of being kind of a hardass (not mean at all, just serious).  It's shit you *shouldn't* get judged on but as OP has realized, it happens."
"It's a job on a school campus! She's koo koo. I worked at the anthropology museum on campus and if there was a school related problem, it was never a problem because it's school. 

By coming into class, Tammy only embarrassed herself. Maybe your prof could complain. That never happened in any of the classes that I taught, but I'd help the student out. "
"Yes, I would take this 100% seriously. Do you have texts or emails of him threatening you? If so keep them. Either way call the cops and an attorney asap. "
"Imagine how productive your ex could have been if he hadn't cheated :o

I mean, for real, it's time-consuming as heck to cheat. Even trying to find a one-night(or one-text) stand online takes up too much time.

Holy crap, even porn takes up too much time. 

EDIT: Words"
"Maybe it’s because I grew up in with majority black people, but I thought everyone knew to never call their hair nappy. I’ve heard kinky but I go with natural. Which it’s rare I comment on hair, not because I’m afraid of hurting feelings but because I don’t pay attention. "
When she initially told me and at the start of the conversation on the phone later she didn't mention consent. Only after I told her I was hurt did she say she wasn't consenting. If she led off with being forced I feel like it would be different.
"Seconding this, OP, talk to the music teacher at your school. I'm a high school art teacher and it lifts my sprits anytime a student comes in to ask for help, even if we'd never met before. If they can't help you directly, they can point you in the direction of an arts center or somewhere to take lessons. Good luck! "
"It doesn't sound like OP, her bf, or their friend sought medical attention for any injuries they sustained from being attacked by the dog."

"In his head, he's being honest and supportive.  Deep down, he's jealous and insecure.  Every person on the planet has cognitive dissonance to some extent, and it's ramped up to 10 for him on this area right now.  You're rocking it with the weight loss!   Tell him you've got this and don't need his input and remind him of that when he probably gives it again.  As much as we'd all like it to be the case, one-and-done conversations are typically not apt to bring about much change in relationships."
"He doesn't really engage in them, and he hates the fact that he is responsible for their school fees (this is the ONLY expense he contributes to, I even pay his phone bill!) He would rather they go overseas and we never see them, then pay the high fees we do here! Mind blown."
"I suggest you don't open one until you're 18.  If you do, it will require a legal guardian and she will get access to your money.

Of course keeping cash is risky too.  It could be stolen (by family or others).  Investing in a small safe that you can keep in a secure place might be a good idea."
This! Your boyfriend is putting other people and YOU in danger!! Do you want to be with someone who is willing to put you in danger?
Five bucks says this marriage has been going downhill for a long time.
"Yes, record them. But don’t say anything back to those racists people. Don’t egg them on. Let them sink their own ship."
"&gt;  It’s likely your mutuals know she feels this way and are teasing her. There’s nothing you can do. Let her block you.

Honestly if this is it, then her mutual friends are fucking assholes. I don't think ""there's nothing you can do"" and ""let her block you"" are appropriate in that case. "
"Him getting pegged could be an eye-opening experience... but it's not a trade.  He can get pegged or not, and you receiving anal stops, period.  

For the record, outsourcing is a terrible idea.  First of all, if you do have some kind of open relationship it should go both ways and you should each be in charge of finding your own partners.  Second, you can't just say ""no emotional attachment"" and expect it to be that simple.  "
"When you wear the dress, which you absolutely should, you can also add a special accessory for your fiancé, something meaningful you’ve picked out that has symbolic value for your relationship. Earrings he bought you, or something along those lines—I’m sure you will know what it could be! The wedding will symbolize you two first and foremost, and the beautiful history of the dress won’t tarnish that."
"Regarding housework I agree, but the kids need both parents involved. Aunt’s care and mum’s estate should be the first things to get outsourced. "
Great insight. Getting stuck in the cycle of expectations causes so much pain. I had to move across the country to get away from my mom because I woke up each morning genuinely afraid I would have a nervous breakdown. 
"I mean this is a huge cultural issue, it's really unlikely your parents are going to acquiesce and let you do what you want. You really need to decide whether or not it's more important to please them or please yourself. "
"I really appreciate the feedback, but I don't know that this is the issue. Actually, it may be that my alone time is actually causing the feelings of wanting to be independent and free of our relationship. Definitely going to see that therapist. Thanks again."
"If her work situation is this demanding, she'll likely find herself out of a job when she ""returns"" from FMLA. *Not* that I don't think you're right that therapy needs to be a priority, I'm just saying because I've seen this happen to multiple people who've taken time off after a burn out. Losing her job will just compound all of the stress she's under."
I'm a guy who could never imagining abandoning someone in such a fragile time. You're not an asshole. You're a sensible human.
"""Kill them with kindness"" is advice that in my experience, usually isn't about altruism or kindness at all. It's about refusing to buy into their rage and responding with the exact opposite response they're looking for, usually enraging them even more.

I think most of the time, it's about making yourself look (and feel) superior to the asshole you're dealing with. Maybe I'm a bad person, but my ""politeness"" causing an insane person to lose their mind isn't really about trying to resolve the problem anymore...it's about schadenfreude."
Sadly I think you are correct. OP just wants people to validate how she feels. She doesn't want people to actually help the situation.

"“I feel unloved and neglected. I need more quality time with you. I really need you to set aside x amount of time because I’ve been feeling really lonely. I think x amount of time is reasonable.”

If he can’t see your point of view, I’ll ditch him. No point being together with someone who can’t and won’t compromise or even trying to understand your feeling. Sounds immature to me."
"Hey fellow naturally skinny girl! Welcome to my life.

All annoyance aside, this is something you need to deal with - because it can affect you pretty negatively if you don't shut it down.

You're healthy. You eat. You cheerlead. 

I'd come up with a few lines, and enforce a boundary that you won't continue this type of conversation. 

If there are specific offenders, I'd sit them down alone and straight up say ""I'm really glad you care about me, but when you assume I have an eating disorder it hurts. I'm healthy. My doctor says so. Please stop bringing it up"". 

"
I second this. My mother did this to my sister. It got to the point that I had to tell my sister if it didn't stop I would have to cut her off too

"Yeah, I definitely think OP should change all his passwords and put a password on his PC, and make going to therapy a condition of earning back his trust. Otherwise, this is going to cause big problems in the future. "
"Yeah...personally when I read his post it almost sounded like the long hours and missed trips were the secondary thing upsetting him. I mean a good portion of the text focuses on their ""roles"". I wonder if it's possible her career starting to take steam and he's a bit worried it may make him the permanent stay at home parent. "
"&gt; She's spent time experimenting with hard drugs

So did my husband when he was in his teens. Doesn't make me think I need to go out and do a fuckton of cocaine just to level up my life experiences. 

You're viewing this as a competition instead of looking at her life experiences and seeing the person she's become. Your irritation at not being allowed to go crazy probably has nothing to do with Rachael and everything to do with the way you grew up, so maybe stop displacing it on her. She is with you because you represent a good and stable future.

"He seems to prefer being ""right"" to being helpful, sympathetic, loving, empathetic.  Be glad you found out now. End it. 

My guess is also that he's not that close to his mum."
I’d say “well go and get me some now if it’s not a big deal”
"Fully agreed. I’m trans myself and dating another trans person, but if I was ever dating somebody who wasn’t, I would definitely want this to be a discussion we had first. 

I understand that she probably values disclosure, which isn’t bad, but I agree with other commenters who said that this should have been an expectation she brought to you explicitly. "
"&gt;Part of me thinks: ""You broke up with her, and you don't own her. She can do what she wants after you leave""

This is a sensible part of you. The other is the toxic part. We all have it but we have to learn to recognize it. Yes, it's OK to feel pain, but placing that pain at her feet it just wrong. She's not at fault."
"It's not really ""bullshit,"" though, it's just something else. People mostly use the word allergy incorrectly when they're talking about some other kind of food sensitivity, like lactose intolerance. It's incorrect, but calling it bullshit minimizes the problems that they DO have. Given that we tend to scoff at people with food sensitivities like that, it's not surprising that they use the word that gets their needs respected."
Set multiple alarms. Set alarms on your phone that you can only turn off if you solve a simple math problem or something. There’s apps like this. Be proactive. It is not his responsibility. 
"I mean, it's a totally dumb thing for him to be genuinely upset about. Particularly for a man of his age.  

But I have to say that your post is positively dripping with contempt. If that's the attitude with which you approached your ""apology"", it's little surprise he's hurt.  

His direct quote is also pretty telling:  

&gt;""I am hurt. You knew this was important to me. It makes me feel that I'm not allowed to like silly things because it's a chore to you. If you feel upset about something it's a big production and I love to comfort you through it but you can't even be assed to say sorry more than once.""  


Is it a common thing that you dismiss his feelings (no matter how silly they may seem) but then expect him to rally around you for things which YOU find important? I think that's the real issue here."
"She shouldn't protect herself? That's all you canurge a victim to do. Getting out of that situation and protecting herself should be everyone's first concern. Urging her to protect herself isn't judgement, at all, it's encouraging her to empower herself.

"Your roommates aren't going to solve the problem, so stop complaining to them about it. And you aren't the supervisor of other people in the building, so forget leaving notes under their door. A pet owner isn't reasonably going to get rid of their dog because another tenant asked them to.

That leaves the last option, which is reasonable - just contact the landlord and let them know you moved here with the expectation there wouldn't be pets, and incessant barking seems to be coming from apartment XX. "
"I kind of have a problem with this advice. I feel that essentially you're taking Katie's side because of your similarities to her in terms of being an insecure friend. You're basically saying you and Katie can be distant friends and name-call other people, but those people have to show you the utmost restraint and kindness in return? That's bad advice in my opinion. 

I would say to OP, considering the length of this relationship maybe give Katie a chance to make things right, but if this problematic jealous behavior continues you don't need that in your life. By no means should OP accept that a friend can treat her like this just because she's insecure or has problems. "
I was wondering the same thing. Is she going to pay for gas while he pays for bus fare?
"It doesn’t sound like you *can* convince them of anything. You need rock solid boundaries with them. 

As far as having them back you financially for your education... man, that’s so tricky. It sounds like you’re going to have to make a decision about how much you’re willing to put up with and to what end. What is the highest good that you want for yourself. Not just career wise - that’s part of it, but if you imagine a future for yourself in 5 years: what’s your best case scenario? What’s the worst case? Does the best case require that you work with your parents for now or does it require that you cut them off and focus on healing yourself and getting far away from them and sorting out some other way to make a life/get your education?

None of that is rhetorical - I’m just trying to ask questions in case it might help. 

Boundaries only work when they are implemented with the understanding that you cannot control the way others behave. You can only control your own choices. Like your father threatening to hit you and you threatening to call the cops was excellent boundary making. 

I have an aunt who yells at me. I don’t tell her not to, because I can’t change her behavior, you know? I just hang up on her/don’t call/leave the room. Lol because boundaries are about what *i* do. "
"OP doesn’t sound mature, or thoughtful enough to be a *parent*.... yet here we are.  I’m really not surprised his fiancé sounds less than stellar."
"Like others, I would just lie and tell them you got tested and you are the bio dad.

However, with where at home DNA stuff is going you might want to actually do it, but dont tell anyone the results, so if he has questions as he grows up he has answers. There may be genetic diseases and other complications it would be important to know.

Best case he is your bio kid though."
"It may be common, sadly, but it's also common to find men who aren't like this. 

My partner has always been patient and supportive, even when it means no sex for a while after childbirth, or surgery (I've had 3 gynaecological surgeries, 2 minor, 1 major, and a few other procedures that needed healing before sex could resume). He will get me a heating pad, and pain meds, make me endless cups of tea, and give me a massage or cuddles whenever I want. He supported me breastfeeding until our kids self-weaned, even though that meant 6 years when I didn't want my breasts touched. 

On the cuddling part - one of his 'love languages' is physical touch. I'm pretty sure he would actually give up sex before he would give up long snuggles. 

If this is truly surprising coming from your boyfriend, it's worth considering if it's something you could work out together, provided he could demonstrate that he truly understands why what he said was horribly wrong. 

But rest assured there are a lot of good men out there who will honour you and your body for what you go through to create life. "
"Telling him nicely will never work. You need to grow a spine and tell him to get his shit together and get a job, start doing his share of chores, or he needs to move out.

He doesn't just seem childish, he is childish, and he's treating you like his mother, and treating you quite poorly at that. 

Stop funding his gaming addiction, don't let him mooch on you anymore. You need to draw some hard boundaries and there's no way to be ""nice"" about it because it's not going to be and never will be a fun conversation to have with someone. He has no right to be angry at you for telling him to stop being a freeloader."
There's no probably. He's cheating. Get it over with and leave. Your gut has told you multiple times to stop letting this guy get one over on you. And I suggest getting tested to make sure he didn't do more than waste six years of your life going behind your back. 
Why not have someone record the Super Bowl for you then watch it with your friends when you get back? Yeah it’s not quite the same as watching it live but at least you will still get the experience of enjoying it with your friends anyway.
"let me get this correct... she tells you ""bad"" things about yourself and let's you know that she's overlooking these things in order to be with you? that's awful, she doesn't sound like a loving partner in any way. "
"Don't diagnose yourself, particularly that diagnosis which is rarely used correctly as a term. A few different things could inform you ability to lie and lack of drive/affect, heck, you could even have an underlying medical problem or just severe anxiety.

If you can see a therapist. Don't write yourself off as one thing and vindicate the behaviour as inevitable. If nothing else they will be someone to open up to.

"Ahh that's irritating, go to Toronto with Bekka after the hang up.

"Accounting AND customer service? Are you kidding me? FFS hire a full-time customer service person or at least mix them in with a more appropriate position other than accounting. To me it sounds like they're putting pressure on you to perform and do more by micromanaging which creates a bad work environment for you. I just hired a guy a little over 3 months ago and he's barely to the point where he can ""take ownership"" of small projects and some of his work because 3 months simply isn't a lot time when you're dealing with new policies, new software, new people, new workflow, etc... He's made mistakes but that's to be expected. No one is perfect and most people take time to figure everything out.

The errors you made seem avoidable so you really need to spend more time proofing before posting or sending anything out. However, I could see the pressure from above being a direct contributor to these errors. Your manager is there to manage and help you learn the job as the company has it setup. Talk with her about how you want to do better, what you're doing to improve and ask work on figuring out some specific tasks to focus on and perfect then move on to others so by the end of the year you're fully up to speed and working well. 

Don't change your personality and think you have to be social.  I'd start looking for another job while trying to improve what you can at this one.  Maybe it will get better."
"Reading between the lines you still branchswung. You went through 5 years of a crap marriage because that was better than being alone, until you met someone you could jump over to. Then you somehow found the strength to divorce. As awful as the marriage may have been, you still used your wife. This is behavior that your friends are uncomfortable with, because it IS deceitful and they don't have to be friends with you if they don't want to. Your family doesn't have as much of a choice, you're still family and they probably want what's best for you overall and still keep you in their lives.

The only way forward is to lie completely in my opinion. Still deceitful, but its TMI to clue them in with any real details."
"&gt; Do other men here empathize that this could really be nothing?

I'm a guy, and NO I do not empathize it could be nothing. If it meant nothing, he would never have watched it while he was committed to you. BTW, is he still in contact with this ex? Facebook friends, texting, etc? If he is still in contact with her at all, there's no point talking it over. Just drop the relationship on the spot in that case."
"I guess I'm in the minority here, but not a deal breaker for me. He realized it upset you and deleted it."
"You roommate has also been treated very poorly in this situation. I'm sorry to tell you this, but you are the bad guy here to everyone involved, including yourself. Have you ever been in love with someone you couldn't have, but they still wanted to be friends with you? It is the worst. You think that as time goes on, one day they'll just wake up and realize it was you the whole time. But that pretty much never happens. Instead, you're just stringing along this poor girl, who you told means EVERYTHING to you, and she didn't even know you were in a relationship, so to her you were available. What is she supposed to do with that? You treat her like she is your borderline girlfriend, and you're surprised that someone else couldn't handle that.

You may not have been cheating on your gf, but your inability to be honest with your roommate and the fact that you've been allowing this situation to continue means you were not ready for the relationship you had, and your gf was right to end it. Seems like you already know all this, but I felt the need to make sure you really get that. If you want to have a healthy relationship, you need to 1) tell your roommate that it's happening when it does and 2) probably stop living with her and hanging out with her. No other woman is going to want to be with you while you're in this situation because they'll never know for sure if something's going to happen, and it makes you look too weak to handle problems like this, not to mention your roommate deserves to be able to move on as well, and living with you is preventing that from happening.

So move out, be completely honest with her, and try to tell your ex that these things are happening for these reasons and you hope she can give you another shot. Tell her you realize that it was your weakness and maybe even a little ego that has kept you in this living situation, and she showed you that you need to be a stronger person. Because that is the real wrong here, so you need to confront it and change things. Honestly you don't deserve another chance until you can do that.

"Totally agree with you, I can't believe she was still doing 50/50 of housework! OP maybe you could help more with her aunt as well? Not sure why that has had to fall all on her, you could at least go with her?

Agreed. If they were teenagers I'd say give it a second chance and have a talking-to with the friends. These people are 30. By 30 your friends reflect who you are and these people all need to grow up.

Take care of you and heal well!!! Make sure you do your rehab and stay strong."
"I remember when I was a kid my father spanked another kid for hitting me with the approval of the mom. 

Watching my father hit another kid was worse than that kid hitting me. It was a bit traumatizing tbh.

Especially since his dad got permission after the fact, I would not want him watching my kid either. "
Godwin’s Law strikes when you least expect it! 
And they aren't. Find a class that tailors to your interests in Eastern cultures more if that's what you want to learn. But this professor isn't doing anything wrong by focusing on classics of Western music for his introductory music class. Maybe there's a higher level music class that will touch on the music of Eastern cultures but it isn't this one.
"Nope. I'm the one with a religious background. And I think he'd get super flustered if I started asking questions like that... which would be a win in a debate setting, but maybe counter-productive for a relationship."
"As I understand it, the idea isn't ""to win,"" but to have the other party examine their own views without you outright rejecting them or insulting them. No need to be antagonistic or demeaning while exercising it - but if you think even just asking him about these claims would be too much, then it's best if it comes from someone else. 

Would he have any interest in a basic philosophy class? That's where I learned a lot of the fallacies I held when I was a teenager - it forced me to back up my claims, and some didn't withstand the scrutiny. I found it enthralling; but I'm not sure if your SO would..."

"my boyfriend dresses like he's about to attend a party hosted by Gatsby, and he helped me dye my hair bright purple the other day. It was his suggestion too becuase i said i was tired of red.

"I am quite sure he's picked up on that last part. Saying no is a lot easier these days - But for some reason, this time it's really difficult. The fat that he knows that AND uses it against me... Makes me doubt everything about him."
"You know, I disagree with everyone here. So your husband hit you. That's not a big deal, right? I mean, strangers don't hit you, but if the person who's supposed to love you and earn your trust hits you, no big deal, right?

And, he only hit you while drunk. As you know from when you drink, drinking completely changes you as a person and MAKES you do violent things against your will. So it's not him, it's the alcohol. And he can quit that anytime. I mean, you shouldn't expect him to totally quit drinking, because why shouldn't he have his fun? I mean, again, it's not like him hitting you matters that much. You can just stay out of his way if he's been drinking. Get used to being on high alert for your entire life, because that's what all good marriages are!

And if he does get violent and hurt you, well, let's be honest, it wasn't the fault of the guy who got drunk and swung his fist at you, was it? No, it was your fault for saying something to him that he didn't want you to say! Just like how when someone gets shot, the judge punishes them for not getting out of the way of the bullet.

But, real talk for a second. He only hit you once, he'll probably never do it again. Well, actually, he pushed you, and then he felt sorry for it, and then he got drunk again and hit you, and now he feels sorry again. But next time it definitely won't happen. I mean if you really piss him off he might choke you a tiny bit, or break a couple dishes or call you a f-cking b-tch or maybe slightly cut you with a knife. But isn't that a risk you're willing to take? After all, isn't a peaceful, unmarried, self-determined life worse than constantly living under the threat of bodily injury?

Yeah, I see no issues here. You're overreacting.

And if this sounds insane and idiotic, that's because it is."
"OP states in her original post they've been talking about this for three years. By the time most spouses have three *months* of conservation about purchasing a home and moving, that conversion is something to be taken seriously. It's *possible* her husband is truly that dense, but I don't think it's terribly probable. "
"This. She's worrying about the schools and the shoes and the Comcast and which bank account the money for these things is coming out of, while OP is reading and watching TV and writing his novel. These aren't made-up jobs, someone needs to do them. If OP isn't pulling his weight on them, of course she's going to worry about them."
"I only read like half of this but good grief just break up with him and let this '""relationship"" die. You'll both be happier for it "
"She also could be the type of person who holds deeply ingrained ideas about certain behaviors being consistent across all members of one gender. It's not just her BF she doesn't trust, she wouldn't trust any guy she was dating because ""guys are dogs and you can't trust them unless you keep a leash on them."" She doesn't think he needs to accompany *her* when she goes out because *she's* a woman, so she's not a pig like men and can be trusted to behave herself. 

I mean, obviously without knowing OP's GF it's hard to say. But I don't like jumping to the immediate conclusion of ""she's cheating!"" I think it's more likely she's just an immature hypocrite. "
"Exactly. They probably see it as different problems. I'd bet his wife doesn't understand how he feels about the service right now, and views the problem as what he sees is the solution. If he brings her in and says something like ""Our problem as a family is that I am not going to survive another 11 MONTHS much less 11 years to retirement, so we need to find a solution together. . ."" that's much more likely to work than him just saying ""I want to move home and work instead of being in the military. . ."""
"This may not be a great option if he's *emotionally* burnt out as well as physically, which it kinda sounds like he is (he expresses a feeling of ""not caring"" and being disinterested in his work)? Recruiters do horrible, soulless work - it's an important job, don't get me wrong, but they're basically contractually required to lie to teenagers to convince them to risk their lives in the desert. That's not a job for someone who's having trouble believing in the military. "
"She should definitely be more sympathetic. He needs to stop working so much and she needs to step up to help bridge that gap. A relationship is not sustainable if things stay as they are.

Still though, if he had a week off and spent all of it gaming that's a bit annoying. Did he make time for their kid? Did they have sex? I mean an hour a day (whilst off) is enough to do at least one of those. It's a holiday but it should also be a time to reconnect a bit."
That’s one of the worst advices I have seen so far on this reddit

"&gt;  I would gently remind you that the very same Xeroxed advice is issued like clockwork in 90% of these /r/relationships threads.

"You can be firm, honest, straightforward, and gentle at the same time. Gentle doesn't mean being vague or lying to preserve his feelings. It just means being kind. I'm not sure why you feel that she should be unkind to the man that until recently she wanted to marry. "
"&gt;her interpretations

Physically assaulting you, threatening you, then demanding that you can't leave until you ""buy him out,"" while also crying and begging you not to leave, is manipulative and abusive. No interpretation needed.

&gt;I tried to breakup with my boyfriend of 2.5 years on Friday night. Was ok at first but the next day he was really mad, thought I cheated (I didn’t), hit me in the face for the first time and dumped his drink on my head and took pictures while threatening to post them, and then profusely and desperately apologized asking me not to leave him and saying he would never hit me again.

&gt;Well I still want to leave him. Problem is, in his anger he said I need to either buy him out for all the furniture we bought together or sell it all and give him half since the split was my decision. Well I don’t want all the furniture and can’t afford it anyway - I was hoping we were just going to each take a few things and that would be settled. To make things worse, he is now trying to charge me $270 which he says he had to pay for his license getting suspended and paid late because he says the bill came while he was out of town and that means I lost it and caused his suspension (I never saw this letter).

And the last time you tried to break up with him, he got hysterical and then pretended like you never said anything about breaking up until you gave in and decided not to leave.

This is not a healthy relationship and it's completely understandable why your friend issued an ultimatum. There's only so much people can take when seeing people they care about refusing to leave a relationship like this."
"&gt;He is grabbing the corner of his pillowcase pulling it until is long, sharp and curly and then putting it into is ears/nose.


That's pretty weird but okay.


&gt;If he gets a text while he is poking is ear/nose with the pillowcase, he would just leave it INSIDE THE HOLE

Why is he like this?

&gt;Sometimes he does it even during sex! 

Why are you letting him?Why are you still fucking him. What?

&gt;He makes a baby voice and speaks to me pretending to be the pillow, saying things like ""heeeey I'm pillow! I want to visit some holes hehehehe""...Of course the pillowcase turned brownish and it's completely disgusting.

"I'd HOPE the second. As I see it, if I urge him to see a medical doctor his fear will come into play, and if I urge him to see a therapist it wouldn't but he'd resist that too because he doesn't think he has any problem.

"In the future, call the police before/as well as your attorney.  The police have the ability to act on the order in real time.  Given she drew a deadly weapon on you this may be needed.  This is something to say when you make the call too.  The record of your call and their incident report is also further evidence to her breaking the order.

Finally, as others have suggested, ask your attorney whether a video from your phone or that of a security camera would make it more reliable evidence than simply your own testimony.  You'll need to ask how privacy laws regarding filming people work in your state if this is a viable option."

"Did other people get +1s for their SO? Is it only you that didn't get one?

It can be awkward planning a wedding if you don't have a lot of money. You have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to invites, and to me people who are not married to someone in the family (or if not married, have not been around for a significant enough amount of time to pretty much be part of the family already) would probably be some of the first to get cut from guest list. 

I wouldn't take this so personally. Weddings are expensive, and although you are an important family member your gf is not (yet, anyways) and the day is about the couple getting married, not your gf meeting the family. I don't think your gf is owed an invitation, especially if the couple is young and low on money. "
Really don’t get her logic.  OP said no but her BF has the right to choos for her to have a threesome?  I think her friend just is looking for a guiltless way to let him know that she wants to bang him.  Probably hoping he’ll cheat or leave OP.
"If I wasn't on such a tight budget I would send my bff flowers every day.  She has been there for me when my husband (12 years) was not.  

My husband would never understand how important she is to me, or our marriage in general.  

Please tread lightly.  This woman may be very important to your wife and if you come at her with guns blazing, you may be setting yourself up for some SERIOUS conflict."
I think he sexually assaulted her too. It was a horrifying post.

"Erm, it *can* help you lose weight but it wasn’t really intended for that purpose. It makes you absolutely ravenous and you have to increase your calories to accommodate your milk production. Depending on a persons genetics they *might* lose weight, most women maintain and some women gain. There’s also quite a few women who suffer significant supply issues if they attempt to create a caloric deficit while breastfeeding, which is devastating and they may or may not be able to recover. 

Breastfeeding is hard enough and I often find myself discouraging any new mom from attempting to diet or exercise early in their breastfeeding journey. It’s more important to make sure your baby is fed than worrying about your figure. I think it’s an absolute travesty we put so much pressure on new mothers to ‘get back in shape’ when they should be focusing on taking care of their baby. "
"Some people here might tell you this relationship is dead, and yes, it's time to split.

First of all, you have to decide: Is fixing things worth it? Do you see a future here? Are you willing to put the effort in - and at first, the effort will have to come from you, because he isn't in a place where he can manage it yet.

If the answer is no - and no judgment if that's the case, I haven't lived with this guy. He sounds like a pain in the ass - start collecting your thoughts, maybe get a lawyer and look into family law, and have that conversation with your partner.

If you think it might be worth it, here is my advice - and hopefully it's advice you can take into future relationships, to stop them from going the same way:

There are two issues here: the long term problems you both have with anger and communication, and the short term problems you both have with your joined temper tantrum.

The short and long term relate to each other. Short term is apologising, and having the conversation you've explained here - about the constant cycles of miscommunication, and how they make you feel.

You are dead right that you need couples therapy, and that the trouble is your poor communication methods. You can see exactly the cycle that your current methods of communication have. You BOTH have this problem. It may be that he hasn't quite reached the point of understanding the cycle yet - so, you might have to take one for the team, and patiently encourage him to understand it.

The point is: you can see the cycle. You can see how it works, you can see the misery it brings.

The reason you are stuck in this cycle is that ultimately, short term, giving in to that angry, petty part of you feels good. You think ""this person has done a bad thing, so I am going to give them the cold shoulder."" you get that rush of anger, and right in that moment you throw your wedding ring, because it feels *good*. It's *Exciting* to have a row, all those frustrations vented in one moment of explosive negativity - or stored up into a tight little ball of ice, like a snow  ball you carry with you for a week with the intention of throwing at his head when he turns to look at you. Ha. Serves him right. And why SHOULD you bend? Why SHOULD you forgive him, why should YOU say sorry? He did something bad too!

To break the cycle, you will have to conquer that feeling. Conquer the part of you that wants to manipulate and corerce him with negativity. Conquer the part of you that values your pride over your relationship.

This is how you do it: You swallow that pride. You bite back on that anger. Yes, you feel it. Maybe you have a good reason to. The last thing you should do is meekly accept whatever is going on - you want a conversation, not a one sided shouting match.

But you need to feel those emotions without acting on them. Yes, you're angry. But is it worth acting on? No.

When you feel that anger, breathe in. Breathe out. Take a moment. 

Is it worth acting on?

No.

Speak to him instead. Tell him your mind - what's going on in there. Don't accuse him of something. Don't say things with a goal of getting a reaction. Talk neutrally about your feelings, and be gentle. Take his hand.

If he ignores you, then leave the situation before your anger can get out of hand, and discuss the matter later, when you have a more level head, and the mood is lighter.

You may need to lead the way with this. He doesn't have the skill, same as you. Have patience, and use your calm perseverence to coach him into communicating better.

- Never do the cold shoulder.
- Never lash out in anger.
- Never make accusations.
- Never say something with a goal of making him feel bad."
"I think the hardest thing for me is how I feel so loved by him most of the time, and how quickly that just drops when he’s with that particular friend. I end up feeling like he’s a “victim” in some ways of being unable to stand up for how he truly feels (I know it’s not the truth). If he does really love me, how sad it is that the relationships ends over this. I know consciously that the reasoning is because he doesn’t have the backbone and etc etc... Knowing that doesn’t stop it from hurting though. "
"Your husband makes fun of violence victims?!?? HUGE RED FLAG. And your career and personality is driven to help them???? Based on everything you said, sounds like he is not the partner for you. Surely you would be happier with a partner who is as compassionate as you are. "

"Why should she compromise on church? He needs to tell his parents she is a different religion and that its not fair to her background. Either include Buddhist things as well or make the wedding secular. 


My parents are interfaith and did this, mom actually ended up renouncing the Catholic Church because they demanded her and my Muslim father do Christian premarital council, wedding in church, and kids need to be Catholic.


Also the reason I'm not getting married in a church, dad complains whenever he has to sit through a ceremony in church because he feels so out of place. Ask your husband to be how he thinks this will make your family feel when they see that none of their cultural values or beliefs are represented in the wedding. They probably won't be too impressed. Church is his birth families' belief, not his. He needs to learn how to compromise with his new family (you)."

"Sorry man. She's cheating and manipulative. Best thing is to go no contact (believe me, no contact is the best way to get over people) and go after a hobby you've been wanting to do"
"If you feel like you'd like to see more of her, you shouldn't feel bad about having said that. I mean, you really don't need to feel bad about wanting to feel important to her. In fact, you should absolutely make sure that you feel important to her, and it was very good that you raised that point. 

Having said that, you could ask yourself if you absolutely need to see her two or more times a week in order to feel important to her (if yes, and if she cannot provide this without feeling bad about herself, this would be a reason to break up) or if there's another way she could provide you with this feeling.

I also want to add that you might want to try to stop texting all the time. Less texting makes me miss the other person much more because I feel like I can only catch up with his life if I make sure that I get to see him in person. Maybe this works for her, too?

To me, all of this sounds like you're both still trying to figure out a way to make sure you're both happy in the relationship, so there's no reason to end this until you're sure that you can't find a way to satisfy both of your needs."
"Nope. Sounds like he wanted to cheat and failed to do so, or succeeded and panicked a bit. 

This kiss wasn't just a kiss, I can guarantee it. 

He's also brought up that its your fault he did this because your job made you less affectionate. Yea, OP, he was looking for affection elsewhere and is now blaming you for this ""kiss."""
"There about a hundred threads here of young women who figured they were mature for their age at 19-23 and were at the level of a 30 year old... and it hardly ever ended well. In r/relationships, it's more like none of them ended well.

The unfortunate thing is- the maturity you gain from growing older can't be understood by just hearing about it. You know when you go through it. When you turn 30 you'll realise how disgusting it is for a 30 year old to hook up with a 20 year old. It's not a relationship of equals by any shot.  There are exceptions from time to time but that's it... it's an exception, reality is that such relationships are disadvantageous to the younger person. "
I'm beginning to realize this. She was my first time and I was with her for 8 years so I think that experience really fucked up my perspective of reality.

That was your warning that she was going to become THAT step-mother.

And no this isn't stress. your wife simply realized that having a kid did not move her and said kid up in the ranking. That and probably realized she was never going to(and was unwilling to work on being) be a loved mother figure to your oldest. 

 I had my share of step mom's and dad's GF in my adolescence. The one thing ALL of them understood? I came first and do not cross the line when it came to me. Tween attitude aside if any of them had kicked a door in my father's house they'd have been out on the street.

What happens when the baby is here? Doe he keep going off on these trips leaving his wife home? 
"Man, this is such a lose/lose/lose/lose situation, bc no matter what happens someone (you) lose. Here’s the 4 scenarios:

* You do manage to get him to stay and don’t go into labor. He’s going to hold it over you and be bitter.
* You do go into labor and he’s stays. You’re going to be super pissed at him because *you told him so* and that will breed resentment, especially with all the “what-ifs” that’ll go through your head.
* He goes. You go into labor, you’re alone and he misses the birth of his 1st child and the rift it causes may never be fixed.
* He leaves. You don’t go into labor, then *he told you so* and resentment will *still* happen. 

I can’t beleive he would be this selfish, obstuse and dense. This, imo, is completely unforgivable. Here’s my story to explain how dire this situation is for you:

I gave birth to our daughter last summer. I was alone most of the pregnancy and almost for the birth. I was hospitalized for a while because they thought they’d have have to take the baby early at 34 weeks because of suspected Pre-e. My partner was 2 hours away because of school and I had to move with my family for the support because he couldn’t be there for me because of school and work. He made it just in time for the induction (like, he arrived Sunday and I was induced Tuesday and where I was already in labor but baby was in distress and her heart would stop on and off). He had no choice in the matter. I still have some resentment and I know it wasn’t his fault. But if he pulled what your husband is? Absolutely I would be a single mom right now. 

Not to mention, if he misses it, you’re going to have to take care of the baby pretty much alone even while completely exaggerated after birthing. You need his unconditional support before, during and after. This is completely unforgivable. Have him read all of these replies. Because, OPs husband, if you leave you’re signing your relationships death certificate. "
"This is why I don't run to my friends about everything, and when I do, I talk about the good things about 99% of the times. They only know what I tell them.

"First, yes your wife's behavior is childish. Second, so is yours. She is obviously angry and frustrated, some problem is going unaddressed. Perhaps she is tired, angry, stressed and irritated herself. Third, why the hell does your wife ""owe you money""- esp in such a small amount. You are either grossly glossing over your own behavior or conveniently leaving things out to conjure agreement to your point of view.

Or maybe Sandra's death shook your girlfriend in a way that made her realize her own mortality.

Don't sweat it OP. I'm betting that ""little chub"" you have going on is much more akin to healthiness and a good body weight than actual chubbiness. "
"It kind of depends on how you gave him the news. Did you declare it like an ultimatum? If so, I might consider sitting him down and telling him that you're still his best friend, but some of the old wounds from the way this person treated you haven't healed and that the tension would bring the group down and that's why you're gonna have to sit this one out.

It's a bummer that you're going to have to miss the trip you were so excited for, so maybe you should plan to do something for yourself. Give yourself a ""mental health day"" so that you can have fun and feel good about yourself."

You're being offensive to abuse survivors by saying that her noisily setting down a coffee mug is abuse.
"Ha, I was curious about that too. My (probably incorrect) speculation was INFJ. It's supposedly the ""rarest"" personality type, and I know a couple of people who constantly reference how ~special~ they are because they're INFJs.

"I filed divorce papers this week, but it's still hard after all these years.

 He wasn't always like this. He used to be so caring and protective, but then he started hurting me in ways I didn't mention. I called domestic violence hotlines, I had to hide from him in a bathtub once. I just keep hoping he's gonna change and each time I try to tell him he has to or I'm done, he promises me he will. 

It's also really hard because I've lost nearly all my friends for him, so he's nearly all the ""support"" I have. "

What if the judge had believed her? What if you had grown up believing your father had abused you? Don't you see how messed up this is?? 


I know she's your mother but she is rotten beyond recovery. She has everything but your wellbeing at heart, Google ""parental alienation"" to see what your mother has happily been pulling over the years. 


Anyway, congratulations on somehow not having grown up to be a hot mess (as far as I can tell). Your mother's abuse could have turned things into another direction easily."
"You need to break up with your boyfriend ASAP and go find yourself.

* Your history indicates you cling to relationships and have not explored who is out there as prospects.

* You two are incompatible since you are totally non-religious while he is some sort of devout Catholic.

* You have years left of study in a place swarming with romantic prospects, both male and female.

* But with years left of study for both of you, you two have no idea if you will even wind up in the same place after your studies are finished.

You are too dependent on clinging to romantic relationships.  You will never have a better chance to explore.  You are in no position to make any sort of long term commitment, so it is pointless to wait years for something that will never happen.

Be honest to yourself and see whether spending so much time in a relationship has cut into time you could have been using to make more friends.  If you had more friends you might feel less compulsion to cling to relationships for companionship.

Just end it and move on for both of your sakes."

You should not feel this way in a relationship. Something needs to change, or you get out. 

&gt;It's been more than enough time for progress to be noticed, but things are worse now than before.

So why do you expect things to get *better?*

&gt;He's a super good guy, unbelievably caring and loving. 

No, he's not a good guy, if he openly treats you like this, despite him knowingly hurting you. 
No, he's not caring, a *caring* person would actually **care** what you think and how it makes you feel. 
He may be loving, but love means **nothing without respect** and he doesn't respect you enough to stand up for you.

&gt;What can I say or do to help him?

You tell him that this isn't working. You are unhappy and since he is unwilling to respect and support you, you are not going to date him anymore.

Have some self-respect and dump this @ssh0le.

"He made it explicitly clear to her that this was a dealbreaker to him, 6 months in.

But it doesn’t count because it’s not a dealbreaker to OTHER people? They are the only people in this relationship!!"
"You’re planning to join finances but it hasn’t happened yet. So he is in the right to do whatever he chooses with his money. You have no right to be upset. Expecting people to abide by rules that haven’t been communicated is just a recipe for disaster. People aren’t mind readers. 

However, it’s definitely fair to say, hey since we’re planning to merge finances soon, from now on, let’s start running major spending decisions by each other, anything above X amount. 

But I don’t get the sense that this is about the money. You’re uncomfortable with him being close to his gorgeous female best friend. No idea if any boundaries have been crossed that you haven’t mentioned, but all of his behaviour in the post seems like normal best friend behaviour to me. 

There is nothing inappropriate about asking for help from a very very close friend when she needs it. Her dad has cancer, her sister is disabled, and they racked up her credit card debt without her knowing. It’s not like she’s been fiscally irresponsible or anything. Would you have more compassion for her if she were male or less attractive?  

That said, it’s human to be jealous. You have a choice on how to act on the jealousy. Going in, guns blazing, demanding that your partner do certain things with his money, is not a constructive way to go about it. Anyone with a modicum of self respect would be like, hey, it’s my own money, back off. And then wonder if it’s a good idea to share finances with someone who is jealous and has a controlling, possessive streak. 

If you are jealous, be honest and loving with yourself and with your partner. Have a discussion.. don’t go in guns blazing. Say hey it makes me feel really insecure that you’re so close to Kayla, she’s gorgeous, talented, wonderful, super important to you, all of these things, I guess I just don’t see why you’re with me, not with her. I don’t want you to lose your friendship with her, but it’s really killing me inside. Can you reassure me?  

That’s where a good partner steps in and tells you why you’re more amazing to him than Kayla and works with you to set respectful, mutually agreed upon boundaries that he doesn’t cross in his friendship, to make you feel safe and loved. "

"This is the best approach IMHO.  He is a guest, not a roommate.  I wouldn't have a ""guest"" over to my house when I'm not there. If he wants to spend the night, that's ""okay"" (it shouldn't be every night), but he should NOT be allowed in there unless she is there."
"She is being selfish. If its a real open relationship, you both get to see others. You both get to pursue others and you both get to talk about it. 


Right now she has you being exclusive with her, while she gets to see others and brag about it.

"Imagine your relationship like a sandwich. It’s your favorite sandwich: fresh baked bread, mouthwateringly succulent slices of turkey, delicious cheese, crisp lettuce, and fresh tomatoes. You absolutely love this sandwich- it’s great, you’ve been eating it for a while, and you don’t want to stop eating it. 

There’s only one problem with this sandwich. Tucked between the delicious turkey slices is a little brown turd. Now, this turd doesn’t take up most of the sandwich, maybe only about 10%. While the rest of the sandwich is great you’ll still get the turd taste every few bites which makes you feel sick to your stomach.

No matter how fresh and expensive and delicious the other sandwich ingredients are, no matter that this is one of the greatest sandwiches you’ve had or think you’ll ever have, no matter that this sandwich is made with way more great stuff than it is bad stuff, no matter that this sandwich is one you’ve been eating for a while so you’re kind of invested in it... all that doesn’t change the fact that you are still eating a shit sandwich. 

Why would you willingly keep eating a sandwich that has poop in it when there are millions of perfectly good sandwiches that have no poop in them? 0% poop is the bare minimum level of acceptability when it comes to sandwiches. Even if you try your hardest to get rid of the poop on your current sandwich it is still ruined because there is no way for you to properly clean that sandwich. It will never be a safe sandwich to eat and it 100% will make you sick if you continue to eat it. 

Just like absolutely no amount of poop is acceptable in a sandwich absolutely no amount of abuse is acceptable in a relationship. "

My fiancé who is(was) one of his closest friends knows about everything. It’s weird because his processing style makes it seem as if he is unfazed by it all. He reached out to my best friend to let him know he has no animosity.

And you’re right - he told me he did have hope I would feel the same. I truly can’t believe anyone would think I would leave the love of my life right before getting married! I’ve been with my fiancé for 4 years. Best 4 years ever. "

If you continue to expect your SOs to provide heavy-duty emotional support, enough to handle severe episodes of depression, your life will seem to you to be an endless series of emotional betrayals.

The second thing you should do is recognize you might be in a phase of your life where you simply cannot commit to a relationship, given all the long times away for work.  Actually you weren't even able to commit to this woman before you went away for 3 months.

At this time you should expect any romantic encounter to be nothing more than a fling, and you should stop investing so much emotionally in them, putting expectations into them that the other person simply cannot perform."

Right off the bat he is completely in the wrong, ESPECIALLY if he belittles you while you basically do everything inside and outside your home, but i digress.

If you want to confront him about issues relatively passively, when it comes to housework I would suggest mentioning your exhaustion or offer to reward behavior that increases his productivity to make the issue apparent. Clear out all of the elephants in the room and make him realize how much of a toll its taking on your mind and probably your body. 

I am not one for revenge, but I don't think he would know what to do with himself if you ever left for a week or a girls night out. Just food for thought.

I never understood why some men take advantage of their partners. Every day I feel like I need to prove I am even worthy to my GF (not her fault, its just my mentality), and I enjoy spoiling her. I just don't understand this mindset. Maybe encourage that type of mentality as well. Usually when I do breakfast in bed for SO, she gives me a back rub or something along those lines.

Right now, your apologies aren't genuine. You say it yourself:

&gt; This entire thing is making me apprehensive about my engagement. 

Your engagement should be the last thing on your mind right now. It worries me that you think your teenager only has a certain amount of time to get herself together before you give up on her. A rational adult woman would look at this situation and be horrified for that poor girl, and tell you that wedding planning takes upwards of a year anyway, so there's no rush to work things out. I'm running on the assumption that the woman you're marrying is over 25, but if she's not, you've got way bigger issues than your daughter.

Right now your big focus needs to be on your daughter, not your fiancee. If she's told your ex-wife about what you said, I think a sincere apology directly to your ex would go a long way. It's one thing to act penitent to a bunch of strangers on the internet, but humbling yourself in front of your ex-wife is a whole other story. After that, family could be a good resource for giving her the space to talk to you without feeling judged. It'll take a lot of time and effort, but if you're sincere, you can salvage the relationship in the long term."
"I think the huge difference isn't that the sister doesn't vent about her BF, but that her BF actually puts effort into their relationship and into knowing their family. OP's BF doesn't do any of that, and I don't blame the family for not liking him when most people who hear of him don't. "
"Asking a question or calling for an answer isn't as big as you are making it to be. I don’t think you’re taking into consideration their relationship further down the line as well. You can’t snub close family and not expect it to hurt them or strain the relationship down the line. Obviously this is important to the OP and if this is where his niece wants to take her stand then she has every right to do so. 

&gt;Clearly you have never paid for or planned a wedding.

This is beyond rude and uncalled for. I haven't paid for or planned a wedding because I didn't have the luxury of growing up thinking that would ever (legally) be an option for me. But it's an event and this is close family. I understand both and that doesn't mean that YOUR opinion on an event is reason for you to be haughty and dismiss someone else's opinion.

"Okay, here's the thing: your description of this guy is pretty fucking vicious, and occasionally even verging on racist. I honestly don't even know how you expect to salvage a relationship out of this, if that's what you think of him right now.

To be honest, I feel sorry for him. You two are clearly incompatible, and I can't see any kindness in the way that you view him, so I think it's better that you break up."
"r/raisedbynarcissists

You basically have two options, become a mindless slave and let him control your life, or cut him off for a long enough period of time (like years) so that he understands he can't control you. Your dad will never be a normal dad and you will never have a normal relationship. I know you love him but you need distance to grow in a healthy way. He will never let you have that distance. 

I know you want to stick around and look after your brothers. But you can't rescue your brothers until you are independent. Put on your own oxygen mask, then help them with theirs. If you stick around and let your dad control you, you'll just be another victim. You have to get free. "
"Exactly like that. That you know it was totally consensual, so you aren't making any accusations, just that you feel like it became physical too quickly and you'd like to hold off on that for now.

However, you DID meet on Tinder, so if his intentions weren't necessarily for a lasting relationship, then he may want to move on, which is also okay. It's never inappropriate to have boundaries, and if someone can't work with them, then they're simply not compatible"
"You know deep down that you need to leave. You’re incredibly smart and self aware for pointing out your father if he behaved like this - you know what has stopped you from leaving. Your boyfriend will be fine. Just leave him so he can hopefully wake up to himself, it’s the best thing you can do.
"
Can confirm this is true. I am late 20s yo female with no interest in having kids and I didn't know. Not surprised if OP's bf doesn't know.
"You are not responsible for those things. You may feel that you are, and you're amazing for being that far above the abuse that you lived with, but you are not legally or morally responsible for your father's well being."
"She said that this is what she communicated to her boyfriend:

&gt; She and her husband had gotten into a fight about sex and intimacy, because she didn’t have to have sex yet.

And this is how he responded:

&gt; I explained the situation and my boyfriend started laughing and said that my friend should just have sex, even if she can’t normally it should be anal, and a bunch of other stupid shit. I don’t want to get into it too much. Basically all the examples I mentioned, all the fears I thought I worked through, came right out of his mouth.

And when she had a breakdown over all her worst pregnancy related relationship fears seemingly coming true he left. The dude wasn’t confused. And I’m sorry, but no reasonably intelligent man is going to think that most women are going to push a football out of an orifice, start caring for a newborn, and then heal enough to “perform” on command within a seven week period. So either he’s incredibly stupid or he’s just an asshole who thinks that a man’s sexual satisfaction is more important than a new mother’s wellbeing."
"How about no contact?

And got any quotes for that one? "
"The kind of guy who is so insecure that he has to make sure that the world knows that he has a penis. In other words, pretty much equivalent to the middle schooler who draws dickbutts on everything. "
"You've never experienced adult life without her. And I suspect that even though your marriage is going great, somewhere in the back of your mind after having bought a house you're feeling a bit stuck, as life with her is all you've ever known and is all you're ever going to know. You've never been alone as an adult and you're daydreaming about what that would be like. FOMO on a grand scale. But I bet if you followed through and left your wife and packed up and started over in another country, six months from now you'd be kicking yourself for what you'd left behind. 

You love your wife. And it sounds like you have a great life together. Try to remember that this is the only life we get, and we can't experience everything, and you already have what most people spend a long time looking for. "
"Your father is NOT completely independent.  He appears he has early onset dementia.  I'm not a doctor but I work in eldercare.  Get your father to a doctor immediately for an evaluation.  In the meantime, start making a list of all the 'slips' your dad has made so you can share them confidentially with the doctor.  You need to respect your dad's dignity, but you also need to keep him safe.  "
"You cannot be both boring and weird.

Weird is interesting."
"You know, it always amazes me how cold, miserable and hellish cheaters marriages always are....and yet they don't leave those cold, miserable and hellish marriages.  Not  until they find a ..... woman/man who is happy to have an affair with a married man/woman.

A lot of people don't want liars and  untrustworthy people in their lives.   You can lie about it but then you run the risk of someone spilling the beans.  Or you could try to tell the truth, but you won't make many new friends with that information.

I'm afraid that your past is as attached to you as it is anyone else.   Your infidelity does define you and your fiancée.  
"
"The advantage I can potentially see with adoption is it does give you more time to think this through, rather than needing to make an early decision. If (big if) it turns out that this is a knee-jerk panic reaction, then with some more time he might change his mind."
"OP, your desire for a partner who has a full time job is reasonable. However your desire for Emma to have a full time job may not be reasonable, not with her very fragile ego and inability to take criticism. 

Was the sexual and physical abuse in her childhood, or in adulthood? Was it for an extended period of time? Has she gotten therapy for it? Is she continuing to get therapy? Does she continue to have problems as a result of the trauma? How does she support herself, is she on disability? Does she even want a child?"
"You're right. I think he was trying to exhibit control over me. He used to do that in high school. Like he'd literally call me hundreds of times when we'd get into fights/he was exceptionally mean to me so I'd ignore him. I was young and dumb then though. Any boyfriend of mine starting at 20 years old to now could tell you I'm no doormat. 

How would you suggest I tell his girlfriend though? According to her Instagram she lives with him. He told me he only works 1 day a week (which I can confirm because the past 5 days he's been texting/calling during work hours asking where I am, where I work, send him a pic [never sent him a pic], and etc). I'm assuming she pays all the bills/rent."
"Propose to him in a grand fashion.  You'll get the answer you want.  Or tell him ""Screw my career.  I'm moving in with you for the week and we can drive back ""home"" each weekend"" (and be serious).  But I think you already know the answer.  He doesn't want to get engaged, He intentionally moved away for most of the week.  He doesn't even want sex when he comes back into town.  He may love you, but he isn't all that into you.  As a man, the porn and Instagram model stuff doesn't bother me.  If he lets you see him like photos of hot models, he isn't doing them, in all likelihood.  Ask yourself, is this what you want for the rest of your life?  Because the ""meh"" sex and career over family things don't cure themselves.  And by the way, you aren't stuck either.  Anybody can move their career...unless you are a marine biologist and your fiancé wants to move to a desert in Arizona or you have a signed contract with one specific company."
"Yup - I think OP's friend like the idea of being dressed up and the attention of being a bridesmaid more than actually wanting to be OP's bridesmaid. OP. I think you need to ask her to step back - she will only cause more drama the closer you get to the wedding. 

I say this as someone who had to reprint her orders of the day a day before the event to remove a bridesmaid. It started off small and escalated. "
"""If all the other wives pushed their husbands off a bridge would you want me to too? No? So can we get over what your friends are doing now, and instead talk about what you need to be doing."""
That's not the situation described here.  
"Wait, back up - babies and kids sleep outside in Iceland? Like, in a tent? Or on the ground? Or like a doghouse? This is fascinating."
"It's kind of his job to know these things though. The flu has always been the most lethal for the very young and the very old. No one thinks he WANTS his kid dead, but he needs to be more assertive about things when the life of his child is on the line. Would he let a toddler play with matches because he ""Didn't want to say no""? NO. And he would be a shithead if he did. He needs to get his ass in gear."
"I know it’s anecdotal, but I’ve seen more circumcised men complain their parents did it to them than uncircumcised men complain they weren’t. "
"Unless you pay rent and the utilities you're making more expensive because you're there, YOU. DO. NOT. LIVE. THERE. I would be SO incredibly annoyed if I was the roommate, and I'm quite surprised she hasn't said anything yet. I had a roommate like your girlfriend in college. It fucking sucked."
"Umm... I'm very very very atheist, but I wouldn't be bothered by any of those songs. They are so common it's ridiculous. Which is probably why they were chosen. Additionally, they have a long long long long history of being sung in choruses and--as someone who sang them for many years in public school music classes--they're also easy to sing. Another reason why they were probably chosen. You want a hard song? The Star Spangled Banner. You want something everyone can hit the notes and rhythm on that can be sung in a round? Amazing Grace"
"Fuck, this is like the 5th time I've made that mistake.

And yes, I respond to anal sex posts a lot, haha. "
"Well, this sounds like something which just came out in the heat of the moment. I've said I love you for the first time during sex before, and it definitely wasn't planned, it just burst out because I was in such an emotional state. You really shouldn't hold it against him, if anything it was really sincere and in the moment. I am probably a bit biased because I don't particularly like the traditional romantic recipes for doing things, but I think this makes a pretty good story for when people ask how you got engaged. Well, it would if it worked out. 

But yeah, marriage shouldn't be about how the person proposes, or about the wedding. It's supposed to be about the relationship and how it makes you both feel. If you want to marry him, do so. If not, let him know. But don't let something as silly as this affect your relationship, although this might also be seen as a warning sign of sorts. 

As for his part in all this, he is probably offended because he has made himself vulnerable, and wanted to take a big new step in your relationship, and you focused on the delivery of it and turned him down/stopped speaking with him. Sure, it was a stupid way to propose (subjectively), but that shouldn't take away from the commitment that he was willing to make. Talk to him. If the proposal itself means so much to you, give him a chance to redo it sometime. And good luck (and potentially congratulations)! Keep us updated!"
"I mean... It's kind of bigoted because you're making assumptions about women based on the number of sexual partners they've had. It's already clear in the way you make out like someone with a high number of partners must be a porn star or having regular threesome.

You're free to have that requirement, sure, but let's not pretend it's not something rooted in misogyny. "
We’re saying this because we’ve all been there. Wait five years and read this. It’ll be an endless well of cringe. 
Nothing this dude is described doing is loving in any way. I hope that's not how you were taught to recognize love.

"Oh so he just tried to guilt her into committing a felony, nbd"
Is the working situation a temporary one? are you planning on being in this line of work long? and is she looking for work currently?
"It's understandable you may feel frustrated and powerless listening to this. What you need to do is wait for a time when you are both calm and not feeling so many heightened emotions and stresses, and approach her with COMPASSION, not anger, not irritation, not frustration. You are her only lifeline after uprooting her life to be with you. You owe it to her to help her adjust. I get that she may seem dramatic and overreactive. A lot of women are at that age, she's nearing 30 and hasn't hit many mainstream milestones popular today.  
  
When you talk, express your feelings using ""I"" statements, Google it to get a good handle on the technique. ""Gf, I have been noticing lately you seem really unhappy (about shitty job) and anxious (about integrating with your friends and family). I feel powerless and frustrated listening you suffer and expressing frustration multiple times a day. I feel worried that the situation may be brewing resentment between us and I don't want that to happen. I love you. Please tell me exactly how you've been feeling lately, I want to make sure I understand your feelings correctly""  
  
That last part is important. Do not try and immediately solve her problems. Just listen. Really listen, actively listen. When she's done, repeat what she said in your own words. ""So correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you're really worried and self conscious about what my friends thought of you, because of X""  
  
And she will clarify if needed, hopefully. Research anxiety and something called ""catastrophizing"" described as a downward spiral where the person fixated on the worst possible outcomes of the situation. There are ways to learn how to dispel and de-escalate this as her partner.  
 
Generally, it involves investigating and actually talking about this seemingly silly irrational worst possible situation. Don't mock her or tell her she's crazy or just looking for trouble and thrives on chaos, etc.  
  
Actually contemplate for a second with her ""Ok GF, let's assume for a second my friends didn't exactly warm up to you immediately and acted that way to try and be polite, and you also feel like you lost your chance to be friends with them. Can you tell me why you feel that way, about losing your chance to befriend them? **LISTEN** OK gf, while I agree that is not impossible, I've known these people for a long time, I feel like it's unlikely they won't warm up to you and see how great you are. Haven't you ever met someone you weren't sure about, but later warmed up to? They could have been distracted about some other issue going on at the moment, and next time you meet them they'll probably be a lot more open and friendly. I feel worried and a little bit hurt to hear you write them off after only meeting them once. They're my good friends, and I am worried your fear may be trying to hold you back, and you don't deserve to be scared like that, it breaks my heart. I know how important it is to find friends after leaving yours behind for me. Do you think it's silly of me to be worried you may be missing out on some good friends here, just because the worst case scenario is they didnt love you immediately?""  
  
(Be sure to word this in a way that reflects the agreed upon worst case scenario, don't minimize her feelings on the situation) Ask her if how she feels about the solution, and ask her what she wants to do.
  
She gave up a lot to be here for you, she obviously loves you and is willing to sacrifice for you. So you can try asking her to give them another chance, for you, since you'd be so happy if you all ended up being good friends. You also need to be silent again and listen to what she thinks about that suggestion to Worst-Case-Scenario.  
  
Having these in depth conversations where you guys actually explore the situations and scenarios she's struggling with, and exchange feelings with each other with compassion and validation rather than defensiveness, and come up with a plan of action (or several) together. Validate her feelings (I'm sorry you feel unwelcomed GF) and talk through the catastrophy and reassure her that even if it the case, everything will still be OK, because you guys are a team and you're going to do everything you can to support her. And whenever you catch her whining about something, validate her feelings but remind her of your plans of action (babe i know youre scared but I really think they're going to figure you out and love you. I know how great you are, they will too. I understandable to worried/scared but we'll handle everything as it comes)  
  
It seems exhausting but it becomes easier once you figure out the patterns of thoughts (on both your parts) that lead to these situations she's worried about and whining about. You want to be able to lean on her for emotional support (you feel sad and angry and frustrated she's unhappy and feel powerless) and you want to be able to emotionally support her. You guys need to learn to communicate effectively with compassion and come to **compromise together** im sorry but ive known great couples break up due to these issues (she whines too much) and honestly after seeing it enough times I think it's not just the woman's fault. It's a common saying women don't want you to fix their problems, they just want support. What it doesn't say is you can understand and empathize and Validate her feelings without agreeing with them. And while you don't have the power to fix her problems, you do have the power to plan and collude with her about how she wants to handle it (she may not want your help) and offer to help her figure it out and consider things she may not have.  
  
Don't make this a one sided thing, you're not her therapist (truthfully she would benefit from CBT) you need to express your feelings and ask for support too. And while she is being pretty dramatic it IS understandable to be nervous about how your pre-designated friends in the small town you just moved to feel about you. I dated someone from a very small town in college, and while the relationship ended badly due to him being a liar... I LOVED his town and really appreciated him introducing me to the people important to his life there, often and with enthusiasm.   
  
His family were super sweet and welcoming and immediately treated me as a daughter in law and I didn't feel like an outsider, even when I was in the worst state of self esteem at that point in my life, and my social anxiety I had from high school had only been fading for about a year and half at that point.  
  
But there were struggles too. For the most part his family was great except for the alcoholic cousin who was nice when sober but said stupid offensive shit when wasted and drove drunk, family did nothing about it.  
  
Another pitfall to watch out for: You and your friends probably have a lot of great stories and inside jokes from your shenanigans in the past and from high school. Make sure your friends are making an effort to befriend her as an individual, even your male friends. This is really important for your best and closest friends to do. My ex's best friend was always so nice to me and would just talk to me at the little house parties we'd have and make efforts to get to know me and tell me stories about him and my bf. So naturally when my ex wanted to hang out with him, I was always welcome since we all got along so well but I was also not worried about them hanging out alone together or with the ""boys"".  
  
The major pitfalls: hearing about your exes and things and experiences or special things you shared with your exes in the town. Example "" Hey OP remember when you and your ex were hooking up in the bushes at that party when we were in high school and then we all went skinny dipping in the pond?"" Make sure this doesn't happen, be proactive if you think your friends may slip up when drunk.  
  
My ex even brought me to visit his grandma pretty often, and I liked opera music which is what she loved to listen to. So I would sit with her and chill with her while my ex did chores for her (mowing the lawn mostly). He brought me to family meals, brunches, dinners, trips to see extended family, all because he wanted to and liked my company (even though I could aslo be whiny at that age) and he was confident others would appreciate my company too. He even introduced me to his high school sports coach and we showed up to his younger siblings sports. It adds significance to the seriousness of your relationship. You plan to marry this girl right? So start integrating her into every aspect of your life in this small town so she can grow her roots. People and places are much more interconnected than she s probably used to. For example, my ex's coach was also one of his good friend's dad, a lot of drama usually circled around a particular family, everyone always goes to X restaurant in town because of Y. There's a lot of nuances that can be difficult. Ask around to see if people are hiring (most young people were employed in family owned small business wineries so they were lucky to live in a rural area with decent tourism industries)"
"I think that counseling is often worth it, whatever the outcome.  It can help you find closure together respectfully if it comes to that, it can help you think well about if you actually want kids or are just keeping up with your friend group.  It can help you evaluate if your desire for children is worth losing your relationship over."
"Maybe you missed something. But it's not your job to be a mind reader or to put up with this kind of behavior from them. Even if there is something else going on you're well justified in quitting. The ""putting up with your bullshit"" comment especially throws it over the top, I would be pretty mad."
"I wouldn’t say “served you right”, that’s a little harsh on yourself. But it is a mistake you won’t make again. Family and exchanged money doesn’t mix. Too often “gifts” end up with unforeseen strings attached. 

I would suck up your pride and try to talk to your dad, with your brother, to see if you can split the profit with your brother. Sounds like your dad just wants his kids to get along and wants to help out where he can (as incomplete as his gift attempt was, I think his heart was in the right place). 
Then you and your brother both get $2,500, which is obviously more than you have now. And with a kid at home that money will definitely help. 
Good luck!"
"Your brother is an asshole.

Did you pay off the entire remaining 7k? 

If so, than this situation is absolute bullshit. Your brother got a free car for 3 years and only had to pay for maintaining the free, expensive car **he drove**. He’s absolutely not entitled to reimbursement. 

Go to your Dad privately with a specific amount in mind and ask for that. Explain that he said it was a gift and you believed you owned the vehicle. Pull the new baby card and explain that you were relying on the money from the sale to pay for baby stuff. Activate waterworks if necessary. 

If he doesn’t budge than I would go no contact for a long time. "
"I would really rather not have known at this point. If I had found out back then, great. But finding out about something that happened 4 years ago just drives me crazy. I’d really prefer none of it came out, but I don’t know if that’s stupid."
"As someone who is 3.5 years clean, I always try to tell them as early as possible. 

This is a huge part of who you are, it has shaped you, and if you want to be intimate with her, she needs to know. You need to tell her.

If it is too much, then I mean, would you want to be with someone who is diametrically opposed to who you are? What you've gone through?"
"But also, your post history is a bit bizarre. You need some help. "
"Right? I have co-workers who completely baffle me socially (WHY are you a 40yr old man listening to Disney music and wearing shorts in winter??) but...who cares? I do my job, I don't dwell on their personality quirks, and we function as coworkers. I don't gossip about them behind their backs. Some of my co-workers are really obnoxious, and I have nothing in common with them, but oh well. It's not a big deal."
"&gt;give him time to deal with it his way

His way of dealing with his grief is to cheat on her. OP should not hang around being his dad’s unpaid caregiver while her boyfriend cheats on her."

Pretty sure the police won't want to get involved on that level.
Wtf. I could not bear to be with someone who does this. It would kill my sexual attraction. 
"&gt; She said she wanted me to know because she cares about me and doesn't want to do anything wrong, **but**

Bzzzt, nope.  Developing a crush is one thing, but the *only* thing that should follow a reveal like that is, ""and here are the steps I'm taking to be respectful of your relationship because I value your friendship.""  Not the place for a ""but"".

She didn't confess out of respect for you, your relationship with your boyfriend, or your friendship with her.  She confessed because she hoped that you'd be impressed by how *noble* &amp; *honest* she was that you'd actually let her have your boyfriend!

&gt; She's mad because she thinks I should let him choose and she claims she'll tell him herself because he ""has a right to know.""

Bull-fucking-roar.  She's mad because she still feels like *she has the right to your boyfriend*.  She's mad because she's already decided that *you* are in the way of *her* potential relationship with *your own boyfriend*.

I gotta ask, is she really your oldest friend because your friendship is *that* strong? Or has the friendship lingered for so long because you've put up with her till now?  Manic or no, that's not an excuse for pulling this kind of shit.

As for what you should do, you should tell your boyfriend what's going on.  He will probably have to sit down with her to make it absolutely clear that, not only is he 110% not interested, but she has blatantly disrespected him, 
 as well as your relationship &amp; your friendship.  EDIT TO ADD:  It's gonna have to be him because, unfortunately, he is the only one she will listen to.  Then you both should take a long, long break from her friendship."
You can love someone and wants what’s best for him and not want to be personally liable for their livlihood when it’s someone else’s responsibility. The two are not mutually exclusive. 
"You brought a religious nut in your gay friend's home. Shame on you. You owe him to kick her out and offer your apologies.

"The fact that the plans aren't finalized yet because your wife is pushing back doesn't change the fact that you *assumed* that you could unilaterally change plans without asking your her opinion first.

Stop focusing on the ""we"" right now and get into therapy yourself ASAP because if someone said those things to me I would walk away from the relationship and never look back. You have to take care of your self right now and learn to communicate and figure out why you have so much anger and thrive off it. If you guys choose to work it out then you can work on him attending therapy down the road but for now you need to call and book an appointment today, good luck!

Then respond to your brother's expectation of to stay with you.

Now I get he's your brother, he's family, so you don't need to do anything fancy for him.  So no don't change your schedule, go tot he festival, go to swimming. If they want to spend time with you on short notice, they can integrate into your activities.

Basically I expect your wife felt put upon to clean, cook and be a host without notice or consideration for her. "
"The fact that you would give up everything for him is the *problem*, though. Most people don't want to be with someone whose life is so empty or unhappy that they're willing to throw it away for someone else. Most people want to be with someone whose life is full of things they enjoy, things that matter to them, because a partner with a life they value is a partner who will enrich your own life. A partner who tries to latch onto your life because they don't have a full life of their own will just co-opt everything you have without adding anything of their own. Sharing your life with someone means there has to be give and take on both sides. I'm sorry if that's hurtful to hear, but it is an important thing to realize."

"Just because having a kid is the top priority still doesn't make it the best choice. Is it really a good time for to bring a child into this world when you have so much instability in your life? 90k loan is no small sum. You don't have a job yet. Your husband and you are not on the same page regarding huge issues like where to stay. What if your child has unexpected issues, would you be able to handle it now? "
I am going to leave a short note that says goodbye. Why exactly does this situation warrant an explanation though?
"You ignored a shitload of red flags with his contact with both of these women at the beginning of your relationship. It seems that you need to get better at recognizing red flags in your partners. 

Part of it seems to be that you refuse to listen to your gut and are allowing your partners to gaslight you into believing that you are the one in the wrong when clearly you are not. Perhaps some therapy to help you improve your self-esteem would be worthwhile, so that you can demand respectful behavior from the beginning and break up with assholes the second you see the asshole behavior."

"&gt; They were auditioning to be your boyfriend. They kinda suck.

It is exhausting to be a man, and get called bad things.

How exactly is a guy supposed to meet a girl?  Is Tinder the only acceptable method now?  The conventional advice is do activities you are interested in, when there is a girl there you are interested in get to know about her, see if you two like hanging out, if you do, ask her out.  It sounds like these guys are just doing that, and for doing so ""they kinda suck""?"
"There's a huge difference between ""acknowledging you had sex"" and ""comparing your ex's performance to someone you just met""."
"I think you need to get away from this idea of it being a problem in the first place - her requiring clitoral stimulation via fingering or oral isn't a problem, it's perfectly normal for a very large chunk of women. That's part of sex, sex isn't just the time you have your dick in her. "
You're married to him. That's absolutely your business.
"If you don't want to kick her out, and you don't want to have a legit conversation with her, and you don't want to talk to her about respect, and you don't want to tell her how her behavior is making you feel, I'm not really sure what advice you are looking for here. 

What do you want?"

"&gt;Do you know what cures self esteem, confidence, anxiety etc issues? A supportive significant other

Wow, that is just not true. A supportive significant other goes a looooong way in helping someone overcome those issues, that's true. But they're just that - a support. Only the individual with the self esteem, confidence, and anxiety issues can get rid of them. Source: I have self esteem, confidence, and anxiety issues, I have been with my extremely supportive SO for 4 years, and I'm still working on these issues.

"You are really naive if you think there's no sexual interaction going on at strip clubs. It's extremely easy to get head in a private room, or get a girl to leave with you provided you have the money.  The issue isn't the strippers. They can make a living any way they want. The problem is seeking out someone else to give you sexual attention and wanting it enough that you'll pay for it. Most people don't want to think about their partners grinding all over someone else, the exchange of money doesn't change that."
"Our rent is all inclusive of utilities so it's an easy to move out and not have any other loose ends. We do have mutual friends so in case there really is something, I can have someone else handle it on my behalf."
Nope. Sorry but this is factually and legally inaccurate. In the US the first time a dog bites a person and draws blood it is most often put down. I have seen it time and time again. Aggressive dogs cannot ever be trusted.

 It is so alien to me now to think about how much less than basic human decency I received from my ex. 

OP, I think you should explain the crying to your boyfriend as it is. You're happy and relieved and sad for past-you because you didn't know how well you should and could be treated, and those feelings are valid and good! If you don't tell him about it, well, most of us tend to worry over the worst-case scenario, and if he's as thoughtful, kind, and caring as you say then he's going to continue to worry about it until he knows what's up.

"I just think that most people go into parenthood totally clueless. I have a friend whose only experience with babies was through friends and she was in for a rude awakening. I know people who love their kids, but if they had a do over, they wouldn’t do it again.

I’ve seen many situations where the woman gets stuck with most child rearing responsibilities, even after they’re don’t breastfeeding. There are men who say they’ll be good dads, but there are many times that doesn’t materialize.

You’re right, though. Unfortunately, there’s not an agency to give people trial runs. "

"Well it obviously hasn’t been without issue has it! She may just have had trouble bringing it up with you before. If she has anxiety or mental health issues it would have been difficult and intimidating for her to speak to you and your gf about not wanting to have you there for half of every week or more. That’s a difficult and confronting conversation. So she’s been steaming and steaming about it and now she has snapped. She hasn’t handled it in the best way, absolutely, but you and your girlfriend have also been extremely unfair and inconsiderate to her. At the very least you should have asked he when she moved in if your staying over so often was Ok with her. And really you should not be staying over and waking up so early and making noise in a home that’s not yours."

The longer you drag this out the more it’s going to hurt. It sounds like it’s gone on long enough already. I’d recommend you break it off and find someone who is as excited to be with you as you are with them. 
"&gt; Either we only have sex on the weekends, or she figures out a way to get rid of a couple of her conditions.

Does she have a problem with that first suggestion? Seems like a reasonable compromise.

You sound nothing but derisive of her in your post. The fight was about how rudely you're speaking to and treating her, and from the way you wrote I would assume that was an accurate portrayal. Despite your claims of being calm and relaxed, it seems she doesn't agree and considering your level of dismissive insults at her here she's probably right. You don't get into that whatsoever and just want to talk about whether you're getting sex and what that entails."

"I am a bit more blunt person, so I would directly go to their house and ask to speak with the wife, with something along the lines of ""Hey, we don't know each other very well and this might feel a bit coming out of nowhere but last night when I was smoking outside I noticed your bathroom window is very see-through, so I thought I should give you a heads up."". Sure, it will be awkward but it gives room for interaction on their part. If I were the one to receive such a note on my door, I'd probably be too embarrassed to speak to my neighbours ever. But again, that's just me. If you go ahead with the note, you might want to omit the ""we"" part from it if you're concerned about them perceiving your roommates as creeps."
"It's a common piece of advice around here but:

When sex is good in a relationship, it amounts to 5-10% of said relationship. When sex is bad in a relationship, it feels more like 90%.

I understand your girlfriend's position on sex being an added bonus. Additionally, she doesn't have experience with sex, so how it will shape the relationship for her is still an unknown.

I think you should be more direct about the fact that the presence of an active sex life matters to you. Express that her timetable on when that happens is still of the utmost importance to you but that is part of the relationship recipe, not the cherry on top."

Your friends have been there for you through thick and thin it sounds like...why are you gushing to this friend about your amazing boyfriend when you know she is struggling? Of course she will not be super stoked about this. I'm not saying don't ever mention it, but you said yourself she was very drunk and you didn't even notice that she left? My friends and I text each other to say we got home safe. I don't understand that.

From my perspective as an outsider, seems like you think you are somehow better than her, more informed in your life choices and deserving of a happily ever after and she's bitter because she's not. You should have more compassion, especially for someone who claims to be a best friend of so many years. You are no better than she is."
"When my dad died, I asked my bf to come and see me, he complained he'd be missing a band practice. That relationship did not last! Some people just don't want to deal with other people's problems, even if they claim to love you."

"Your girlfriend is so wrong in every way in this situation. I would break up with her over this. She’s going to force you to solely support her unless you give her your car? You offered to drive her in the mornings. You even got freed for her to have the car if she pays. 

Honestly I would let her move out. I would even help her pack! "
"But it’s asking her to physically change for one day. What happens when she gets married or there’s a big family reunion or graduation and then Mum wants this to happen again. Or she has a kid and it’s inappropriate for a mother to have pink hair? Hair is a big part of your character because it’s one of the first things people see of you. So to me it is a big deal, especially as that’s one of her identifiers. Hair for woman is also a way of claiming identity and having control over their own life as well"

"You are allowed to break up with someone for whatever reasons you want.  That they are full of hate is a good one.

"This is a tough one.   

On the one hand, it sounds to me like you were a *little* insensitive towards her on the day of the funeral. The reasons you stated for not wanting to be there (broke/not feeling well/not a fan of the crowd) are understandable but the thing is that this day wasn't about YOU. Although you had previously agreed that you wouldn't go to the bar afterwards, she may have needed more freedom to mourn properly with her friends. Having you sat there visibly unhappy to be there probably wasn't that supportive and it may have been better if you just let her go to that on her own. It's better for you to not be there than to be there and be itching to leave every 5 minutes. Your plans for the funeral were very practical, but she was obviously upset and maybe it would have been better for you to ""go with the flow"" a bit more rather than badgering her to leave. There was no point in compromising on going to the bar if you weren't going to do it with good grace.   

But on the other hand, her sneaking away in the middle of the night without a text or a note is incredibly selfish and for a 33 year old adult I would expect better. Given that she's likely still grieving I would give her a pass on that, but it's understandable you are not happy about it.  

&gt;This has ruined my day before it even started because now I'm dreading the inevitable confrontation at the end it, but I know it has to happen otherwise she won't understand that this is a hard boundary for me.   


Is it not possible for you to communicate your boundaries *without* a ""confrontation""? You talk about it like it's an inevitability, but it should be perfectly possible for two people in their 30's to have a discussion without arguing. I wouldn't suggest it's very constructive to yell at someone the day after a funeral for a friend and to be honest will kind of make you the bad guy. 

Swallow your pride and try and be supportive on this occasion, although obviously if this turns out to be common behaviour for her then you should re-assess this at a later stage. "

"Sounds like they’ve been outsourcing their son’s emotional difficulties to you and your dog rather than actually addressing it themselves. Hence the frequent unannounced visits and boundary pushing.

They never should have allowed their son to become this dependent on a dog that isn’t theirs for comfort. It’s not fair to you or their son. If they wanted to get him his own support animal, they could (and should) have done so when it became clear that the kid responded so strongly to your dog. 

This is 100% their failure, as both parents and neighbors. Next time they harass you, hand them the name and address of the nearest animal shelter, and walk away. 

Unfortunately, continuing to let the boy see the dog at this point will only stress him out more. It gives his parents more opportunities to act inappropriately and upset everyone, and it’s no longer a source of comfort for him. I’m of the opinion that the visits should end now. It’s a shame that his parents ruined what was a very kind and generous arrangement, but the reality is that they did. They have the capacity (and clearly the money) to get Mason a pet of his own, and that is precisely what they should do. Whether or not they do this is not your concern. "

"He was with ""other friends"" is so vague at such a messed up time that this is beyond fishy.

Just sounds way too convenient to just happen to be with these ""other friends"" at the same time his, what i assume is a really good friend, is banging some broad at her house. I'd have a suspicion that there is a little pool of deceit, drugs/alcohol/, and women in this group of friends. Has your husband been on any overnight or late night/into the morning business meetings lately? Trips to the bar with the boys becoming more and more frequent? 

There is some investigation that needs to happen and your husband should have no problem with it given the circumstances.

Honestly, I'm struggling to figure out why you can't see this. You seem to willfully have blinders on about Nick.  Either that, or you know full well that he wants you, and you like the feeling, so you keep him around.  In which case, I wouldn't be trusting you either."

You could have played it as a mistake. ""Hey, a few of these are actually beers I bought recently and still want to drink, husband."" Done, nobody's lost face.

When you don't speak up for yourself, YOU foster and reinforce the perception that women aren't as strong or knowledgeable in a given field. That stereotype may pre-exist you, but you're directly contributing to it by acting passively and hiding your knowledge and will. We're conditioned to do this, I know, but please take some distance and try to look at it objectively. This whole story and your entrenched way of thinking about it make me feel really sad."
"So instead of being assertive in the moment and stopping it from happening, you exploded afterwards. Do you realise how this is actually not a good thing, and a failure in communication? 

Stopping him from selling your bottles would have been, at most, slightly awkward for a little bit. It would not have blacklisted him from ever getting a job in the industry, and frankly it feels like you're using it as an excuse for why you didn't speak up and stop it. 

You could have nicely but firmly been like 'Oh I think you grabbed some of mine, I'd rather not sell them. Please remove them from the logs yeah?', get your stuff, and then afterwards have a private discussion about why he felt entitled to just try to sell your stuff. 

That's a healthy way to handle a situation like that. At some point you have a responsibility to stand up for yourself even if it slightly inconveniences someone else, and communicate clearly, or you really just can't get aggressive and resentful afterwards. "
I have anaphylactic allergies and this makes me so mad for the simple fact that if I tell someone I have allergies they’re taken less seriously. 
"Similar to what is happening now to people with Celiac.  Sure, they now have many more options.  But now people are less careful because 99% of the people are just following the fad."
She might not actually be allergic but maybe her stomach is sensitive to them. 
"I wish more medical forms had space for ""negative drug reactions"" as opposed to just ""allergies"".  I went in for surgery last year and had to write codeine and morphine under the allergies section, then put ""Not Allergic - Violent Hallucinations"" beside them because there was no other section for it.  

I mean - yeah, I'm not going to stop breathing taking them, but I'm sure nobody wanted me tearing my stitches and punching a nurse or doctor because I didn't warn them!  And everyone was asking what I was allergic to because of the red bracelet and I had to keep explaining that they weren't going to slip up and kill me, but if they gave me either I might hurt them."
He's not coming to the city to visit you. He's purposely choosing a time when he knows you won't have time for him.

"&gt; EDIT: some commenters are already mentioning this. Avoiding my dad while he's here would break my heart. I haven't seen him in 8 months and I was really looking forward to exploring the city together without him interfering in my brother's vacation.

isn't your dad breaking your heart already by coming when he's not invited?  how else do you expect your father to learn that he can't get away with this behavior?  if you spend time with him when you told him not to come you are teaching him that he can do whatever he wants with no consequences"

"It's also worth mentioning that while she may not have cheated on you, probably at least one of these three outcomes are inclined to occur:

1) She will in due time cheat

2) She will in due time leave

3) In due time you will become miserable, with trust issues, insecure (about yourself in general), depressed, resentful &amp; more."
I’m sure his current girlfriend is thrilled with what he’s doing now lol
"Not celiac but have celiac friends and experience in kitchens: even salads and fruit/cheese trays are unfortunately prone to contamination. Salads often have croutons or the like, and many salad dressings contain wheat or wheat by-products. Fruit and cheese trays often have crackers and unless the kitchen staff is trained in handling things for complete gluten-free environment, preparation surfaces are often reused without sufficient cleaning to remove all traces of gluten. So even if a single salad or fruit or cheese plate were prepared, if it was prepared on a surface which has been used to say, cut up bread and the surface just casually wiped down, there will almost definitely be gluten contamination which will hit the celiac sufferer when they go to eat the 'gluten free' plate prepared for them."
This gave me hope that love is real and possible when I was starting to think that it wasn’t. &lt;3

"I don't think there's any way to tiptoe around this one.  He needs a major wake up call in general, not just as it relates to having a child.  You need to explain to him that his behavior is detrimental to your relationship, and you're not sure it can even be maintained at its current level (marriage), let alone taking it to the next level (co-parenting), without a significant change from him."
"So your daughter will learn to associate religion with boring, non-fun things? Or worse, think that it is something that makes her feel guilty or on edge? To me religion has provided a place where I could feel safe and accepted for who I am. It provided a place where people were excited to see me, were always respectful, and talked about cool things like social injustice or why we exist. Your daughter is not going to get that experience. Maybe she will be driven away from religion entirely, or maybe she will learn to obsess over it out of fear of making a mistake.


I think your wife is trying to self-medicate with religion. She's spirally in more narrowly and rigidly in the hopes that if she just tries harder then she will fix her problems. Something is horribly wrong and needs her to dedicate that incredible amount of energy towards fixing it, but that problem is not a lack of religion. Most likely, it is untreated depression. Untreated mental illness is life-destroying and quite often instead of just going away it instead feeds off itself and grows into a bigger problem. 


Before I became depressed I unknowingly had social anxiety and adhd. I thought my life was normal and I used sheer willpower to overcome the anxiety and executive dysfunctions. Everything was fine. But when I became depressed (probably a bit because I was putting a ton of energy towards doing things other people found easy and didn't have enough left over to focus making friends or continuing hobbies) that willpower started to dry up. I felt this happening and it scared the heck out of me. Out of desperation I dug in my heels and put in even more willpower. This made my willpower dry up even faster. I knew something was wrong and despite hating needles, blood, and doctors I scheduled multiple appointments and insisted that my doctor run several blood tests. It did not occur to me that I might be depressed or have a mental illness. My GPA nose-dived and I finally realized that either a) I fail out of school or b) I at least humor my therapist and doctor by scheduling an appointment to talk to a psychiatrist about whether I have depression. I humored the psychiatrist by taking meds I thought wouldn't do anything and getting an adhd evaluation that I thought would come back normal. It wasn't until I was less depressed that I realized that not only was depression a real thing (ie. not made up by Big Pharma) but that I had been pretty severely and dangerously depressed. 


Your wife is digging in her heels in the same way. She knows religion is the solution in the same way I knew physical illness was the answer. She's right that recovery will require significant energy and life style changes and she's right that it is something that needs prompt attention, but she's wrong that it is religion. If it were religion then the problem would have been fixed ages ago. Maybe its not depression or even any other mental illness, but whatever it is it is certainly not religion. A good first step for her would be to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist.


Slightly off topic: my interpretations of my religion's texts is that hell feels like depression. It is distance from God and existing without vitality. Being close to God is like the dead coming back to life, and becoming depressed is like being dead while you're still alive. The only reason I didn't kill myself is because I figured I would continue to feel just as dead except without even a physical body to occasionally distract me."
"I agree with you in principle but it doesn’t sound like he’s asking her to stay home and be a “traditional mother”. If my spouse was constantly working late, didn’t spend time with the kids even when he was home, and then bailed last second on a family trip to work some more I would be pissed too. 

It’s one thing to make sacrifices to provide for your family, it’s another to sacrifice your family for your career. It sounds like she’s more in the latter category. 

That being said, expecting her to take 1+ years off after every baby is ridiculous and I totally agree that OP is just as responsible for staying home with the newborn as she is. I’m more concerned with the recent behavior and the fact that the children constantly miss her. "

"Honestly, it's bizarre to me that you saw him in the process of selling your beer, you could have stopped it, but you decided it was preferable to let it happen and then be very upset about it later, than to pull him into another room and tell him not to sell your beer.

He's at fault either way, but I would much rather have a discussion about how he *almost* did something stupid and damaging, than about how he *did* do something stupid and damaging. His comfort in not looking bad in front of his friends is not as important as preventing his destruction of my hobby, and I do think you have some culpability here for choosing to let it happen. Unless he has taught you that interrupting the sale would have made him so angry that it would be worse than any other consequence, in which case you should get out if his baseless anger is that big a threat in your lives."
"I like this, but I can see how someone less confrontational might be uncomfortable doing it.

Not everyone is as lucky as you are, being able to have your parents pay you through college.

&gt; I do get jealous of him talking to other girls and I don't really want him to be friends with one

There is no way to make this not sound possessive, because it quite literally is possessive. Your reasons are pretty baseless and controlling, so you have no legitimate argument here against him doing so other than ""I don't like it."""

There is no time limit cutoff when it comes to cheating. And yes this definitely counts as cheating.  Confront him now and decide if this marriage is worth saving if you truly believe he has changed his ways. But if he only stopped because his friend got caught then there is a very real chance he will be back at it again once the dust settles.

Funny you mention this, I actually got into a cheese related car crash 4 years ago. A car hit my sisters car (not too hard, thank god) and I had a thing of chips and nacho cheese dip and when it hit us it went all over her and she swerved into the sidewalk. 

Completely unrelated, and I get your point, just thought I would share. 

Still, I disagree. This isn't about her feelings, this is about her opinion of me. If this was hurting her feelings, or really hurting her in any way, I would get it. But its not, its not like I turn into an asshole when I am drunk, or I stop doing household chores. My drinking doesn't hurt her. 

And this isn't about being right, this is about me not drinking just to prove a really obvious point during a 2 week stretch that has a lot of fun plans in it. Its my best friends birthday party, and when  I dont drink there whats my excuse, that my girlfriend thinks I am an alcoholic? My friends are going to think that is absolutely insane, they think I am a pansy when it comes to drinking. 

The reality is that her belief that I am an alcoholic is more important than my feelings. And that is fucked up, on her part.

"If she's so unreasonable about you drinking anything at all, the two weeks is NOT going to make any difference. You either get her to accept your behavior period, no more complaining every time, or you tell her this is who you are and she needs to either accept it or call it a deal breaker. If you don't want.to.give up drinking for her, which would be dumb, I think this might be something she'll never get over."

"Do you have any idea why you do this? You should figure it out. But it's good that you want to stop. 

I would start with a couple things. Tell her to call you out when you make her feel bad. And every time she does and every time you catch yourself, apologize to her clearly and directly. And give her a genuine compliment to boot. Remind yourself of all the things that are good about your wife--practicing gratitude and affection is always good in relationships, so make a list and go out of your way to say kind, positive things toward her on a daily basis. Thank her for the good that she does. Hopefully building up a culture of love and positivity will help you from falling back into being mean to her. 

And think before you speak. If you aren't going to say something nice, change your mind and just say something nice."

"Okay OP, in the following I’m not saying your daughter isn’t acting like an asshole - she is and she’s also being very self destructive. However, I grew up with my mum’s SO who sounds pretty similar to yours and it affected me in sooo many bad ways, I just want to share my experience and see if it resonates.

My mum’s been with her SO off and on since I was 12 (I’m now 26). He moved in with us and I can’t remember how it started, but about a year in we just did not get on. He is extremely childish and cannot take any perceived slight, so dealing with a standard teenager who thinks they’re smart (me) was like a bomb going off. As an adult I’ve realised he genuinely bullied me in my own home and it was SO SUBTLE - I’d be practising piano and he’d come in and turn the TV/radio on loud without saying anything so I couldn’t practice, he’d never say hello when he got home from work, he’d ignore me, he’d kick off if I asked my mum in the kitchen if she wanted a cup of tea and didn’t ask him in the living room, he’d hide my stuff.

Him and my mum had a very rocky relationship (still do, literally break up once a year) and she would ‘kick him out’ and tell me he wasn’t coming back, only for him to move back in a week later. No discussion, no warning, she’d just be like, ‘he’s moving back in.’ And I was expected to go back to playing happy families. When they fought he would always say, ‘Well you know why we’re arguing, it’s because of HER,’ as if a 14-year-old could be the source of all the problems that actually came from themselves. Kind of like how your SO calls your daughter a ‘fucking junkie’ and walks out, only to walk back in. My older sister didn’t like him either and tried to stick up for me, but for some reason I was the one he really bullied. My extended family knew he bullied me but would also make me feel ashamed by asking me to get on better with him ‘for my mum’s sake’. I love my mum and I wanted her to be happy, so I did try. Their situation to this day is still break up, get back together, and I’m STILL expected to act like nothing has happened once they get back together. It’s very hurtful and very hard to spend time with this man for me.

I have serious issues from this that have actually recently resurfaced after they’ve had yet another breakup/getting back together. I feel like my mum chose him over my well-being, because he bullied me and she actually told me I needed to ‘try harder’ a few times. That instability combined with my lovely stepmother dying led me to a suicide attempt at the age of 16. I have had CBT and I have been very healthy and stable the last few years, but when I think about it too much I am SO angry. As I’ve said, they break up at least once every year and every time it brings me back to being that bullied child. I don’t think I’m exaggerating when I say the atmosphere at home during my teenage years has permanently traumatised me, even though I can deal with it now.

I’m telling you this because this is the very real, very long term impact that kind of home life has had on me right into my adult life. I LOVE my mum, she was a single parent and made a lot of sacrifices for me and I really look up to her in a lot of ways, but God damn her relationship with her SO has really fucked me up. I never did drugs or anything like your daughter is doing, but on the other hand I seriously tried to kill myself, which stemmed from the same self-destructive need and depression. I know for me had my mum stuck to a breakup, I would have felt much safer and been much more mentally stable."
These are some of the same people that believe that condoms lead to pregnancy so they don’t use them.
I wouldn't be able to respect someone like that. Work ethic and drive is important to me in a life partner. It's okay if it's important to you too. Nobody is going to judge you if you don't want to tie yourself to someone like that. It's an incompatibility. I really recommend that you listen to your gut here or you've got a lot of heartbreak to look forward to.

"Jesus, I did not know it could get that bad. That will be the first question for future apartments hahaha!"
"I actually think she's being smart in not answering that.  If she starts to try to explain her reasons, people will just start attacking them and this will all become about convincing her why she's wrong.  She sounds like she's thought this through and is firm and confident in her stance, and is not seeking opinions on that in particular.  And that's fair, especially since she realizes the consequences and accepts them (probably having to break up with this guy, and narrowing her dating pool).  (And I say this as someone who is fine with porn.) "

It’s easy to think of the future during that time and cloud your perception of how things really are right now. Even if you got engaged, does that change anything? He will still come home and not give you the attention you want. He will still like pictures of half naked girls which sort of bothers you. You will still have doubts. I think you need to both come to terms with where you are right now, where you want to be, and when you want to be there. There’s a ton of communication that needs to be happening."

Cheating is my deal breaker, my husband knows this, because I would never be able to fully trust again and I don't want to live that way.

You can't trust this guy with something as basic as your health. 

Edited to add: I have a special diet and I've had to live with people who didn't get it, date with it, etc. What you're describing isn't accidental - that is 100% intentional. If it were unintentional, he wouldn't get mad when you wouldn't eat something that's bad for you. I would demand an explanation."

Instead of celebrating where Jane is at and where you are at, she's pushing on your husband to enable this fantasy too. 

To your husband, ""The answer is no and I'm tired of you sugar-coating our decisions as parents to accommodate their feelings. Shut down the conversation or I'll do it, and you won't like what I have to say.""

"Your reaction is absolutely justified. There is nothing irrational at all about being afraid of men treating women like shit when, as you have seen, this is not at all uncommon. Your boyfriend's reaction is disgusting and appalling, and frankly if it were me I would run like hell.

"Dating is a skill. Over time you get better at reading signals and expressing yourself and setting expectations and being a good partner and all that stuff.

Yes, it sucks when things don't work out, but use this experience to make your next attempt at something a little bit better. Do some reflection on what you would do differently, and use that to make your next dating experience more successful.

In the meantime, set some goals and spend time with friends and keep yourself busy."
"&gt;and we have remained friends

"Maybe so, but it had to be said.   "
