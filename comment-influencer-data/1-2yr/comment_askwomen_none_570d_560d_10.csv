"100% - it’s the kind of woman who is always in competition with other women and has to let everyone know how geeky/quirky she is, how she’s “not like other girls” and is super cool because she likes [insert typically masculine interest] and hates [insert typically female interest]."
"Something we talked briefly about but were then confronted with within a year or two of marriage that we felt ill prepared for:

What are each of your expectations when it comes to supporting family members or close friends in need? 

This includes but is not limited to--  
-Eldercare. Will your aging parents come live with you? Will you pay for a residential facility for them? Pay off their mortgage? Move to be closer to them?  
-Debts. Do you loan money to family? Give it? How much? How often?  
-Troubled siblings. Can a brother who lost his job and his relationship/living situation in one swoop come stay with you? For how long? Can a sister with a drug addiction and no stable housing do the same?"
Helping out in the kitchen during family gatherings. It's just not my thing but then I look like an asshole when I stay in the living room drinking a beer with the rest of the men.
"Slutty, crazy, bitchy, referencing “time of the month,” speaking of intelligence or competence in a woman like it’s extremely rare. Even compliments like that are backhanded "
"There's been a lot of moments I avoided danger but the time that stands out was when I decided to so something dangerous because it felt *right*.

As a homeless 19 year old in Vancouver, Canada a friend of an online friend on Columbus, Ohio bought me a greyhound ticket to come live with him.

I had called the internet friend with the last minutes of my phone in a desperate act of being less alone on a bad night, and was asked to call his best friend. ""Please, just trust me, he's good with this kind of stuff."" 

So I did, because why the hell not, and after only a few minutes into talking the man on the other end of the phone bought me a ticket to come live with him leaving in 5 hours. He said I could stay until the winter was over to get out of the cold. 

It just felt right. It really shouldn't have but I just went with it. I ended up staying almost a year and it completely reset my life. That man brought me into his family home, gave me my first Christmas in years, and fed and clothed me for a near year before giving me a bit of money and sending me home. Completely restored my faith in humanity, my faith in things getting better. "
"I remember on thread a while ago where literally everyone said they wouldn't mind if they had a daughter who grew up and worked in the sex industry.

I wonder how many of those people actually know any sex workers in real life? Escorts, prostitutes, sugar babies? It's a physically unsafe and mentally draining job that makes it more likely for you to be raped. It usually puts women in contact with actual messed up evil people. Human trafficking is prevalent is these industries. Absolutely nothing you would want your daughter to aspire towards. And I'm not taking about a camgirl who has the safety of her home or someone selling used underwear online. 

I feel like a lot of people on here have a lot of radical veiws but are too sheltered to know what they are actually talking about. "
"In my office, men are 'men' or 'gentlemen', but women are always 'girls'. Never 'ladies' or 'women', only 'girls'. We range from 27 to 50, but don't garner enough respect to even be referred to as adults. 

I recently was having a conversation with a co-worker about bringing groups of people together for a meeting, and he said, ""ok, you email all the girls"", so I replied, ""and you'll email all the boys?"" He made a shocked face at me and corrected ""I'll email the *men*"". 

Drives me crazy that men get to infantalize us, but doing the same to them is seen as wild disrespect..."
You're lookin' at it...
"Oh boy... here goes!

Settle the kiddo with a snack and tv. He's always tired after school.

Empty the cat litter. Take it and the garbage outside while taking the dog out to pee.

Empty my lunch bag and son's lunch bag. Wash dishes and containers.

Get dinner started.

Make lunches for tomorrow, this takes a while.

Finish dinner. Sit down to eat with my son.

Clean up. More dishes. 

Quick vacuum of the apartment.

Put son in the bath.

While he bathes do random cleaning. Wipe down bathroom etc.

Get son into pajamas. 

Lie on the floor and question existence.

Feed son a snack while he watches tv.

Do son's reading homework with him then read him a few stories. Tuck him into bed. 

Clean up the rest of the kitchen. Do laundry if needed.

Netflix and Reddit and tea.

Dog out at 8:30. 

Set out clothes for son and I for tomorrow.

Feed cats and doggo. 

Sleeeeeeep by 10."
"So this isn't exactly a word for women, but in Spanish the word for handcuffs is just the plural of the word wife (esposas and esposa). That's always bothered me."
"I have a large collection of make-up. I never use any of it, a bit of mascara from time to time. I used to spend my mornings painting my face and the evenings scratching it off again when I was younger. Then sometime I don't remember why, I stopped doing it. And when I realized this changed strictly nothing to how attractive people find me or how people see and treat me, I didn't think it was worth starting again.
Now, I also think this is really cool because everybody knows my true face. I get no ""Are you sick?"" when I had no time to do my make-up anymore. When I go to a special event and wear some for the occasion, I really look pretty with minimal effort because people are not used to the upgraded version of myself."
When they have to go into whether or not they find a certain woman attractive when it's not relevant to what they're talking about. 
"Make jokes about their penises.  A few times I've made vagina related jokes and EVERYONE in the room was disgusted.  Not about my vagina even, that might have been TMI...we're talking Superbad level type humor.  Had I been a man, and had it been a penis joke, I really don't think people would have reacted that way.  I still remember turning red as all the *women* in the room moved away into the kitchen to laugh about me (they later admitted that's what they were doing, so I wasn't being paranoid)"
"My father had a couple of friends I’ve never liked. 

They were pushy, overly friendly and very touchy. They just rubbed me the wrong way and I didn’t like it. 

Once, they invited us(my father, his wife, my brother and I) to a party. I refused to go because they made me uncomfortable and it sparked a huge argument with my father. Eventually, he realised he couldn’t force me to go and they left without me. 

Once at the party, which had been advertised as a large 50th birthday party, or something, they realised it was only the couple, my father, his wife and my brother. Fair enough, a bit unexpected but they wanted to make the best of it. 

Until the couple spiked my brother’s and my father’s wife’s drinks with the intention of sexually assaulting them and my father herded his wife and my brother home. 

He then came crying to me about it."
"LPTs about dating: Only date guys who DO good things are ARE good natured. If he acts like an asshole, he is an asshole. Don’t make excuses for him like “I know he’s good inside” or “he could be such a great guy if...” 

Also, NEVER consider time in a relationship an investment. What I mean by this is, never say to yourself “but we’ve been together for one year and I don’t want to have to start over with someone else now.” Allow break ups to happen. At the time it may feel like you’ll never recover and that no one can understand what your going through, but you will, and most every person can understand and knows how hard a break up can feel. You are never alone. "
"My thing with ""crazy"" is when it's used to describe a 100% not crazy thing. An acquaintance of mine broke up with his girlfriend of 3 years, both age 32, for wanting marriage and babies. Lol, wat. That's smackdab in the middle of normal, not crazy by any stretch. Incompatibility does NOT make someone crazy"
"I was driving one weekend to go to our cabin we had out in the middle of the woods. About 20 minutes before getting to the house, it's literally just dirt roads, just big enough for one car width, and trees on either side. I've driven back and forth between my regular house and our cabin in the woods MANY times before.

Anyway, there is a blind 90 degree left turn on one of the dirt roads about a mile before you get to the house. I was approaching the turn and had the most uneasy feeling ever. I slow down and tried to figure out if maybe I was about to have a random panic attack again or something.

Right as I slowed down and came to a stop before the blind curve, a huge red pickup truck came speeding around the turn so fast he lost control and ran off the road. Since the lane was so small and I was in a tiny sedan, if I hadn't stopped when I did, he would have slammed into my driver side door and totaled my car and possibly have killed me. 

I was completely in shock for half a second, but surprisingly calm after I realized what happened. I realized something in my gut made me stop before that turn, and probably saved my life. "
"I had discussed all of this before marriage but this is my advice on which chats not to skip before marriage.

 It's important to know where you both stand on the subject of having kids.

How you will split finances, will you now have joint accounts.

Surnames.

How/where you'll spend holidays (Christmas etc.) "

Yes, I hold you accountable to deadlines and responsibilities. Suddenly this means I want to crush your manhood, rather than, I dunno, get this project done on time and on budget. "

"1. Google Calendar. Being able to see your day-week-month all in front of you keeps things in perspective. 
2. ToDo Lists. Same idea as the calendar. Write down small, medium, and larger goals separately and prioritize. 
3. Lastly and most important. Low expectations. You can plan all you want but sometimes you just have to wing it. Learn to love it and the anxiety will go away. 

Take a day every week to review how your last week went and improvements you can make going forward. This can apply to all areas of life. Write them down. "
"1. Give yourself time to mourn the loss and the pain it came with. You owe it to yourself to shed the ache out. It’s not defined how long it’ll take but you’ll know when you’re done crying. 

2. Know when to stop crying about it. At some point you have to pick yourself up and start rebuilding. Explore outside your boundaries, find yourself in new experiences and without you knowing, you’re starting to enjoy life again.

3. Put yourself first. You are given the chance again to worry no one but yourself. Aim for a better body, do things you didnt get to do before, spend more time with friends and family – remember that this is your time. Spend it on rebuilding yourself :)

4. Lastly, take care of yourself throughout the whole process. Treat yourself to some ice cream and put some old favorite movies on play.

"My best friend's mother passed away and he couldn't take her cat in. I knew immediately he was my cat. He needed me and really at the time I needed him. My husband didn't want to bring another cat in, especially one so young, because his cat was a senior and not used to being around other cats. 

I convinced my husband to just try things out and if it didn't work then okay. Mr. Darcy has been with us for about 7 years and has made my life so much better for it. He greets me at the door, always sits next to me on the couch, is a total sweety to guests when they come over and is just a great cat! My husbands cat is great too, but she's been his for her entire life. It's nice to have my own little buddy and I hope my friend's mother knows he's in good hands.

"Not make their kids the center of their lives. The idea of ""Mommy"" is so enshrined in our culture, the idea of mothers as adults who have their own lives is judged pretty harshly, while dads are allowed to prioritize themselves and their careers above their families."
I want all judges to wear curled white wigs. 
Been alive 54 years.  You can't really depend on anyone else.  The only person you can depend on is yourself and only you are responsible for your life.
"I deleted facebook and twitter. I am SO much happier. I may feel a bit more out of the loop sometimes, but it's a small thing compared to how I feel. I have more time and I don't feel like I just 'know' stuff about people in a creepy way. I have real conversations now. I highly recommend getting away from social media. "
"For me specifically, these are the most frustrating:

* Wear basically the same thing to work everyday
* Have a special room in the house dedicated to your hobbies/just to hang out in (""man caves"")
* Keep your surname when you get married
* Want kids but not want to centre your life around being a parent
* Insist on doing activities likes to result in you having an orgasm every time you have sex"
I just find it odd how nobody ever upvotes anything
Chick. Females. Girls for adult women when you use 'men' in the same sentence.
"Crazy. In my experience, most of the time whatever the woman said or did was definitely not crazy, it was a perfectly valid reaction that the guy just happened to not like. Also, if you have 5 ""crazy"" exes, it says a lot more about you than it does about anyone else.

My friend went out with a guy for about 10 minutes who referred to every woman as a ""pair of tits"". For example, ""the pair of tits who works at reception"". He thought it was hilarious and couldnt understand why no woman ever laughed when he said it."
"Medical stuff. I made an off-handed comment about an allegery I have to a certain medication and my husband and had no idea. We realized we've never really sat down and discussed that stuff so we're putting it in a file in case we need to make medical decisions for each other. 

I feel so dumb for never thinking of it but I'm glad it came up before we actually needed it."
"crazy, bar none.

i hear it and just hear ''she had needs i didn't feel like dealing with so i labelled them irrational but like an irrational person she kept having them''."
"When I was at uni, I was the only girl in my class. The boys would discusses how they wanted to bang this girl or bend that girl over a desk, and the teachers did nothing. One day I said the word vagina and a lecturer took me to one side and said it was completely inappropriate language for the class room."
"Same window, different dressing: entitled to an attractive partner even though they have 0 of the characteristics which they seek, condescending about their niche- be it STEM degree/ particular gaming habits/ superior intelligence, uses ""sheeple"" unironically, often brogressive political ideologies but sometimes just a douche (or both), poor hygiene, out-of-date clothing style or ill-fitting clothes and thinks anyone who dresses well for their body or wears make-up is 'shallow' 

E: thinks anyone who shares their story in a discussion is trying to make anecdotes into data, thinks anyone who doesn't agree with their rigid ""well, actually"" views just ~doesn't understand~ them, shits on almost all pop culture, thinks outgoing or extroverted people are shallow or not as deep as the brooding standoffish ""introvert"" (uses that term wrong) that they are, and... most importantly, says they are ""not like other girls"" "
"24, sometimes you can do everything ""right"" in a friendship/relationship, and people will still not value you. Them not seeing your worth has nothing to do with you. "
"I haven't seen this one yet, but I think it's a conversation that is important.

Define cheating. Seriously. Not everyone has the same idea of what it means to cheat.

For example, is flirting with someone cheating? What about hanging out with someone alone? What about drunkenly kissing someone at a party? Hanging out with their ex? 

Where do you draw the line between harmless and a betrayal of trust?"
"I met a nest of ladydouches a couple years ago. They all wrote Captain America/Bucky Barnes erotica, fought viciously amongst each other, mooched like crazy, had all manner of excuses for why they had to eat a diet of garbage, talked about being soul-bonded to anime characters, smelled like armpit cheese, and had the hygiene, emotional maturity, and social skills of preteens."
"I remember birthdays for my husband, send cards for various occasions, help him pick out thoughtful gifts and remind him to call his mom and dad on Mother’s Day and Father’s Day and generally help him look like a kind thoughtful friend/brother/son.

I listen to him vent about his work as a database administrator despite the fact that I’ve no idea what he’s talking about half the time.

I do behind the scenes work like cooking and cleaning to allow him to have get togethers.

"Always asking me where things are. Dude, we’ve been living here for the same amount of time. How would I know where *everything* is more than you? Just take a look around before asking me, at the very least. 

Linked to that, when he emptied the dishwasher and places things in the wrong place and claim « he didn’t know ». 

But it’s not a deal breaker. I usually just answer with « I don’t know » if I don’t actually know and don’t feel like searching with him. "
"I had just moved in with my boyfriend, and then my mom died (which was a very hard time by itself, but my boyfriend is very good at supporting me with stuff like that). I inherited her house. It was - although a bit grim - an amazing opportunity. The monthly mortgage payments are next to nothing, it's in a very popular and nice neighbourhood in the centre of our city, with a big yard, and it's just a cute house.

My boyfriend's rental apartment cost us four times as much every month and it was half the size of the house and in a bad neighbourhood.

He did not want to move. I didn't want to live alone, but I didn't want to sell my childhood home and couldn't rent it out (I had to work on it for six months before anyone could live in it, my mom was a hoarder). We had countless talks about it. Didn't go anywhere. At some point we stopped talking to each other completely, then had a massive all-cards-on-the-table-conversation on whether we wanted to break up. Neither of us did. And we prepared to live alone, but still together.

Months go by, my boyfriend sees the progress I make on the house, I find a temporary roommate, move into the house, and all of a sudden my boyfriend says he is moving in with me in a month. Which was exactly when my roommate was due to move out. Now we live here and he's honestly so excited to fix up the house and buys so many plants and stuff to make it pretty. It's nice. "
"Maybe it's because I really want pizza right now but..

I want to come home to a homemade pizza making station. The dough and sauce is all set and then we just get to decorate the pizzas in all of our fav. toppings and cheeses.

I think I'll have to do this. I'll get some of his fav IPAs and a bunch of really bad b movies or end of the world movies lined up to watch while we eat. "
"I'll go with one of the ones that affects me the most.  Be assertive and stand up for themselves.


If not letting someone walk all over me makes me a b-word, I'll wear that badge with pride. I'm gonna be the biggest B you ever met, until I graduate to a C.  "
Female. Though even some women use this term.  In most contexts it just seems very off putting. 
"When people say their partners are ""not allowed"" to have friends who are not of the same gender. "
"My husband and I had problems with this early on. I had to be the one who *noticed* everything. I had to know we were low on milk, or there were dirty dishes, or the dog needed a vet appointment, or the refrigerator was leaking. He could walk into the house trailing clumps of mud and literally never see it. It drove me nuts. 

I bottled it up for a long time because honestly I’m not even sure I recognized it as emotional labor. 
But one day I did, and I exploded at him a bit (which obviously isn’t the super healthy way to go) and explained how having to “ask”him to “help” or prompt him or remind him all the time made ours feel like a mother-child relationship rather than a husband-wife. And that’s not sexy. 

I will say, his first reaction was along the lines of ‘tell me how to fix it.’ And I was like, that’s part of the problem- I shouldn’t have to tell you how to do your part and treat me like a partner rather than a parent. 

And he got it. We set some boundaries/expectations (I’m the one who restocks toilet paper, toiletries, etc, but he keeps lists of things he’s noticed we need; he does the pet care, and takes the trash out weekly, etc). and I’m so much less stressed out. 

In fact, I’m laying in bed redditing while he’s downstairs, completely unprompted, loading the dishwasher. Change is possible! "
"Walk in to him sitting at a table with a board game set up and enthusiastically challenging me to a game of whatever. There is Thai food and Parks and Rec on in the background.

"If you plan to have kids together discuss how you plan to raise them. What are your views on discipline, chores, teenage jobs, paying for college, etc. I knew my husband and I both wanted kids, but I had no idea our views on how to raise them were so different."
Being indifferent to children and/or not wanting them.
"More of a mentality than a behaviour: When a bi woman is in a relationship with a man, and the man thinks that if she kissed another man it would be way more serious cheating than if she kissed a woman. "
"Being open about sex. Unless you're talking with your ladies, as soon as a women opens her mouth about her enjoyment for sex- or her sex life in general- everyone's tails are up."
"My husband and I were together for such a long time that there was basically nothing we hadn’t discussed before getting married. 

But financials. How are you going to combine finances, a basic budget, financial goals, what kind of debt you currently carry, etc.

When we got married I knew my husband had a mortgage, and some stocks. He was always pretty vague about finances and gave the impression that he just didn’t really know how much he had and owed. Despite me asking very specific questions, he would only give vague answers about basic things like his monthly take home. I’m a financial planner by nature and had laid out every cent for him.

The day after we got married he took me to the bank to put me on all his accounts. He showed me his stock portfolio and how little he still owed on the house. It was a life changing amount of wealth. He thought I’d be pleased and surprised and was a bit... confused when I burst into tears and started yelling at him. I was frustrated he’d hid things and felt like he didn’t trust me. We got past it, but it was quite a shock."
"I wanted to be married before having kids. Nothing wrong with people who choose not to, though! I just personally wouldn’t be comfortable doing that. "
"I was terrified of him seeing me without make up on as I had very bad skin (and still continue to have flare ups). 6 years later and my skin has been everything from crystal clear to landing me in hospital and he has never treated me different at any point.

I still feel embarrassed about my skin, but I feel safe with him and know he still loves me no matter what. "
" My husband will never be on time to anything.

Fortunately, he's completely fine with me reminding him that we need to leave in 30/25/20/15/10/5/2 minutes, and with me telling him flat out that he doesn't have time for something.

If he were stubborn about his lateness, that would be an issue, but he just gets distracted and loses track of time. "
You’re a superhuman. 
"I’m a college student who works at a country club as a waitress. I’ve only been working there 3 months. When I started I was told about a wealthy couple who always tips a minimum of $100 when they come in, which isn’t often (maybe once a month). I was lucky enough for them to sit in my section back in January and I managed to make a really good impression and they left me $200 on the check. They loved me so much that they told me they wanted me to serve them the next time they came in. Last week I came into work and they had called ahead and requested me as their waitress. They gave me $100 cash and left me $100 on the check and told me that they’d request me every time they came in and asked for my schedule. I feel almost bad because my coworkers don’t have a chance now to get them in their section but I’m very proud and honored that they like me enough to only want to be served by me. "
Something I don't understand about this sub is how everyone here seemingly prefers being single yet every post is about dating/relationships/SO's. If being single is so much better why is everything about relationships?
"* being ""nice"" so that other people feel good.  This may involve expressing gratitude for things you're not actually all that grateful for, smiling or putting on a happy face when you're having a bad day, 

* listening when someone else needs to vent.  Not telling them what to do or what they did wrong, just listening and holding space, validating their feelings.  This may involve seeming interested in things that you really aren't all that interested in.  

*  Not expressing your feelings when they might make someone else uncomfortable.  This can be temporary or could be permanent.

*  Being a safe place for other people's vulnerability.  This may involve hearing very difficult things, other people's grief or confessions or shame, and just ... bearing it.  Being strong and stable enough so that other people don't have to be.

Essentially, it's caring for the emotions and psychic well-being of other people.  It means sometimes putting other people's emotional needs above your own."
"This is a good one! Depending on your views, you really can marry the family, not just the person. We let a dear friend and his SO live with us for nearly a year, and... resentment ensued, for a few reasons, and I will never ""un-see"" certain things. My husband and I were fine, but it was a strain, to say the least. "
"My mom always told me never let a stranger into my car. I got off work at a 24/7 grocery store at around 11pm. It was located pretty out of the way, right in the middle of white rich suburbia, about a 20 minute drive back into town. I was getting in the car ready to go when this young woman ran up to me asking me for a ride. I knew she missed the last bus, she looked really out of place for that area (low income, bordering on sketchy), and I knew no one else would drive her in. So I did. She was nice, unfortunately hooked on drugs, but all she wanted was to go home. Nothing bad happened, I let her out and she thanked me. She didn't try and steal anything, didn't ask for money, and was really honest (""So I'm technically a drug addict...but I'm working on it...you can let me out here if you don't want to drive me anymore."") I would never have done that if something inside hadn't told me to help her. "
"It's just the neckbeard characteristics; unhygienic, socially awkward, superior attitude (""my IQ is 150 according to this internet test!""). Weeby interests are associated with it, so tgey might have a crush on a male anime character like a male waifu. 

Anecdotally I find them to be the types of girl with tumblrs dedicated to gay fanfiction, or who reblog posts about heartbreak and being a good girl in a society which ""only values sluts"" (as opposed to a neckbeard who would post about how women don't go for nice guys, only love Chad, etc).

"I feel like there’s a lot of straight couples that just straight up don’t like or respect each other? Like the whole “ball and chain” schtick, or the jokes about the wife dragging the husband down the wedding aisle kicking and screaming. I see that a lot in engagement shoots. Or even the ol’ “My wife is such a nag, I have to have my own room of the house that she’s not allowed in!” kind of thing. I’m a bisexual woman, but I would never allow a male partner to treat me like I’m a thing he has to tolerate. "
"I don’t find it unusual, and I understand why, but I still find it weird how much people care about sex here. It’s just not a factor in my mind most of the time."
"When I met my husband I knew it. I *knew*.  I was visiting from out of state so I knew absolutely nothing about the man but I knew he was going to be my husband. We went on one date and a week later I packed a bag and drove over 200 miles to visit him at his place 'for a week or so'. I knew it was crazy. I knew it was potentially dangerous. I knew that this was how women ended up chopped up in a freezer somewhere. I knew it was rash and dumb and I would have advised anyone else against it.

I didn't care.

I went for a visit and never left; ended up moving in with him suitcase and all. Less that a year later we were married; that was ten years and a kid ago &amp; we're still going strong.

"While I’m visiting home for the holidays, where my 22 year old brother still currently lives:

"He is my best friend, who I trust above all else, opinions etc, he can still make me belly ache laugh and we have amazing sex. And we spilt everything, cooking he has dishes that only he can cook, likewise I do. He has to clean the kitchen likewise I have to do the bathroom.

The secret, making sure your partner is exactly that, beauty fades, opinions/beliefs can change, situations change. To know that, that person next to you has your back 100% and will laugh with you all the way through it that's it for me."

I thought about my favorite hobbies
"Oh my god, I work in recruitment and like 90% of my office (of around 70 people) are men. Whenever we have a new woman due to start, all the guys are on her Instagram, Facebook and whatever else trying to find bikini pictures and see how hot she is.

Funnily enough they're never looking up her LinkedIn profile 🤔"
"That it hurts a lot, especially in the beginning, when you're rehashing old hurts, explaining your backstory, experiencing old emotions like they're new again, grieving for what could or should have been.  It might feel like too much and it's very easy to give up when you don't sense immediate improvements.

That you might not click with the first therapist you see.  It's a relationship that has to develop, and if it's not working that doesn't mean ""therapy doesn't work for me.""   Give your therapist a few sessions and feel it out.  You might have to switch, and that's okay.

That you might develop some weird ideas around your therapist.  With my first therapy experience, I was convinced he was about to drop me as a client at any moment.  I was so afraid he was judging me and would at any moment go, ""I can't see you as a client anymore.""  I was transferring a lot of fear on him because this is essentially what my dad did.  I talked about these fears with my therapist and he helped parse them out.  So whatever you find yourself feeling about your therapist in particular (you might even develop a crush), TALK about it.  This is part of the process.

It's going to take some time and you might not see immediate results.  It might stress you out, but that provocation is the grounds for changing yourself from the inside out.

Congratulations and good luck!  My current therapist has been a rock in my life for nine years now."

"I “do it all” by trading being a fun person. Honest to God. I maintain a household, work 60 hours/week, make time for friends, and exercise. On the outside, my life looks “together.” On the inside, I’m screaming. 
I used to be more like “do what needs to be done only” but as I got older, my expectations increased too. Sigh. 
Remember: you can do anything, but you can’t do everything. "

"Locking somebody into a legal contact before springing a surprise on them, especially one as important as finances, is a pretty shitty thing to do.

If you're so worried that your partner of X years only wants you for money, then surely there's a deeper problem. If you feel you must wait, do it after you're engaged. Not after they consent to a legal agreement without all the facts about the agreement they were entering.

"A guy pulled over while I was waiting at a bus stop alone at night. He seemed friendly enough, and told me the bus drivers were on strike, so my bus wasn’t going to arrive. He then offered me a ride, to which I said ‘no’ because I was trained from a toddler never to accept rides from strangers. He was persistent, but I kept saying no. A car came down the road and honked at him, he jumped like he was electrocuted and drove off quickly. 

The thing is, I believed him that the busses were striking, so I started walking away, and not 2 minutes later the bus I had been waiting on passed by. The guy had clearly lied to get me into his car. I still sometimes wonder where it would have gone if that other car hadn’t honked at him. "

"I'm Asian and he's white. I worried that he was one of those people who fetishised my race and didn't actually like me as a person. Before we got together, he made a comment about how he found Asian girls the most attractive.

Months into the relationship I brought up that comment. He admitted that it wasn't really true but he liked me and thought that saying that would give me a hint. I explained the whole yellow fever worries I had and he was so embarrassed."

"I've observed that most of the men I know who are terrible at emotional labour seem to be in long-term committed relationships, but very few if any of the women I know who are terrible at emotional labour seem to be able to find someone who will stick around.

"There's been a few instances. 

The guy that tried to kill a friend of mine.... Yeah, I knew he was bad news. Barely even knew him. Something was just off about him. About 6 months later, he tried to kill her. The girls Mom happened to just get a feeling herself, so drove over to check on her daughter. Right at that moment, it just so happened the guy was fighting with my friend, had a bathtub filled, and would have drowned her if her mother hadn't showed up. "
"It's cliché, but I really love coming home to see new flower arrangements. I also love new plants too."
"I was overall unhappy in the relationship and didn't like who I was becoming. What I thought was love at the time kept me from ending it for a while. But, once I realized I couldn't see a future with him at all, I decided to end things. For me, it was the right thing to do because he seemed so invested in the relationship and I couldn't keep dragging him along knowing how I felt. "

"This thread seems pretty black and white. It seems like no makeup is some sort of holy grail. 

Let me tell you another story. I had severe acne and makeup was the only thing that helped me feeling somewhat decent about my appearance. Fast forward a few years and my skin has gotten much better. However it's still blotchy remand red and uneven in tone. So applying some light foundation to even the skin tone a bit of blush and mascara makes a world of difference! Makeup can make such a difference when you know how to apply it an choose a natural makeup. I ageee there is rarely a need to cake on a ton. But I'm definitely not one of these natural beauty's and I've tried because the time it takes to do makeup is long.

But the thing that definitely changed from teenage days: I don't feel like hiding my natural face anymore. I used to almost feel ashamed even going to buy groceries without makeup. Now I do not even give a crap anymore. On weekends I don't wear any anymore and I am totally fine. So I think even if you wear makeup regularly its important to realize there is no need to be ashamed for your real face. :)"
"Each morning after my coffee.

I only realized that that wasn't just how bodies work when I went on a group holiday and commented on how having only one toilet would lead to constipation (hehe) at the bathroom door each morning and people where amazed at my 'predicting my poop' abilities. "
"It doesn't bother me in a personal setting. My boyfriend calls me a girl occasionally (but never in a way I find remotely disrespectful). ""Guys and girls"" is ok in a personal setting. But ""men and girls"" is NOT OK IN A PROFESSIONAL SETTING, DALE, I AM A WOMAN. "
"I was paranoid that I wasn't his ""type"" and that we wouldn't last because of that. I was 6"" taller than any of the other girls he'd dated before.

But ""types"" don't mean anything and obviously it was fine. I wore heels at our wedding and looked down at him while we said our vows and he's now the proud father to a long ass baby daughter."
It was a total benefit. Yes I felt like I was missing out but not having that stress or sadness some social media brings was well worth it.
The only real sticking point my husband and I had after we got together was where we'd be spending holidays. Everything else was talked about or just naturally sorted itself out. Three years of marriage (almost) and we're still squabbling over holiday arrangements.
"I'm going to have to second the jealousy over opposite-sex friendships one.  As a lesbian, this would never work out for me as I have a best female friend that I share emotional intimacy with and would never be willing to give that up for a relationship.  Luckily, most lesbian/bi women don't care.

Another thing:  Some heterosexuals will say that teenagers and young adults are too young to know their sexuality, yet they sexualize the interactions of babies and toddlers who smile at the opposite sex (ladies man, she has a toddler boyfriend, etc)."

"Emotional labor is when my husband and I took our dog to the emergency vet, a dog we've both owned for 6 years, and he looked at me helplessly when the vet tech asked who our regular vet was. 

Its also every time he stares at the looming pile of recycling and says aloud, ""Khajit, we should take the recycing out soon."", and then continues living his life as if the thought he could do something about it himself never crossed his mind.

It's also the time I asked him to clean the bathroom because I was very ill but we had company coming in a few days, and he reappeared in the bedroom to ask me ""how to clean it."" "
"Not starting your sentences with an apology or sugar coating things.

"Dating.  I'm not poly (though there's nothing wrong with people who are), so I would never date multiple people at once, which seems to be the current trend.  I don't even know how people keep so many relationships straight!  The whole idea of the ""exclusivity talk"" is alien to me.  We're now assumed non-monogamous until explicitly stated, which is the complete opposite of when I was younger.  But I'm old-school, so one relationship at a time for me!"
"That so many people seem to have no difference in boundaries between friends of any gender. Maybe it’s the type of activities I do with my friends? But to me, there are definitely differences. 

For example, I’ve gone on a “girls’ trip” to Europe with a female friend and left my SO in the States. Could not imagine leaving my SO behind while I went on an overseas trip with a guy friend. But the way so many people talk in this sub, it seems like they would have no problem doing that? Or do they not take overseas trips with just friends at all? 

I don’t know. I can’t relate to that mindset."
"Or “calm down,” no one says that to a man when he’s assertive"
"Slut, whore, ho, etc. Any term that shames women for having sex or wanting sex, really. (I also hate it when women use these terms against other women as well)

I've also noticed that some men can't comment on anything a woman does without referring to her level of attractiveness or *something* about sex. Perfect example of this is in /r/roastme. Any woman who posts there, and who is even moderately attractive, will get mostly all posts about being a slut/whore/fucked by an uncle/fucked by the football team/casting couch/etc. 

It's like these guys see a woman and all they can think about is sex. She's not even a full person to them. If she's attractive she'll receive posts about how dirty and worthless she is because of how much sex she's having, and if she's an unattractive woman she'll receive posts about how no one wants to fuck her and therefore she's useless. There are very few, to sometimes no posts about personality, job, interests, etc. when a woman posts. If anything, the variation will be about how attention seeking she is or whether or not she has the ability to get a boyfriend...or was dumped by a boyfriend and is now worthless.

Meanwhile, when a guy posts to /r/roastme he'll get all kinds of responses about his interests, personality, job, etc. Yes, he'll get some referring to people not wanting to fuck him or whatever, however it's not the main focus of the comments. 

Edit: For example, one of the top posts there right now is a woman with her hair pulled back in a ball cap, and a loose butcher's shop work shirt. The top comment is about how she looks like a low-budget porn star. "
"It's the Dory method -- just keep swimming.  

Not literally; I didn't go to the pool.  But I just kept getting up in the morning and doing something.  What was in front of me.  Some days, that wasn't anything more than watching X-Files episodes.  Other days, it was more.  And it took *months*.  

Some of the things I did during that time were therapy, walks, filing for my divorce, hung out with friends, wrote my dissertation, working on improving my scrambled eggs making."
"I always wondered where the stereotype of the ""nagging wife"" came from. Then I realised it has little to do with nagging, more to do with the (hopefully minority of) husbands who are totally inept at doing reasonable things, like helping to maintain the house they are living in."
"One of the best things you can do is to treat your wife/mother of your daughter as an equal and capable partner. Ensuring that your daughter knows she should be in a relationship with someone who is willing to respect her opinion on all matters, help around the house, make sacrifices for her career, etc.. Showing your daughter how she should be treated by her partner is incredibly valuable. "
"Remember the age you were 4 years ago. 

So if you're 14, remember what it was like being 10. 

When you're 18, remember what it was like being 14. 

Recall how silly and immature and swept up by silly things you were. How convinced you were that you'd love something forever and ever, only to become indifferent toward it a few months later. 

9/10 times, in 4 years you'll look back on your present self and think 'wow I was a a goofy nitwit back then' 

Things start leveling out a bit in your 20's. 

Until then, think back 4 years and try not to commit yourself to any life-changing decisions. 

(And really, the likelyhood that your One True Love just HAPPENED to be born within 1-2 years of you, in your school district is.... kinda astronomically unlikely. Remember all those friends you made in middle school that you no longer associate with because you don't SEE them every day? Once you're out of higschool, you realize a LOT of friendships and relationships only worked because you were forced to be in the same room 5 days a week)"
Not sure why I thought of a black ski mask instead of facial mask 
"I used to plaster on so much makeup and spent SO much money on my appearance in general (waxing, tanning, designer clothes, chemical hair straightening, etc). During that time, I refused to leave my house without makeup and I did my makeup in a dimmed room because seeing my own face without makeup caused me to spiral into a panic attack. 
I believed that no one would want anything to do with me without it. I thought no one would want to date me, be friends with me, hire me, etc.

Fast forward a few years: you couldn’t pay me to put on makeup and I do not even own any. I wear men’s plaid shirts from thrift stores for 50% of the time. I do not pay for any beauty treatments (no waxing, nails, tanning, etc). I don’t wear bras. I wash my hair and let it dry without any styling or hair products. 

At this point in my life, I was hired for a job I love, I have more close friends than ever before, I have received romantic attention from BETTER people and not sleazy ones. People feel safe to open up to me. Strangers smile at me.
Why? Because I am myself and I come off as a warm, authentic person. I used to look like a walking Barbie and was treated as such (most people were very cold towards me).

*this change happened while recovering from an eating disorder...hospital stays and times in residential treatment gave me a ton of time to find my soul-self. My raw and natural self has proven to be the best way in my life.

Never really an inbetween, I'm working on balance. "

"I said this in a reply but decided to add it to the main thread with a story.

I was awkward and fairly unattractive while I was growing up. I hated girls who were prettier than me because I thought that’s all they were good for. None of them were nice to me so why should I be nice to them? None of the guys I liked, liked me back, they all liked prettier girls.

After high school my group started hanging out with one of the girls from high school who I thought was nothing more than a pretty face. She was easily the most attractive girl I’ve ever met, and throughout high school she intimidated me. After a night of partying she asked me if I wanted to go to Denny’s to talk, I did.

The female version of a Chad who I was positive was a shell of an attractive person, who to me, wasn’t smart, wasn’t funny, and wasn’t kind... turned out to be the sweetest person I’ve ever met. Not only was she smart, she had this sense of humour that matched mine so well. I went from hating her to loving her in one night.

She is one of my closest friends and I am so grateful I sat with her in that Denny’s at 4am and shot the shit.

Long story short, I asked her to give me a makeover and teach me how to use makeup/do my hair and my self esteem sky rocketed. I felt good about myself for the first time EVER. A lot of those dudes I liked who didn’t like me back were in my inbox, I realized I didn’t want them if all they cared about were looks.

While today, I rarely wear makeup or do my hair, I am thankful I had a friend who showed me a side of myself I have never seen before. I believe she is a big reason as to why I am truly comfortable in my own skin.

Thanks Boo, I love you so much."

"This is me personally, I know lots of women who would definitely say it's breakup worthy.

Extreme financial style differences. My SO hemorrhages money. I am an absolute tightwad. 

I find it very annoying when a major expense comes up, whether planned or surprise. I usually end up footing the bill and letting him pay me back. 

His other qualities well outweigh it. The fact that he always pays back his half &amp; pays our rent on time definitely downgrades it to Bad Quality That's Not Breakup Worthy. 

If he were late on the rent every month or putting us in debt, it would be a *very* different story."
"Story 1

This happened 10 years ago. 

My mum had fallen for a guy online. At the time that wasn’t the norm yet, but I had played a lot of MMOs and understood it. After a while she plans a visit. He was in America and it just so happened that I was planning on going to school there so she decided we would spend 1 week visiting schools in one state and then 2 weeks at this guy’s place in his state getting to know him and the area as she wanted to move there in the future. 

We do my school stuff and fly over to his state where he picks us up from the airport. Instantly upon meeting him alarm bells go off in my head and I do not trust this guy one bit. I tell myself “it’s the first time you’ve seen your mum dating, you just feel weird, ignore it.” 

He takes us to his truck and gets us to all sit inside. He drives us through endless cornfields. I realise I’m stuck in a truck with an old guy I don’t know in the middle of bloody nowhere. Just endless road and endless corn fields. Something about him is setting me off and I’m like “I need to get away from here.”  

We start meeting locals and some of them act really strange with very backwards sexist commentary.

He then takes us to get fast food but treats the servers quite badly. There’s an air of “I don’t care if I make someone’s life difficult as long as it means I get the best.”

We then get to his place and it’s quite dark, wood panelling everywhere, middle of bloody nowhere. He goes off and sits in a dark room. A dark room that he would then sit in every day for the remainder of our time there. 

In this room are police scanners and constant police chatter: “we have a code x on the xx highway heading east” etc etc. He just sits there, hunched over his computer listening. 

He tries to be nice, cooks some dinners, tries to relate to me as a kid etc. He even takes us out to a few places at points to visit stuff, and it’s actually genuinely fun at points. But there’s something in me screaming “get out, go home, run away!” Especially when he’s sat in that room. 

I manage to get my mum into a room for a few minutes and say we have to leave. I didn’t know why, but we weren’t safe and we had to get out. She’s upset, obviously.  She says he’s acting a little different than normal but- “no, somethings wrong, we need to go, now” I say. 

She shortens the trip and we head home about a day later. I feel kind of bad, but I also feel an overwhelming sense of relief. 

Within a few days it happens. A call from one of his family members. He’s been arrested. 

He was arrested for trying to sell guns on the black market when he isn’t even allowed to own guns. One of the people he tried to sell to turns out to be an undercover cop. But it gets better... 

He claims that the government is after him, that’s why he was monitoring the police scanners so that he could be ahead of them. What was he going to do when they finally came after him though? 

Remember those wood panelled walls? The police pulled them down and found home made bombs hidden throughout the walls. His plan was to blow up the building if the police ever found him so that he wouldn’t be caught or something. 

We would have been in the building whilst those bombs and guns were in there too. 

I believe he was charged due to having weapons without a permit or something and was locked away. Although I believe he may have, or be close to, finishing serving his time now. 

Story 2 this happened last year

Once again, my mum fell for someone online. She’d been out of the dating scene for years but said she wanted to try again. Now dating online is normal, so I show her a few sites, even teach her how to make a profile. I give her a few pieces of advice, tell her to be careful etc and then state one line “whatever you do, NEVER give money to someone online.”  She agrees and she’s very tech savvy at this point so I figure it’s fine. 

Over the weeks she meets a few people, most are kinda meh until she matches with this one guy who she adores. He’s a hunky Italian guy, older, decent money wise and matches many of her qualities. 

She gets to know him over a few months and seems very smitten with him, but I start to notice a pattern: he keeps cancelling on the meet up dates. I get a weird feeling, but my mum assured me it’s nothing, just work clashes. Fine, I have my own stuff going on I’ll just leave her to do whatever. 

Cut to 5 months later and me and my partner really have a strong bad gut feeling about this guy. There’s just been too many excuses, too many cancellations. I get told they’ve spoken over the phone a lot, and even Skyped, there’s nothing to worry about. But somethings not right. 

Cut to me coming down to finding my mum having a panic attack. She’s freaking the duck out, seriously. I ask what’s wrong, use anti anxiety skills to calm her down, and that’s when she shows me a picture of him bloodied up and I suddenly dread the next sentence because my guy says “that’s fake” and it all spills out. 

He finds and sells gold in Africa. He got jumped and robbed and is now in a hospital in a complete mess. 

Wait, sells gold? What? 

Apparently he’s working on a big shipment to send to us. It’s going to be worth a lot of money, it’s already on its way, but some paperwork needs to be signed. 

The paperwork costs money. 

Being released from hospital costs money. 

Being given a hotel for the night costs money. 

He had his passport robbed and it costs money. 

And a billion other different things have happened. They all costed money. Money this guy didn’t have. Money my mum sent him. Money that would be replaced by this “shipment of gold” one it is freed from the country. 

Shit. 

Shit shit shit shit. 

“How much money have you sent?”

She doesn’t want to explain. “I’m trying to help. What’s happened? How much have you given him?”

“He’s in danger, he needs it, but I don’t have any more to give. I’m in debt. I can’t just leave him.”

.... eventually I discover as a family we are 100k+ in debt from 5 months of payments.

I know what’s going on, but I know she isn’t going to hear it right now so I say this: 

“You can’t send anything right now. He’ll be fine in the hospital for a bit and if he can contact you by phone then it can’t be that bad can it? In case he tries to contact us could you send me a picture of him. Maybe his phone number too? And you said you had a photo of the gold, can I have that?”

She’s a bit confused but does it anyway. She goes to get some sleep after making me promise I won’t tell anyone. 

The next day I build my case. I find everything that proves this isn’t real from proving how the photo of the gold is faked to how he could get multiple pictures to even some proof that African scammers often claim to be Italian. 

I can’t really remember the exact sequence of events after that. I remember confronting my mum and her refusing to believe me yet also understanding that the evidence I had analysed was faked. Then I remember making a plan to lock down all her cards which she agrees to hand to me and I hide, but then less than 10 minutes later comes back to me begging and crying for me to return them “he just needs 500 to get out of the hospital.” “No, you can’t have them back.”  

I call my dad, o have a disabled sibling, and explain that I have put my mum into lockdown for money. She makes me promise I won’t say why, but my dad insists that I’m the one who’s gone crazy and must be overreacting “unless if she’s been an idiot and fallen for one of those hot people in another country who just needs X amounts come over and-“ “yes dad. That’s exactly what’s happened.” “I’m on my way right now.” 

It’s several months later now. My sibling is on benefits due to his disability getting worse and I’m the designated carer. My dad is carefully monitoring us to check nothing bad happens. My mum has been through therapy and her money is now controlled by an outside charity as it’s in complete disarray. I run almost everything in the household, but my partner and I are hoping to move away so we can finally be free from this madness. 

I’m really really tired. "

Does he/she place more monetary value on objects or experiences? Impulse or planned purchases? What's their idea of financial comfort? You can save yourself of trouble if you take the time understand what the other person will/won't work for and why. Most people are pretty good at recognizing ""lazier than I'm comfortable with"", but aren't as good at recognizing ""driven to make sacrifices in the pursuit of ambitions that don't complement the life I want""."
in itself it isn’t annoying. what is annoying is if i tell the person i’m not interested and they won’t take no for an answer or act like a baby about it.
"Being topless. The whole ""male nipples are fine but female nipples are lewd"" thing is completely absurd. Especially in the cases of trans and nonbinary people, when the general public (and law enforcement) do a lot of hand-wringing trying to gender people's nipples. "
"A female Indian friend told me that until she moved to the US, she never encountered the stereotype that women are ""stupid."" She said that while India is definitely a misogynistic country, the idea that women are too dumb for math or science doesn't exist there. I've also heard that in Russia and parts of Eastern and Southern Europe, medicine is traditionally considered a feminine field. 

I think it comes down to cultural differences and stereotypes."
"CHVRCHES, watch their BBC one hits and where they cover songs. I think they even did one at an awards show of Janelle Monae’s Tightrope.

Queer relationships in movies/TV are distracting and unnecessary. But I had to watch Steve Rogers suck face with his first love's niece in Civil War for no good reason. 
"Once every two to three days usually.

My SO still thinks something is wrong with me since I don't poop every day."
"How he views his role as a parent and the division of labor in regards to children. (If you even plan to have kids) 

I wish I had known that I would have to convince him to parent in those early years. I was learning to parent and having to drag my partner into partner status. It was infuriating. 

It’s still not equal (he doesn’t know how to navigate our insurance to get dr appointments for the kids) but it’s better than it used to be. "
"I just got to the happy end of a divorce after some pretty rough seas.  

There were shenanigans involved, but they were just the force that found the faults.  I think the marriage could have survived if we hadn’t had the following problems.

1) our libidos were incompatible.  American Puritanism made it a topic that we never really discussed.  He wound up cheating on me and I completely understand why he needed to.  We should have aired the differences and talked about it before we got married.  We would have either found a work around or not gotten married, but instead let it become a hidden fissure.

2) I am the type to find reasons to do something (anything, travel, take a class, watch a particular movie); he’s the type to find reasons not to do something.  It was fine for a long time, I would just do stuff without him but once the problems started, it became a fundamental issue.  

Those were the problems once I boiled off the anger and hurt and surface issues.  We parted as amicably as two people can and I have to live in a place where I’m grateful for the experience, but more grateful that it’s over; but hopefully that helps future couples reading this.

We’re both much happier now and our son isn’t lost in a house of arguments and resentment.  Good luck in your marriage!"
"This is one of my favorites. I’m an attorney and there’s a number of angry, condescending men I deal with on a regular basis. Whenever they start getting loud or otherwise acting unprofessionally, I say, “you sound upset. Why don’t we end this conversation and you can call me back when you’ve calmed down a little.”

Works like a charm. "
"This one kills me. 

The logic is that if I have sex 10 times with 10 different men, my vagina will be extremely loose and unpleasing.

But if I have sex 100 times with only 1 man, then apparently that doesn't do anything to my vagina?

It makes literally no sense. Plus, by that same logic, all mothers would have vaginas permanently stretched as wide as a damn cantaloupe after giving birth.  "
"I'm 36. That not everything can be achieved by anyone with enough work and therefore that not all dreams will come true, and not all people will get a good, easy or happy life even if they try very hard and ""deserve"" it."
"23, sometimes life fucks you up out of nowhere and there's nothing you can do but learn to live with it."
"Guy saying ""hey sorry to bother you I just thought I'd say you have really pretty eyes. See you round""

vs.

Guy following you down the street staring at your ass and ignoring you repeatedly rejecting his advances"
"There seems to be this idea that it's wrong to want to please men with nothing in it for you. As in, it's wrong to dress/wear makeup solely to attract men, it's wrong to do things for him with no agenda, it's wrong to sexually please a guy without expecting him to 'return the favour'.

Every time I/others have implied anything along these lines, we've been beaten down by the ""dress for YOURSELF!"" brigade.

"
I’ve always been a fan of Metric/Emily Haines! 
"Describing women using their “rating” on the 1-10 attractiveness scale. For example, “she’s a solid nine.” Bonus points if they’re acting like this degrading bullshit is a compliment. "
"He is from Pakistan and his parents wanted him to marry a Pakistani Muslim. Instead he asked me, a white atheist who thinks religion is bullshit, to marry him and got me pregnant out of wedlock. That was a fun few months. Its all g now though, they love me."
"My fiance and I started dating when we were 15, we've been together for 7+ years now.

The main thing I have to say is, don't expect your high school relationship to stay the same once you're an adult.  It will be completely different. There are a whole slew of things you have to deal with in an adult relationship that just aren't issues as teens.  Work and/or school, managing time between friends, family, and your SO (because now you don't see them everyday) and still finding time to be alone when you need to.  Living together - finances, household chores, pets/children can be difficult to navigate.

Enjoy your high school relationships, learn from them, but don't take them too seriously (even if you are in a committed long-term one). The serious part starts after school. "
I heard some people keep buying lipsticks in the almost identitical color and shade. NOT ME!! ha ha (hides the lipstick shelf)
My husband is a vegetarian and I grew up on a farm where we slaughtered our own livestock for meat. I was afraid that would be a problem but he's been really cool about what I do and what I consume. He states that we are much more humane than a large farm that mass breeds and slaughters. 
"getting loud during debates or arguments. when a man does it, he's confident, bold, impassioned. when a woman does it, she's shrill, impatient, and emotional."
"We found ourselves taking a phone call from the director of the city's mental health hospital the morning of my birthday one year, being asked to confirm that we would be assuming responsibility for my husband's 20 year old brother who was being released that afternoon from an involuntary week long stay.

It was a crash course in figuring out what ""family"" meant, especially for my poor husband who found himself needing to figure out how to balance his sense of obligation to his brother and what it meant to be a partner to his new wife."
"Hmmmm. On a nice rainy night I'd love to walk into my apartment with the lights low. My SO has all of my favorite foods laid out in front of the TV that's already geared up to play that movie we'd spoken about a billion times but never got around to watching. He's sitting there in his comfiest clothes, wrapped up in a blanket with the dog, the biggest smile on his face.

That's all I want lol. Being surprised with take out and a movie on a rainy night with my SO and dog. I'm easy to please 😂"
"Filling in, without discussion, where the other person has weak spots.  Remembering, organizing, whatever you do better than someone you care about, do, so the unit of you-and-them functions smoother."

"On a typical day 2-3 times before I leave for work, then 1-2 times throughout the day after that

"Dated one guy and it sucked, but overall-- don't take it too seriously, it's normal to not find love when you're that young. Just have fun. If it's not fun then don't stick around. Also, a relationship is not going to suddenly make your life better. Don't rely on it for your happiness.

ETA: Don't get with someone just because you're lonely and all your friends have dated many people. Nothing wrong with not meeting anyone you like in high school, and getting with someone you don't actually like is the worst."
"Every night I try to do 30 minutes of mindful cleaning and organizing. Going through mail, cleaning counters, changing sheets etc. This is an effort to make sure I have no zero days.

The rest of my time can be broken down into three categories:

Obligation nights: these nights I have standing plans. Whether it’s dinner, drinks, or a show, these nights are for networking, friends, or family. After going out I’ll do a bit of cleaning and go straight to bed. 

Productive nights: on nights where I get to go straight home from work after a low stress day, I try to write for a few hours and get some constructive reading done. Right now I’m about halfway through *several short sentences about writing*. I highly recommend. 

Unwinding nights: after a stressful day at work I come home, pour a generous glass of wine, and watch reality tv. I’ve gotta turn my brain off, and apparently that’s the best way. "
"I'm pretty traditional in my attitudes towards sex, in that I don't believe in having it outside of a long-term, committed monogamous partnership. It seems like Reddit has this attitude of ""sex on the third date *at the latest* or GTFO"" and I just can't relate to that. Ofc if someone is happy having sex outside of those bounds that's cool too, but it makes dating kind of hard when most guys seem to want sex ASAP and kind of drop off the radar when you make it clear that you don't feel comfortable with that without commitment first. And I know there is the concern of sexual compatibility and blahblahblah, but this is just *my* view on the matter."
"I was once congratulated by a client for being a female structural engineer. While I honestly think it came from a good place (he mentioned how he was going to go home and tell his daughters how cool it was that he met a woman engineer today), I was still kind of taken aback that he made a big deal of it. It kind of just made me realize how far we still have to go in the industry before being a woman is normalized. -sigh- "

"As an extremely shy person with social anxiety, I'm sometimes thankful that I'm a woman instead of a man. 

It's a struggle no matter what gender you are, but I think that society favors shy women more than shy men. Plus the social pressure for men to be the one to ""make the first move"" romantically is hard to overcome. I'm trying to become the type of person who's able to do that, but I haven't built up the guts yet."
"We loved each other intensely, still do actually, but the relationship just didn’t and couldn’t work. We both acknowledge that after about 18 months of trying.

Love does not automatically equal compatibility, and it’s a tough lesson to learn and walk away from."
Feisty/sassy it’s always when you correct a man about something and he says it because he feels insecure that you’ve just corrected him and deflects it by calling you feisty or sassy as a way to make you be quiet or argue that you aren’t being “feisty” you’re simply having a discussion and corrected a point. Men are never called feisty or sassy you’ll notice.

"I bet you juuust barely heard the noise of the truck, but not enough to consciously be aware of it. Good call listening to your gut!"
"Mine’s silly so....

My husband sometimes acts like he’s 13. He is a smart person who in difficult or risky situations makes responsible decisions. But sometimes, in places where he is comfortable, acts like a 13 year old.

Some examples:

He microwaved a CD because he heard it made “cool sparks”

He lit some paper on fire in the sink (non flammable and contained) because it “burned interesting.”

He added a change on my phone so every time I typed his name it changed to “my beloved King” or something like that.

He set up some program on my computer so he could remotely send audio files to play seemingly randomly throughout the day. So it would sound like he was talking to me "
That is super gross.

"It seems like whenever a sexual topic comes up, a lot of responses here tend to come off as pretty rude and judgmental. Like it's not enough to say they're not into something, but kind of lean toward stuff like ""I can't believe someone could be into that"" or saying that other people are disgusting for liking things they don't enjoy even if the question doesn't really apply to them.

"I deleted everything except reddit and my mind is at peace already. I felt like a character who could hear everyone's inane/insane thoughts at once; the cost being that I was ignoring my own.

It made my depression and anxiety a million times worse and I'll never get back the time I've wasted mindlessly scrolling through feeds, making myself miserable. 

I never truly learned anything, and if I did, the time I told myself I'd spend using it to better myself was spent...you guessed it, scrolling through more feeds.

My attention span went to the gutter.

And despite interacting with so many different people across many platforms everyday, despite the likes, RTs, responses, reblogs and loves, I'd never felt more lonely, irrelevant, small and forgotten. 

Oh and the echochambers and tendency of groupthink bullying and harassment are fucking disguisting.

There are so many more things I could say about social media, but at the crux of it, the negatives far, far outweigh the positives. Especially when it comes to our health (both body and mind).

"Wow, the answers are so starkly different between the moms and non-moms. Crazy. 


I'm like all these other non-moms, I come home and sit my fat ass on the couch and watch TV and browse reddit, eventually make dinner, then back to Netflix or internet. Sometimes I will do one of my hobbies for an hour or so. I get off work fairly early so I'll sometimes get some errands in as well. But mostly I do whatever I want. I hang out with my husband, and I cook pretty much every night."
I want a wedding. Most of reddit seems to want a small one but I want to save up and go all out and have a traditional Mexican wedding.

"Gender roles in general.

"I did pretty well last semester.

I'm in law school so it's highly, highly competitive. It's all a curve so it all depends how well you do compared to the rest of the classmates vs. just knowing the material. (Everyone in law school knows all the basic material anyway)

I don't want to talk about my grades because I know a lot of people didn't do well or as well as they'd hoped. Most people just want to be median but I made it way above median (like top ~20%.) I'm pretty happy about it but I don't want to brag in front of people who didn't do as well.

"Ugh, yes! To add on, I hate it when some guys comment about whether or not they want to fuck the woman in question, when it's completely irrelevant to the topic at hand. When they make these comments, they all assume that the woman would actually want to fuck them. 

For example, saying something like, ""I'd fuck her"" on a totally non-sexual photo of an attractive woman working the counter at a fast food restaurant. They assume that fucking her is even an option for them. Like how do you know she'd want to fuck you??"

"As they say: **""money is funny, honey.""**

Money, and financial disconnects, are cited- always. for young/old, religious/secular, kids/childfree, rebel/square- as the top 1-3 reasons for divorce. And not just having it, or not, all the stuff that comes with that 

* See, money is overlooked often because it's not ""sexy"" like kids' names or honeymoon destinations. And it's easy to overlook in early dating, since dating thwarts your spending. It's also easy to overstate or overlook your spending, since you can't really ""verify"" it with someone you're dating, like ""let me see your bank statements"" type of thing (at least in early dating). But you *CAN* verify other facets of them - family relationships, hobbies, goals, interests - these are all much more outwardly visible when you're dating. 

* Financial values, habits, and patterns are also learned really early on. If your folks were house poor, or wealthy, or working class, or frivolous, or penny-pinchers, that affects your baseline of ""normal spending."" Yes, people can change, but, IME, they rarely do on a *fundamental level* regarding money. The hedonistic treadmill is very real, yes, but it's interesting how millionaires retain habits from their upbringing, and people have brand loyalties across SES. So, you think this is just something that affects less-than-wealthy people?? NAH. My husband makes a lot (IMO) of money, and STILL has habits and hangups from his upbringing - to the point where I won't go with him to the food store, for various reasons.

* Money also affects every facet of your life. To quote that one rapper: ""money isn't everything, but not having it is."" So if you're living together and trying to save money, and the electric bill comes, it's so so easy to say ""Well, you always leave the light on!"" or ""relax, this craft beer is my ONE treat!"" You cannot un-tie yourself from money's far reach. Unlike tidiness or pets or other compatibility things, money ~~is~~ can be the cause, symptom, and consequence of many, many problems. 

* I am an accountant. I spend all day looking at the spending of businesses, people, couples. I work directly under financial planners and can tell you this: MANY of our clients come to us for marital counseling just as much as financial expertise. Not only are some people totally unhinged about their spending and willing to acknowledge it -""I don't spend *THAT* much!"" Welllll... yes, you do, and here it is on paper. But also, financial goals take time to showcase - so if your partner leaves socks on the floor, that can be corrected and shown progress in, say, a week and it feels good to see your partner do x,y,z chore. But money?? nah, that shit takes time to see! Maybe YEARS to truly see any tangible improvement

* I am a bit obsessed with money, consumer behavior, debt, student loans, realities that millennials are facing, healthcare, and many other related things. In that way, I am very biased when answering questions like this, I will admit. But just because I'm obsessive does NOT mean that I'm wrong: MONEY IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL! 

* Oh, so It doesn't end JUST at money. It's priorities, drinking habits, donations to charity, entertainment, family outings, vacation, dream jobs, retirement, pets, where you go, how you travel, what you wear, the job you have, the company you keep, and so so so many other things

* I could write about a thousand questions regarding money. There are books and articles written about this very thing. I will elaborate if there is interest, but for starters, I'd go: ""What are your views on prenups? What is your educational attainment/ debt, and do you plan to get professional certifications/ more degrees? Whose job will take precedent, and would you be willing to re-locate to a new area/ town/ state/ country? How much do you think is reasonable to be in debt? What is your/our plan if you can't work? How much should birthday gifts cost? Do you have family help/ savings/ a safety net? How much does work matter in your life vs. income? Would you take in my brother/ friend/ ex-roommate if they had a crisis, and if so, for how long? What are your thoughts on hiring a maid? How much do you eat out, and how much should the grocery bill be? What age do you want to retire??"" 

....so, yes, I am pretty cynical about couples who don't have similar financial priorities, and the younger you meet, the more aligned yous should be. I've seen financial disconnects unfold in my career, my social circle, my family - it's very very difficult to overcome, and I'd strongly advise not marrying someone unless you're pretty damn similar

**TL;DR - MONEY** Look up the stats on reasons for divorce, watch how your partner spends not just how they claim to spend money, have very very similar views on finances before you even consider marrying someone."
Girl. I’m right there with you. 
Garbage. I love Shirley Manson.
"It’s amazing.
If anything, it taught me to trust my gut feeling. 
My brother is, thank you! I’m so glad he figured it out quickly as well. As far as I understood it, once the drugs started working; he got my father and they all went home straight away. 

I don’t talk to my father anymore because as horrible as this experience was, it was quite a common occurrence that he brought us into similar, dangerous situations."
"So I'm not particularly a fan of Amy Schumer, but I CAN.NOT. STAAAAND the people who complain about her. ""She's so unfunny with her gross vagina jokes. No one wants to hear about your stinky, smelly vagina."" But those are usually the same people who find comedians like Louis CK *hysterical* as he jokes about a cup of sweat that just hangs around his asshole.

**Edit** gendered slur. Sorry. Don't kill me, mods."
"So I'm a bisexual girl, and have pretty much the exact same type of friendship with my guy friends as I do my girl friends. I don't see the problem. 

I'm not going to sleep with any of them, it would be so weird. "
"I plug all my meetings and events into my phone calendar. I review it at the start of my day and at the end of my day. Set timers and reminders so I don’t forget. Sticky notes as backup.

I make lists for everything. Groceries. Chores. Errands. Ideas. Outfits. Meals. Activities. I’m obsessively organized. Making lists actually gives me a sense of peace. Might be why I don’t struggle with anxiety. Lists = organization = small sense of control and order.

I put my bills on auto pay. I use Mint to supervise my finances. I live minimally so there’s very little clutter to my home. Very little to tidy up. No car because I live in the city. No pets either. And the biggest factor: no kids. "
I don’t. I honestly enjoy the fantasy. It’s fun and it’s mostly harmless. If I’m imagining a future and those possibilities with someone it’s an indicator to me that I really like them and want something serious with them 
"Women taking a man to a ""chick flick"", and even calling it a ""chick flick"" to begin with. It starts young.

If a woman is the lead, the boys will go off and do something else while the  girls watch ""their movie."""

"Ugh my husband does this too. He’ll also leave the smallest amount of a snack in the box, so like three crackers, and so I’ll get my hopes up. Then I open the box and there’s literally less than a bite left.

I would love to come home to flowers for no reason. I’ve never gotten flowers for no reason. Now that I’m married I don’t even get flowers when there is a reason. One time I got socks for Christmas. 
"I’ve got two: 

When I was working with a friend in a small business, someone came to us with an offer through a company (kinda like square) for being able to take credit cards as payments.  He gave her an unbelievable low percentage.  Which meant the percentage of each payment someone made to us, would go to that company.  Which is okay, the company has to make money too.  

So asked me what I thought, to which I told her that I didn’t know, it almost sounds too hound to be true.  So she asked him to call his boss to make sure it was okay.  

A week later we’re all set up with the little reader and everything, and she notices something fishy.  The company has taken more of her money than they should, in the way of the percentage was more like 50 or higher for each payment.  We were a small business so we didn’t make a lot in a week anyways.  

She calls the company to cancel, and they tell her she has to pay $500 to do so!  She tries explaining to man who came to us told us that percentage called his boss to say it was okay, and found out he never called him!  

Turned out the whole company was a scam.  She had to close that bank account because of them. And we went back to square. 

I’ll put my other one in a reply to myself. "
"Well, comparing having lived on both sides, these come to mind:

1) all things sex

2) assertiveness of self, about self, boundaries of, and for self in general

3) aggressiveness when it comes to personal boundaries that are continuously violated

4) ambition for career, hobbies, etc.

5) competitiveness

6) leadership and willingness to step up to it, and even compete for it

Interestingly, many if not most the things that allowed me to socially climb before transition are now frowned upon, and that's in the face of the fact I have a greatly reduced social status in this world. The game is rigged, don't be surprised if I go forth and hack the fucking shit out of it."

It's crazy of they were together for that long without that expectation up until then.
"My then-BF and his roommate lived a couple blocks from the bars, so we’d walk to dinner/drinks if the weather was nice. One night we’re walking back and as we approach an intersection I notice a guy approaching from the other street that just didn’t look right. Wasn’t dressed to go out, looked like he was in a hurry, etc. So I sped up so that I’d pass the intersection before he got there. He robbed the roommate at gunpoint and apparently had just been going down the street, mugging anyone he could. By the time we got to their house five minutes later there was already a helicopter and multiple cops in the area looking for him.

And yes, I felt bad about not warning the two guys about why I was hurrying up, but I felt like I didn’t have a tangible reason for being uneasy."
"Men can be loud, authoritative and direct and it's considered attractive and good leadership. We do it and we're bossy and high maintenance. Not fair.

I actually throw up in my mouth whenever I'm at kid's events (birthdays or whatever) and the men (if any show up) sit around and do NOTHING. Can you get off your rump and gather the kiddos for present time? Or organize who gets to go in the bumper cars next? Can you not go down the water slide with them? Thanks!"
"I have one friend that just can talk for days. A three second story gets turned into an hour long drama every time. It gets old, but honestly she’s pretty funny if you have the patience and she has a really good heart. If I need to talk she can be a really good listener and genuinely care about what I am saying. All in all she gets pretty annoying but I love her to death. Also she laughs at all my jokes ahaha"
"People who care about their partner's sexual history and either they have engaged in casual sex before or not. Like... People change their minds about stuff, and also, having casual sex does not mean someone can't see sex as a display of affection too. I simply don't get it.

"I really worried about whether he actually liked me for me. Now we've been together 10 years and married for 5 and I guess if he didn't, we wouldn't be together but it isn't a worry."
😨 just that description made me uncomfortable.
Wow reading this makes me realize I was a teenage lady neckbeard.

"I worked traditional jobs until now. It got better with each job. First job out of college was super strict - 30 minute lunch break that was watched by everyone else, getting text messages and calls if I hadn't yet arrived by 7:35 (had to be there for 7:30), never leaving even a minute early, etc. Time off was accrued and very little. Each job got a little more relaxed.

At my previous job, the young woman I was working under came to me one day and said she had been planning to break away and start her own company doing what we were doing. She had started that aspect of the company all on her own, but didn't receive the benefits of actually owning the company. She asked me to come with her. So I took a leap of faith and did. I now make $10k more than I was, and the sky is the limit for growth since I was literally employee #1.. when we had no idea how things would pan out. 

My boss is young, only 30. She is a huge believer in being judged by the work you produce - not the hours you sit in a chair. She moved out of state, so it is just me and an assistant in this office. I go in whenever I wake up naturally - no alarms. I leave when my work for the day has winded down - usually ~3pm. I work from home ~1 day per week. We have about 5 months of ""busy season"" where I'm working 40-50 hours, but then 7 months of more laid back work. 

I don't have set ""PTO"". I just take off when I need/want. If it is an appt or just an odd day off, I don't even tell my boss - as she wouldn't care or feel the need to know. If it is an actual trip, I put it on the calendar. I only do this 1-2x per year. In fact, I doubt I even use 2 weeks worth of vacation time. But with the coming and going as I please, it evens out.

There is a LOT to be said about this type of work setup. It is just so relaxing not stressing about paperwork, tracking hours, doctors notes, etc. And because she is so laid back and awesome as a boss, I will answer any important call/email at any time of night or on the weekend. I never have any issue dropping what I'm doing to help her out because I know that if it's slow on a random Tuesday, I can head home after lunch and have a beer on my patio."

"I'm gonna be self-centered on this, but I love the little moments my husband and I have in groups where we really include each other in the conversation. Like, sometimes people assume they know how their SO thinks and will just 'talk for them' or pay more attention to others in a group setting. But with my SO and I, we ask each other for input just as if they were (and they are) part of the group, and not a discounted extension of ourselves."
"Talk about sex. When I had my girl friends over, and we talked about sex, no one thought anything about it if my SO joined the conversation. Okay cool, we're all in one small apartment, and we're sorta hanging out everyone, of course he can join in on the convo. When my SO had his boy friends over I thought I could do the same, right? 


Nah. 

Later on, when they had left, he told me that I need to chill a bit cause all of his friends thought I wanted to have a massive gangbang with them, just cause I joined in on the convo we were all having."
"He's an introvert and I'm an extrovert, and it used to really worry me (what if I overload him? What if he gets sick of me?) I also had an introvert ex who would completely shut down at events, and I dreaded bringing him places because of it (my friends would ask if he was ""angry"" at them)

But the good news is that he's extremely charismatic, even moreso than me. Everyone loves him. I'm also great at reading social cues, so we've worked out a system where I can tell he's ready to go and we leave. And, often by the time we leave, the best part of the event is over with anyway... and we still get a few hours just to ourselves every night!"

"Yeah I've never had a man *try* to give me an orgasm. I try to offer near-daily blowjobs if I'm in a serious relationship, but I've never had a boyfriend just *offer* to get me off, and it's always been assumed that sex means an orgasm for them but not me. "

"I was born in 1990 but I think I did most of my ""growing up"" in the 2000s. Music takes me back the most! I loved the soaring female vocals of the early 2000s like Michelle Branch and Vanessa Carlton, the pop-punk of Simple Plan and Good Charlotte, and the emo stuff like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance. 

Also just how much counterculture was hitting the mainstream--those were the glory days of Hot Topic fashion, anime was on cable TV, and the advent of digital music downloads made obscure music available to everybody. All that stuff makes me super nostalgic."
Unapologetic about saying *no*.
"The thing is... Everyone always spouts ""relationships are hard work."" Which they are *sometimes*. But the majority of the time, a relationship should be *easy*. It should be very easy to hang out with the person and relax with the person and talk to the person. If you are constantly fighting and nagging and stressing and cold-shouldering, it is not a healthy relationship.

A good relationship will have hard *times*, where it might be difficult to get through together, but most of a relationship should *not* be work. So if my relationship starts to feel like extra work and stress, rather than an *escape* from my stress, then it's time to start re-evaluating things."
Or the girls who talk about how they just get along better with guys as if having strong female friendships makes them less than.  They are just so *different* that they can't be bothered with silly female things.  Ugh.
"I think the parties that are a thing now, like gender reveals- I don’t hate on people that have them but I’m not gonna have one for my kids if I have them. I personally hate showers of any variety, baby or wedding. I always feel awkward at them, and it’s just a pain in the arse. I went to a baby shower where the sister blew like $3000 for decorations. There wasn’t actual food either, it had a Candy Bar. Nothing but candy in glass containers an ass-ton of candies in each. There were a shit ton of people there, but with all these women who were members of the country club we were at, no one ate any. It was kind of sad the waste alone. "

"A lot of people have mentioned talking about if you'll have kids and how you'll raise them.  Another important conversation along those lines is what if you want kids and can't have them?  How far are you willing to go to have a kid?  Will you seek medical help first or look into adoption?  How far down the medical path are you willing to go?  IUI?  IVF?  Sperm/egg donor?  Surrogate?  Are you willing to adopt an older child?  One with special needs?  One of a different race?  How much money are you willing to spend to have a child.  Would you prioritize it over other spending?  Would you take out loans to do it?  Ask family to help?  Is there a point at which you just give up and accept that you'll never have children?

We never thought to have that conversation.  Luckily it turned out we agreed on how to move forward, but if we didn't it could have made a very stressful time in our lives a lot worse."
"The amount of bullshit that the average woman puts up with from her man is astounding to me. That fucker can remember his mom's birthday and that you're out of milk. He just thinks that's your job now. If you left him, you can bet that in most cases he would become a fully functional human being.

General heteronormativity is really confusing to me. I feel like an alien at a baby shower or bachelorette party. I actually thanked my coworker for forgetting to invite me to his. "
"I guess people are less likely to consider me a threat? So when I ask for help people respond without any suspicion. Like when I got lost in an English town and had to get back to my hotel. My phone was out of battery and I was out of cash. I asked a man cleaning his garden for directions and explained that I was lost, and he told me to wait a bit and then brought his daughter out to drive me to the hotel. I could have been a bad person for all they knew,  but I imagine me being a woman and Asian probably helped in this situation."
"Legal? Maybe none. Information though? Why did he think he needed to hide the from me? Doesn't he trust me? Did he think I'm not mature enough to handle the concept of wealth? What else is he hiding? If he's okay hiding this aspect of himself--a *good* aspect--what darker things could be be okay with keeping from me? 

It's the principle of it all. Waiting until you're legally bound to someone is... not great. Even if it's a ""good"" thing. I see under promising and over delivering, but you have to be able to trust your partner to involve you in your shared life. Let you be an adult and make fully informed choices. Do it before the wedding, man."
"25, Sometimes you can be whole-heartedly in love with someone who is just not right for you and the only thing you can do is break your own heart and theirs so both of you have room to grow into the best versions of yourselves. "

"Straight people have so much baggage on how to behave: do this or no man will like you, you have to pay for the girl or she'll think you're rude, if you're a woman don't be too masculine, if you're a man don't be too feminine.

"The women who say they don’t get along with other women because they just don’t understand them, other women are jealous of them, etc. I hate to admit this, but I was like that in high school and my intention was always to make myself more attractive to men, even if I didn’t actually want any of them.  When I finally figured out how to have female friends after high school, everything changed and I no longer felt so lonely.  Having a best girl friend opened up a world for me I never knew existed (more in terms of the kinds of open communication I got, my straight guy best friend for most of my life never would have had those conversations with me).  Now I have a tribe of women who I couldn’t imagine my life without. "

"When I was in high school, my mom and I were on our way home when we saw this little dog, a dachshund/terrier mix, pacing along the side of the highway. Being huge animal people, we immediately pulled over and I got out to see him. He was so excited to see someone and I knew then he was going to my dog. He was skinny, dirty and collarless, but I reluctantly walked from door to door in the area asking if he belonged to anyone. Thankfully no one claimed him. I took him home and he’s been my little buddy ever since. I literally could not ask for a better dog. He is always by my side. I get emotional thinking about how lucky I am."

I might have to do that for him this week minus the wine since he doesn't drink, but the picnic anyway.  We take out wood cutting board and add 2 or 3 types of cheeses (usually something soft like brie, hard like a good cheddar and whatever else looks good to us that day) some salami prosciutto or other cured pork product. An apple or pear, some sauteed mushrooms and onions, a cucumber, and usually some smoked oysters or anchovies.  Add in some crackers and good crusty bread and it's pretty much heaven.  We eat is picnic style on the floor usually while watching a movie and cuddling.  "

"Graduated with his radio-television-film degree, promptly declared he didn't want to go into radio-television-film, he wanted to move 1000 miles away to a place we had never seen before and open a retail shop. I thought he was joking until the day we packed up all the worldly belongings we had that would fit in an 8' x 12' uhaul and drove 15 hours to Colorado. I'd never even seen Colorado, never been here. He'd never started a business. I thought he was crazy. Four years later he owns 3 successful retail businesses. Now he says he wants to make a video game &amp; now I believe him when he says he's going to do it. "
"As a mini step toward knowing what to prioritize, I make 3 lists every day:

1) what must get done today? As in I'm royally fucked if I don't get these things done. (Think water bill is due tomorrow or boss wants the presentation to be given at 8:00am tomorrow so it must be done or I don't have any clean underwear left so time to do the laundry type things).

2) what *should* I do today? As in the things to do today so that tomorrow's list #1 is very short. (Think water bill is due in 3 days or presentation that boss wants will be in 4 days or laundry is pretty full type things).

3) what do I *want* to get done today? This can be both things I would like to do that I can use as rewards for completing the other two lists and things that are long-term goals. (Like going disc golfing or I've been meaning to read this book or I told myself I was allowed to go see *Black Panther* if I finished 6 things on my list type things).

I have to finish list #1 before doing the next one, and I'm not allowed to do list #3 unless I completed all of #1 and at least a certain amount of #2. Over time, I was able to add a 4th list that is about ongoing things (like diet or self improvement, stuff like that), but it took a long time of the 3 list system to figure out how to time manage so that list #1 wasn't overwhelming all the time."
"He had a Grand Mal seizure suddenly and nearly died with no prior warning.  I am glad I was driving at the time.  Afterwards, the stress got to both of us as we freaked out about both the seizure(which could happen again, no idea why it happened the first time) and the money we have spent looking into it for no answers.

"&gt; mothers as adults who have their own lives is judged pretty harshly

I have a strong memory of my parents making fun of our (adult) next door neighbor growing up because she mentioned wanting to ""have some wine and me time."" She had one suuuuuper chill kid, so I guess my parents were jealous? Looking back it's like, wtf y'all, let her live her life."
"Just the overwhelming obsession with sex in every aspect of people's lives. There are plenty of movies whose entire plot is ""this guy wants to have sex with this girl, let's watch two hours of him doing stupid, desperate shit in an attempt to succeed in obtaining sex.""

Even commercials advertising extremely un-sexy things like hamburgers turn to sex to sell their product. Like, when I think of a hamburger, the *last* thing I want to think of is sex.

Reading stories on the Relationships subreddit just makes me shake my head in confusion, because every single post seems to be about sex in some form or fashion. ""I'm not getting enough sex."" ""I'm not getting the right kind of sex."" ""How do I get more sex?"" ""How do I get better sex?"" ""How do I convince this total stranger to have sex with me?"" ""I'm insecure because of X and it's affecting my sex."" 

I really can't grasp how people's entire existences seem to revolve around that one act. 

Can you imagine if it was something else? Like golfing? If you really could not give two shits about golf, but every movie had to have an obligatory golfing scene, and entire TV shows were talking about all the golfing people were doing with each other, and every commercial for a car or a milkshake was some blatant golfing innuendo, and clothing was specifically designed for people who wanted to go golfing all the time, and half the questions on your favorite AskWhatever subreddits were asking about golf swings and club sizes and whether women like golfers who are great putters versus good long drivers...

"Our breakup was kind of funny, actually. We were out on our date night, in the checkout line at Barnes and Noble. I suggested we think of places we wanted to go on our eventual road trip and somehow it turned into a discussion about how we didn't want the same things out of life. It was very calm and just kind of like ""Oh. We aren't going to work, are we?"" 

So we broke up, him being more of a homebody and me wanting to travel and move someday. It took me a long time to get over him, but looking back it was 100% the right decision because of the different paths we want to follow. We are still friends and he has a lovely girlfriend (who, oddly enough, is in the same profession as me).

I'm still single but I'm happy. I don't think we would have been happy if we were still together."

"The other is about a stray cat.  

So as my animal loving self, I tend to feed the strays that roam up and down our road.  But there was one that particularly caught my eye.  At the time we had another cat who was an outdoor cat who we were transitioning into an indoor cat.  We would feed her in the garage, and she would come inside and hang out.  But this other skinny little thing started appearing.  

He would come into the garage and eat the other cat’s food so I started leaving him a bowl too.  I would sit out there very still, so I could get a look at him.  He turned out to have six toes!  I knew this poor cat was going to be my cat at the end of this.  He didn’t have a collar or anything, and they poor thing was so hungry.

One fateful day coming home from work, I saw him waiting for food outside the front door, he hadn’t been here for about a week and a half so the poor thing was starving.  I rushed inside and got some wet food and a fork.  I gave it to him, and he was still kinda skittish.  I reach out the fork to him and he ate it off of the fork.  Then by the act of some miracle, he let me pet him!  As I kept petting him he came over and sat in my lap!  I sat there for at least thirty minutes.  

I gradually started bringing him inside, first for five minutes at a time, stretching it until he would sleep all night in my room.  He was the best cat, but the poor thing was living in the sewers before brought him in, so he stank.  

He would let us hold him, rub his face against ours, sleep in our beds.  We affectionately gave him the name ‘Six-Toes’. After a while his stink was going away, and he was becoming softer.  

But after about six months of having him, he quit eating.  We took him to the vet and they said he was quite old, probably 7 or more.  They gave him fluids for hydration and an appetite booster.  That boy came home and ate!  We thought everything was going to be alright.

About a week later he was back at eating nothing at all, they did another round of booster and hydration.  The booster didn’t last as long this time.  In the middle of the week, we could tell he wasn’t doing so well.  And by Friday he was having trouble breathing and even staying stood up.  He went under my bed and stayed there.  I was going to my dad’s house that weekend but I didn’t want to.  I knew this was his time.  But I reluctantly went.  

I got a call the next morning that Six-toes had died.  My mother had to take him to vet because wasn’t doing well.  She wrapped him in a blanket and sat with him all morning listening to the birds on the front porch.  And he used all his energy to purr.  

By the time they got to the vet he was barley making a noise anymore, they put him to sleep so he wouldn’t suffer anymore.  They took him home in that blanket and a box from the vet, and buried him in the back yard.  

I knew I had to take that cat in, he gave us all he love he had left in his life.  He knew we were his family so he stayed.  And he somewhat live on through the kitten I have now.  He’s also a polydactyl cat, named Mr Hemingway.  He made me fall in love with all polydactyls, and now that’s the only type of cat I want to adopt.  I’ve got my kitten with me now, laying in bed next to me and purring. "

"All single-stall / one-room bathrooms. It’s hilarious to me when gas stations or coffee shops have two single-stall bathrooms, one labelled male and one female, and there are like two women waiting but the men’s is wide open and empty. (It’s also fascinating how the social conditioning in that case is powerful enough to keep at least some women waiting; I’d just go for the men’s and I know a lot of women would too, but some definitely wait for the women’s.)

I realize some of this may have to do with bylaws and such, but... there’s no reason for them to segregate single-stall bathrooms. "
"While you may see a correlation between gender equality vs people in STEM, this does not mean that there is a causal relationship. Countries were gender equality is considered high are mostly Western countries. There can be other differences between Western countries and their cultural views on jobs/STEM and the rest of the world. 

For example, in parts of Latin America, there are many, many female professors in universities compared to European countries. However, there is a difference in cultural attitude towards these positions in these parts of the world. In Latin America, being a professor is not seen as very prestigious, but being a successful businessman is. So then women may have less barriers to become professors, but may have much more trouble in business as men are more likely to dominate those areas. "

"I had an epiphany right before I started dating my SO. The full story of that is in a recent comment elsewhere, but this is the nutshell. 

My whole adult life I’d had a problem of chasing people who weren’t interested. I mean, I did have long-term relationships, but between them I’d get really hung up on guys who were not interested. I always tended toward unrequited love. 

The epiphany came one night when I was telling a friend I was going to let this guy down gently. He seemed cute and sweet and all, but I didn’t feel any chemistry. My friend said “I dunno, there’s something about this one, you should give him a chance.”

I joked back, “nah, I don’t trust a guy who actually likes me.”

As soon as it came out of my mouth I had this weird moment where I realized — I wasn’t actually joking. My self-esteem was fragile enough that I was skeptical of guys who liked me and looking for reasons not to even check it out to see what was there. 

That night, I had a long, hard think. And I saw so clearly that my pattern wasn’t working for me. I was doing the same thing over and over and getting the same results; I needed to change the pattern. 

So I took a chance with the cute and sweet guy. Turned out, he was actually the love of my life. "

"This was almost 15 years ago, so some details are fuzzy, but this is my story.

In my senior year of high school, we got a new Spanish teacher.

At the time, I was involved in stage crew, and so I'd be in the auditorium, fairly late after school, working on sets or techie things with a few of my friends on a pretty regular basis. I'm a 5'8"" woman and this group of friends was mostly tallish nerdy guys (I know what you're thinking -- ""Nerds in stage crew?!"").

One day after school, my friends and I were planning to go and work on the set, as usual. The guys decided they wanted to get a snack at an after-school hangout nearby, but I wanted to get working on the project, so I decided to head right to the auditorium, and they'd come by in a while.

When I got there, the space was empty (typical) and mostly dark (also typical), except for the Spanish teacher, who was setting up a projector for some assembly the next day (not typical). He said something to me to the effect of coming closer, helping him with the cables or setup.

Every internal alarm bell went off in my head. I still couldn't tell you exactly why, but I made an excuse and met up with my friends. I remember clearly thinking, *I don't feel safe alone with him, I want my guys near me.*

Not too long after that day, the Spanish teacher was taken out of the school in handcuffs. He was charged with, and convicted of, repeatedly molesting a little girl who he had been babysitting, over a course of years.

I don't know if he had creepy intentions towards me that day in the auditorium, but I know that every bit of gut instinct I had was saying to steer clear, and to this day I'm so glad that I did."
This. My husband and I lean closer to not wanting kids these days because we can see major points we disagree on. I grew up with parents who were always undermining each other and trying to parent in two opposite ways and it was complete hell.
"I feel like it's 'common' around people who also do the same for you, but it becomes 'labour' when you become that person for people who don't reciprocate or appreciate it. Especially things like repressing your own feelings or reactions for other people's benefit - the respectful thing to do sometimes, but a problem when it happens all the time."
This question is actually a great example! Google is your friend.
"Pretty much nothing. Today I laid on the couch for a half hour and am now doing my taxes...

Thank god for leftovers, because meal prep was not happening today."
"Don't put a wishbone where a backbone should be.

That man needs to be lonely until he figures it out.
"About 6 months after I started HRT and had what were basically bumps under my nipples, *everyone* started yelling about me **needing** to wear a bra. I'm not even talking about being topless, I mean always have on a bra if you leave the shower or bedroom. Men &amp; women freaked out if they could see an outline of my now suddenly lewd nipples. 

People are so fucking weird about women's chests I can't possibly understand it. It was just an overnight thing that now I am a woman and my chest is inappropriate and needs to be hidden from society. 

A somewhat validating experience that I am ""woman"" enough to have my chest be included in what is socially inappropriate but it really shows how stupid the idea is. "
Endlessly grateful to him and his family. It's strange but we didn't keep in touch so it's like this untouched chapter of my life that just stays pristine and warm. An oasis in life. 
"&gt;But I live in Oklahoma. Here, the only acceptable achievement topics for women are: what you made off your pinterest board this week, what church-related thing you did, or what your kids are up to.

Wow you have achieved way more than me by far, but as a fellow Oklahoma resident, I can relate to this so much...

My husband's family is from here, and whenever they get together it's like the men all gather around and talk about politics (and of course none of them are informed about any topics at all, they just regurgitate things they heard on fox news and infowars...) and the women only talk about their kids, church, and recipes.

When my husband and I got engaged, at the time I was working on my MBA, and my mother-in-law said ""Well looks like you won't need to finish that degree anymore!"" ...What year is it?! I feel like that's something that people said in the 1950s."
"These two seriously had the best marriage in media. They were loving, committed weirdos and they were so into each other."
"1.  Be honest, share everything, do not censor yourself.

2.  The work is done in between sessions, where you practice what you talked about, practice introspection, and work to change yourself.

3.  Establish goals with the therapist.

4.  It’s ok to choose a different therapist if you don’t have a great relationship with the therapist."
"Yeah, I feel like I'm the only woman here who actually *prefers* purses over pockets. Show me a pocket that can contain my 0,5L water bottle that I carry with me everywhere."
"You don't wake up with gold eyelids?! I do! My hair is in place and I let out the cutest little sigh when I wake up. And after working out, I have a slight glisten and smell great with a cute, not too fancy not too messy, bun.

It annoys me when people think that my ""no make-up look"" means I don't spend time on my appearance. The literal point of most make-up is to make you look better, highlight features, and hide flaws ffs"
"Horrifically smelly feet. Sometimes it can’t be helped, but when you remove your work socks and three cats immediately flock to the area to try and cover them like shit in their litter box, you gotta know something is up. 


My current partner is very good about washing his feet off &amp; putting on clean socks after work, but it took us a bit to get to that point without him feeling deeply offended. I consider myself very fortunate that smelly feet is my major gripe. "
"The proper method for hanging toilet paper. I do not understand why the man is utterly incapable of hanging it so the loose piece is over the top. We’re not savages, goddamnit! "
I’ve actually heard women say that their husband is at home babysitting the children. They actually use the word babysitting. It’s so fucking weird. 
"I dress up, go to a nice little patisserie, and have a tea party by myself. "
When they go out of their way to bash a woman’s looks when that woman literally wouldn’t look their way in a thousand lifetimes. I see it all the time and 90% of the time it’s from an ugly and insecure dude. 
"omg this is something i’ve always noticed but never found a good place to express! like as a woman i don’t want to post on r/roastme, not because i’m self-concious, but because i know all the insults will be about how i “suck dick” or “im a porn star”, and nothing actually creative. men always get creative insults, women just get slut jokes. "
Broad
"&gt; I get no ""Are you sick?"" when I had no time to do my make-up anymore.

On the flip side, when you do go out of your way to wear make up and dress up a little, everyone asks you if you have something special going on that day, or if you have an interview or a date!"
"The man cave thing makes me insane. Every time some dude on HGTV is like ""I need an office despite not actually working from home, and a dedicated man cave despite the two living rooms and game room you just showed us...."" Flames, on the side of my face..."
I was super hungry and my bf asked me what I wanted to eat so I cried because I was too hungry to decide. 
"When a guy is referring to his wife - ""the boss"". As in, ""I don't know if I can come out to work drinks tonight, I'll have to check with the boss"". Completely avoids taking any responsibility for your own choices, or for working out what's best for your family/relationship yourself."
"In college, I used to wear A LOT of make up. Smoked out eyes, blush, the works. I never had any problems with getting people to like me and feeling like I’m being heard, be with other students or the faculty. When I graduated, I decided that I wanted to go for a more natural look in my new job in the banking sector. I thought people will be more accepting and take me more seriously. Turns out I was very wrong. It’s amazing how shallow people are and I learned that the hard way. Where I work, the “prettier” you are and the more effort you put into your look, the easier it is for people to want to collaborate with you, to listen to you, and to be sold on your ideas, which in turn produces better work results and increases your chances of promotion. I wish I could say I’m one of those people who looks just as good if not better without so much makeup. But I’m not and how differently people treat me now compared to when I was in college is a testimony of that. I’ve only got my college days to benchmark with, but life in general was so much easier when you meet society’s expectations of beauty. I learned my lesson, though. Going forward when I get another job, I’m not going to pretend that I can pull off the au naturel look. I’ll rock my smokey eyes because it makes me feel confident and beautiful which in turn will make it easier for me to navigate my way around the social dynamics of corporate life. "
"I work full time, full time school, exercise, and have a decent social life. I have crippling depression and keep myself as busy as possible so I don’t have to face my thoughts! Can’t think about bad stuff if you never have the time, right? So that is my motivation. Bottling things up is bad, though, so every once in a while I schedule a “cry time” where I allot a small amount of time to make myself cry and feel things (usually over the course of a sad movie that makes me start crying- my two go-to’s are Big Fish and Moulin Rouge). After crying, I feel great, then go back to being gangster. "
"Don't settle just because you don't want to be alone! It will all work out in the end and all the sleepless, sad nights of feeling like something was wrong with me because I was single will be wasted energy. To work on myself and not focus on others who won't even be around for long. "
"it's acceptable to use it as a descriptor (''female doctor'', ''female engineer'') but when it's used in as a noun, it can come off as dehumanizing and strange especially if ''men'' is used in the same sentence. ex: ''females, how do you feel when men look at your boobs''"
"I knew somewhere in the middle of our first date that I was going to marry my husband. I just knew. We'd gone on two or three dates when I drunkenly told my sister I was going to marry this new guy. She said I was full of shit, so I bet her $5, and told her she could present the money to me during her Maid of Honor speech. She did just that 4 years later. The money is in a decorative jar on a shelf in my living room, the same place it's been for 10 years next month."
"If you are well dressed and are wearing makeup, people will be more than willing to help you with anything.  I've noticed that when I go out with no makeup and my studio clothes, people think I'm a bum and no one will talk to me."
"I haven't deleted facebook,  but i culled my friends down to people who i invited to my recent wedding only.  I don't actually look at the news feed anymore,  i only use it for some local groups im in.  

I now realize how much information i was taking in that had NO relevance to my life at all.  However,  I do feel like i miss out on things from people i do care about.  I  saying that,  now i have made the break from it,  i really don't want to go back.  So overall i am happy with the choice i made! "
"I witnessed my girlfriend cry over a cutesy parenting video, get ungodly mad at a plastic bag for tearing, curse me up and down because I never mentioned anything about having plans for that evening, cried tears of joy when I showed up for said plans WITH HER, then demand we get Thai food because nothing matters in the world more

And this was in the course of six hours? Ish?"
It gets forgotten about if the guy backs off once you make it clear you're not interested. It's annoying if he doesn't. It's super annoying if he acts like you're at fault for not returning his feelings instead of getting over it like an actual adult.
"Columbus was a misunderstood genius who wanted to prove the earth was round.

Nope! It was common knowledge in 1490 that the Earth is round. Eratosthenes calculated Earth's precise circumference in ancient Greece using angles and shadows. Columbus wanted to prove that its circumference was far smaller than it actually is. He believed the earth was pear shaped, with a nipple on top.

He was an idiot. He was demonstrably wrong via mathematical calcuations widely known in his day. That's why it was so hard for him to get funding."
Rock out with your cock out is ok but heaven forbid we jam out with our clams out.

"mothers that introduce their small kids to their new boyfriend(s). Im promiscuous and non monogamous and very liberal but that is not something i would ever do. Its too dangerous and its also a shitty thing to drag your kid into considering most relationships dont last. Unless we plan to get married, there is zero need for any of the guys i have dated to meet my child."
"And bisexual me is here like ""I can't have ANY friends?"". My abusive ex used that to alienate me from everyone, claiming I'd fuck any of my friends."
I murdered reagan91.
That’s so sexist of him. It puts female staffers at a clear disadvantage. I don’t see how this doesn’t violate labor laws. 
Multiple orgasms...? Idk. 
"I had a baby nearly 5 months ago and I am so fed up with people visiting whenever they feel like it. 

No heads up, they just appear and then it throws off baby feeding/bath time . They don’t knock, they just walk in. 

My whole family live in Ireland &amp; I am in Scotland so I feel suffocated seeing my in laws so frequently without breathing space.

Thanks for giving me a place to get this out! "
Men refer to women as a 'bitch' for literally any reason at all. Its sad.
"Time is the only thing I've found that works. With that in mind, do things to try to occupy your mind. I am not artistic or crafty, but whenever I do decide to do something of that nature it consumes me because it doesn't come natural so I really have to concentrate. Before I know it, hours have passed with no thoughts really running through my mind. Do that for a few hours everyday and that's a few hours without worry or sadness.

Also, if you have friends, hang out with them. Talk about things other than relationships, and maybe go out and do something new (maybe a new restaurant, or an escape room, etc).

I also try to deal with my feelings of heartbreak instead of pushing them all away. If you can face the demons, they aren't that scary anymore if that makes sense. If you push away the feelings they may come back with more force and make you worse in the long run. I used to journal, or even just write out my feelings online (but keep them as a hidden post). It helps.

"Definitely the fact that the Harry Potter books were still coming out, and there was so much to debate about.  I spent tons of time on Harry Potter fan forums.  I miss a less social media and cell phone-centered world as well.  Though by the end of the 2000s that was all gone.  I'll even admit I had a soft spot for mall goth fashion.  I never had the guts to wear it, but I thought goths at school looked cool.  

The rest I have zero good memories of and will gladly leave behind, thank you very much."
Put my frozen cold feet in between his thighs to warm them up for me while in bed. What a trooper. 
"I told the cute regular, “It’s my last day tomorrow.”

He left me his card taped to the door the next day. My boss threw it toward me in annoyance. Nothing he could do about it at that point.

We’re enjoying coffee with our dogs. Married 3 months... 

Obviously don’t risk your job, take that chance before you leave!"
"Petition to call men who don't shave their legs ""legbeards"" because theirs are much more impress than ours."
"I'm 32.  Shit happens, and nobody cares.  There doesn't have to be a reason.  The inverse of this is that you could be having a wonderful time and dancing like a lunatic and feeling a little self conscious or not, and still, nobody who matters cares.  You do you."
"he was hopelessly enmeshed/codependent with his twin brother. it got to the point where including him in our relationship was honest to god on the table as a ''solution''. inappropriate behaviour was happening and my SO felt too helpless to stop it.

thank god he woke up when it progressed to sexual assault. he came with me to therapy and cut off communication for the time being with his brother. you might ask why i stayed, and the reason is because i know very well what it's like to be enmeshed with highly manipulative family. and none of my own manipulative family members were ever my ''born best friend'' or ''the same person'', so i can't even imagine.

we're good now. it's been over a year since we made a stand. he's made up his failure to protect me in droves. he's maintaining boundaries with all of his family and i couldn't be more proud of him."
"Grit.

I love women (and men) who don't give up, and just push through pain / discomfort / misfortune."
"The fact that I didn’t have to work to please someone else. I can do whatever I want, when I want, and enjoy my own company "
"I agree. I’ve known women who have worked in the sex industry over the years and, except for one exceptionally beautiful young woman who was able to make a lot of money stripping, they were all deeply traumatised. 
I agree with decriminalisation and regulation as it increases safety, but I struggle with the way destigmatising has become normalising and almost promoting it as a career option.
It’s inherently dangerous. "
"Or “I actually screwed up the relationship and/or got dumped, but I’m just going to call her crazy so that I still look good.”"
"If I was married to a guy and they referred to me as the hole they are with, I'd leave them. No fucking joke. "
"I tend to brush off illnesses and injuries because I don't like going to hospitals. I don't like doctors, I hate the idea of surgery, and needles scare me.

There was this one Friday though, I had a great day, fun with friends, ate some pizza, played video games, continued talking to friends on my computer and I slowly started getting this belly ache. So I brushed it off. I probably ate too much pizza and I was suffering the consequences.

As time went on it started getting worse but it was tolerable. Around this time I started feeling nauseated and felt like I was going to puke. I've only ever felt like this I e other time and it was when I had food poisoning. I told my friends I wasn't feeling well and I was going to try and sleep it off. I'm laying in bed pain getting worse so I take a ibuprofen or what ever pull helps with pain. My mom is a nurse, she tells me what to take and I take it. Lay back down feeling better. My mom was getting ready for work because she works night shifts. And I remember just telling her. ""I think I have appendicitis, I want to go to the hospital."" She knew I wasn't joking around because I will treat a huge gash like it's a paper cut.

She asks if I'm serious and if I couldn't wait till the morning. ""It's probably just a belly ache, go to bed and see if you feel better in the morning.""

Step dad comes home from bowling. Ask him to take me to hospital ""I think I have appendicitis, I want to go to the hospital.""  He was willing to take me. I was able to stand up straight the amount of pain I was in. Get to hospital, paperwork, go to room to talk to doctor. Doc asks me to stand up. I stand up nice and tall, no pain. They start to not believe me. Step dad starts to not believe me. I know something is wrong.

So a test with some sort of liquid and look at my insides from an MRI or cat scan or something, low and behold. Appendix is ready to burst. To into surgery that Night. 

I'm so proud of myself for knowing something was wrong and sticking to my gut.

"Many things, but I think the best thing was that he was cool with my natural voice. I've always been picked on for having a deep voice (think Bea Arthur), but when we started dating, he said he liked it. It was the first moment in our relationship when I realized he might be a keeper."
"“We accept the love we think we deserve.”

You deserve more. You deserve better. "
"Really?

Mostly looked like girls attacking other girls for pointless reasons"
"Ugh I see my teen self here too. 

Is it possible that part of being a neck beard/ legbeard is just an adolescent mindset (I am so persecuted and I know better than everyone) that you never grow out of?"
"Some examples are being called names and assuming that I will be attracted to them (and then getting offended when I say I am not lol).
But the worst is the sexual harassment.  The ""curious girls"" who want to experiment with a lesbian and make me feel like I'm of no worth besides just a sex toy.  Then they get all grumpy and entitled over it if I say no and to experiment with other curious women...they say it's not the same because they want someone experienced.  I view this homophobic in particular because these people treat us like objects even though they would hate the same to happen to them. "
"I want to get married. I don’t have to, especially in this modern age, but it’s something I’ve always wanted. 

SO &amp; I are getting married later this year despite being childfree."
Seriously. I am single by choice and get so annoyed with all the dating advice questions. 
"I've seen this [Tumblr quote/poem](https://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Breakup+feels_8d9fbd_5090851.jpg) floating around fairly often, whether it's on Facebook or whatever -- the idea that ""every cell in your entire body"" is destroyed and replaced every 7 years. I get that it sounds poetic, but it's incorrect. 

RBCs have a lifespan of about 120 days, skin epidermal cells are sloughed off every 2-4 weeks, the epithelial lining of your mucosa (think -your GI/oral cavity areas) is also sloughed off and replaced every few days, some of the cells of your immune system only live hours to less than 2 days, osteocytes have an average half life of 25 years, and although the research on this is ongoing, neurons can potentially last a lifetime (although pruning does happen in your adolescent years). To slap this arbitrary, scientifically incorrect number (and to attribute it to a professor!) on the body's complex apoptotic and regenerative cycles is just ridiculous. "
"Yes, I completely agree! When I was shopping for my wedding, I found [this lovely cake topper.](http://www.michaels.com/wilton-cake-topper-ball-and-chain/10451949.html) Because that's what I want to convey at my wedding... my husband doesn't really want to marry me and I'm going to make his life miserable forever.  Why tf would you even get married if this is how you feel about marriage? I get that it's supposed to be a joke, but I really don't find it funny.

"I took a lot of courses and went to an evening school for 9 years, and now I speak 6 languages, 4 of them fluently. "
"Yes! My boss does this all the time - whenever a random woman comes up in conversation he has to make a comment on her looks. Like recently a Kylie Minogue song came on the radio and, apropos of nothing but another coworker going, ""is this Kylie minogue?"" my boss pipes up with, ""I think her sister's prettier though.""

I didn't even turn around to face him, just went, ""oh, I wasn't aware they were having that competition."""
I don't like looking up anyone's LinkedIn because they'll get a notification a week later saying you were looking at their profile.
"My cousin was asking for a place to stay, along with her boyfriend.  She was 16 or 17 and had a troubled home life, so an aunt and uncle of hers took pity on her and took both of them in.  When I visited, everything just seemed wrong about the situation, especially since her boyfriend looked about 40.  And the way they behaved was strange, like they weren't in their right minds.  I talked to my mom, and we brought up our concerns, but her aunt and uncle insisted they were just ""kids down on their luck.""

A few months later aunt and uncle realized every valuable item in their house had mysteriously gone missing, talked to the police, and figured out both of them were heroin addicts who'd been pawning their valuables for money.  The boyfriend was a four-time felon in his late 30s."
Basically a lot of sex tips for women are about pleasuring men instead of themselves so not something specific but it's what I notice a lot.
