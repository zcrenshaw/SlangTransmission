How is confirming you have the correct customer not how it works? He was literally doing exactly that."

Yes, Yes there is."

"When I was in high school my grandfather worked for Texas A&amp;M University and we moved to Doha, Qatar so that he could help start the branch campus they were opening there. The ISP there offered so-so DSL for home users (and blocked a lot of things) but the university had access to high speed fiber.

One of the IT guys, who lived near us, decided that he wanted fast internet at home too.

To accomplish this, he set up directional transmitters and receivers on the roof of his villa and one of the university buildings. I remember him setting up the one on his roof. All the buildings there had nice flat roofs, so he was able to build a stable base for a tower that must have been twenty feet high. Everyone told him he was crazy and that someone was going to have a tower fall on them; in retrospect I think there are other reasons that this plan was bizarre, but as the campus was just getting started there was kind of a cowboy atmosphere to the whole project and nobody told him he couldn't do it.

It apparently worked great, too - he was able to wirelessly connect to the university network from kilometers away, and enjoyed better download speeds than anyone else in the neighborhood."
"This is one of my favorite types of story: the one where someone doesn't want to spend three or four figures to solve the problem in the simple, straightforward way, so instead they throw away five or six figures' worth of employee time on researching cheaper solutions that don't work."
That has to be the best failed attempt at social engineering I've ever read.
"$CluelessCFO called me up one day

&gt;$CluelessCFO: ""I need some training""

&gt;$Me: ""Sure. In what, the multi-function copier? Something to do with the Internet?""

&gt;$CluelessCFO: ""Excel.""

&gt;$Me: ""Excel? What part?""

&gt;$CluelessCFO: ""All of it.""

This where I realized I was dealing with the top brass."
"&gt; Man: Yeah man I've got some pizzas here, I need the address for.  
&gt; Man: No, that's not how this works. Just give me your address.  
&gt; Man: You know what? I see your house up here. I'm gonna pull into your driveway and sort this out.

I have questions.

Edit: Formatting."
The fact that the internet was blocked by an ISP billboard is at once scummy and strangely poetic
Wow this story has a happy ending huh? I like it!
"""responsible for HR related things"".


Saw the power trip and huffy-ness coming from miles away.


Dear lord I loathe HR people. Ours is a nightmare of self importance and telling others how to do their jobs. Specifically ones she knows exactly nothing about. "
"Isn't that completely illegal, using someone else's Wi-Fi without their permission?"
"I couldn't work the support desk at my company. Those people are the unsung heroes of everything. Once an internal user was having issues with an internal web application and as a programmer, support desk called me over to help them look at it. 

$Me: why did they feel the need to create a new client and then hit the refresh button 10 times?
$SD: They were trying to intentionally break the system, they are really proud of them self for finding a way to do it. 
$Me: then they are an idiot and can fix it on their own. 
$SD: He can hear you.....
$Me: Oh my bad....sir you are a complete idiot and should be banned from the system. Start over and don't be an idiot again. 

Surprisingly I'm still working at the company 8 years later and never heard any feedback from it, but I could never work as support desk dealing with the idiots day in and out. "
"My college professor told me this story:

He worked at a place in Texas right near the Mexico border. They had a factory in Mexico that was roughly 10 miles away. The factory had basically no internet options, and the one they did have was so insanely expensive and low speed that the company couldn't afford it. The solution was to setup a similar system like your IT guy did. 

It worked pretty good, no major problems for a few years. There was nothing in the way between the two transmitters, everything was kosher. 

Until it wasn't. My professor said he came in one day and the factory in Mexico was down. He did the troubleshooting, couldn't find anything wrong. Went down to the factory, found out the transmitter wasn't getting a signal. They tried all kinds of things and come to find out, the ISP had built a billboard between the two locations that was blocking the signal. So they built higher towers and it worked for a few more years until the factory had a viable internet option. "
and this is why IT depts lock down computers so tight that users can't even fart near 'em.
"Yeah, he was really aggressive so I felt like it was some weak scam going on."
Only at the Sonicwall statement did I realise this isn't my office.

For those of you wondering the `bash story 240849` bit.

&gt; &lt;Patrician|Away&gt; what does your robot do, sam

&gt; &lt;bovril&gt; it collects data about the surrounding environment, then discards it and drives into walls"
"Oh yeah, the guide says to do that."
"Wow.  From ""Whatever. You built it, fix it.""  to ""suddenly the user looked down at his feet.""

That shithead would have let you think you'd fucked up, and let you pay for replacements etc., if he had the chance."
"Ah yes, the sewing machine school of troubleshooting. Is the needle fucked up? Is it threaded right? Is everything in the right way 'round?  If it still doesn't work after that, get a cup of tea and come back after fifteen minutes, do all that again, and it'll probably work.

Edit: I have no idea why this got gold, but okay."
Yes. It's theft. Same thing as if I had taken your car to work without asking.
"It is a baby monitor in a way, by providing Internet access and making users act like babies when it is down, and is able to monitor our usage of it as well, so yes, I can see why $OL made that mistake."
"That's how our director is. He dismisses it as ""well I'm paying you anyways"".

Nevermind that the time you waste on these fools errands prevents you from performing billable hours tasks, which in turn prevents you from meeting billable hours goals which prevents you from attaining bonuses tied to meeting your billable hours goals."

Well, on the plus side it means you don’t gossip about users behind their backs since you’ll say it directly to them lol."
"That’s happened at my work before. They scanned their badge, which happens to be a number in the millions.

There is no possible way that I could have refrained from suggesting she try it on her phone.
"I was hoping you'd password it, you didn't disappoint."
"Soooo, if I am getting this right you are telling me, that you can not fix my neighbor's not paying the internet policy and that I have to go yell at him, why he didn't pay so that I could keep on stealing his internet?!

What kind of incompetent person am I speaking with!

I want to talk with your manager!"
I'm fine with that.
"""Let me email you some troubleshooting steps."""
"Drug deal gone bad for the seller, was code I guess."

"I thought so. I'd have just said ""look, you are illegally using their internet. I'm gonna have to alert the authorities. Please stay on the line while I contact them"". 

I bet that would have ended that call immediately. "
"&gt;$Me: ""both mail.ourdomain.com and ourdomain.com point to the same address, which is the external address of our Internet connection. They are actually the exact same address.""

If that's the case and they do indeed both resolve to the same public IP, wouldn't it have made sense to give him the address as ourdomain.com:1234 instead to avoid confusion? It would seem to me that making people point towards the webmail server to access the remote desktop is kind of confusing. "
"This is why I read this sub.

Are you good at bowling because of all the practice in testing, or did you get worse with all the times you just have to chuck a ball down the lane whichever way?"

"That's when you get creative...  ""Okay.. do you have a key to the right of your spacebar that you have no idea what it does?   Great!  Press it!""    That and the ""Shift-F10"" trick.

What was annoying was dealing with the militant southpaws.

&gt;Okay, I need you to right click on the icon.

    Actually, I'm a left handed user, so for me that's my left click, and besides, it's called the context click.

"&gt;”Welcome to tech. These people are your life now.”

I’m just imaging a grizzled war veteran in khakis and a polo working IT."
That last paragraph hit me more than it should’ve. I’ve volunteered helping elders and young kids fix/setup computers and I hate how many people just blindly blame it on the computer first but it’s nice to see someone who takes initiative to try to make their job easier before requiring someone else to do that for you. Docks and simple stuff like a slightly different mouse or minor desk reorganization works wonders for old folk. 
You wouldn't download a car

Because he is a boss and not a leader.
