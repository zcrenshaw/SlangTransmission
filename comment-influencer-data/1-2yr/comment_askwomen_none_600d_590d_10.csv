"Lack of adequate parental leave in a lot of countries (...the US).  The expectation that mothers should take a very small amount of unpaid time off then just get back to work.  Also the fact that mothers are seen as the primary caregiver of children by default always, because of being female - that mothers get time off because they're expected to be the primary caregiver but fathers do not."
"I was taught from a young age to only date Christian men. If they were abusive, immature, definitely gay, didn’t matter as long as they loved Jesus. I turned down sweet, kind, attractive guys who were respectful and wonderful because I was desperate to follow the church.

Well,  I married the atheist that finally changed my mind. No one from the church speaks to me anymore, but I couldn’t be happier."

"It’s tough for sure. 

I hit that weird spot of being abstinent til marriage, but still very sex-positive. So I’m kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

The only thing I can do is just continue to date and only get serious with guys who respect my wishes. "

"I don't get Pedicures from strangers because my feet are crazy ticklish. Tried it twice. Both times I was squirming and trying desperately not to kick the person in the face on accident. 

However, I can do it to myself - Bucket of hot water, soap, Epsom salts, soak feet for 15-30 mins (usually I just put on a show to pass the time) and then attack the callouses with an exfoliating bar thing. 

Toe nails are soft by then, so push back cuticles, trim nails, rinse of again, and then apply moisturizer. 

I only really do this maaaaybe 3x a year, because feet are feet, they're gunna look like weird deformed hands no matter what you do"

"I met a guy in 2007 that broke alllllll my deal breakers. Smoked, didn't graduate college, still talked to all his ex girlfriend's..... And I ended up marrying him. We have been married almost 7years and together 11. We have had some ups and downs, but he is my best friend and soul mate. He has quit smoking though so that's good. "
"This guy literally considers me in everything he does and how it will benefit the both of us. I'm like the other half of him. He doesn't say it nor tell me mushy things, he just does it and I don't think he even realizes. But it means even more to me that it's just second nature for him. 

This guy loves me unconditionally and it's crazy to experience that kind of love that's not just from your parents. He is always trying to motivate me and get me to set my goals and achieve them so that I'm living to my fullest potential. 10/10 will love 5ever. 

Edit: holy, thanks for the upvotes everyone :) y'all are so kind. I showed my guy my post and explained everything and he was beyond flattered by all the love. He even shed a tear...admittedly we've been having a few drinks tonight so we're a little more emotional :p"

"He cares about my comfort. Always asks if I’m warm enough. While he was making me a fire last week, I flashed back to a huge fight with my ex in a restaurant where I was freezing and he didn’t want to move because he picked that table. 

Another one that really sticks out is within the first few weeks of dating he asked me about love languages because he wanted to make sure he was capable of giving me what I needed. Flash back to explaining to my ex why I needed physical affection besides just “Let’s bang” and being completely disregarded. 

So much more but rarely even think about exes now :)"
"Went on a date with a guy once and he said he had to ""stop off at home"" for his wallet. (He lived down the street from me.) I went inside with him and he ended up pulling me down onto his lovesac as a ""joke"" and trying to hook up with me. I got up and left and walked home. 

Fast forward a year and I read in the local news that he was arrested for kidnapping and raping a woman that he had been on a date with. He held her captive in his apartment and beat her and assaulted her. He could have faced life in prison, but only spent about 6 years in before he was released on parole. "
"Fuck it, I'll bite. I dislike Hillary and hate Bill, I wouldn't vote for Clinton period. I didnt agree with any of her nonsocial policies (taxing, Syria, guns, military etc. Her family has also been involved in almost every scandal). Voting third party doesn't work with how our system works, I wish it did. 

Trump is very pro-military and I'm in the military. I'd love to be paid a wage I can live comfortably on (many of my coworkers who have a family can barely make it paycheck to paycheck). He also fixed our GIBill. Mattis is a badass and a god too haha.

Do I agree with how Trump deals with gender equality? No. However that wasn't my priority. Feminism is so large right now and protests will push no matter who was the president. If the issues aren't dealt with this term, they definitely will be next term. 

Honestly, the worst thing about this situation is that all my liberal acquaintances (including most of the reddit) act like I'm the some racist bigot and everyone who voted for Trump is one too. Askreddit is filled with questions asking why people voted for Trump then attacking them for doing so. Most people who voted for Trump voted for him because they didn't want Clinton in office. A lot of my Republican acquaintances wanted a different president too. Can we all just agree people have different opinions sometimes things happen that we don't like, including presidency? 

Edit: I feel like I need to state I don't like Trump. He was the lesser of two evils to me. It's all very opinion based. As we all know, most of you don't have the same opinion. I don't need to hear about every little thing Trump has done wrong and people trying to prove my opinion wrong. It's an opinion. 

Most of you are so obsessed with proving me wrong. I know Trump is a shitty person. It won't change the fact that I voted for Trump, Trump won (even if my state lost, I'm from a blue state), and if I had to make the choice again I would still vote for him. Would I vote for Trump in 2020? Probably not. 

I also don't need to hear how I'm a bigoted racist or other derogatory terms that my PMs are filled with. I just answered the question. "

"I know a ton of people in my parents’ generation who were (rich, white) lefty in the seventies and think that that gets them a free pass to be considered lefty for the rest of their lives. So, they’re super judgmental and look down on poor people and barely tolerate gay people but think they’re liberal because, like, they smoke pot and think black people should have Civil Rights."
"Yes. 

I think men are physically stronger, naturally. This is not to say that women can’t be strong!!! I’m just saying men can build the muscle mass faster. 

I don’t like periods. Who does? 

I don’t like the idea of being the one to carry the child for 9 month. This is kinda a short term disability. You can’t do certain things for a few months. (Touch toes, gymnastics due to fear of falling, drink). 

I don’t like boobs. The get in the way and are heavy. I’m sure men think the same about balls though. 

I am very happy being a woman, but if life was a video game where you could pick your starter character. I would pick Man. "
Basically any form of social media. I've cut back a lot lately though to focus on hobbies that are more fun/interesting/fulfilling.
Three months in and I realized he did not know my last name. It even came up and he still didn’t ask. I don’t know if that seems petty to most but it really rubbed me the wrong way.

"Reproductive issues are the big one, I'd imagine. If it seems insane to me and many other people in this country that in the year of our lord 2018, we're still criminalising abortions that happen anyway in Ireland, I can't even think what the opinions will be like in 2050. "
"Pretty much anything that's going to return its cost in durability/versatility. Shoes and handbags that can go with anything in my wardrobe. A $200 pair of shoes makes a $3 t-shirt and $30 jeggings look super chic. I've been trying to ""mature"" my wardrobe and the investment has been worth it!"

"One of my favorite Asian actresses in Western media is definitely the casting of Sandra Oh as Dr. Cristina Yang in Grey's Anatomy, because she wasn't reduced to stereotypes and her ethnicity rarely plays this ""big, central role"" that POC typically play with their roles, if that makes sense (like it's not mentioned as this big point of interest, it's just there like it would be in real life). Sure she's smart which is an Asian stereotype, but we can have smart Asians on TV just like we can have dumb Asians on TV, because we're humans like everyone else. Plus, her smartness is never reduced to ""it's because I'm Asian,"" it's because she's headstrong and goes after what she wants (which also goes against this stereotype that Asian women are submissive and passive). I only watched 3 seasons, so maybe that changes later on, but I loved her.

Overall, I agree with a lot of points mentioned earlier. Asian women are often either made nerdy or over sexualized. It's a strange contrast to be honest, but it's toxic either way because what if you are neither? Or what if you are smart, and now media has told you that this intellect you have is something we see in a lot of Asians and therefore is a result of not your own hard work, but a result of your ethnicity? I don't know, I want to see Asians in more roles being just three-dimensional people who aren't necessarily cast for their ethnicity. "

"Instagram. I almost never post, but I open it maybe about 5-6 times a day just to scroll through my feed. 

It doesn't give me any joy but I do it anyway, mostly to fill idle time and a little bit out of FOMO-slash-noseyness. In fact I'd say occasionally it has negative effect on my happiness... I know it's people's ""highlight reel"" and all that, but quite often I find myself wishing I was more social or outgoing or hanging out at all these cool, fun places, even though I *am* social and outgoing and *do* hang out at cool, fun places. 

I kind of wish I could look at Reddit instead but Reddit is blocked in my country.

"My ex would get super nice before sex, and for the entire day after sex. Typically he's kind of a humorless guy around the house. Anyway, I always loved how much nicer/friendlier/ much more loving, he was towards me post sex. Typically he just did he own thing and didn't interact with me at all. I should mention, he was my first long term sexual relationship, we married as teens because I was pg and split up after a very long marriage. 
With my current SO, I expected a better than average day after we had sex and was truly baffled when he would watch football or whatever. I honestly thought the sex wasn't good enough. Finally I screwed up the courage to ask him why he wasn't more loving towards me after sex. His reply? ""I love you the same, with or without sex."" God damn. And he does. I can say no to sex, and he's still super affectionate and loving, and this is a guy with a high sex drive. My ex would literally not speak to me for days unless he had to if we didn't have sex. I was completely blown away that I lived for so long believing my value was based on how much/little sex I was having. You really can't know what you don't know."
"I didn’t, but my grandmother voted for Trump because Obummer was a Muslim who kept trying to steal all her hard-earned inheritance money, and women are too emotional to be president (she said this to my face, with a straight face).  

Internalized misogyny is real. "
"My longterm guy friend who always had the opposite of conservative lifestyle in dating like sleeping with a whole lot of women, hiring escorts couple times, having one night stands, having FFM threesomes, even things like sleeping with a former fling's cousin said he looks down on women who have casual sex without feelings and women who have a high number. It was shocking. All the times he listened to our mutual girl friends' stories about their casual sex, he was looking down on them apparently. He still thinks he's tolerant and not a misogynist because he can befriend or have casual sex with ""women like that"" and he believes in gender equality just not on the same things. My blood is boiling again, ugh."
"He was very rude to wait staff and strangers in public in general. The first few dates he wasn't so rude, or i just didn't notice. But our last dinner out had me horrified, and I ""fixed"" it by just ordering take out for dates and eating in. He was very negative and also insecure, yet somehow full of himself. Since we no longer had wait staff to act as the buffer, his little comments began to target me. My clothes, my hair, my makeup, my hobbies were suddenly subpar.

I noped out so fast and broke up with him over lunch between classes. And I told him why with some examples of what he'd said. He didn't even deny it and told me I needed to not be so sensitive and if I did things the way he liked, he'd be happy and wouldn't have to make those comments. LOL NOPE"
"Doing my makeup, honestly. I was doing a full face every day for a while there but it's not really worth it to me (I'm a student, so I was basically just getting done up to go to class)."
"I told a guy about a sexual assault that I had sustained on a train (a man put his hand up my skirt).

Date said to me, 'What, like this?' AND THEN ATTEMPTED TO RECREATE THE ASSAULT.

This was a first date.  In a park where we got coffee for goodness sake."
"Ehhh. More than you'd think, but they are the type that are super-conservative and are bothered by the fact that I have kissed &amp; made out with previous boyfriends and that I hold the opinions that I have. I have also ditched a lot of the ""modesty culture"" that was big in the '80s-mid '00s (and is dying, but still very present). Similar to what someone else said down below, I don't jive with guys that take issue with my fashion and makeup hobbies because they ""hide my real, godly beauty"" or whatever tf. 

Also, it's still very common for Christians to get married young (like, 20-24), so most guys that would honor my wishes are already off the market."

"I work in construction so... All my coworkers voted for trump. The women's reasoning was ""well I'm not voting that (female slur) in!"" and ""oh honey, all men talk that way."" (in which I replied, my boyfriend doesn't. My dad doesn't. John over there doesn't. And they smiled and said 'oh I'm sure not in front of you') 

I do hear them from time to time making some jokes about Trumps tweeting and his bad comments, but the general consensus seems to be that he is still better than That Woman. They also comment a little bit about how well our 401(k)s are doing and the fact that this is the highest profit year ever for our company after a slump. Honestly though? They've been pretty quiet since the election. If anything they talk about Republicans in general and not trump. "
"Being an outspoken woman in a male industry and with all male co-workers I have been surprised at how customers often will be taken aback. I guess if you are a Asian woman, you are expected even more than any other woman to be a submissive, quiet, delicate background personality. I've had people tiptoe but essentially say they didn't expect me to run the show because I look like I wouldnt be the type. One said that ""my people"" tend to be meek. 

I guess we're all suppose to be house wives to old white guys, nail ladies, massage therapist, nurses, run a restaurant or do taxes. "
"There was a solid year close to a decade ago where I would have fits of hysterical laughter while I tried to sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about this photo of an emu eating so grossly. Even typing this on my commute it's bubbling out of me. That fucking emu.

**edit** *I am so tickled that so many people found joy in his joyous face. NO ONE in my life was struck by it, and I spent months laughing midsentence just thinking about him out of the blue. My partner at the time was so done with me. Bless you all lol.*"
Great date and ended by walking on the beach. I took my shoes off and he offers to hold my shoes while I grab a couple of sea shells. We walk back and I am washing my feet off and he walks over to his car I thought to grab a towel and he takes off with my shoes!

"Ethnics outside of Chinese and Japanese are virtually nonexistent.  Koreans are making more of an appearance. 

Asians are either half white or looks... very Asian? I’m Asian American and I feel like I don’t look like the Asian women I see on the screen. I don’t look like Olivia Munn or Zhang Ziyi. Brenda Song is probably the closest representation but even we don’t look anything alike. "
"The problem I had while dating was that most guys either thought I was crazy or were from super conservative families and had never been alone with a girl before. I wanted someone who really appreciated my desire to save myself for them, but who also shared my values and beliefs (like, I'm not interested in dating a guy who thinks makeup ""distracts away from true beauty"" or whatever). 
   
I think the fact that I'm saving myself for religious reasons has helped me find someone though. There tends to be less weirdness about wanting to save yourself within the church. I'm currently dating an amazing man who shares my beliefs and values and we will be each other's firsts. So, guys like that are out there, they just seem few and far between. "
"&gt; Trump is very pro-military and I'm in the military.  

But do you still believe this, one year in? Knowing all of the following:  

* McConnell refused to guarantee pay for the military during a shutdown
* Trump has talked about his sex life being his ‘own personal Vietnam’ 
* Trump is a draft-dodger 
* Trump disrespected a gold star family 
* Trump disrespected Sgt La David Johnson’s widow and forgot his name 
* Trump got 4 soldiers killed in Niger 
* Trump bounced around and sang during the changing of the guard at Arlington, and then didn’t even know the words to the anthem during the college football championship game 
* Trump didn’t even know what the bugle call was for at the PA air national guard 
* Trump ended a program at the VA aimed at cutting veteran homelessness, despite claiming he wants to end veteran homelessness 
* Trump’s proposed 2018 budget ends the individual unemployability benefit for disabled vets and reduces their benefits from $35k to $13k. 
* The military pay raise for 2018 was 2.1% - the exact same as the 2017 pay raise under Obama "
"Sometimes. The main appeal is: I wanna be able to suck at something and have it just be ""wow he sucks at that"" and not become ""wow girls suck at that""

"If women don't wanna have kids, I assume it wouldn't be a big deal then.

"For me, it was that my current bf actually ENJOYS communicating about everything! My last bf couldn't be serious about anything, never contributed if I wanted to talk politics or anything deeper than small talk, and would avoid any topics that had the chance to create conflict. After a while I just stopped trying and our conversations became ""what're you up to"" ""doing x"" ""oh cool I'm doing x"" repeat ad nauseum.

New guy... Holy shit. I ask about anything, no matter how ridiculous or trivial, and he jumps on it no questions. Our conversations are so interesting and satisfying!!"
"Kind of similar - My mother is a high school teacher and told me her female students will brazenly just walk to the bathroom with a tampon or pad right in their hand, instead of hiding it in a pocket or shoe like we did in school. Girls today are so much more confident in their womanhood and I LOVE IT."
"I also dated a guy who was a good bit overweight and with a body type I did not initially feel attracted to.  He was so very smart, a great conversationalist, intuitive, and charming that I fell for him really hard. 

His body became another part of him I adored.  He was active and worked out on pretty much a daily basis which may have also had a factor in it.  As a result, I am now more open-minded about weight and body types which has expanded my options for relationships. 

Unfortunately, we had different relationship goals (he didn’t see lasting value in committed relationships and I’m hoping to find one) and we broke up on friendly terms.  

Yes, it made me wonder if I’ve been shorting myself with other dealbreakers."

It did hurt, still hurts now. "
Whenever I'm in a playful mood and I want a kiss I make a squeaky noise. After 3 and a half years he's so accustomed to the noise that if I do it while he's sleeping he will wake up and give me a smooch when he's still half asleep. Most of the time he usually shoots up with his eyes still closed and tries to find my lips. He normally looks like a fish looking for food when he does it.

"It means that:

-I don’t shame others for not being abstinent. And I am not expecting that my future husband be abstinent prior to dating me. 

-I believe sexuality is a beautiful thing. We should be free to talk about it in an open, positive way.  Because after all, God designed sex.

-I believe that comprehensive sex-ed should be available to all. Even if you wait, you will still want (actually, need) that info.

-I am pro-LGBT.

"It wasn’t about standards and I thought he was cute, but I’d been hanging out with this guy for a couple of weeks as friends. I could tell he was into me, but he was so quiet and didn’t really seem to have any personality whatsoever. There was just no chemistry, and I thought I’d be super bored in a relationship with him.

So, one night I told a friend I was planning on letting this guy down gently. “I dunno,” she said. “There’s something about this one. You should give him a chance.”

When she said that, I had this weird epiphany that like... my previous dating pattern obviously wasn’t working for me, because I was both single and with a string of heartbreaks and failed relationships. So maybe I should try. 

I also realized he was probably super nervous around me. So, I figured I’d see if things changed if he loosened up.

The next night I had him over for some drinks. After a few he actually made a JOKE, the first joke he ever attempted to make around me. I decided to see what would happen if I kissed him, and took him to bed. Right away, he blew me away. The chemistry was unbelievable. 

That was five years ago. Now we own a condo and cats and have basically been together every night since. "

"Atypical? Usually people who are driven and ambitious are touted as desirable. But in reality you'll sit on your ass alone all the time because they don't have time for you. Their life revolves around their project and that is never going to change. So if it wasn't my interest as well, I'd rather not be the housewife who keeps a house warm for a guy who may be there a few times a year.

There are of course nuances to this. Couch potato incapable of life isn't desirable as well."
"I'm in my late 20s and I've long admired how few fucks the older women in my life tend to give. As I've gotten older, I find myself becoming more and more like that, but I'm still pretty sensitive.

"That they think certain things aren't assault and that this is getting a little carried away. They get so defensive. ""Well.. women I KNOW would have removed themselves from that situation/not done that/etc. Real women stand up for themselves and take responsibility for their actions.""

"When my friends, or other random girls out in public, compliment my makeup. I don't wear it often, but when I do, I go all out. It's just nice to have my blinding highlight noticed sometimes haha.

But as far as things I wear... my black leather jacket, this red-orange lipstick I have, and my pair of blush Nikes that my SO got me for Christmas."
"I met this guy online, texted a lot and I thought why not go out on a date? Well, there were a lot of things he failed to mention, such as his extreme tourettes (every sentence had a swear word thrown in randomly, and he would interrupt me constantly,  which I brushed aside because I have met people with the syndrome before), his height was almost a foot less than his profile said (said he was just over six foot, but I'm 5'7 and towered over him) and of course, forgot to mention the six other girls he was 'in a relationship with'. I was uneasy initially because of how much he failed to mention, but it got worse. He took me to a massive antique store (we both love old stuff) which was basically the creepiest warehouse I've been in. It was dimly lit with all sorts of creepy dolls lining the wall... Not my kind of antique store. So we're walking through the store, with him randomly shouting swear works, and I just want to go home. He kept grabbing my shoulder... Cupping the shoulder and squeezing hard, then would run his hand down my back and grabbing my ass. I tell him I'm not comfortable with it, and he grabs my hand and pulls me into the bathroom at the end of the shop, throws me against the wall so I end up on my hands and knees (I'm in shock now), locks the door, lowers his pants and thrusts his junk into my face. When I didnt follow his 'request' he grabbed my jaw and tried opening my mouth. A finger slips in and I take the opportunity to bite it. This freaked him out, screaming 'what the fuck is wrong with you I just want a blowie' and I stand up, slap him across the face and get out as soon as possible. I'm crying while running out of the shop, and the shopkeeper stops me and asks whats wrong. I explain what just happened and he looked over to see my 'date' chasing after me. He was arrested on site and haven't heard from him since. 
Thankfully I'm now with a wonderful man so it all worked out in the end.

I always check for a clean bathroom.  If their bathroom is filthy I’ll likely peace out...I’m not showering the next morning amidst all their filth. 
"There were several, but the one that still nags at me well after our break up (the one that finally he initiated after not letting me end things on my terms 3 other times prior) is that he would regularly embarrass me in front of others as a means to bring me down to his social level because he didn't like that I was the more intelligent, organized, and stable of us.

 He even went so far as to bring my dildo out and throw it into the middle of the group we were having a party with and announcing that it was mine. To follow this he decided to tell people at the party that I'd have a 3-way with them while he watched. There were many other red flags, but the persistent act of embarrassing me in front of everyone to attempt to damage my social standing and professionalism (yes, he even did this to me at my jobs) is what still enrages me."
"Yes, currently I feel it more than I did before. I'm in my late 20s finishing up medical school and from a traditional culture (Muslim and South Asian). I feel like my career and hard work and goals for the world isn't as valued in my South Asian/Muslim community unless I was a man especially when it comes to relationships.  I feel like my age and biological clock dictates the majority of my worth to the community. The guilt of figuring out how to be at home to raise a family vs furthering the career I worked so hard for... I wish I didn't have to pick or be shamed for either choice. In my parents generation and some of my own generation, I've seen the culture expect women to give up their careers to become housewives (including doctor women).  I'm gonna work hard to find my own balance, but with both male and female expectations placed on me by my parents, I found the male role a lot easier for who I am. I'm very low maintenance (so emphasis on looks and looking perfect/proper sucks sometimes), hardworking, and simple minded.  

Also, seeing boys favored over girls in so many countries around the world, seeing the majority of sexual violence against girls, seeing girls be forced to marry as children, seeing women fight for ordinary rights... that really hurts to see. "
"People who are constantly shit talking/negative.

I'm all for venting from time to time but man is it draining to be around someone who hates everyone and everything all. the. time. Also, most people save it for their close friends. If you're like that while we're subpar friends, I can imagine it being waaaay worse and soul sucking."
"Because most people long for that kind of very close and intimate companionship. Everybody wants somebody that they can bond with on the deepest possible level, somebody that they can be vulnerable and show all of themselves to, and the way that we work socially says that that kind of intimacy is only fully available through a romantic relationship."
"My SO told me that he would have no problem breaking up with me if he met a girl who he thought would be better for him. 

I understand what he was trying to say, like he would break up with me before ever cheating on me but the way he said it really stuck with me. It made me insecure and jealous of whatever other girl he was interacting with. He's very particular about who he likes and even girls I know he'd never go for, I still felt that terrible feeling. 

He's no longer my SO. For that and a list of other reasons why I broke up with him. "
"I experienced something similar. My dad had died in a car accident and like most people, I was devastated. About a week after his death I was sitting on the couch and I was sobbing uncontrollably. My boyfriend at the time looked at me and said, ""damn girl, you're acting like you just lost your dad or something."" - followed by laughter.  I broke up with him the same night. "

Current SO knows there is no Magic House Fairy who cleans up his mess and is responsible for it."
"I was manipulated a lot as a teenager, so I've really got my hackles raised a lot higher for ""button pushing"" behavior than others do.  People who brag about cruel behavior (even really benign cruel behavior like ""One time this guy cut me off in traffic so I got in front of him and drove real slow""), people who are passive aggressive, people who give backhanded compliments, I have zero tolerance for it.  I'll be pleasant as punch when we run into eachother, but I absolutely keep my distance socially."
"Cheaping out on many things, but most importantly cheaping out on photographer. A friend with a good camera swore she’s a good photographer. We ended up with like 5 in focus photos.

"I *love* telling this story. It’s not really creepy, just . . . awkward.

So, first thing you need to know is I get migraines with aura. I generally vomit from pain from them, it’s like hard to see sometimes cause light sources have big halos and everything like glows, it’s all p unpleasant.

About two years ago, i’m excitedly getting ready for a tinder date and I start feelings migraine coming. It’s like 45 minutes before the time we set. This dude’s been super pleasant over chat, he has this cute hipster buddy holly look going on, and I swear if anyone ever told *me* “sorry I have a headache” less than an hour before our first date i’d delete their number. So obviously I have to go. Sometimes I can ward off my migraines with caffeine and we’re going to a Thai place, so I rush through finishing dressing for the date and head to the restaurant, because i’ve decided that the solution is to get there early, drink a Thai iced coffee to load up on caffeine, and get this migraine gone before he shows up!!

It doesn’t work. Dude shows up, i keep casually like propping my head up on my hand while we talk so I can press against my temple with my fingers. I am only making one-word responses and positive noises, that is my entire part of the conversation. At two separate points *i leave the table and go puke in the restaurant’s bathroom* and then I come back pretending nothing happened.

I would like to say i’m just an amazing actress, but i’m not. I get called out instantly when I show up to work hungover. Also let me reiterate *I was not speaking in complete sentences this entire dinner*. So this guy was like on a date with a corpse.

**He was so fucking into me**. He kissed me outside the restaurant and I pulled away pretending shyness (I had puke mouth ewwwwwww), have him some line about it being pleasant, and went home to die. *This dude spent three weeks straight trying to get me to go out with him again, he was SO INTO this corpse-woman he went on a date with!!!!* I shared no thoughts, no personal anecdotes, I DID NOTHING THE WHOLE DATE BUT NOD WEAKLY. AND HE WAS INTO THAAAAAAAAT.

I am when not physically impaired what one would call “a broad” in the positive sense. I curse and talk shit and don’t take shit from anyone and have a thought about every fucking thing in the world. This dude would *hate* my actual self. And tbh, I think the fact that he apparently wanted to date someone with no opinions of their own is probably why he was single.

TLDR; I went on a date with a debillitating migraine and my date was into that. "

"Okay so in mine *I* am the lie.

I, for multiple years, told vegan and vegetarian friends that my pies were fine. I mean, i almost never make cream pies, so it’s always just fruit fillings!!!

For some absurd reason, I managed to genuinely forget for multiple years that *lard is meatfat*. THEY AREN’T EVEN VEGETARIAN.

Oh and once I fed a vegan mayonnaise cake. They assumed I used fake mayonnaise. I also assumed I had used fake mayonnaise because I BOUGHT SOME JUST TO MAKE A DAMN VEGAN CAKE. Nope, used the wrong mayonnaise."
"I know it's not necessarily realistic for everyone, but living alone. No SO. No roommates. No family. 

If you can afford it, DO IT, even if just for a year. It's freeing to only worry about yourself, never have to be agitated because somebody else left dishes in the sink or ate your leftovers. You can spend your free time doing whatever you want without interference or compromise. You learn a lot about yourself and your own personal preferences. 

I happily live with my SO and our dog now, but I have very fond memories of my solo year in my tiny apartment. "
"So, I had been out of the dating game for roughly a year, and being the awkward mess that I am, my best friend had convinced me to try out okcupid. Figured, eh I can get to know people online and then try a date.

Terrible idea. I’m still mad at her.

So, I meet this guy on the site, and we spend a few weeks chatting and getting to know each other, and he seems really cool. He asked me on a date, and I said sure. Here’s the part where I’m a moron and am surprised I didn’t get murdered.

I say I prefer low key dates, so he suggests that he cook us dinner and we watch indie horror films at his place. I agree! ( I am so stupid)

I show up to his place, and have developed a code word system through text with my bestie, and she has all the details of where I am. He meets me outside, and I realize I tower over him. At 5’7” that rarely happens to me, but I shrug it off, can’t help your height right?

We go up to his flat and he shows me around, emphasizing on the bedroom. Then takes me to the kitchen to show me the four bottles of very expensive wine he bought for me....and no dinner prepared. He pours me a glass, and I awkwardly pet his dog.

We sit on the couch and he puts on this weird Italian art film; no subtitles, in all Italian, neither of us know what is happening. So I just sit there, feet flat on the ground, spine rod-straight, sipping my wine, when he decides to basically curl up in my lap. And he starts nuzzling my face. Like that thing cats do. But with his face on my face, for at least ten straight minutes. His dogs looks at me with pity. At this point, I excuse myself to the bathroom and text the bestie to call me and get me out of there.

After taking her call 20 minutes later, I politely try and thank him for the glass of wine and make my way off the couch, and he lays across me and force cuddles me. Wouldn’t let me leave, so I just...stood up, and he plummets to the floor. Because like I said, I am an Amazonian compared to him.

He pops up off the floor to help me put my coat on, and gives me one good sniff right at the nape of my neck. Pretty sure some of my hair is still infused to his brain from how deep an inhale that was.

I made no attempt to hide my running down the three flights of stairs and up the block to my car.

Deleted my account that night. Never again."
"Not having my hair/makeup done. It was a 9am wedding and I didn't opt to pay someone to handle this for me, so my makeup was basic and my hair was limp. I guess I could have done hair myself but... 9am wedding. Nah.

"I currently live back in my (Asian) home country so my media *is* mostly Asian people, but I'm more of a Hollywood/Western media follower myself and here are my jumbled thoughts:

* I generally feel unheard. I'm an Indonesian-Chinese with a very Chinese family yet a Westernised mind (my friends jokingly call me a ""banana"": yellow on the outside, white on the inside), and I don't often see my stories, my values, my thoughts on mainstream media.
* Would love to see more shows/movies where one of the protagonists is an Asian woman tbh. Elementary/Fresh Off the Boat did this and I appreciate that, but I'd love more.
* Huge fan of The Bachelor franchise. Craving to see an Asian woman take centre stage as the Bachelorette, but probably won't happen any time soon. 
* I know The Joy Luck Club has its fair share of criticism but I actually love it and I thought it was pretty damn accurate/representative of my own experiences as an Asian woman with a very traditional mother. 
* I'm not sure where I'm going with this but there's a huge difference between Asian-Americans and Asian-Asians and I don't often see this acknowledged. 
* Still feel like there's a tendency to lump people from any kind of Asian culture as just ""Asian"", even though culturally speaking there can be huge differences between Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, etc. 
* Would also love to see shows where an Asian protagonist struggles with reconciling her cultural identity with the society she lives in, balancing the expectations of her parents vs. her own, etc. A show like this might get criticised for focusing too much on her ""Asian-ness"" (i.e. an othering effect, perhaps) but it's an issue I've struggled with and still sometimes do. 

Edited for clarity and to add more thoughts. "
"This guy made plans with me then kept saying he was too tired to meet up. I said ok well let's not hang out. He says he genuinely wants to go and I mention that he would put effort into meeting up if he was truly interested. Fast forward an hour or so and he admits that he wants to go but can't afford it. We were going to the beach. All he would need was $5.50 for a metrocard both ways. He said he didn't have that much. I'm surprised, but agree to go somewhere else and pay for the metrocard (whatever, I have a stable income). So the day is meh bc he's pouting at and criticizing me for buying a giant water and frozen yogurt in 90° weather. Then we get to a bookstore and I'm deciding how I feel about this comedy novel and he randomly blurts out: YA KNOW, MY PULLOUT GAME IS ON POINT. What a scrub. 

That was in June. In October, I was on the train and saw him toting huge shopping bags while walking with an exhausted looking girl. He introduces her and mentions that he met her one day by skating by her and yelling ""HEY SEXY IN THE YELLOW DRESSSSS!"""

That one, a guy I've been friends with for almost 8 years, has always been a little awkward &amp; is now convinced that everything is sexual harassment or assault, and is ""Terrified"" (not really, but he says he is) to interact with women for fear of being accused of one or the other. Again, been around this guy for nearly 8 years, and we've hooked up a time or two, and he's never once done a single thing that could be interpreted as assault or harassment to me... so clearly, he KNOWS how to act appropriately around women, and I have no idea exactly what has him so worried."

"His alcoholism. I don’t care if you drink every day, but don’t get drunk every day. Don’t drink until you’re non-functional. Don’t drink until you slur insults at the person you say you love. Don’t make that person responsible for cutting you off, and then get mad at them when they tell you it’s time. Don’t become violent and blame it on being drunk. And when you know what person is at their limit wth your drinking, don’t try feebly to hide it.

He played video games and drank until drunk *every* night.  He then would try to hide it before I got home, but not very well. And when he ran out of beers he would drink the liquor straight. I gave him every chance to curb the habit, until I could no longer see the guy I loved inside the shell of the alcoholic I was afraid of. "

He thought the difference was in hemline - if it's short, it's a skirt. If it's long, it's a dress."
"He spent the whole time lecturing me about everything he thought I was doing wrong with my life.

Things he thought I was doing wrong with my life included: using a computer that doesn't have the absolute top of the line specs currently available, owning more than one pair of shoes, buying the same shirt in multiple colours, drinking beer (and our date was at a beer fest! no idea why he agreed to that), having gone to public school, caring about the availability of birth control as a political issue (even though dude said he was childfree), having used programming languages other than the one he thinks is optimal, not being a programmer by profession, carrying a purse, having things in my purse that I didn't end up needing during the course of the date, not having a charger that fit his phone in my purse, eating things that aren't 100% pure protein from time to time, and having a chip in my nail polish."
"He wasn’t what I expected. I’m a pretty nerdy girl who works in science. So,before him, I had only dated other people in science and engineering since that was who I had things in common with. He was a pretty stereotypical former frat bro from the US South who worked in sales and now finance. 

We met online and he showed up in a polo shirt, khaki shorts, and boat shoes, wearing a huge class ring. I remember thinking, *Well, this will be interesting...* But it turned out we had insane chemistry and talked that night for 4 hours until the restaurant closed down at 1am. 

Still half-expected him to ghost after I declined his invitation to come back to his place to “share a bottle of wine” right after.  But he kept coming back.

I waited over a month until we were exclusive to finally sleep with him, bracing myself for him to duck out once he thought I wouldn’t put out. He stuck it out and we continued to have the best time. 

And what I really love about him 7-8 months later is how he encourages me to be the best I can be. Truly. All those other more “intellectual” nerdy, high-achieving guys *said* they wanted the same in a girlfriend. But when it came down to it, they wound up feeling competitive with me or expecting all my aspirations to take a backseat to theirs. 

This is the first time I’ve felt my partner genuinely wants me to be more successful than him if I’m able. He’s encouraged me to take opportunities that take me away from him or may strain our relationship, but he finds a way to make it work. He has an uncanny ability to make me totally relax and tune out all my life’s stress when I’m with him. I love his ability to live in the moment and I think we both want to be more like each other in a lot of ways, which makes us appreciate our differences. 

But he still defies every image of what I imagined my perfect match would be. "
"The fact that I never have to tread on eggshells around him and don't have to worry about finding him passed out drunk in various places around the house are good things. The fact that he's never tried to physically block or restrain me from leaving an argument is also great.

Weirdly, the ex probably did a lot worse things to me than this, but the thing I am MOST relieved to not have to deal with with my current boyfriend is not having him shut down and refuse to talk to me (while I'm sitting right next to him) for hours at a time all the while having to guess what pissed him off and what I should do to make it better."

"The night after the election, I spoke with one of my dearest, oldest friends. I was still a bit in shock about the results and we had always been incredibly careful not to let politics interfere in our friendship. (She is far more conservative than I)  She brought it up, she was also in a bit of shock, and we tentively discussed it. 

She said she voted for Trump (gagging the whole time) because she couldn’t stand Clinton and didn’t want 4 more years of the same policies of the previous 8.  Everything was still too raw and I cherish her even if I don’t agree with her politically.  — But the question I really, really wanted to ask (but couldn’t because I was afraid to hear the answer) was “ What on earth was so terrible about the last 8 years?”

I have often wondered whether she regrets that vote but i would never ask her. No good would come from any answer she would give. I do think that she voted for him because she never thought he would win and just couldn’t vote for Clinton under any circumstances. 

Meanwhile, I’ve been snorkeling in red wine for the last year while reeling from the constant barrage of Breaking News/Tweet alerts

Edit to add: I discuss politics with other friends on all ends of the political spectrum but most of those friends who voted for him would stick by him no matter what he did. So his statement that he could shoot someone inTimes Square and not lose their vote was pretty accurate."

Republicians blocked a movement by Dems to pay the troops during the government shutdown.


What makes him pro military?

"I quietly swallowed all of my opinions when every guy in my office (I’m one of 2 girls in the whole office) was going on and on about how out of hand sexual assault allegations are getting, and they were saying how immature and power hungry grace was from the aziz story. I started to say I think it’s a lot more complicated than that and was talked over by all their angry voices so now I’m just quietly stewing. "

"I told my boyfriend the other day that I was so lucky I had never beed raped. I then told him about how while in college, I had multiple friends who had been raped and it was terrible how common it was. He then said something along the lines of ‘okay, but how many of those were soft rapes?’ I got the impression he felt most rapes were not real rapes if they weren’t raped by strangers and if they weren’t shoved to the floor /violent rapes "
"We should have eloped.  The wedding was fine, BUT all the drama involved and dealing with two sides of very unreasonable parents is still a vivid part of my memory of my wedding.  My mil also did and said some really nasty things the day of my wedding. We should have just eloped and made it a private moment.  My parents and mil were the bridezillas, they were horrible."
"Ever since I've known him, my husband has kept up an unending narration of everything he does under his breath. He'll clear the table or put the dishes away or put food out for the cats, all the while mumbling to himself about what he's doing. The best thing about that is both that he does it, which I find very sweet, and also that his narration is always in Irish, in the thickest and most foul accent he can muster. My Irish is tolerable but I don't totally get his particular dialect yet so when he wants to address me, he interrupts his narration, turns his attention to me and speaks Irish in the clearest, most standard way he knows how so I'll understand. 

It's a small thing but probably the sweetest anyone's ever been to me and I'm fully enamoured with it."
"So, so many people in grad school. It was like a breeding ground for faux-woke-ness and ""who can be the most open-minded, but then only associate with people exactly like them"" contest. Many supported a woman's right to make her own reproductive choices, but called our colleague (with 5 kids) some very, very rude names, like ""mindless breeding machine"" and said things like ""what's the point of going to school, then?!"" I took a Health Law &amp; Regulation class, with 2 actual certified doctors, and one of my classmates got so offended by their experiences, that they actually left the class that day, yet were just yammering on right before that about how ""everyone's experience is valid""

The double standards and hypocrisy in grad school was something else. It taught me how to discuss things with people that I share 0 in common with, and I'm grateful for that, but some were just so stuck in their own bubble, yet claimed that they were ""open minded"" "

"&gt; I don't hang out with men who do it either.

This is a conversation I’ve had with a few men in my life, but please don’t be so sure about this. I totally understand why we believe this - for the same reasons we believe our friends aren’t domestic abusers, or why mass shooters’ neighbors usually say things like “he seemed like such a nice guy,” or why we don’t believe people we know do any number of other ethically reprehensible things. We know aspects of their personality, and we’d feel disturbed and unsafe ourselves if we thought of people we know as “bad” people. 

Unfortunately, we’re not always right, and sexual harassment and assault are widespread enough that we’re pretty frequently not right. The people who do these things don’t have two heads. The huge majority of them are regular folks who pay their taxes and say please and thank you. The people I know for an absolute fact do this shit _because they did it to me or in front of me_ were perfectly nice people in everyday life. Most of them don’t act like creeps or monsters. They’re smart and friendly and helpful and productive, and oh yeah, they also molest teenagers or harass grown women or assault the incapacitated. 

In fact, it’s hardly a coincidence that publicized cases are so often folks like religious community leaders, teachers, and other people in positions of power. Their standing in their community gives them a level of freedom to do this shit. They know the teenager/starlet/less powerful person whose trust they violated will have trouble being heard and believed. 

People like you and me, people who are our friends and teachers and role models, do some awful shit. Some of them make mistakes they never repeat. Some of them are totally aware of what they’re doing. But the huge, huge majority of them are totally functional, regular people. If someone comes forward about these types of incidents, I would encourage everyone to be extremely careful concluding that they must be lying because “I know the guy and he’d never do something like that.” Everyone has sides they don’t show their friends. Women aren’t the only ones who don’t always tell you about their experiences with assault and harassment. "
When I learned it wasn't illegal to drive with the lights on in the car
"I was also raised to date only Christians and I think it's terrible that some churches will put a profession of Christian faith over actually demonstrating a Christian life when it comes to ""eligibility"" as far as marriage material. I also in my early life turned down a lot of very nice guys because they weren't ""Christian enough"" even if they were Christian but not the ""go to church 5 times a week"" Christian type like I was. I left that church and go to a church that's the once a week type and my husband goes with me occasionally but I never push him to come."
"I had 3 doozies in a row.  The first seemed pretty decent and if he had just stuck with beer he probably would have been fine.  But, I’m a whiskey drinker and he opted to join me.  He got wasted and confessed he was 1. Looking for an older woman to take care of him financially.  2. A very sensual lover (shouted slurringly in my ear) much to the amusement of the people next to us.  3. Desperate to have children very soon.  Weird.  
The second guy took me to a party and sort of ditched me with a group of his friends who were very nice and all poly.  I learned quite a bit about their lifestyles which was interesting.  But, every time I glanced up he was watching me intently, but like hiding behind posts and creeping around corners.  When I finally approached to say goodnight after having had zero interaction with him, he launched into this thing about needed to be sure I would be down with his lifestyle.  He was just odd, that one.  
The last one unfortunately got fired that day and really should have cancelled.  When he found out my job (sucking the corporate American teat all the way to the bank) he just lost his shit.  I mean, I would have been insulted, but it was also amazing to see someone completely break with all social norms and just spew every insecurity for the whole pub to witness.  I paid his tab and scooted out of there.  I felt really bad for that guy.  "
My ex spelled my name wrong on the intake form for our too-little-too-late couples counselling session. We had known each other ten years. 
Make sure my human skin is still securely attached. Surprisingly hard to get it to stick to scales. 
"I had an ex that I had dated for four years and broken up with only a month before she got date raped. (Weed + Benzos + Speed, some of which she wasn't told about.) She described what happened, but refused to call it that. She didn't recognize, or didn't want to admit that it was sexual assault until I pointed it out.

I picked her up from _his_ place, took her home, spent the entire evening listening and comforting her, told her to go to the police, and then proceeded to tell every single other guy that both him and me knew what he did (after making sure my ex was fine with me discussing it), that it was rape, and that if they didn't immediately agree with me on that I had no interest in ever talking to them again. I wanted to make sure that everyone around him knew what he did.

It made every single one of our mutual friends uncomfortable, but I wasn't going to let it be ignored. He got excommunicated, and my ex decided she didn't want to go to the police.

I know it's common, it makes me uncomfortable when guys around me do it, and I tell them that. This social conversation and bringing to light that's happening hasn't surprised me in how _common_ it is. I have been surprised with how systematically some of these people were protected from the consequences, but I suppose I shouldn't have been considering how racist American drug laws are, how few women are in positions of leadership, and so on.

Me having that one moment where I wouldn't allow any of my male friends to ""not pick a side"" fundamentally changed how my entire group of friends viewed sexual assault. Basically every single one of them now is very sensitive and open to the discussion, and several are intersectional feminists.

That's perhaps the lesson of this whole thing that many guys are missing, and that many women aren't communicating. It's not enough for you to not actively sexually assault people. Learn how to recognize it, and call the other fucking guys around you out on it when you see it. Stops that shit cold. It's fucking stupid, but I've been in situations where the girl was clearly communicating her discomfort and displeasure and the guy just kept doing what he was doing. However, as soon as I spoke up, even just one sentence sometimes, it's like a deer in the headlights, and they just stop.

Is it any surprise that guys who engage in sexual assault don't listen to women's opinions as carefully or as earnestly? Having another guy there to help can sometimes genuinely save lives, because the abuser doesn't automatically dismiss the opinion of another guy. It actually stops them and forces them to think. But guys need to speak up for that to happen. 

The campaign after this should be #MeThree or something. Stories of guys who recognized sexual assault happening and intervened. A lot of guys need to have some kind of role model for that behavior, because it's not talked about or modeled at all, except maybe as the caricature of white knighting."
"Absolutely. As an ugly woman, I'm barely even considered a woman to begin with. Ugly men tend to have mitigating factors - ambition, confidence, humor, wealth, intelligence - that don't rate the same way in women. On top of that, I really despise being so physically weak. I could spend every day in the gym and still be weaker than the average man. That probably bothers me the most. "
"I think that's totally normal! It's like being pro-choice, but knowing that  you personally wouldn't ever want an abortion. I think it's great that you separate your personal wishes from your social views. Good luck!"
"I thought I would have everything by now. I always worked so hard in school. I always followed the rules. My grades were my life. Volunteering was my life. I had no time for friends or enjoying my teenage years. For some reason I thought that would mean I would get my dream job and dream house by 25. Bahahahaha!
I highly regret it. "
"People having any kind of comment about what or how much of something I am eating. If it's a salad I get ""Oh salad? Is your boyfriend making you go on a diet?"" or ""That's all you're eating?"" If I'm eating an entire pizza (whether Newman's Own or Domino's doesn't matter) I get ""Are you going to eat ALL THAT???"" and ""How do you fit all that?!?"" If I'm opting out of eating during a lunch-provided meeting at work, I get ""ARE YOU SURE you don't even want a bag of chips? It's not that many calories!"" (assuming it's a diet thing, once again) or ""C'mon, live a little"" (dangling a packaged cookie). 
 
I mean obviously their comments don't matter and if I want to eat a whole damn pizza and join the Ninja Turtles that's my own business, but it's just mind-boggling how often people give a shit about what someone else is eating. Unless it's poison or you think what I'm eating looks fucking delicious, don't say anything. "
"He was a pathological liar.  Dude lied about everything: What happened at work, things he had told mutual friends, his past ex's, if he had paid the cable bill, what the name of a mountain in the distance was - so even little doesn't matter stuff he lied about. I could catch him red handed in a lie with concrete evidence, and he still would't fess up to the lie.  It was bizarre because he was a nice guy. He was loving and took good care of me and my kids.  I decided his lying was a coping mechanism from childhood trauma he had suffered. I thought I could deal with the lies because the rest of our relationship was good. But I couldn't trust anything that came out of his mouth. And if you can't trust someone, it will erode away the foundation of the relationship. "
I feel like red flag might be too light a term for that one.
"&gt; ‘okay, but how many of those were soft rapes?’

That would be instant rage and almost certainly the end of that relationship for me. I do not trust my personal safety around people who think that way."
"Religious upbringing, he was so deep in the closet he was practically in Narnia. Poor dear."
"In my ""atypical dealbreakers"" response to the other thread, I said ""tall"".

I briefly dated someone who was 6'4, intent on ignoring what I thought was a ""silly"" dealbreaker to have. Then one day, sick of bending to kiss me goodbye, he lifted me effortlessly onto a chair so I was at his height and kissed me.

And that was the end of that, unfortunately. I absolutely cannot stand to feel small. "
"real bad, and given those circumstance, i would say no. "
I love how aware and angry they are. There seem to be so many more outspoken young women now compared to when I was younger.
"Oh I'm cringing about this.

I was 14, and a beautiful boy was enamoured with me. We lived over an hour apart but travelled every day to each other. It was good, pure, and darling. He made me a ring in metal works class, I wrote him a letter every day (often finding source material from poetry or my charming and hilarious best friend's letters to her boyfriend). We were adorable.

One day he met me at the door and asked me to never contact him again. As an afterthought he passed me the box of letters and said, ""I think you should keep these,"" before closing the door in my face. He left our youth group, changed his number. Word was that I was crazy, and I was so baffled. 

At 30 I'm sitting with my memory box looking at tokens of a youth gone by when I find a letter I wrote him. 

""We are meant to be together. If you left me I would find you. You'd never get away because it's you and I for life. We should have kids. And soon like the moment we get a job.."" etc. 

Remember aforementioned charming and hilarious friend? Iiiiii didn't know she sent these insane letters to her boyfriend as a joke between them. I saw that she had a great relationship and was always so good with boys and just blindly copied. The letters contained direct rip offs of her nonsensical jokes like writing I love you and scribbling it out with the words SNAT SNAT SNAT all over the page in ham fisted aggression. 

I looked completely fucking insane no wonder he broke up with me. That poor boy lol. 
Ugh. The cringe.

"I had to explain to my SO that I still had to pay rent, even for the week I was visiting my parents. I guess he just thought it worked like a hotel, so that if I wasn't physically present, I could pay less in rent and have more spending money! I wish :( "
"I know what I'm talking about and what I need when I go to a mechanic. I visit a mechanic for jobs that make me all, ""fuck that"". Usually, I do things myself. 

The last time I paid someone to change my oil, the tech tried telling me my radiator was bad (it was new) and needed to be flushed (I had done that the day prior) and he'd do it for x dollars and by the way, did I know what the radiator does? I asked him why he thought my new, freshly-flushed radiator had a problem and he couldn't answer me. Then he tried the ""dirty air filter"" trick. Air filter was new, too. And the stained filter he tried to pass off as mine wasn't even the right one for that truck.

I never went to Valvoline again. "
"I never worry that my husband is cheating on me. My ex cheated with a coworker for over a year, and gaslighted me about it the whole time. (They have two kids now.) After we broke up, I genuinely feared I'd never be able to trust a man again. But all that went out the window when I met my husband- he is so honest and loving, and makes me feel so secure.  "
"""You are X for a girl.""

"I'm 27 and I still mentally think of myself and my female peers as ""girls"" and my male peers as ""guys"" or even ""boys."" The terms ""men"" and ""women"" don't start clicking for me unless I'm thinking of or referring to someone who is older than me. I expected the bar wouldn't raise as I got older...but it did. 27-year-old women were definitely ""women"" to 18-year-old me, but now that they're my peer group I see them as my equal. 

In contrast with some folks, I don't see ""girl"" as a diminutive though, unless used by a man in certain contexts. "

"Similar to what has been said by others here, I’m sex-positive, support comprehensive sex Ed and I’m abstaining for religious reasons. Modern dating is app-based and I use them too despise having different lifestyle choices from many of the users on the apps. I would recommend Coffee Meets Bagel over the other apps that may have more of a hook up focused user base. 

I bring up my life style choice to not have sex until I am married one the first date. Most guys know I’m religious before then and they are Christian too (listed in their dating profile or they have said it to me), but it is always best to clarify, because some people do not practice this aspect of Christianity. 

I have never felt pressured to have sex while in a relationship because I have been in relationships with people who are also onboard the abstaining boat. 

I set physical boundaries and stop physical touch when I feel it’s no longer comfortable. 

For me, abstaining is not hard because the will power is there. For me it is hard because only about 1% of men ages 23-28 seem to be truly onboard with it.  Once you find men that are supportive, it is easy if you communicate boundaries. "

"Man, I deactivated my FB a little over a year ago (basically right after Trump was elected...I'd been debating it for a while), and I'm SO FUCKING GLAD I did.

I do still have Instagram because I like to post nature / cat photos every now and then, but that's it for me."
"My ex. He was, on surface, a liberal, ""woke"" guy: professed to be a feminist, strong socialist views, atheist, etc. But really, he was a crazy True Believer, just from the other side. He thought that everyone should agree with him and in his ideal world those who did not agree should be kicked out of the country/purged/etc. He genuinely felt he knew what was best for everyone, and everyone should get on board or GTFO. 

Towards the end of our relationship, he started to turn in some concerning ways. He was a strong Bernie supporter, and after Hillary won the Dem primary he felt like Trump was a better option because he would disrupt the system and Hillary was a liar and a tool of the capitalist class and so  on. 

But for me the real dealbreaker came when I discovered that despite his professed feminism, he actually held really misogynistic views. He hated children, and felt that mothers and their children should not be allowed in public until the kids were teens. He said he envied women because we could just ""ride the cock carousel"" and use men for their money. He once said he half wished he'd been born a woman so he could use sex to manipulate men and not have to work and just have everything handed to him. 

When I expressed those views were perhaps not appropriate, he got upset that my feminism was ""too radical"" and he was disappointed I had not outgrown it. "
"I have a friend who acted like this for awhile. He would openly share every detail of his sex life with me, which is fine, I didn't mind. But anytime I would mention anything (didn't even go into as much detail as he did) about what my husband and I did, and mention anything about my vagina, I got ""That's gross"" and exaggerated grossed out noises. I got fed up and waited for him to talk about another conquest, and when he got to the gay anal sex part I said ""That is so gross."" He got so mad at me, until I pointed out he does it to me all. the. time. Like I get it, I'm fine with you being gay, it means nothing to me, I'm not going to call you or what you do gross. But kindly give me the same courtesy; just because you don't find vaginas attractive doesn't mean mine is ""gross."""

"I'm a bit late to the party, but I used to work at a place where the owners were a married gay liberal male couple. They boasted about how they thought women should have more power, how they were super inclusive because they hired latinos, etc.

They also constantly made racist jokes (if one of the latina employees mentioned she had gone out for dinner, he'd ask ""Did you go to Taco Bell?""; he'd also make a point of how her sister was a baby factory; one of them would also complain specifically about black homeless people and how they behaved vs whites on a weekly basis), were pretty bad towards female employees (I distinctly remember one time he started complaining about what a girl was wearing because it showed she had some back hair; they also liked to touch the female employees (ass slap, hug, etc.) and claim it wasn't sexual harassment) and hated Jewish people. I pointed out these quite a few times, only to be met with answers similar to ""But I'm gay and liberal, I'm not racist""."

"I spoke to a lot of pastors when I began losing my religion, hoping to rekindle my faith and resolve my growing unease with biblical ethics.

I was a pre-teen and actually got banned from a Christian forum for being an ""atheist troll"" for just asking questions."

"I'd react by walking away. No fucking thank you. 

- How would you know the person chose to hit ""I consent""? If someone wanted to hurt me, why couldn't they also force me to unlock my phone and hit that button themselves?
- Consent can be withdrawn at any time during a sexual encounter
- Who says what they are consenting to? ""I consent"" could mean anything. I could consent to a sensual massage and oral sex but not a dick forced in my ass.
- people who are heavily intoxicated (and can't consent) can likely still figure out how to unlock their phone (or could unlock it for someone else) to consent on the app.

Not to mention the type of people who would want to use it. Like you need it in writing that I'm consenting to whatever it is you're wanting to do? The red flag can't get much bigger."
"Not an apology, but my first (physically abusive) husband found out I was in my hometown and called me at my parents' house.  I answered the phone; he asked for me; I asked who was calling; he gave his first name -- had no idea who it was; so he gave his full name.  I said, ""Why the f*** are you calling me?""  For some unknown reason he thought I would be interested in going out with him while I was in my hometown.  I said, ""You can't be serious.  Do you remember hitting me and all the abuse?""  His response, ""Oh, I thought you would let bygones be bygones.""  I said, ""No.  Don't ever contact me again.""  Hung-up.  

I personally think it is the rare abuser who reforms and is truly remorseful.  They have some serious control issues without the abuse.  "
"I work in research. One study that I worked on involved visiting at-risk adolescents in their homes. They lived in very impoverished areas. It really opened my eyes on *how* impoverished those areas are and helped me realize that some people who live there are trying their best to better themselves but face so much adversity.

Basically, I now get pretty defensive when I hear people say ""oh, why don't they just move?"" or ""everyone in those areas are gangbangers, thugs, and drug addicts"". Yes, of course those people exist but there are many others that work so extremely hard to get out of that situation but it is hard to climb out of poverty.

There are so many single parents who work so hard to feed their families all while trying to better themselves and their situation by attending college, living in very poor conditions in order to save up money to move away, etc.

I feel like I can't even describe it properly. Basically, prior to this study, I just didn't have a real grasp on poverty in my city. Many of my friends and family don't either and they won't be able to fully understand until they immerse themselves in it."
"Expecting a gold medal for basic human decency. Holding open the door is a nice gesture, sure. But expecting me to worship at your feet for it is overkill buddy. No, you're not the only good guy out there. I'm not enormously impressed yet.

"&gt; Lack of adequate parental leave in a lot of countries

I agree and would expand it even more to lack of adequate guaranteed leave of any kind. Most of the countries that the US considers themselves equivalent to offer significantly greater amounts of guaranteed parental leave, personal leave, health leave, bereavement leave, etc. The US lags extremely far behind in standardizing any sort of expectations for US workers' rights to leave time."
Being a lesbian. Works great so far
"I'm going to be a bit controversial here and say.... stay at home moms. There is nothing wrong with having a parent stay home, I understand that. Childcare is crazy expensive and sometimes it just makes the most sense for a parent to stay home. But the part that is regressive to me is how our culture kind of idealizes the stay at home MOM. Why is it never the dad that stays home? And why the pressure to stay home? A woman in her 20s or 30s only has to log onto Facebook for a few minutes to find tons of quotes and memes about stay at home motherhood being posted by her peers. Why are the dads not doing something similar? Why are our careers and our incomes, as women, considered disposable the moment we have a child? And that is culturally acceptable and even encouraged. It's like we STILL expect women to make these huge sacrifices for their children in order to view them as ""good moms"" but we don't expect that from the dad which is really unfair.  I guess this extends to gendered parenting roles, in general. A woman's children are so often the foundation of her being, she gives and gives and gives, foregoing her career and her financial independence, her own interests and hobbies, her social life, and often even the romance in her marriage, to give her children this perfect life, and our society applauds her as a great parent. But the expectation for that level of sacrifice just doesn't exist for fathers, at all."

"I used to think that a potential partner being overweight would be a dealbreaker for me. I am now in a relationship with someone who is, and it turns out that I'm a less shitty person than I thought I was! I'm still really attracted to him, and love him to death. If anything, the extra weight just makes him better to cuddle with :)"
"&gt; But the question I really, really wanted to ask (but couldn’t because I was afraid to hear the answer) was “ What on earth was so terrible about the last 8 years?”

This is what I can't understand about everyone who complains about how ""bad"" Obama was. How many of them were actually worse off in 2016 than they were in 2008????"

"Stereotypically speaking, women from my region of China are supposedly loud, bossy, and rather unfeminine. I always have a good chuckle when people expect the opposite. A few people who are actually interested are usually amazed (then followed by a “duh”) to learn a huge country like China actually have vastly different cultures within. "
"I get irrationally angry when people spell their children’s names weird on purpose. Like I know someone who named their baby girl “Mason” (which I thought was a boys name?) but they spelled it “Maesyn”. Like the stupid “y” as a vowel thing really irritates me. 

Edit: I understand the y as a vowel thing in like old Gaelic or something but that spelling isn’t an old Gaelic name. "
"Faking confidence. I was super awkward and insecure throughout high school and most of college, until I made the conscious decision to pretend I wasn't. Soon enough, it came naturally and I no longer felt like I lacked basic social skills.

"I’ve answered this question once before I believe but it’s still worth telling. In 1 date and a span of maybe 2 hours, this man -without any prompting, mind you- admitted to his diaper fetish, tried to show me pictures of himself in a dirty diaper on his phone,  told me he wanted me to pee on him, made fun of his ex for being my weight (to the exact pound!!!), and by the end started talking about, “when we live together.”
I definitely nope’d the fuck out of there quicker than ever before. I probably shouldn’t have ghosted him but I never asked him to spill all that stuff to me and it was too overwhelming. I feel like it was nicer than kink shaming him?🤷🏻‍♀️
He’s considered only as “Diaper Boy” by my ruthless friends and still dodges me every time he sees me in public. "

"Sometimes people are able to be friends with their exes. I talk to a couple of mine once in a while, so does my boyfriend. Most of our relationships didn’t really end badly, we just realized they weren’t what we wanted, or we just didn’t fit with the person we were trying to fit with. Nothing wrong in keeping contact with a cool person that you just don’t mesh well romantically with."

"Yes. Dated a minor tv/film celebrity for four years. The income disparity was frustrating (I felt constantly broke around them). They didn’t live on my plane of reality and were very entitled due to being born into wealth. Rude or thoughtless to people around them sometimes.

Had no concept of working for a living. Grew frustrated that I couldn’t just take off work for two months to jaunt around the world with them. Didn’t understand my limited number of vacation days. 

Couldn’t empathize when I was stressed from making ends meet (they’ve never had to budget) or tired from cleaning my house all day (because they had nannies and maids). Used money to express love and couldn’t grasp why jewelry didn’t make me feel better when my dad had a stroke. 

Basically a shit relationship. Outside that we had a lot in common and had fun but the bad points slowly outweighed the good once the honeymoon phase was over. Realized I much prefer someone down to earth and within my tax bracket."

"I didn't really want a wedding.  I wanted to be married, but I hate being the center of attention so I didn't want an actual wedding.  My mother talked me into a small thing with close friends and family in the park and then a restaurant afterwards.  It wasn't terrible, but I wish I had either stuck to my guns and not done anything, or I had gone a slightly more traditional route with invitations, gift registry, and just more formal planning in general.  As it was, I still had way too much planning stress and time spent with my mother, but didn't get any presents in return for that.  If you're going to do it you should fully commit to the whole idea.   "
"This is fantastic advice. You'd be amazed at what you can find at thrift stores near upper-class neighborhoods/towns. it might be more of a drive but it's usually worth it. I've gotten formal dresses ( many with tags still on them) for pennies on the dollar. I got a $1250 gown for $10 that was brand new and still had the tags. I've gotten fur coats for $15, a limited edition Gucci bag for $5, and more. 

I have a friend who actually turned her high-end thrifting into a business where she helps homeless, abused, and underprivileged women get into nice clothing in order to get jobs and succeed in life. She runs a shelter, 2 shops, and a full charity now as a result. She travels all over thrifting for her shops and charity events. Everything she buys is high-end brands. "
when's the wedding?
"A little black dress.

Or basically, a versatile outfit you can dress up, dress down, go out in, and feel radiant in. That’s the idea behind the LBD, whatever it may be to you. "
"That I didn't really have one.

I was pregnant and our families were freaking the fuck out and pressuring us to hurry up.  We had been together a while and marriage was in future plans, but we weren't ready.  We eventually just gave in and let them having their wedding so they would shut up.

My mom and grandmother pretty much took over.  They planned the shower and the ""wedding.""  

I wanted it to be outside during the day.  It ended up being inside my grandmother's house at night.  

My mom picked out my cake and registered me for a china pattern I didn't want.

I didn't have a real wedding dress.  It was just a cheap maternity dress (I was 7 months along at this point).  I didn't want to wear shoes, but they threw a fit because ""barefoot and pregnant"" would be too embarrassing.  I wore stupid shoes.

It was family only.  No friends.  The justice of the peace was a nice guy, but he screwed up the vows...rushed through them so quickly.  It was stupid and slightly embarrassing.

All and all, it was ok.  It wasn't horrible.  There was food and gifts and family.  But it wasn't a wedding.  At the time, I didn't care.  It didn't change anything.  We were together and they got to put on their show.  We didn't even have a honeymoon.  We just went back to our place after and put away our wedding gifts.

However, as the years have gone by (we've been married 20+ years now), I've felt like I missed out on something by not having *our* wedding.  My husband and I sometimes talk about throwing ourselves a real wedding.  My husband likes to joke that we should run off the Vegas and get married by Elvis (um...no).  I don't think it will ever really happen though.  "
 I'm sorry that sucks but this one made me laugh.

I don't think it's shitty to not date someone because of their weight. Sexual attraction is important. 
"I have frequent nightmares and sometimes I wake up to him rubbing my arm or something similar. Once I asked him about it, and he told me 1) that he just wakes up when my body tenses up next to him and pets me to soothe me, and 2) usually I don't wake up although it's not unusual for him to have to soothe me several times a night. I asked if it messed with his sleep at all and he responded, ""I'd sleep terribly if I knew you were stressed and didn't do anything about it."" 

He also does dishes. I'm going to ask him to marry me next year if he doesn't beat me to it. 😊"

"For the love of God, *be prepared for security.* Have your laptop out and ready. If you have liquids, have those in a clear plastic bag ready for inspection. Look up the amount restrictions beforehand. Wear shoes it's easy to take off/put back on. Don't wear clothes/jewelry that will set off the alarm and check your pockets befo're you go through. After you're cleared, grab your stuff and move away from the conveyor belt if possible to put it back in your bag so you're out of people's way. Carry a bag it's easy to put things into/take things out of and take the airline's carry on size restrictions seriously. Your day will go more smoothly and so will the days of the people waiting in line behind you. 

Also, bring snacks and buy a bottle of water once you get to the other side of security. The ones they sell on the plane are super expensive and not very good. Don't eat a lot of heavy, greasy or sugary food before your flight. Travel makes me super bloated and eating poorly before/on the airplane makes it twice as bad. "

"Dating/marrying: someone who thinks vacation involves sleeping in a tent in the woods. It’s my idea of hell. It may be ok if they absolutely never expect me to do it but that’s not realistic for family vacation planning. I don’t need something extravagant.

"They got to talking about this shit one time at a department meeting, of all places, and they were all sitting around in their little echo chamber agreeing with each other, using that disgusting fucking lock and key analogy (whole 'nother rant there, don't get me started) and something in me snapped. I waited till one of them was done, and said ""Let's be honest, it's not about morals. If it was about the morality of a girl out there fucking a ton of guys, you wouldn't be out there fucking a ton of girls. It's not your morals, it's your ego. You guys can't stand the thought that your girlfriend or wife might have had a better lay, or a bigger dick than you. So you want her to be as inexperienced as possible, so you have a higher chance to be the best sex and the biggest dick they've ever had."" There were a bunch of denials and refusals that I was right, but the conversation petered out in less than a minute, so I knew I was probably onto something when they subject-changed so hard and fast."
"The only thing that I can think of is making a really cool, rad female friend who's over 30 to remind you that life is still possible when you're older.

All the things people are saying to do before you're 30, you can do those things after 30 too.  So plan yourself a life that you think is going to make you happy.  There are women over 30 traveling the world, having wild group sex, living alone, and doing their own thing.  You don't have to rush to settle down and figure it out, and you also don't have to get as much goofing off into your 20's as possible, as if all the fun has an expiration date.

It's ok to put money in savings and live in a shitty apartment with 3 other people so that you can pay off your student loans and afford to travel in your 30's.  It's ok to work a good job that you don't like too much but that you have all the background for, and then make a career change when you're 40.  It's ok to do whatever you're going to do at the speed you're going to do it, because you're not going to turn into a pumpkin on your 30th birthday.  You're still going to be you."
"I guess it’s not common unless you’re someone with a period but..... my boyfriend didn’t quiet understand the concept of tampons. We were both in the bathroom and he looked over and saw me inserting it and removing the plastic part. He sort of understood that the plastic didn’t stay in the vagina. Wasn’t exactly sure how the mechanics of it worked. I felt like a healthy teacher using my hand as a makeshift vagina. Sad part is he’s a hands on learner and wanted to insert one for me...... I told him no. The only way that’d happen is if I broke both arms. 

TLDR: tampons confused my boyfriend  "
"I had a guy who'd repeatedly told me to be careful outside because I might get raped by some stranger and that he was worried. Funny, because he was the one who ended up assaulting me.

"It's been interesting to see the breakdown in which men look at sexual misconduct by themselves/their fellows as something impersonal, unchangeable ,and inherent, like a force of nature/act of god - as if it was a hurricane or earthquake that struck. There has been so much victim-blaming and ""what do you expect"" and ""Well, if I waited for consent, then I wouldn't have had sex"" type commentary in the media and online. It's enlightening to hear how many of them think that they wouldn't get to have any sex at all if they made sure they had enthusiastic consent and didn't attempt to pressure or coerce partners into sex.

It has also been really good to hear the men who are horrified to realize that the mindset of those other men is so common. Seeing conversations happen between men who are pro affirmative and enthusiastic consent and those who see that concept as a barrier has been enlightening. I've heard/seen quite a few guys calling out other men for holding very problematic views of consent. It's good that those conversations are happening."
That's kind of funny.

"&gt; Attraction + communication + commitment to make it work + willingness to try new things = happy sex life

No, those key elements will *often* lead to a happy sex life. For other couples, despite having all those elements, they will still struggle sexually. It's not like 2 + 2 = 4. There is nothing wrong with abstaining until marriage; it's important however to understand that maybe, you will find yourselves struggling with sexual issues or sexual compatibility issues afterwards and accept this as a potential part of your marriage.

Of course, many abstaining couples end up very happy sexually and I wish you that. "

"I know you probably care about him a lot, but if this relationship is going nowhere you should probably do something about it... you deserve to be with someone who thinks you’re the most beautiful girl in the world and loves you for ALL of who you are. Don’t settle for someone who tears you down. "
"The biggest deal breaker that my current boyfriend has is smoking. The only reason why it was supposed to be a deal breaker is because I’m allergic to the toxins &amp; asthma is a thing.

But I talked to him about it &amp; he’s never once smoked in front of me or near me or anything! We go whole weekends together &amp; I never see a cigarette on his person or taste a cigarette when I kiss him.

I think because I communicated what my deal breaker was and why, he’s made a real effort not to cross that line. And the fact that he’s willing to make that effort means more than him smoking in the first place. "
"Say you're a feminist. Anyone within earshot who snorts and looks like they're about to say ""well, actually"" is probably one of em. "
"I feel with this! I definitely don't see tanner Asian women (except the few Indian female actors we see in Western media). It's strange because the West loves a tan, and Asians don't, but I still feel that paler Asians are cast more often in Asian roles in Western media, if that makes sense. "
"Not creepy, but awkward. Tinder date. We start talking about interests- some of it was rehashed from texting. When we were texting, we talked about how I am not against anime, I liked what I’ve seen, but I don’t really search it out either. He was super into anime. He seemed really chill via text. During the date, the guy looks at me and says “You’re not going to get me to stop watching anime”. I’m sitting there like “When in hell did I say that?” I told him I never said that. And he replied “Doesn’t matter. I won’t get me to stop”. He then proceed to tell me how I’m a lesser person for not being an obsessed fan. Yeah, he got super mad when I didn’t want to go on a second date. Self awareness, man. "
So many women in my rural town voted for him for only this reason. One of them I spoke to even felt ashamed.
"He didn’t treat me respectfully. He liked having one up on me and putting me “in my place”.

"As a photographer who has done a few weddings, this is difficult. There are amateur photographers who are better than pros. Then there are pros who just deliver god awful photos.

I was at a wedding with a second shooter and she was supposed that experienced pro. All her photos were slightly tilted and had a violet hue to them. They looked awful.

So to anyone who reads this, look at the photos the photographer has done before. This is the only way to know if they will be good. Rely on your gut feeling. Also, it's always a good sign if they want to see the location before, if they meet up to talk about all the details with you.

Lastly, a trial shoot (often called engagement shooting) is a great way to test the person."

"The first time I had a surprise period during sex, my current partner was so unbelievably great about it. Like, he gives zero fucks and is like, ""Whatever, we're gonna keep doing this."" He grew up with three sisters and it shows through his compassion for women.

It always shocks me when men think that because it's supposedly easier for women to have sex they should treat it like it's gold.  Doesn't your friend realize that if every woman had the values he holds dear he wouldn't have had all that sex?!
"Hey a topic just for me!

When I saw Kate Winslet's boobs in Titanic at 9 years old and thought to myself that naked women were infinitely more interesting than naked men.

"My abusive ex would apologize profusely every time he hit me. I always forgave him.

Just a few months ago he called my mom's house, I don't know his number and I was alone there so I picked up. He asked me if I still loved him (no fucking way) because he still loved me and told me that he apologizes for everything he did, though alleging we were ""young and stupid"" (abused from 16 to 19, now 22). I told him I would never forgive him for almost killing me and our daughter (he tried to kill me several times when I was pregnant, and after) and hung up on him."
I don't do that much time and I can do my whole face in less than 10 mins if I want/need to. However I use a good hour and a half before work to sit at my vanity do my hair and makeup while listening to a good/happy podcast to get ready to face the day.

"Michael Schur writes really great characters in general and creates really interesting subplots for women.  I can't quite remember where he said it, but I remember him saying on some podcast or in some book or something that he always felt that once TV characters have babies it's the death of the show in that it dominates almost the entirety of story, so his solution when Ben and Leslie had the triplets was to just keep them off camera as much as possible, so the stories could still focus on their lives outside of parenthood.

That was something that always bugged me about ""tv moms"" that I could never place my finger on.  A lot of modern shows are better about it (Blackish for example) but I definitely remember associating the idea of main characters having children as when things got boring on a lot of shows.

"I don't really get why it's seen as impossible by society to not have sex. I have desires, yes, but it's definitely not worth doing it before marriage (for both faith and emotional/health reasons and frankly, I just don't want to). It's like friendship, on a deeper level.

What is hard, though, is the rampant virgin-shaming and general dislike some people have of ""prudes"". It's like my very existence just makes some people defensive and weirdly angry, even when I said nothing to provoke such reactions to my lifestyle choices"

They're all for expressing your sexuality the way you want to, until that sexuality goes in a direction that personally makes them uncomfortable. Then, suddenly, they're awful pearl-clutchy and ""what about the children?"""

"I think there’s a lot of, frankly, manufactured confusion among men of what “appropriate” conduct is. It seems very obvious to me what is and is not appropriate to do in a workplace, or a relationship, or a sexual encounter, and yet a concerning number of men have expressed a level of confusion about those things that just seems inexplicable to me. I’m talking about the sort of men who are saying that now, they’re afraid to even go on a date with a woman, or speak to a woman at work, or interact with a woman in public. What on earth are you doing that you think your normal day to day interactions would prompt women to be afraid of or uncomfortable around you? And why, instead of thinking critically about your actions and trying to figure out where these impulses come from, are you claiming that it’s all a wash and you guess you just have to never speak to our gender again, because *it’s a mystery?*

I think a lot of these men know what they’re doing, or what they’ve done, and now feel the need to claim ignorance to save face. I don’t think it’s nearly as complicated as they’re making it out to be, and I think they’re being disingenuous when they begin conversations about harassment or assault with ‘oh, but the line is *so confusing!’*"

"I've seen it on Reddit a few times but it was in relation to having interviews. The advice was to ask questions at the end which help you find out whether the company is a good fit for you. Before that, I always saw those questions at the end as just an opportunity to show off a bit more and not necessarily find out useful info.

Anyway I had 3 interviews this week and ended up getting job offers for 2 of 3. And unbelievably, those 2 offered exactly the same pay (like down to the penny). The deciding factor for me came down to what they said in response to the questions I asked them. It completely flipped what I thought would be my top choice when I was applying."
to me it isn’t irrational but other people seem to have no issue with it. smokers getting special treatment and being allowed to take multiple 10-15 minute breaks through the work day on top of their lunch. smoking in general is repulsive to me so i’m overly irritated that smokers can just go outside 5 times a day without having to clock out for a break but i can’t leave the floor to just go stand around for a few minutes. you do not have a disease that requires you to regularly take breaks. you chose to put that shit into your body. why do you deserve special privileges.

"This is one thing I fight with my coworkers about all the time (all men)!

I am like, So you're okay with going out and fucking them, but you won't date them? *Nope.* You do realize that you're being a hypocrite, that it's okay for you but not for her? *Yea but I just have good morals, I don't want a girl that's been around the block a hundred times.* But you DON'T have 'good morals' because you're holding her to those standards but not yourself!"" *Yea but I just don't want a girl that is willing to go out and have sex with whoever.* You do realize that if those girls didn't exist, you wouldn't be having all of the casual sex you're having?

"Ok, so I realize this doesn’t exactly count because we started dating way before he was a pro, but I’m engaged to an NFL player! However, I have been around other athletes enough to know what goes into their dating lives. Just know a few things-

First of all, their schedules are insane. I know everyone has their crazy busy lives, but during the season I see my fiancé long enough to hold a conversation once a week (twice on home game weeks, but this is also because I work evening hours) Every sport is different, but if you’re dating one and have a lot of downtime waiting around to hear from them, know it’s not you. Just don’t go sending them constant messages because I’ve seen that’s the number one thing that drives those guys crazy. They don’t have time for that and will make time for you when they can. They will have all the time in the world for you when the season is over.

They’re real people too, and they love a good girl who is smart, down to earth and sees them for who they are, which isn’t always just being good at sports. But do keep in mind you’re their number one fan and will go to great lengths to defend people who have no clue what they’re talking about. Sports fans are crazy. You will know more about sports than you ever cared to possibly know.

Remember that even though they seem super important, you’re just as important and are dating them too. I’ve seen girls who stuck it out with athletes too long even though they weren’t compatible just because they were dating an athlete. If he’s not treating you right, let him know and get out.

If you do find your person, the perks are amazing. We’ve traveled everywhere together and I feel like the luckiest girl in the world every single day. And we’re going to the Pro Bowl next week and I get to support him there every step of the way! :)

I might’ve gotten a little carried away but I was so excited to find a question I can relate to. Good luck on your date! Don’t be nervous just be your confident self."

"Abstaining 23 yr old female here, the sexual compatibility question is a big one. I would hate being an a marriage where the sex was terrible. However, not having sex before marriage taught me a lot about communicating and improving existing relationships. 

Abstaining is successful if you communicate with direct sentences that have a kind tone “your hand feels great but we need to keep up above here” 

I expect my sex life after I’m married will be similar but like the other side of the coin “you hand feels great there but it feels even better Here”.   Direct and to the point without hurting feelings. 

The reality is that my honeymoon will be filled with mediocre  and *gasp* maybe even bad sex. However, I will communicate what I want as I learn it and he will do the same. I will marry someone I find attractive to the max and he will think I’m the shit. 

Attraction + communication + commitment to make it work + willingness to try new things = happy sex life "

"The thing that probably sticks with me the most was when we talked about his exes (I don't have exes, so I have no idea what it's like), one of them in particular who he'd been with for 8 years and through his teens, his first love and soulmate (that hurt enough as it was) - only to follow with that when they broke up, he realised he'd made the biggest mistake of his life.

It still hurts, though it wasn't supposed to, but I don't know why the fuck you'd say something like that (but that may be because I don't have any exes).
I have pretty nasty issues with insecurity, and you can figure out how much it fucked me up."

"When somebody compliments my appearance, my first instinct is to assume either that they're doing it out of pity ('this girl's so plain-looking, let's call her pretty because nobody else will') or as a joke ('did you see how she smiled and thanked us? can you believe that she *actually* thinks anyone would think *she's* pretty?')

I think I'm plain or unattractive. I have some redeeming features (clear skin; striking green eyes; dainty, delicate figure) but I genuinely don't like the rest of me, and I avoid photos because of it. I've cried over my looks before.

With the exception of the people responsible for years of bullying in high school, other people don't seem to agree. My boyfriend calls me beautiful. At a NYE party, a friend's sister called me 'gorgeous', and other friends agreed. I once had some drunk girls come up to me in a club and call me 'so pretty'. I just don't see it. To me, there's no way any of it can be true, and my brain always finds ways to rationalise it into meaning nothing: ""He's your boyfriend, he's *supposed* to think you're good-looking, even if you're not. Same for your parents. Drunk girls are just nice."" "

Also a guy who doesn't understand that consent can be revoked at any time. He very well could rape someone if he thinks that gives him unlimited consent.

Edit: also isn't it easier to just realize that women are equal participants in sex and should want to have sex with you as much as you want to have sex with them so if you find yourself wondering if she wants to have sex then stop and find out for sure. Isn't enthusiastic sex with an equal participant much better than grudging sex you do *to* someone? I know society says women should do anything to avoid being ""easy"" or a ""slut"" and that's done a lot of damage to women and men alike. It leads men to assume women must be hard to convince to have sex which leads them to be pushy as fuck. If we let women be unapologetically sexual then maybe dudes would realize we say yes when we want and no means no not please convince me. "

"I have one ex who was a pro at shitty comments. Here are a few of my favorites:

1) He asked me who was his ""biggest threat"", which was suppose to be the person that I had a crush on. I think the conversation was suppose to be light hearted and fun, but I couldn't think of anyone and ended up saying some random person I had a crush on from a few summers ago. I then asked him and he answered my best friend.

2) Somehow memory loss came up, and I jokingly said something about having him lose his memory and getting to watch him fall in love with me all over again. He responded by saying that if that happened he wouldn't fall in love with me again. 

And my personal favorite...

3) He threw a party and invited me over. I said I was suppose to spend the evening with my sister, and I would ask her if she wanted to come over to the party. My sister had recently been raped, and I didn't want to force her into the party atmosphere nor did I want to cancel on her. My ex said: ""Don't bring her over. All my best friends are coming over, they're great people and I don't want them being accused of rape"". I ended up trying to forgive him because he was very drunk when he said it and I didn't want to end things over a drunk shitty comment. The ironic part was a few weeks later he was over at my apartment crying because his sister was being molested by one of his ""great best friends"". I felt realllly bad for his sister, but I checked out of the relationship then."

"Guy I met on tinder, we hung out a few times at his friends house it was pretty chill no complaints. Then I invite him over to my house to hang out and play board games, we hadn't even kissed at this point it was always very casual the way I like it during the getting to know each other phase. So we're at my house and there's a pull up bar and he insists on seeing me do a pull up even though It's not mine and I tell him I can't do one. I think now I should have just said no but I grabbed the bar and struggled a bit then looked down and said ""see? Can't do it."" Then he says something about me being cute and grabs me around the waist and pulls me off the bar and starts making out with me and I pull away feeling embarrassed and suggest we play a board game. He tries kissing me again and I say I'm uncomfortable so he stops and we're playing this trivia game called jackass but he keeps trying to push the board out of the way because it's in between us, but I put it back and tell him to stop because I know he's just trying to kiss me again. After the game we chatted for a bit and he's mentioned before he has class on a certain day but we didn't really discuss it anymore than that till this point at which he tells me sometimes in his class they have him talk about ""what he's done to women"" I'm like ""wait, what are these classes for?"" and he responded ""well that's fucking rude, I don't ask you what you go to therapy for"" so I tried to calm him down and change the subject and then a bit later he starts kissing me again and he grabs my leg and pulls me on top of him while I'm literally yelling ""no stop"" at him which he ignores. I then say that I'm tired and he needs to leave and he's like ""are you sure you don't want me to stay with you?"" And I say yes while I'm kind of shooing him out the door and he finally leaves. I pretty much ghosted him after that which I know is frowned upon but I just didn't know what to say. I still wonder what that ""class"" was and what did he do to women? lol"

"In middle and high school I was the only white person in my friend group. It was mostly black girls, a few black boys and some mixed race girls. Nothing opened my eyes to casual racism more than being their friends and involved in their lives. I remember the first time I went out to the mall with two of my best friends and getting followed by a sales person in Macys. I was wondering why she was following us and asked my friends if they noticed. They were not even surprised and told me it happens to them all the time. These girls were straight A students, active in the honor society, very involved in their church and community. And the sales clerk was treating them as a shoplifting threat. I was incrediulous and couldn't stop thinking about it so I made an effort to notice other things I may have been blind to before.

My friends had to work so much harder to be acknowledged for their achievements. When my best friend made drum major, the other girls chalked it up to the band director chosing her because he was also black. The thought that she auditioned better than all of them could not possibly be the reason. That particular friend also had a strained relationship with other black students because they accused her of ""acting white"". 

The worst thing that happened was when there was about 10 of us at a lunch table outside. Everyone was being loud but I guess the fact we were also being loud particularly upset this group of white kids next to us. One of them screamed at us ""SHUT UP n-word"", except well he used the word. It was legitamitely shocking to me that in this day and age someone would yell that at us for daring to have fun and laugh at lunch. Of course we told the principal and the student got a referral. He and his group of friends hated us from then on for ""getting him in trouble.""

When we went to college I lost contact with most of the friend group, but I still get together with some of the friends I was closest to. I'm super grateful to them for opening my eyes and showing me the ways I was ignorant to racism. They didn't do it in an accusing way, just a way that showed me, yeah this is what we have to deal with that you don't because we're black and it sucks. This turned into such a novel but your question triggered so many memories lol. "
"I consider it neutral. People should wait to have sex until they are ready. That is going to vary from person to person. 

Tbh a big part of why I’m waiting, in addition to religion, is my personality. Even if I was agnostic/atheist, I would be waiting (though perhaps not til marriage). I am INFJ/INTP ish and it takes a lot for me to be vulnerable with others. I would never engage in casual sex. I can only see myself doing it with someone whom I love and trust with my whole being. "

"Working as a teacher in a deprived area, and then doing placements in more advantaged schools for contrast. It's not just the extreme cases which involve social services that bothered me, but it totally warps your sense of what is 'normal' or 'average'.

Kids who were considered 'low attaining' at my school would probably have been in special needs classes at another more affluent school. But there were too many of them in my school for us to provide that level of support. I saw in my placements kids who had 1-1 support for behavioural issues who would be considered some of the most well-behaved at my school. One kid during my placement lay down on the floor and that was a huge shock to the teacher and class. Meanwhile in my regular class, my ""mentally disturbed but has been on a child mental health assessment waiting list for 3 years"" boy would be throwing chairs, trying to stab me and other kids with pencils, swinging from the curtains etc.

And then working with the system was soul destroying. The waiting lists. The constant investigations that led to nothing even when a child comes in completely covered in bruises and complains about sleeping outside and chasing foxes all night. I get it, the social workers are overstretched too and they don't have the resources. But no one seems to be able to help these kids, these families, they had problems so far beyond my training and pay grade.

And I can't help but think, god, those kids are going to have to grow up. And they've been behind all their goddamn life. How many of them will grow up to commit serious crimes? Become drug addicts like their parents? Work menial labour jobs and struggle with poverty? It was heartbreaking to me to see at age 7 or 8, some children's lives were so negatively impacted already that they would be climbing uphill their whole lives."
