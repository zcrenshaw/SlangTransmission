"A real, proper train service to/from the airports, preferably running to Midtown. None of this end-of-the-subway-line-and-then-transfer crap. So many other cities have this down."
"I enjoyed Dante's Inferno, personally. "
Any gym. Nobody is looking at you. 
lmaoooo i thought this post was about something ENTIRELY different...
A willingness to invest in infrastructure.
"I've been living in Japan for a little under a year and it's amazing to me how every town I've visited, from the most rural mountain village to the busiest neighborhood of Tokyo, is immaculately clean. No cigarette butts. No splotches of gum on the sidewalk. No food wrappers in the gutter.

And to top it off, there are virtually no public garbage cans here. People carry their trash all day and then take it home."
"I'm pretty sure it was because the original towns of Flushing, Jamaica, Rockaway, LIC, etc. all had independent municipal governments and therefore had independent post offices before the incorporation of the Borough in 1897.

Queens is also one of the only places in the country with legitimately hyphenated address numbers. There was an article about it here: https://stevemorse.org/census/changes/QueensFormat.htm"
"Sometimes, it's an inbound call and it's a timely issue, so that makes sense. I'll pick those up, selectively, but the first words out of my mouth are, ""I'm on a subway, so I might lose you.""

Other than that, I can't imagine why. 

Also, I hope that they keep the airlines call-free. I don't need to listen to some self-important prick out prickette talking loudly. "
"Don’t call it ctown, thats a supermarket "
"10 applications? Lol.

It's very competitive here. Especially for anything decent, well paying, etc.

You might find that you need to make 100 applications to get some interviews."
"Maybe it's because you live in San Pedro? Have you tried living in more gay friendly areas of LA? Weho, SM, etc?

If it's just the bashing you're going to get that everywhere, you just need to find the right pocket, and that is regardless of LA or NYC.

Fwiw I moved from LA to NYC 5 years ago. I haven't found one necessarily better than the other, they just have different things going for it. I'd say it's a bit easier here to ""get in where you fit in"" but you trade off weather and a generally more laid back vibe.

Moving across the country won't magically solve the bashing issue. You still need to find your scene which takes work."
"Walk a different route to/from where you’re going every time. Use Google maps to save places you see that look interesting—restaurants, bars, theatres, museums, etc. Add places you read about that you want to try. When you have the time, go to that map and pick something to check off that list in whatever neighborhood you find yourself. "
I buy a ticket to a show or performance in advance . It forces me to schedule around it and enjoy. I lately buy two tickets and find someone to join. 
"I got mugged at knife-point once. It was 3AM on a Wednesday and a guy tries to sell me heroin. When I don't buy, he pulls out a knife and asks for my wallet

I had like $12, some IDs, credit cards and a metrocard. I actually negotiated with my mugger to keep my driver's license because it would've been a pain to get a new one - he relented and gave it back. 

It was kind of scary but I didn't get stabbed or worse - have to go to the DMV. overall a smooth transaction."
Public restrooms.
"People who FaceTime during their commute tho. Like half the time they’re not even talking, just why?"
"The most in danger I have ever felt is either: 1) standing on a subway platform and having it crowd behind me as train delays rat fucked people and realizing that if the crowd pushed, I’d be shit out of luck or 2) the time a dude followed me out of a bar, pissed I wouldn’t sleep with him, until I hid in a bodega until I thought he was gone and then found him the next day after work waiting on my stoop with flowers. "
I’d love to see streets more focused on making a pedestrian-friendly environment rather than prioritizing cars. I’d also like to see more pedestrian-only areas and more protected bike lanes. And I’d love it if both motorists and cyclists would follow the letter of the law more exactly. 
"Vacancy taxes like in Vancouver, so people buying million dollar apartments as investments that they never live in pay taxes that can go to affordable housing. "
I'd forego paying for groceries and meals and just offer to pay a flat rate to help out with rent. If a friend was staying on my couch I'd much rather prefer a reasonable wad of cash (and maybe them taking me out for a few meals and/or drinks) than having to submit my receipts to them. 
"Any bigger or more “traditional” gym is fine for the self conscious. No one will look at you at those. It’s the small, “hip” gyms (trendy ones, especially the ones designed around dedicated yoga classes, etc) where you get more of the catty, ‘staring at heavier women or women not wearing lululemon-esque workout’ gear behavior. Even those can be okay, though; look for reviews saying there are lots of different body types and fitness levels for those."
"Eating local has many benefits, but allergy mitigation is not one of them. This is a myth that is supported by literally no evidence."
"This is a serious American cultural problem: 'ew I'm not touching that it's dirty so I'll just throw my shit wherever or piss and shit wherever making it dirty and people who clean things are dirty and should get paid dirt.'

Culture needs to shift to shaming people and feeling shameful for littering and making a mess and respecting cleaners and sanitation workers for fulfilling an honest needed and difficult service."
You’re staying in a budget hotel in Chinatown. 
"Comedy? 
Improv? 
After hours at a museum (don’t have to drink)? Poetry slams? 
Jazz music? 
Ping pong place called Spin. 
Board game cafe in the West village
Hookah (if you don’t mind tobacco)
Chelsea Piers has all sorts of stuff
Royal Palms shuffle board club (Brooklyn)
Take the ferry to LIC or Brooklyn
Brooklyn bridge park
"
"It's not that NYC is unwilling to invest in infrastructure, we invest billions. The problem is that the MTA and the contractors it hires form a pit of unaccountable corruption that you can sink billions into without getting much of anything at all in return."
"That's correct. Queens used to be a collection of villages and hamlets that over time were combined into bigger entities (such as Long Island City the 1870s). Nobody back then would have referred to it as Queens. It's just the name of the County whereas Brooklyn was a city much earlier. Brooklyn as an incorporated village is actually older than New Amsterdam.

All of this is also the reason why Brooklyn has a Downtown whereas Queens has distinct centers that are spread out throughout the borough. "
Also people who FaceTime while walking on the sidewalks... and with no headphones on.. and our speaking into the bottom of their phones. Like what’s the point?
"Full legalization of marijuana. Tax it and use the money for subways, schools, etc."
The Bowery Boys is good for history
JFK is absolutely not too far. Lots of cities have airport transit lines that far or farther. Part of the problem is that Robert Moses made sure the highway running out did not leave space for a rail line.
They are called scammers and you do exactly what you did. 
"Integrate local and commuter rail (like in London) and have through-trains (like in Paris).
Sidewalk snow plows (like in Montreal).
Keep building subway lines (like in Asia)."
It would be really nice if new york had a subway system.
"If any asks ""can I ask you something?"" Or ""do you have a minute?"" Or ""can you help me?"" Or really any question which requires them to ask another question to get to the point... just smile say ""thank you, have a great day""... 

If someone wants something or needs some help they will make that their opening question ""Where is Fulton center?"" ""What bus gets me to the cloisters?"" ""Is this Olive Garden any good?""

"
"In lieu of arrest, you're forced to enroll in school and repeat a grade at random."
My 4-year-old kicked me in the nuts one time when he didn't want to leave the playground.
"The great thing about C-Town is that they have everything. Produce, cereal, coffee, paper towels, deli meat..."
"Don't get pressured into buying a CD on the street.

Don't give fake monks (or anyone) money.

Don't pay anyone who bumps into you and claims you caused them to drop something and break it."
"I read through some of your other posts and hope you’ll consider talking to a therapist with trauma experience for a few months before moving. 

It sounds like you’ve been through a lot in life and moving/finding a partner won’t fix any of those things. Gay men are often brutal to  each other - I can definitely speak to that from experience. But, you have some other traumatic events that could probably benefit from a professionals help. 

Moving here is ridiculously expensive and with extra baggage may quickly find yourself in over your head. Good luck! "
"You are jerks if you'd completely ruin people's lives because you didn't expect to hear someone have sex in the cheapest hotel possible and you refuse to talk to the hotel staff because reasonable responses like changing your room aren't good enough for you.


Please do not call the cops on someone having sex. "
This city is full of psychos. 
 No tipping policies. No tip jars everywhere. Pay people living wages.   
"At the time when the Grand Central Parkway was being constructed to connect Idlewild to the Triborough Bridge, civic engineers BEGGED Robert Moses to expand the planned Right of Way purchase by 15 feet on either side, which would allow for a median wide enough to one day construct a light-rail connection that would terminate at Grand Central. Moses not only refused, he saw to it that the steel used to support the roadbed was only suitable for motor traffic, to ensure there would never be a train connection to the airport. Many of his choices were based on the logic that cars were used by middle class and rich people, and by making certain areas impossible to reach except by private car, he could keep out the riff raff. He was also a notorious racist and once decorated a playground in Harlem with cast iron filigrees of monkeys playing. "
"For $1,200 you're living with roommates, just so you know.    

Internet can be a little above $50, but if you have roommates then you'll probably split it.    

Food budget seems high unless you eat out all the time or like to treat yoself a lot. Or if that includes booze and you drink a good amount.    

You'll be a little tight on money, but hey, it'll work. If you lived here for 3 months then you should have a decent handle on what you'll be spending.    

Also keep in mind you'll need first, broker fee, and security at a minimum to move in almost anywhere. "
Look at Rockefeller here with more than one room.
"3rd Floor.

We typically keep the bathroom window open. By day 3, there’s a layer of dust/soot on everything.

I try to wipe every few days just to keep up between cleanings but a Clorox wipe is no match for NYC dust.

And... my day was great, thanks!"
"I’ve lived in all parts of CA and moved from SF Bay Area to NYC a year ago. I really miss the natural beauty and easy access to nature, camping, hiking of CA. But the nightlife, museums, etc are better in NY. If given the chance I would move back to CA. I’m at a time in my life where the natural aspect of CA is more important to me than the culture part of NYC. However I don’t regret giving NYC a try! Definitely give it a go while you are still young and not tied down to family, a career, etc. "
"As someone who grew up in the south east and owned a car my entire life - not having to own a car is a major selling point of NY for me.  It was crazy how fast I fell out of the routine. I still feel comfortable driving when I need to but I realize more and more how stressful/ dangerous it is and it feels great not having to worry about it.

"I've been here for over 8 years and love it. There are some solid bars  in the area, and more and more restaurants are popping up. It's close to pretty much every train, so it's easy to get to the anywhere in Manhattan, Jersey, and most of Brooklyn. There's also a bunch of ferry options, some are even free on weekends.

It's quiet and clean, which I imagine isn't too different from Stuytown. It's easy to get to Tribeca, WV, and LES for a good nightlife experience, but here a few local spots that I really like:

* Cocktails
    * Cedar Local
    * Dead Rabbit (but beware of tourists)
    * The Beekman (a bit pricey, but nice)
    * Vintry Wine &amp; Whiskey (Stone Street)
    * BlackTail
* Pubs/Dives
    * The Iron Horse (best to frequent this dive after 1 AM)
    * Ryan Maguire's (Irish pub, inexpensive and they are generous with buy-backs)
    * Malt House (good craft beers)
    * Fraunces Tavern (the oldest bar in NYC. Yes the oldest, much older than McSorley's. Fantastic all around.)
    * Irish American (HUGE basement bar, lots of games to play)
    * Jeremy's Ale House (fun dive, great patio for day drinking. In seaport)
    * Coygirl Seahorse (awesome tex-mex, local non-NYC feel)
    * Clinton Hall (beer hall, 2 locations)
    * Ulysses (fun bar on Stone Street)
    * Plenty more
* Restaurants
    * Augustine (amazing French bistro, pricey but good. In Beekman Hotel)
    * Temple Court (also in Beekman Hotel)
    * Pisillo Italian Panini (amazing sandwiches)
    * SUteiShi (solid sushi in Seaport)
    * Adrienne's Pizza (Stone Street)
    * Felice (Italian)
    * Westville (farm to table)
    * Harry Steakhouse (fantastic Saturday brunch with free Champagne. Located on Stone Street)
    * Osteria della Pace (really good Italian food in Eataly)
    * Eataly restaurants (a handful of options)
    * Wooly Public (really good burger, and I hear their cocktails are good but haven't tried yet)
* Other stuff
    * 4 grocery stores (including Eataly which has the best produce), and they're opening a Whole Foods on Broadway (closer to wall)
    * CVS and Duane Reade are plentiful
    * Tons of ATMs and banks
    * Westfield mall
    * Plenty of gyms
    * C21 and T.J. Maxx department stores, and other clothing stores
    * Anthropologie (I'm a man and not ashamed to admit that this is my favorite store)
    * Ikea in Redhook (free Ferry on the weekend)

I think you'll be pleased with the decision to move to FiDi. I'm happy to provide more insight, just send me a DM.

If your grandmother likes tea theres a place called Alice's tea cup in Manhattan. Dont remember exactly where but it's a nice little spot
