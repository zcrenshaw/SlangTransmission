"I saw the title and thought, ""Aw hell no!"" but read the entire story.

Suddenly I realize I need to be more empathetic of other people's situations.

Good job!"
"This is hilarious. I would have chewed that line for years. My only question is, if the mannequin didn't have a head how was it wearing a hat?"
"I really hope you said something like, ""I'm sorry you forgot your food but we went out of our way to keep it cool so you wouldn't waste your money.  Have a nice day!"""
"When she comes in for her feed she will demand a discount, guaranteed."
People are aware of how old/young they look. I am in my 30s but would never go somewhere to buy something that is age-restricted without my id. 
"I'd read this to my husband, but I think he'd start crying. "
I don‚Äôt understand the mentality to let your kids run around and act like little gremlins. 
That agent owes you a bottle of tequila
"&gt; You're too young to be this angry!!

""Yeah and you're too old to be alive but here you are"""
If you don't have to 'special order' it then that means she is not special. How dare you suggest she's not special!
"I'm not into pokemon, but this made me tense up"
"Oh gosh that made me cry. I can't even imagine being in that woman's situation. ""I'm tired as hell but my baby's sick and I'll be *damned* if I go home empty handed."" You probably made her whole world."
"It was a joke, he just had trouble reading his audience.

Twenty-odd years ago I cut and threaded some pipe for a customer. He'd requested an odd length, something like 9 and 5/8ths. 

&gt;Me: If you have a little play or can bend something I can grab you one out of the bin that's 9.5 inches and save you a couple bucks and some time. 

&gt;Customer: Oh, no. Any shorter and my wife will survive the explosion. 

I just looked at him.

&gt;Me: You do know we had the FBI here last week taking samples of threaded pipe, right? The woman that got blown up last week?

&gt;Customer: FUCK. No, no. It's for &lt;school&gt;. I'm replacing a urinal. I'm not even married!

We really did have a visit from the FBI. Some small-time judge killed his wife with a pipe-bomb and blamed it on the people he'd convicted. He shopped at the store and I'd made pipe for him more than once, so I was especially pissed off. "
"In 10 years, she'll be pulling the same stunt with cashiers who don't give her a discount. 'But it's so expensive. If I don't get this I won't be able to eat. Do you want me to die.'"
"This is why I hated retail.   You could never call people out on their bullshite.

However, as a customer, I am free to put people like that in their place."
"I wish I was multi lingual.

I'm barely lingual."
"Depending on the cards, they might have been worth a lot even damaged, due to their status as Gen 1. But they might also have been a pack of cards that are a dime a dozen, with no real rares in them. Either way though, I'm amazed that the father keeps buying his child Poke'mon cards if he just tears them to pieces. Like, buying anything just for your child to destroy seems wrong, no matter if it's cards, toys, or whatever. "
"If it would make him happy, my 8-year-old has a deep love for Pok√©mon. When my little sis went into the military, she gave him all her cards. He keeps them in a Pok√©mon binder, all in sleeves. They're basically for looking at. When it's bedtime and he's not quite tired yet, he flips through until he falls asleep, and has been steadily adding to the collection whenever he gets money. :)"
Especially since it was $90 worth of filet minion. 
"Any time a customer says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never shop here again!‚Äù I respond by saying ‚Äúsee you tomorrow!‚Äù As they‚Äôre leaving.

Because let‚Äôs face it, they‚Äôll be shopping there again."
You helped her not even knowing what she wanted to buy and you turned out a hero. 
"Yeah I kind of went for a benign bait-and-switch title since the post had been written without a title in mind, and with the knowledge that there would be a serious plot twist towards the end.

The amount of karma this post generated has me feeling awestruck, it's like 5x the karma of my entire account.  I was actually expecting and prepping myself to come back to a lot of down votes, and a similar amount of harsh criticism centered around refusing her service.

I am glad that the post was well received, that even tales that don't vilify customers can still be embraced by the community."
"Yes, lady, it's definitely the fault of the workers that you managed to wander around for a half hour in a store that's clearly still being set up. Wow.

But I believe it. The last store I worked at was opening a new location and we could volunteer to help set it up. A few of my coworkers and I carpooled over to the new location. We went up to the sliding doors and knocked/waved someone down - like you said there was no dress code so we were in normal clothes - and the woman who opened the door immediately apologized and said they weren't open to the public yet. We explained we were there to work and she let us in. 

Turned out they had been having similar problems with people coming up to the doors and trying to get in to shop despite the fact that most of the shelves were empty, there were boxes everywhere and there was clear signage on the door stating when the grand opening was scheduled for. If the doors hadn't been locked I'm sure there would have been plenty trying to shop and complaining about the mess lol. "
"I'd stash it in the back and, when she came in, tell her we were sold out.  "
"Especially when it can end with a trip to the E.R. Also, retail employees are not babysitters üòÇ"
"The other lesson to be learned here is that she didn‚Äôt come in and rudely demand to be served or anything like that; despite the fact that she was probably right on the edge of a complete meltdown. 
She knew that her best chance of getting what she needed she would have to treat the staff with some respect."
"I'm dumbfounded by this.  

If any company claims I didn't pay for something that I know I paid for, the FIRST thing I'm going to do is get the statement or other proof that I paid on my end.  

Secondly, do they not balance their card statement?  How can they not notice a $1000 discrepancy?  They are just begging to have their financial information stolen.  Aren't old people paranoid about that stuff anyway?  "
"It has a neck that we rest the hats on, like that pic."
"&gt; OL: Hi, I'd like to buy this flip phone.

&gt;Me: Sure thing.

&gt;OL: You look annoyed.

Well, I wasn't before, but I'm getting there now."
HOW DARE YOU NOT READ MY MIND!!!
Wow. The stupidity of some people is insane.
"And tell her if she wants it ready for her on arrival, she needs to call ahead next time and special order it. "
I have to wonder how he's going to take it when that baby starts talking and enters the 'why and how come' stage.
"Hahaha only somewhat relevant but my senior year of high school I was briefly a key holder in a mall retail establishment. We had one of those grates that you'd pull down to the floor to lock up at night because the storefront was a big open arch.

One morning I was opening alone, get to the store (all of the lights are off, grate is down, clearly no one is there yet), kneel down and unlock it. I lift the grate enough to duck through (3 or 4 feet tops) before turning around and immediately lowering it back down until it was time to open.

Except I ALMOST crushed an entire fucking human being because a woman DOVE through the low opening I briefly created to try to get in behind me. She's on her hands and knees scrambling through. I look down at her. We make eye contact. I am astonished and just say ""...oh."" She says nothing. She backs up (still on the ground) and leaves. 

She didn't come back later.

It was the weirdest and most comical fucking behavior I ever witnessed there."
"That last part of OL's spiel sounds like she's trying to put herself on a pedestal so you'll feel bad about not taking her. Like, I'm such a good waiter, and I was going to do a good deed for those girls, and then you went and did a horrible thing to sweet little me. Like, get a life lady, OP's job is not to wait on you hand and foot, there are other customers too."
"To be fair, I don't really get it either. I'd have just trusted your advice though. Don't get why people have to think everyone is against them."
"I‚Äôve been ‚Äúyoung-dad-sent-out-in-the-wee-hours-to-find-fever-medicine-for-baby‚Äù and it‚Äôs a type of desperation that I don‚Äôt ever want to feel, again."
"Yeah, it really is crazy how young you can look. I sometimes have ID's from people born in 1985 or so"
Do managers really think all complaints are completely true? 
"As a cashier some years ago, and working in a migrant worker town in Canada, we would get a lot of Mexicans in the store. Some of them were very nice, but then there would be these groups of sleazy dudes who were obviously saying filthy things about the female cashiers - you could tell from the leers and hand gestures. I had taken basic Spanish lessons so that I could communicate on a basic level - but I had no idea what they were saying, it was far above what little I had learned.

The one thing I *did* know how to say: ""You know I speak Spanish, right?""

It didn't matter that I didn't understand a word they said - they didn't know that and were totally embarrassed and apologetic as they slinked away in the walk of shame."
"You know someone will need something.
You go out of your way to get it for them.
They ask for it.
You give it to them.
They get angry because fuck all."
"I was 15, hanging out with my boyfriend and his two sisters, when he kissed me on the cheek. The one sister said, ""Gross, how can you kiss her when she has all those pimples?""

It has been over 20 years. I still have not forgotten how it felt when she said that. Good for that father for trying to teach his daughter some damn manners."
"I don't miss the days when I had to change our two mannequins, a.k.a Stripper Jane and Stalker Joe."
And that is the first time in my ten years as an NPC that I have witnessed that. I‚Äôve heard tales but it was awesome to see. 
"Daughter is out of town, but yet she has her card, and can't reach her by phone? Yeah right."
"&gt; the manager, who's deactivated the emergency door in the back of the store so she can vape instead of working 

lol"
"I mean, to be fair, taking a percentage off the sales tax is a ridiculously stupid sale.  But that‚Äôs not your fault at all."
"""Oh I'm so sorry! Usually my daughter knows to change in private, but she's such a dummy."""
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what other store does.‚Äù Like punta this ain‚Äôt that store. 
Oh man. That‚Äôs amazing! 
"I know there are those out there, like those on /r/minionhate, but wow, that escalated quickly..."
Fat chance unfortunately. 
"""I'm sorry sir, that requires a mind to read."""
"I was born in 1979, and I still get carded for liquor if I'm wearing a band shirt and a baseball cap.  Having worked in gas stations and grocery stores throughout high school, I always have my ID out.  I'm close to 40, but I still dress like I'm 20 when I'm not in the office.


Almost never get carded in my work clothes though."
"""I'm sorry.  After you made such a fuss earlier, the manager told me I had to adhere to the 10 items or less.  You will need to stand in line in the other lane.""

edit: word"
I've never heard of pumping gas before paying. Then again I live in the east coast and that may just not be a thing here. 
"This happened to my husband.  He was working and took a $20 bill from a customer.

He did his standard thing to check the bill out while someone else stepped into line.  The customer he was waiting on said ""don't worry, I made that this morning.""

The customer that had just stepped up sighed, tapped the guy on his shoulder, and said ""Secret Service, do you mind stepping over here for a minute?"".

My husband said he had his badge and everything. 

Edit- Changed from FBI to Secret Service.  I posted this on 2 hours of sleep and forgot that detail.  Apologies.

Edit edit- I should mention the bill was real and nothing happened to the jokester.  The agent told my husband he figured the guy was joking and definitely wanted to scare him a bit."
