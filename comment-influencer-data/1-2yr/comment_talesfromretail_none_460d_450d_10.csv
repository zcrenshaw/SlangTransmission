I quit my retail job two years ago and I‚Äôve genuinely forgotten how fucking mental the general public can be.
"My only tattoo is something my grandmother used to always tell me. 

""You're the sunrise to someone else's endless night."" It's across my side just under my rib cage. The same spot where I made my first scar. It's been four years now since she passed. I miss her so much.

Only one person has ever commented on it. I live each day remembering her words and that someone, somewhere, needs me to help them. We truly touch so many people in our lives, you never know when you may do the smallest kind gesture that saves someone's life.

I promise these are happy tears."
"I've learned from experience you can only be honest if you're talking about the pros and cons between two products, anything relating to the customer they will take offence to. I tended to answer questions like that with something along the lines of ""do you think it's comfortable? that's the most important thing"" or make a joke of it mentioning it'll be them wearing it and not you so if they like it then go for it.

At the end of the day most customers are just looking for an echo chamber unfortunately. "
Haha. I do that sometimes take pictures of receipts in case I lose them. But if he had the receipt and knew where it was exactly. Then why... Why go through the trouble at all... 
"I used to work at a gas station in my late teens during graveyard shift. I had a very sketchy fellow come in one night and ask me to break a $20 for him. I told him that I can't open the till unless something is purchased. So he asked for a pack of smokes. When I asked him for ID he obliged and handed it to me. When I turned around to unlock the smoke cabinet a security car pulled into the parking lot beside ours(they were security for the strip mall next door and not employed by our company). He panicked and grabbed the cigarette display case that was sitting on the counter. He made off with 6 packs of smokes that were inside it, each of which was no less than 3 years old(and probably didn't even have anything inside the boxes), but left in such a rush that he left his $20 bill and ID on the counter."
"&gt; Well haven‚Äôt you ever heard of the customer is always right?!



‚ÄúYes I have but you‚Äôve failed to convince me.‚Äù"
"Some people are so incompetent ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but really, an XL for a pug? I mean they're thick but they're not thiccc?"
"Hmmm, let's go over this.  She doesn't have time to answer the phone. She doesn't have time to respond to an email.  She doesn't have the patience/time to call the company who needs to speak with her. But, IT'S NOT HER FAULT!!!  How could you possibly think it was HER FAULT???  She did everything someone like her was willing to do (nothing) and somehow you and the repair people are trying to blame HER.   OP have you no shame?? /s"
"Be careful of thefts too. The bank branch I used to work at let customers use them back in the day as a courtesy, until they started going through and stealing some of our stuff (bathroom/toiletries, never personal/important things). We then changed it to ‚Äúonly pregnant/older/younger customers or those you‚Äôve been sitting with for a while or those you can vouch for‚Äù. Thefts went away. "
"""You may not care if your child's face gets melted off, but I do. Have a nice day."""
"Yeah, my left eye just started twitching uncontrollably from reading that. So. Much. Pain."
I pocketed it and spent it.
I used to work in a store that was popular with elderly customers and this was very common. 
I half expected the comment in the title to come from the lady who crashed into the store.
I get the feeling she doesn't have the patience to deal with them today
Did you check the backroom?
"She's an adult. If she can't handle the answer to her question, she should know not to ask."
"At least in oregon, a wrap refers to either rolling paper or blunts. They fall under tobacco laws as well so you need to be 21 to buy them. Don't know where OP is but maybe a state with similar laws."
The dog was definitely overweight. It was sad. 
Good manager!
"Tell me he tried to get his stuff back. Please, it'll make me laugh so hard I herniate."
"Where I used to work (large box store) there was a fire in the grocery area.  Started in one of the refrigerated cases and so the case next to it started on fire.  Other than that, the fire really wasn't spreading (but as we know, that could change quickly).  

Fire alarms are going off, the Fire Department is on its way, announcements are being made over the PA to evacuate and employees are trying to herd the shoppers to the front and out of the store.  The number of people who wanted to continue shopping in a burning building because 'the grocery department is waaaaayyyy over there and anyway, I can't see the fire' truly amazed me."
"Funny that you mention this....

Just yesterday I went to my local grocery store, and needed to use the restroom.
They have a public restroom in the back, which also serves as a staff locker room, with a small bank of lockers and a coat rack type closet. 

When I went in, there was a super sketchy looking guy, obviously not an employee who was rifling around in the pockets of the staff jackets hanging up in the closet. I called him on it, just said ""do you work here?"" which sent him immediately scurrying out the door and out of the store. So I told the customer service clerk what I'd seen so they could check the cameras and get a picture of this guy.

It's a tough call because I totally get the need for customer access to restroom facilities. But stores need to provide their staff with a safe, separate location for their break-room/storage/washroom facilities.  "
And did you offer her your last chip? No? Terrible customer service! /s
"You're exactly the kind of salesperson I rely on when I go clothes shopping.  I need to look my best, so sometimes I need the absolute truth."
"&gt;So everything is going fine until this dude walks in to buy a wrap

Am I missing something here? When someone says wrap I think tortilla shell with a meat and filling, why would you need an ID for that, even if they're 15?"
i mean its literally illegal to sell recalled items he did what he was required to do 
"I like to ask ‚Äúhow do you feel in it?‚Äù  If a customer is super excited about what they‚Äôre trying on, I‚Äôll keep the encouragement going.  If there‚Äôs a fit issue I‚Äôll point out exactly where that issue is‚Äîusually when something doesn‚Äôt fit right you can point it out in the shoulders (not typically an area of embarrassment) and then see if they want to try on the next size ‚Äújust to see how it looks‚Äù."
"I feel like he might have been at work and was like ""I've got a spare half an hour for lunch might as well return this charger"" and printed it at work? Only reasonable explanation I can think of "
"C: *calls corporate* They wouldn't even order an XL for me.

Corporate: We are so sorry ma'am, let me give you a gift card for 8000 dollars, we'll get you an XL and we will reprimand that sales associate. 
üòÇ"
"I have a Lemony Snicket tattoo on my thigh with hash marks in the space around it. I used to self harm, so both of my thighs are *covered* in scars. Each month I add another hashmark and they‚Äôre done over the scars I have. Congratulations on being sober!! Also, thank you for sharing because it‚Äôs comforting knowing that some people deal with things in a similar way ya know? "
"Yo.  So I was in here the other day and, funny story, I left in such a hurry that I accidentally grabbed your display case instead of some cash and my ID.  If I could just get those back that'd be great. "
"Get his image and company name out to your local clerks. He's gonna try it ~~agaun~~ *again*.

Edit: speelin"
"Thank you. I‚Äôm thinking hmm, need ID for whole wheat wrap or garlic and herb but maybe a white flour wrap can be sold to anyone."
Usually the age limit is 18/19/21 or wherever OP is from. Most companies that sell smokes/beer/liquor etc will tell their employees to ID everyone up to a certain age. Where I am from we are told 25 (legal age is 19). This is to avoid selling to minors who look like they are a year or 2 over the age limit but who are actually underage.
It‚Äôs probably sitting at home while she waits for the mail carrier to ‚Äúcontact her‚Äù about shipping an item. 
I think sometimes some people just can't control their bladders. Not saying it's an excuse as such but it does happen. They should wear adult diapers or pads if it's an issue.
Bet you anything that she never bothered to ship it out herself 
"This is my life all day every day.

""Stop contacting me""
""Who are you?
""You don't need to know""
""Well I can't stop contacting you if I don't know who to not contact""

I don't even cold call... I work in customer service... they are our customer... i honestly feel like working in customer service should be a requirement like school... to just teach basic human interaction..."
"35?

Pardon me, I'm no retail worker - I work in I.T.

But why the age limit of 35? Curious."
