"My SO and I were staying at a hotel with a free continental breakfast.  They had boiled eggs but my SO prefers hot breakfasts, so he microwaved two boiled eggs.  He opened the microwave door and one of them exploded.  He shrugged, grabbed the other one, and PUT IT IN HIS MOUTH.  Where it exploded and burned the inside of his mouth and his lips.  

I watched the whole thing happen from across the room, confused and powerless."

"I know a few couples that constantly post over the top lovey dovey stuff on Facebook. These are the same couples that regularly break up and get in major fights. Now every time I see someone in a couple post tons of mushy garbage, I just assume their relationship sucks and they're just trying to prove it to other people/themselves that their relationship is actually solid.

"The wife in Mrs Doubtfire. Not technically a villain, but we're meant to empathize with Williams' character because he's such a ""cool"" dad. But holy shit, he's undermining his wife at every step, offloading the unpleasant part of parenting (you know, discipline, stuff like that) onto her, forcing her to be the strict, lame, uncool mom while he gets to reap the rewards of being the cool dad who throws a ridiculous house party for his son's birthday."
"He didn't take it off during sex, he just never put it on at all. He grabbed a condom from the drawer, fiddled around with the wrapper so that it would seem like he was putting it on, but he didn't. I didn't notice it wasn't there for a few minutes. I reached down to feel the base of his dick to check on the condom when we changed positions, and I was like ""Wait, I don't feel the condom."" assuming that it had just slipped and started to come off inside me or something. He said ""There isn't one."" like it was no big deal. 

I panicked and scrambled away from him, went to the bathroom to get dressed, and then I attempted to stay calm and ask him just what in the actual fuck was he thinking. He knew I wasn't on the pill, we'd been sleeping together for months, we had always used condoms and I had never once implied in any way that I would be interested in doing anything other than using a condom. I asked him why he would pick up a condom and fiddle with it and not put it on. He proceeded to basically gaslight me and try to say that he ""Thought I knew"" and that I should really take some of the responsibility since I should've been able to feel the difference. I asked him in what world my knowing about it would have magically prevented me getting pregnant and him paying child support for 18 years. I was like ""You're the one with the dick, you knew you were supposed to have a condom on your dick, and you knew that you didn't. In fact, you straight up pretended to put it on. How am I in any way responsible for this?"" He proceeded to say that he wasn't pretending, and that he didn't put it on because his dick wasn't hard enough, which was total and complete bullshit because I literally had just been playing with it seconds beforehand and could definitely feel that it was plenty hard. He continued to refuse to admit what he did, kept changing his story and his flimsy reasoning, and saying that I should've known. I have never been so frustrated with another human being in my entire life. 

The next day I took the bus to planned parenthood and bought some plan B. I spent all day in bed feeling extremely sick after taking it. I wanted to drive to his place and strangle him, but I just sent some angry emails and stopped seeing him. I felt extremely violated and mad for a long time. I felt like I wanted to press charges or something, but I felt like it would just be a pointless he said/she said situation so I didn't."

"This is totally a boring adult thing, but my wife and I KonMaried our clothes together.

It's a method of purging old stuff where you pile all of your stuff by category into one place, (so like, first all the shirts, then all the pants you own, then every single pair of underwear, etc.) and then you pick each item up one by one, and if it brings you joy, you keep it, and if it doesn't, you thank it for its service, and you either donate, sell, or trash it.

It feels really stupid to thank your underpants when you're doing it by yourself, but when you're doing it with a person you love, you can do things like saying ""OMG, I love this shirt.  My dad gave this to me, and I think it's so funny, but I never wear it because it has a swear word on it."" and you can feel like you had that moment to treasure that memory together, and now you have the strength to throw away this thing that you are never going to use.

It feels really good, and it's also really romantic.  You learn a lot of things about eachother when you're talking honestly about your emotions about your shoes."

I'll regularly let you initiate sex, but then turn around and masturbate instead. You're not allowed to touch yourself, though, that's gross.

If you try to talk to me about any of this or ask how you can  make sex more enjoyable for me, I'll attack you and claim the problem is that you dress too sexy and need to lose weight, even at a BMI of 20."

"When I met my now boyfriend/soon-to-be-fiancé he was about to move out of state after having graduated college. We had instant chemistry, but with him moving in two weeks' time we didn't want to start anything serious. So on our second date (which was him coming to my house and cooking me dinner and us listening to swing music and reading and cuddling together after dinner - also a great frugal date) I suggested that we spend the next two weeks together making as many amazing memories as possible, and then when he moved on we would always have those memories be a bright shiny thing in our past to look back on because it wouldn't be tainted with expectations of making a relationship work forever. Being college kids we were both poor so everything had to be a frugal date. Some nights we drove around town in search of donuts, we cooked together and danced in the kitchen, played Mario kart and drank way too much wine. But our best idea was a road trip. One day I said hey let's take a road trip somewhere and the next day we packed up my hatchback and headed to Asheville, NC. We talked and sang and made out and ate sandwiches that we had packed, and walked around art galleries and book stores and then decided to go to a beach. By the time we got to Charleston it was late at night so we slept in the hatchback of my car (we had packed blankets and pillows just for this) with sheets covering the windows, it felt like a little fort or nest (lol love nest). It was spring, so it was a little cool which was perfect for car camping, and we had parked almost on the beach so we could hear the waves. The next morning we got up early and grabbed some blankets and went and watched the sunrise. Watching the sun come up over the East coast is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, and as it was rising he turned to me and told me that he loved me. The rest is history. He ended up not moving back home for the summer and then I moved with him when he got accepted to grad school and here we are.

"I designed a treasure hunt for my SO. A series of clues would lead him around places that were important to us until it led him to a hill overlooking or city where I'd be waiting with a picnic basket. 

I gave him the first clue, wished him luck and then went to set up the picnic. My roommate was on call in case he got stuck. Sure enough, 2 hours later, he finds me and the picnic! I was hugely surprised he solved it and he seemed to enjoy it. We ate our picnic and it all felt very romantic, looking at the city skyline and feeling just so content.

At the end, he said he had something to confess. Turns out he didn't really solve the scavenger hunt conventionally. He got stuck on one of the clues about an hour in and so he went on my laptop, went to recent docs, found the word doc that had all the clues and then skipped to the last one.  He said he did it because he didn't want me to be waiting for ages.  I thought that was so clever, wasn't even mad."
This happened to me and fucked me up for awhile. He even tried to make me think I was nuts to even think he did that even though it was obvious he did (i found the condom)..I remember feeling terrified and disgusting for a long time after. It’s an incredibly fucked up thing to do someone.

"I love waking you up in the mornings to the bed shaking because I'm masturbating angrily next to you, while I insist that sex is not on my mind at the moment.

I love to spend quality time with you by spending hours in the same house, without ever talking to you.

I will pretend you're the most important thing in my life. Yet in over 7 years of being together I never once managed to be there for your birthday.

I will propose to you but then a few months later say that our spark is gone and that you're not fun while pursuing a model I fell in love with. 

I will make you feel loved by saying things ""you're not funny, I never liked your sense of humor"" or by calling your hands with ""our"" engagement ring giant.

I will obsess over this model I work with and text her in the morning, dump you in the rain to pick her up, text her at night, have her as my desktop background because you're important to me. I will get angry if you try to stop our friendship because you think it's inappropriate because only she understand me.

I love making you feel needed by not participating any bit in household chores. When I unwrap a pizza and let the packing fall the ground it's my way of telling you I love you so much that I would allow you to clean up after me."

We would just walk, and talk, and vent (our financial situation was more than dire for a long time so there was plenty of venting) and it cost zero dollars. There was a lot of vulnerability and laughter and everything in between on those talks, and that's romance to me.

It really puts me off, and theres something about it that doesnt sit well with me. He openly acknowledges he wants people he went to school with to think hes doing well. (we're ten years out from high school mind)

Its that he needs others to be taking notice, i dunno, it makes me wary. He has promised me he wouldnt buy a car right now, but tells everyone he is going to constantly. 

Ive never pictured myself without him more than I have these last weeks. He cares about other peoples opinion of him more than us. Thats enough."
"I wear a ring every day. I never notice it unless I take it off for something -- then I check my finger every 10 seconds and feel extremely uncomfortable.

As for earrings, I've been lazy lately but I wore them every day for 10 years. I choose small ones that don't weigh much or swing around (usually studs but I do have some dangling ones) so I just forget about them. I can't remember ever even noticing them after the first few months.

I think it's just habit. I almost never wear makeup so putting on mascara or gloss will make me very very aware of the fact that I have something on my skin all day, but earrings I just forget."
"I was raped and sexually assaulted by two different guys within a week. Then I entered an abusive relationship that I would end up being in for over two years. By the end of it, he had alienated me from my friends. He also crushed my personality. I was formerly an outgoing, loud, personable, funny, life-of-the-party kind of girl. I became shy, quiet, constantly anxious, standoffish, and introverted. 

When I finally broke up with him and went no contact, I felt like my life would never be good again. I had no friends, I didn’t know how to be myself anymore, and I was so messed up that I didn’t even remember *how* to make friends. I thought I would never get that outgoing, fun girl that I used to be back. I missed how my life was before.

But eventually, after some healing and coping, I started to see sparks of that outgoing personality again. A loud joke at work here, a moment of confidence there. In time, I even started making some new friends. I realized I would never be exactly who I was before. I felt like I had been damaged. But I could repair the damage and become a stronger, wiser version of myself, and that’s what I did. 

Now I’m in an incredible relationship, I have some amazing friends, and my life is really great! I never thought I would be able to say that I’m an outgoing, loud, personable, funny, life-of-the-party kind of girl again, but I am! And I’m more than that. I’m strong, I’m careful with my heart, I don’t let people push me around, and I stand up for myself and others. "

After he left, I sent him the following text. 

""Hey Bud, 
   So I did some thinking after we hung out the other night. I really wasn't comfortable with you not using a condom, especially when I told you several times beforehand and also laid them out for you. It wasn't the first time this has happened, either. I need to trust anyone I hook up with to respect my choices, ESPECIALLY when it comes to my health and safety. With that in mind, I don't think we should hook up any more. I need to stay true to my own personal best practices."" 

He has texted me since asking to hook up but I just won't respond. I've since tested negative for all STDs.

I had such a fight to get diagnosed, to get any doctor to believe I wasn't just a 'melodramatic teenager' (quote from one GP) and I ended up misdiagnosed by a consultant, meaning no GP would revisit my case. It got to a point where I was bedridden, and talking about not going to uni and thinking of ending everything. 

I had a mild up turn, was able to walk slightly, so I chose to go to uni so I would be in a different county and would have to change GPs. It worked. In the space of a month I had a blood test proving what I had, and was discussing medications. Now I have a bachelors and a master degree, and am able to work full time in a new professional job (as long as I can work some days from home). I have a partner who I live with, independently on any carer, and I able to cook and clean for myself. What a difference 5 years makes. November is 5 years from diagnosis, 6.5 from getting sick"
"I feel like if you get into a fight and they try to put you down instead of just staying on topic of what the fight is about, like low blows etc, that's definitely insecurities. My husband has done that several times in heated fights in our past. At first I was seriously hurt and felt so awful about myself. But then I realized it was him projecting his insecurities onto me. He's now in therapy for those types of issues, being unhappy with himself etc, insecure when he has no reason to be."
"This is the one thing that bothers me. I'm not perfect, I don't claim to be and I don't want to be treated as such. Just as a normal person. 

The guy I'm seeing now has a terrible habit of constantly putting himself down and I fell into a trap of saying 'no you're not, etc etc' until I realised recently he does it to get compliments from me. 

I'm not hardhearted, but I give compliments when I want to, I'm not there to constantly bolster someone. It's exhausting. And we're not even 'together'. It's hard work and I can't carry all my shit, as well as someone else's. I'm hardly 'put together' I don't want to have to live like that. It's too much negativity when I'm already a negative person. I just don't fish for compliments for an ego boost. It's *my* job to fix my insecurities, not anyone else's. "
"This happened to me when I was younger and I was upset about it but couldn't really explain why and didn't feel like I had a ""right"" to be. I didn't do or say anything, I just went and got plan B in the morning. Which I paid for. I kept seeing the guy.

It took until reading a thread on Reddit a year or two ago and seeing other people call it sexual assault that how I felt about it made sense. I didn't consent to unprotected sex, in fact I'd specifically said that we had to use a condom. He ignored me and did what he wanted (to me) regardless. Shitty feeling.

I would raise hell if it happened now. "

"Picture it: Indiana, December 1999. The world was nervous with anticipation of the coming millenium. None more so than two best friends. Both, young, beautiful, and desired. Both had attracted the attention of a mysterious man. His body was like Adonis but with the mind of Einstein. Many a night was spent trying to win his affections. The friendship was torn apart. On the eve of the millenium, as the ball dropped in Times Square, he finally chose one of them. The other vowed never to speak to either of them again. And though she had won the man, she could never compete with his charm that had attracted her to him in the first place. She, too, was left alone, when he found other young beautiful women to fight over him. r/askwomen, that girl was me. The other girl was my friend, P. We both ended up happily married to other men and had families. But we didn't do it together. The moral of the story is: don't let a little sausage come between two friends.  "

Does Beatrice count? I wanted to hate her because she's a shitty mother (and a very shitty not!grandmother) and who reminded me of my mom but seeing her as a sassy and intelligent young woman mourning over lost time, family, and chances before she became a cynical, bitter adult made me see her as a person and not just an antagonistic plot device to give Bojack a sad story. Also the dementia episodes were R O U G H. "

"The most striking memory I have was one work-night evening at a market. I think I was already 40 (not too many years ago).  I was packing groceries into my bags and the man checking out after me ordered me to smile.

I started to reply (I think I was going to say ""shut the fuck up,"") but he took my lips parting as acquiescence. 

Then he uttered in the most smeared-smug-smarmy-sticky sound: ""good girl.""

I stopped, set my bags down. I suddenly stood taller than I am, looked him at him squarely and fairly spat *I am not your girl*.  Mind your fucking mouth.""

He stepped back like I had slapped him.  

I grabbed my bags and walked out of the market like I was wearing a cape, my shoulders pulled all the way down my back, my chin parallel to the ground, head held high.

I didn't feel very much like I was tall or caped.  I felt like I needed to wash my hair and cut my nails.  I have no idea how I responded with cool.  I was entirely unsettled.  "

"When I was 31 weeks pregnant with my first baby my husband had a cardiac arrest. It took them over 20 minutes to revive him while I stood there in shock. When we met with the ICU doctor, he told me that had a 50-50 chance of making it and if he did, he might have a lot of brain damage. During CPR he had aspirated vomit and now was battling chemical pneumonia. 

He was the breadwinner in our household since I still had a year of school left. We had a mortgage and bills to pay but I had no access to his accounts. Crappy life insurance and on top of it all, it happened in late November and I still had 4 final exams to write.

In the end, he pulled through. He spent 1 week in a coma and another week being monitored. We brought him home in December and he made a complete recovery. If I believed in miracles, this would be one. We had our baby while he was on leave so he got to spend the first month of daughter's life at home with us. We now have 3 children and he's never had an episode since."

"I left my ex husband, fully believing that I would never be in a real relationship again because that one left me so utterly exhausted. At my lowest point, I was living with him in an office above an actual junkyard he was managing on the other side of the country from everyone I knew, supporting all of us (including our two babies) with student loan money, dodging fists and worse, and spending my nights drinking in a bathtub instead of sleeping and wondering if I shouldn't just call time of death on my life.

4 years later, I'm back in my home state, my credit score has largely recovered  (it was 720 when I met him and 519 when I left, thanks to his opening credit cards in my name and not paying them back,) I'm living in a cute rental with land and chickens, and am with the absolute love of my life. I found him unexpectedly six months after I left and had no expectations whatsoever. We've been together for three years and he blows my mind every fucking day.

Best part: My daughters went through a lot of bullshit with their biodad, so when my SO came around, they didn't really know what to do with that. Recently, my oldest said to me, ""I'm glad we have him, mom. He's calm and he makes me feel better.""

Literally all I ever wanted."
"My family rule was like that too. My mom stayed home though so there was someone to ask, we just got told no. We could ask for and eat a snack before 3pm, on school days that meant we had five minutes at most, it was so we wouldn't ruin our appetites, and we were usually told no. I once got lectured for ""stealing"" ten chocolate chips! I was grounded for tw weeks. My mom was a terrible cook, every meat she made was the cheapest cut, cooked unseasoned and nearly jerky in consistency. She would make her and my dad better things and claim we didn't like them (even when we had never had most of them and did like the rest!) I was considered a picky kid (no wonder) and was very underweight and small, to the point of being tested for every vitamin deficiency and even parasites! When my parents divorced my mom stopped cooking. I shopped and cooked for us and both my petite little sister and I started to gain weight. I weighed 72 pounds at the beginning of freshman year, by the end I had gained enough to trigger puberty fully and by sophomore year I had grow four inches and gained nearly 50 lbs.

"It's not necessarily a rule but the consequence. 

We had a big house which was expensive to heat and cool. We lived in the Southern US where it could easily be 105 degrees, 100% humidity, any given day between April and October. My dad is scrawny and gets cold very easily, and it has to be very, VERY warm for him to even think of switching on the AC or turning the temperature down. He had lots of rules surrounding touching the thermostat, when we could and couldn't adjust it, what temperatures were ok and when, and he finally decided that he was in charge of the thermostat and the rest of us couldn't change it. 

One day, my brother and I were hot, and talking about how ridiculous his rule was, so we went and changed the thermostat so the house could be some semblance of comfortable. 

My dad got fed up, went into the litterbox, pulled out a little hardened piece of cat poop, and taped it to the temperature control panel on the thermostat to prevent us from changing it. My mom went ballistic. My brother and I thought it was hilarious. My mom made him take the poop off and disinfect it to high heaven, but 12-15 years later we still tell this story about my dad at any opportunity we can. "

"I used to know someone who comes from a rich family (not millionaires rich, but both parents doctors rich) who wanted to go into politics. Specifically, she started working for a political group that works in food advocacy and food access in poor neighborhoods.

Every time I saw her, she would spend the whole time making fun of the kids she worked with. Her job involved teaching a lot of gardening and cooking classes, and she found it hysterically funny that so many of the kids she worked with couldn't recognize an onion or a squash on sight.

Apparently, despite working in fucking food advocacy, the idea that some people grow up without working fridges, working stoves, or parents who have time to cook was completely alien to her. She honestly just assumed the kids she was working with didn't know what raw vegetables looked like because they were stupid.

I would have only been mildly annoyed if she were a volunteer, but that moron was drawing a significant salary from a fucking nonprofit."
"- How much ongoing effort and time they take. Training, socializing, walks, exercise, vet visits, etc. These are living creatures with feelings and needs; you can't just ""get"" one because it would be cool to have. 

- How much of an effect they have on your lifestyle. You can't take a spontaneous trip or decide to spend the night with someone because you have a dog at home you have to think of now. And if you don't own your home, be prepared to be significantly limited in the number of places you can live, or be ready to pay a lot in pet fees (they're not deposits anymore; they're ""pet fees"" and a lot of places charge them just for the privilege of having a pet)

- The cost. OMG the cost. Teeth cleaning, which is a yearly thing, is at least $200. The emergency vet visit I had to make because she somehow got into ibuprofen was $1000. She had surgery on her knee which was $3500, then 2 yrs later another surgery that was $2000. Grooming is $50 every 6 weeks. When I rented, I had to drop a $500 pet fee and another $25/month on pet rent. Dog walker is about $300/month. There is nothing cheap about having a dog. 

- I would have also researched more about food and treat choices and the best foods for dogs. 

- I absolutely would have used a harness instead of a collar from day one. 

- I would have invested in professional training, not just for obedience but to help me better understand her needs and cues.  

- I would have gotten pet insurance when she was a puppy. 

- I would have realized the extent of the accommodations I needed to make when I work all day. She's a companion dog and really shouldn't be alone all day. And you can't keep a dog in a crate all day long (it's cruel) I ended up getting another dog to keep her company, which worked out great, and I also have a dog walker come in 4-5 days a week to walk them and let them out while I'm working.  

- I also wasn't prepared for how much I would totally and completely adore her. I went from liking dogs to total crazy dog lady. I had no idea she (and the second dog I got a few years later) would have such distinct personalities, such expressive body language and cues, and the ability to develop such a strong connection. Being completely responsible for my own dog as opposed to having a family dog when I was growing up was a totally different experience. My dogs changed the way I viewed animals in general and certainly how I viewed pets and their quality of life. I started volunteering at animal shelters, doing dog and cat food drives around Christmas, and really opening up my eyes to the needs of animals. 

Granted, none of this would have swayed my decision, but it would have been nice to know going in.

I got the doses of misoprostol wrong, and it was too early on for a medical abortion even - things I would find out years later (the dose is something like 12 pills and you have to do the abortion between weeks 8 and 12, I was 5 weeks along).

I bled half to death, passed out, was taken to the ER where many doctors were able to stop the bleeding. Got checked out, doctors assumed I miscarried. Now doctors theorize I could've been carrying twins, and I passed one fetus but didn't get to pass the other.

I only found out I was still pregnant 4 months later when I still hadn't gotten my period and was violently ill every day."
"I met him online. Which may seem lame but it was such a great experience. With online dating you can establish if you get along immediately, generally avoiding the awful first date where you realize you have nothing to talk about.

"Something my Mom used to casually say was that my sister and I were not allowed to get married until we are 30.

I'm 29 and she is 27, neither of us have been married or plan to get married any time soon.  Now Mom jokes that she wasn't serious about that rule, I can tell she doesn't want to rush us but would like grandchildren."
I work in a building on the National Mall in DC and slow walkers are the bane of my existence. Especially whole families who slowly waddle taking up the whole sidewalk like a goddamn parade of idiots. 
"Mine is a long story. Context: I work in retail, and one night recently I was the closing manager and the only other person working was a 17 year old female. We’re both relatively small, maybe 210lbs between the both of us. 

My associate was going about doing her closing duties and I was going around checking to make sure the store looked okay for the next day, because we had about 60-45 minutes before we actually closed. The store was empty. 

But this guy came in, so I went up to greet him and see if he needed help. Before he opened his mouth I could tell something was off. But he asked if we sell shorts. I asked him what kind he meant, because we are a beach supply/souvenir store. His response was “anything”. So I offered to show him to the board shorts. He followed me entirely too closely to the back of the store and said “You’re very pretty”, which I kind of just smiled and nodded. But when I didn’t answer he decided to yell the compliment at me. So I just said thank you and left him with the shorts. 

I didn’t wander too far because I thought he might try to steal. But I stayed far enough away that he couldn’t try to hit on me anymore. I told my associate to stay away from him because he just didn’t seem like he was all there. Talking to himself, acting like he was in a rush, knocking things over, dirty clothes... 

Eventually he came over to me with about 15 different pairs of board shorts and a few speedos, mixed between adult and kids sizes, and asked if he could try them on. I got him a room and gave him the item limit. He asked if I would stay to tell him if anything “looked good” and kind of licked his lips. I half-laughed out of nerves and said I had other stuff to do but if I was around, sure. Because customer service is still the main part of my job. 

He came out and said nothing fit and went back in with another handful. The next time, I was accidentally back there and he wanted to show me a pair. He had removed his shirt to try on shorts, for whatever reason, and had them sitting at just above pube level. Immediately I backed away. 

He proceeded to pull them away from his body, saying they felt too loose, so I turned away because I wasn’t sure if I was going to see unwanted penis or not, and put a few clothing racks between us. At that point I said they looked fine because I wanted him out of my store. But, he walked back over to look at more shorts so I went about cleaning up the mess he was making. I found a gigantic pill bottle with the label torn off among the discarded shorts. 

While he was “shopping” he was asking me what grade I was in and if I go to the local high school. He become immediately disinterested when I told him I’m 26, because he “didn’t think I was so old”. At that point I stopped with the customer service. If he was stealing they could take it out of my check, for all I cared. I was done with the whole situation. 

Then I heard him harassing my associate. Asking her age, relationship status, what school she went to, what car she drove, and if he could buy her Taco Bell after work. I dropped what I was doing and told him he were about to close and asked if he wouldn’t mind paying and leaving. Of course, he didn’t buy anything, but he did leave without a fuss. 

Technically we weren’t closed yet so I couldn’t lock the doors, but we noticed that he walked away from the store instead of getting in a car. Normally every night the cashier takes the trash to the dumpster around the back of the building where there are no lights. Also we have outdoor merchandise along the storefront that has to be brought inside or chained up.I told my associate they could deal with the trash in the morning and I called my boyfriend to come sit outside while we did the outside duties together. My boyfriend walked her all the way to her car until she was in it with the doors locked while I sat in my car with the doors locked. 

We didn’t see the guy again, and in hindsight I probably could have called the police. Also I’m pretty sure he stole a pair of speedos and a few hangers... Somehow. "

"Why do you see women as a separate freaking species? We aren't a monolithic group. We are all individuals with our own personal opinions.

Also, when I'm in a relationship, all I think about is how awesome it is to have sex with all kinds of other girls, but when I break up with you, I immediately realise what a mistake I've made and try everything in my power to get back together but by then you will have moved on and that will make me try to kill myself."""
Not accurate I would say.  Too kind to have that sort of killer instinct.  
"I have a friend that does this, but with entire outfits. His wife gets mad that he looks like a hobo on vacation but he is very committed to his choice. "
"I just didn't think about it. Essentially gave up trying to catch him or confront him, just assumed it kept happening. It was weird how quickly everything just feels fine again. There were reasons to stay, so I focused on those and told myself that he loved me most, even if he was always looking outside our marriage. 

But I wanted to comment because while I went on to ignore it and pretend he loved me, he couldn't. He left me and our kids high n dry. He had hated every minute of being married. Hated being a father. I thought he was just a wanderer, but his cheating was just a symptom of his bigger issues. 

Not trying to preach, but sometimes, even when you're trying to do everything right and forgive.... it's not always up to you. "

"I started dating a guy in high school (junior year). We stayed together all through high school and college. After we both graduated college, we figured ""I guess we should be engaged. It's the next step."" Neither of us were fully in it but after being together so long, plus the fact we did love one another, we just went with it. Yeah yeah I know. We were young. We went to the local jewelry store to pick out our wedding band sets and our families were thrilled. 


A year passes and in that time we both realized that even though we did love each other, it just wasn't what we wanted. Our split went really smooth and we both walked away as good friends to this day. He moved on and is with a great girl that fits him wonderfully. I ended up at a local bar with some friends one night and guess who I saw? That guy that sold us the wedding bands over a year ago. We hit it off and now him and I are expecting our first child in December. 


Life works in the strangest ways and sometimes you just need to hold on and wait for time to pass. When I met my current SO I never thought of him in any way other than a cute salesman and he never was in my mind until that day that I saw him again and figured why the hell not. I've never been happier and the feeling in my heart was completely different compared to the last time. I just knew this time it was right.  :) "
"I mean, I don't know what the general consensus for these things really is, but it seems that at least a decent amount of people seem to believe that persistence is romantic or supposed to win a woman over, whereas I find it to be incredibly disrespectful, and creepy.

"We went to the shelter ""to begin our research"" two years ago and came back with two huge tomcats. 

One loves routine, so much that he finds weekends a bit confusing. He'll also come find us every night at 10pm and meow until one of us goes to bed. If we ignore him he'll go away for 20 minutes and then come back again, until we go to bed.

The other one has no concept of personal space. When you're cuddling him he is right up in your face, sticking his nose in your mouth and your nose in his ear. If you shut him out of a room he will throw himself against it until he's let in (he's 8kg so it's pretty difficult to ignore).

Basically, they rule the roost. "

"I think it's awesome. Men should have just as many options for family planning as women.

The idea that condoms or a vasectomy are really the two only options in their hands is silly. If I were a sexually active man, especially a young man, I'd be terrified of getting a girl pregnant. Your options are a condom- and the rest is on her. You're hoping she's responsible with taking pills, or has an implant, or some kind of IUD, *and* that none of that fails. If it does fail, and she gets pregnant, it's ultimately her body and her choice. 

It amazes me that men have waited this long to put more than a condom between them and half a lifetime of paying child support. "
"Relying on themselves and knowing they can rely on themselves. Be it emotionally or even financially, by 25 I feel you need to be working to stand on your own two feet.

To realise your role in things when you've made mistakes, and know it's within your power to fix things.

That to me is adulthood, and I leave it broad because I don't feel like people are defined by what they experience - They're defined by how they react."
"""People who ask whether women like this fashion trend or guys with x feature, what other answer could you possibly be expecting other than 'some women like it and some women don't'?""

Seriously, when they word their questions like ""How do you feel about this fashion trend or guys with x feature?"", it feels slightly less stupid to me. (Even though if they still took a minute to think about the possible answers their question would get, they'd realize that some women like x and some women don't like it.)"

"he helped me move what little furniture i had out of my old house so we could bring it to our new place when we moved in together. he left all of it in the back of his work truck — completely exposed — for a week, during which it rained several times. he was not only taking the truck to work with him all day long and leaving my shit open for anyone to grab, but every time he got home from work i told him i needed his help bringing it in (literally a 5 foot walk from the truck to the garage) and he kept saying “okay, okay” and then blowing me off or waiting so long i got distracted and totally forgot or it got too late and i fell asleep. anyway, one by one i’ve been finding all of my shit destroyed. i moved across the country to be close to him and all i had was some bedroom furniture which i offered to sell to put towards rent but he kept insisting i keep it. he left two plush mattress covers in the back of the truck and i found them soaked and covered in mold. that’s ~$60-70 right there. i only found them when i helped HIM move something out of the truck. my unfinished $120 wooden dresser ended up getting stashed at his job because he had to take it out to make room for work tools. saw it yesterday when i nicely brought him coffee during lunch and the wood is totally warped. my $170 bed frame is missing. my hamper that may have had other things in it is missing. my nightstand is missing. but i’m supposed to “get over it” and “stop being overdramatic”. ooookay.

I'm just getting started in my career, coming up on my first real promotion after school &amp; 4 years of working. Meanwhile he's been working 10 years,  saved hundreds of lives, delivered 20 babies by hand, and he knows more ""real life skills""  than I do.

 I never saw myself dating someone with ""less education"" than me until I met him. He taught me that there is much more to learn and be good at outside of formal education. Yeah, sometimes his grammar isn't perfect, but I'm more concerned about how he can contribute in real ways to our life together. I think it's about finding someone who you have no problems respecting; their knowledge and skill set may be different but you recognize it as valuable."

Do you want me to get pregnant *against my will?* Have you grown a brain tumor so large that you don't give a shit about my feelings or my health or my *life* anymore?

I have also as a result dated a few ugly guys.

"I knew a girl who moved here from abroad for a 3 month summer internship. She bought brand new furniture and kitchen equipment, basically everything you would need for living and all of it was high end stuff. But she never cooked anything anyway she always ate out.

At the end of the internship she just abandoned all the stuff. Hired some people to move it out to the kerb and left it by the bins. I would guess there was at least £10k worth of stuff. Someone asked if they could take some of her stuff, even offered money for it but she said she could never let anyone use her stuff second hand because it was hers. So bizarre.

Someone later told me she was the daughter of someone very high up and important in the Nigerian government. Her father bought her way onto various internship schemes to 'train' her and eventually let her manage some of his oil refineries.

It's just a level of money I could never fathom. "

And if you're referencing Anaconda (which I think you are), that entire song was meant to be a parody/challenge of sexualization of black women and their asses. The ""skinny bitches"" Nicki is referencing in that song aren't necessarily every thin woman, it's white models held up as the standard of beauty black women are judged by. (Edit: the same people sir mix a lot called ""knock kneed bimbos walking like hoes"".) A big part of the entire Thing she was doing with that song was challenging how it's okay for Sir Mix a Lot and other *men* to sexualize black women and their asses and rate women by their personal sexual tastes, but when black women say they're using their looks and rate themselves as more attractive than others it's now ~controversial~.

I envied those friendships more than anything else.  I think you have to make the choice - at a certain point - of the man you want to be.  And I tell you at that time you need a parent or a friend.  And if you've learned to hate your parent by then and you have no friends... then you're all alone.  And being alone - that's so hard.  I was alone.  And that sent me to a truly dark place.

"But didn't he put her down, saying he needed to be with a Marilyn and not a Jackie? 

Edit: Jackie, not Marilyn. Brain fart I wouldn't have found without /u/mcpgn"
"I graduated from a state college with a 2.2 GPA, a useless major, and was extremely depressed. The “friends” I had made in my sorority were evil and mean to me, I tried suicide by overdose but mid-overdose I looked at my 8 year old cat and realized I could never leave her because she depended on me.

Skip ahead a year and I got into a veterinary technical school in the city, (440 applicants, 40 accepted), made it on the dean’s list, got an invitation from a national honors society, just got a scholarship that covers the rest of my tuition AND my metrocard for the months I’m in school. Got placed in an internship that introduced me to the world of animal research and animal welfare in labs and found my direction in life. 

I’m now still a student, stressing about tests but doing well (3.89 GPA), working at a seeing eye dogs facility with the puppies (awesome gig), and much happier and healthier. My friends from my program are a lot more supportive and friendly than my friends from college. All thanks to my cat, not only for saving my life but for making me realize what my true passion was: working for animals. :) "
"A man trying to pick me up while I was waiting for my friends to get their tickets at the cinema, when I was 11. I don't remember most of the conversation, it involved telling me how pretty I was and what was I doing alone (my friends were a few meters away). It ended with him telling me I had an awesome body and that he especially liked my boobs, and me shuffling uncomfortably and being very scared, then running off to my friends."
"When people respond with an insult like ""sheep."" Don't address why they disagree. Don't state any alternative evidence. Don't even say they disagree - just immediately name call. It's so gross. "
"Genes. I've smoked cigarettes, drink more than occasionally, and don't think I knew what water was for besides swimming for the 13 years I lived in the desert. Stupid genes win every time."
"When my fiancée and I first started dating we would go to thrift stores together and look for stuff we needed and had a blast rifling through all the strange stuff you can find at a thrift store. Our second date was at a thrift center in my neighborhood where all the clothes are a dollar. We had so much fun picking out the clothes and trying on hilarious t shirts together.

Also, going to the dirt cheap produce market to buy groceries and cook each other meals. We still always go grocery shopping together now that we live together and it always feels like a date to me."
"Strangers asking me for my number. Flirting with me at work where I can't directly reject you or else I might get fired for being mean to a customer. Calling me nicknames like ""babe"" ""sweetheart"" ""beautiful"" ""darling"" if you aren't my SO."
"The thing where you put the strainer in the pot and tip them both over? Yeah thats dumb, you're going to melt your strainer or burn your hand holding your strainer inside your pot while tipping it. Smh if it ain't broke don't fix it."
"A couple months ago I was counting pennies to go buy a bag of rice from target. Couldn't make it to my therapy appointments because I couldn't put gas in my car. Was literally barely scraping by. But I got a job walking dogs (which has since become boring but allows me to afford food and gas and I have even started saving a big) and one morning I went out for a walk and was so grateful to be able to do that. This doesn't apply to everyone because not everyone has this privilege, but I have two fully functioning legs and arms and that makes me ecstatic. I can run and jump and use my hands to make stuff and I know that rich people would give away all of their money to be able to do that if they couldn't. Two of my aunts have MS and can hardly walk anymore or pick up a glass to drink from. I have all of the mobility that humans typically have and I won't ever take it for granted. I just force myself to look at the positives and recognize when I'm dwelling on the negatives and actively work to focus my mind on something else."

This is a controversial opinion? People think new coldplay is better???
How to cook. I stand firm by that for everyone though  
"Is that a punishment? I mean if I were raped and in an act of sympathy, the gods were like ""well you can turn the dude to stone if it makes you feel better"" I'd probably be like ""yeah sweet, that's the least you could do."""
"I can answer on behalf of anybody who's visited my home:

A life-size stuffed Batman doll.  (He'd be 6' tall standing up.)

He was a carnival prize like 10 years ago, and we've had him for so long that we kind of don't notice him any more.  He just sits on the couch or at the dining room table or whatever.  And then someone new comes over and practically jumps out of their skin thinking he's an actual person dressed in a weird costume hanging out in our house.  

I sincerely do mean to warn people I just always forget because I'm so used to Batman..."
i have to wonder if these people have ever considered...their own fathers. i have to assume most of these people don't have rich sexy dads so like...how do they think that happened?
That's not petty. That's putting a missing stair on the map.
He read to you AND played with your hair? Damn. 
"I can't tell you how many times a guy has condescendingly told me "" you don't need makeup"" or ""stop wearing makeup"".  They just don't understand. When you're a woman and you're ugly, people are cruel. It's like being a guy and being very smelly. No one likes the smelly kid. It's the same with women, no one likes the woman who looks tired. I've been told so many careless and hurtful things by men and women alike about my naked face. People don't think twice about it. It's cruel. "
"Yup, for sure. I tend to bottle my emotions and ignore them so sometimes, when things get a bit too much, they threaten to bubble over. 

If I know I'm being unreasonable and don't want to actually raise the issue, I'd journal. I'd write letters to express my annoyance and just cuss as much as I want to (or don't) on those letters. I've never sent these letters and would never, ever would because they're petty as hell, but it usually helps. "
"Eat less.

Diets that eliminate particular foods or food groups are not for me, because realistically I'm not going to go the next 60 years without cheesecake or beer or whatever.

I eat the same stuff I always ate, just less of it. "
"It's not silly :) Basically we do digital marketing campaigns for companies, so consulting on their websites, writing a lot of content, SEO services, PPC ads, social media, etc. "
"Swim goggles work beautifully for me. I look ridiculous, but only my cat sees me do it and he’s already judgmental AF."
"Neither baking soda nor lemon juice should ever go on your skin.
"
"That's the kind of thing you store in a closet, and only pull out to show friends... Displaying it like that is really distasteful and sends the wrong message."
Woa!
"How long did it take you to see the salary you do now/successfully open the two studios? Did you see yourself making this much when you started?

Also, if they're pics you can share (or even describe), what are your favorite tattoos that you've done?"
"It's easier to just say ""he's a rapist"" rather than come up with a metaphor."
"Wear real metals. if I wear cheap/fake metals I get the sensation of discomfort. It's not pain, it's not even itchiness... I'm just aware that the earrings are there."
"Yep, happened to me. I saw him pretend to put the condom on and then toss it to the side. I asked him if he had it on and he said yes. I asked again and he said no and that it's ""better like this"". He was super nonchalant about having tried to trick me.

I sent him home, which seemed to surprise him somehow. We never talked again. It definitely made me more distrustful of men afterwards. I'm not confident I would feel the difference and I'm forever afraid it will happen and I won't notice."
"Along with that, Harley Quinn. 

Because she is the story of the smart, ambitious girl who fell in love with a manipulative abuser, and even though she is *smart*, it's very hard for her to see his evilness and escape. Textbook abusive relationship. I guess that resonated with me.

 She commits evil deeds for him like a pawn because she loves him, and when she's away from him she acts like a ditz because playing dumb is what protects her from getting hit. She is smart, but she doesn't let it show. "
There's a website called Skillshare that's basically like YouTube but just for educational videos! I use it for my job to learn more about ecommerce related topics but there's all sorts of interesting instructional videos on there!
Dr Doom. Everything he does is for his own people. 
"In Japan, heart surgeon. Number one. Steady hand. One day, Yakuza boss need new heart. I do operation. But, mistake! Yakuza boss die! Yakuza very mad. I hide in fishing boat, come to America. No english, no food, no money. Darryl give me job. Now I have house, American car, and new woman. Darryl save life. My big secret: I kill yakuza boss on purpose. I good surgeon. The best!"
"Yes.  Snape was ok with Voldemort killing Lily’s innocent baby as long as Lily was spared.  He was ok with a baby dying and with putting the woman he supposedly love through the pain of losing her husband and child.  

Dumbledore I don’t like simply because he allowed Harry to live in an abusive home.  Maybe it was the safest place for Harry to live because of the blood bond, but Dumbledore could have insured Harry was treated well while he was there."
"I'm going to disagree with you on the Sharpay one lol, I'm still super salty about this. While it's obvious she had talent, let me paint a picture of my HS theatre department. The good roles ALWAYS went to the pretty, popular theatre pets, even if they did not suit the part. There were plenty of people who auditioned for the roles who had acting and singing chops, who were average to attractive physically, but did not take any theatre classes (too many extracurriculars, shy, new to theatre). They didn't stand a chance. There was a girl in my year who received a prominent singing role in our main show even though her voice was meh, because she was pretty and had been in theatre for 4 years of school, and the theatre teachers liked her. They didn't want to take chances on the newbies and it showed when ""I Am Sixteen Going on Seventeen"" came out all high and brittle. I watched people who actually did have secret passions and talents for musical theatre basically decide never to audition again through HS because it was incredibly obvious the teachers played favorites."
The Catalonia indepence referendum that's happening today
I'll add that one reason why so many of us are nice and friendly to strange men is because they can go from alright to aggressive in like .5 seconds.
Being followed by someone who you can't just give your wallet to if they catch you.
"Well I have a history degree. I make nowhere near $150k a year and I don't actually use my degree for my job.

I can talk your ear off about WWII though."
"I think its hilarious that my parents did almost all they could to keep me away from boys when i was a teenager, and now a decade later, mum is dropping hints about how wonderful it would be if my boyfriend and i had a 'happy accident'. 

All i can think when she says that stuff is ""so *now* you want me to have unprotected sex?!"" "
"I think it's because some people break up as soon as they have the impulse, and get over the relationship once they've ended it, and some people wait and drag it out, and by the time they finally do break up, they already kind of went through the grieving process. 

It also has a ton to do with whether you dumped someone or got dumped. "
"Well, shit, what do I know. 

I mean, I've only been in games making hiring decisions for over a decade."
"You either die a spongebob, or you live long enough to see yourself become a squidward"
"Your mum is a spy, mate."
"It's helped me identify patterns in my life that I couldn't see on my own, and let me realize that a lot of the things in my life that I wrote off as just being ""the way I am"" are not actually conducive to building the life I want. "
"I'm not a fan of AC/DC OR KISS, I think the lead singer of R.E.M sounds like a goat, and I only like *some* of Queen's songs. I guess I'm just not that into most classic rock."
"Awesome! Men should have more options for birth control, and it also makes it easier for women who don't do well on hormones so they don't have to rely solely on condoms."
"i mean, my bias is showing but because my father's a tradesman i've always been on the side of pro-trades/trades are just as important as academia. i'm not going to turn up my nose at a profession that put food on my table as a child, and the same goes for custodians/etc etc. what matters to me is that any partner treats me right and our personalities mesh moreso than his occupation."
"It took about six months before I stopped thinking he was going to break up with me or otherwise start acting shitty at any given point. But also, amazing. "
"&gt; she was the daughter of someone very high up and important in the Nigerian government.

I think her brother has been sending me emails."
She went straight from Vice President to dictator.  I was very proud.  
"I think 99% of popular hip hop is sexist and I hate it. I don't care if it's catchy, if it has sexist lyrics, it can go fuck itself "
"I love you too

Edited: I guess my answer isn't funny enough, but after five years with a man who never said ILY, it's really meaningful to me that I'm with someone where I finally get to be the one who says the ""too."""
"Growing up, one of the few things my parents would allow for us to stay home from school was puking.

Guess who learned how to puke on command at the age of 9?

Yup."
"We make smoothies for breakfast every morning. I bring grapes as a snack, and this week we made chili for lunch! It's finally feeling like fall here, which means it's crockpot season!"
"Nothing screams ""someone cheated"" like a couple under ~50 with a joint Facebook account."
This changes microwaved rice from something that should only be eaten in dire circumstances to something that is better than fresh cooked. Best tip ever. 
"It's kind of hilarious to me because he literally did everything she asked of him but no, HE'S the bad guy. I love Sarah but the black-and-white thinking kills me."
"I am so on her side. Yes, I get it, he loves his kids, but he's not a responsible adult."
I love a lot of different kinds of music... And I have tried getting into Beyoncé and Drake.. and I just don't understand their appeal. 
"I. Was. Pissed. 
At the time, I didn’t know it was the name for it. 
We weren’t seeing one another exclusively, we weren’t “dating”. He just slipped it off right st the end, it happened so fast. I got out of bed, (my bed) and stepped on it. And I didn’t say anything. He got up, got dressed and I walked him to the door &amp; I said:
“Oh, that thing where you take the condom off at the last second? Don’t fucking do that.”

And I never heard from him again."
Seriously that would make me break up with someone holy crap!
"I dated a guy for a few months who was always leaving his phone unlocked and complaining that it was dead. So I was like oh my god LOCK YOUR PHONE. 

He didn’t know that was a thing. He was 26 and had had an iphone for years. Never knew what the lock button did. 

He also asked “Who is that” when i posted an older picture of Obama on FB. We didn’t last very long at all. "
