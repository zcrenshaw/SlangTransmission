"Oh, yeah. My manager fired them the same morning when he came in. Didn't even wait for end of business. He cut off over 500 devices, at a call center, at the beginning of their day. He said it was the greatest feeling ever.

I now know we have a 1 warning policy and i can hang up. I've only had a handful of other irate customers, but plenty of stupid ones  that i'd be more than happy to share in the future. "
"I would go to HR if you can now and at least have something written up by them. She is creating a hostile work environment and creating stress in your life that you shouldn't have to deal with. Even if they dont do anything, at least that will be logged and can be used at a later date. Show them everything you have now."
"Tech support stands for technical support, not technology support - so you are most definitely welcome here. Your tales of bowling machines provide some nice variety vs. the standard computer stuff."
"please tell me you fired that customer.

customers like that should never be tolerated since it only encourages that kind of behavior.

as a tech you shouldn't have to tolerate that kind of vial hatred in communication, especially in any environment where your speaking to professionals as would be expected when dealing with IP phones."
"Thats like crashing your car on the way to work, calling your insurance company and demanding that it be uncrashed so you can finish driving to work.

They can crash it after you get there, so it can be fixed while you are at work."
"&gt; They will never know what happened 2 minutes earlier in the conference room they were all sitting in.

Someone should compile an itemized statement of cost, so the C-layer will know the true cost of having a compliance manager on board.
"
Documentation is critical. This is also why I prefer chat and email. If it’s a phone call or in-person I do my best to document immediately after the fact—and usually send a copy of that to the parties involved.
"Medical analogy: Imagine calling them, stating it to be a matter of life and death, for a stubbed toe. "
"I'm a facilities guy now, so I even get asked to fix the wall..."
"I have something to add on the ""no email account"" part, it *used to* work that way. If you had a Windows Mobile PDA and Outlook on your PC, they could sync without a common account.  
So, it sounds like a strong possibility that he upgraded to Win7 and the USB drivers for his PDA stopped working, then support told him to get a newer device, and the new device doesn't work that way.  
Doesn't make the user's inability to remember passwords and expectations to use teamviewer on his tablet and less ridiculous, but could explain why he was so insistent that what he was trying was possible."
"So, when are they going to drop him?"
"If it plugs into the wall, we've been asked to fix it..."
Absolutely this. It's time to go on the offensive. She is slandering you to the rest of the office and you have documented proof on your side. It's time to nip this shit in the bud.
So that's his you become a wizard... Just push random buttons?
"""I need an ambulance right away!  My left arm stopped working!""  
  
*Ambulance arrives to find that patient's left arm was a little sore when (s)he lifted it*"
[This amused me](https://i.imgur.com/VyAk6y3.png)
 That's so much better than I was hoping.
how has no one fired this customer yet?
"Unless it's a standalone wall, the wall is plugged into another wall."
Right? Today is actually my 1 year mark here. Its honestly the best job i've ever had. 
"*Potter pushes button, turns on TV*

&gt;Hagrid: Yer a wizard, Harry!"
"I am not in tech support, I work in a very different business.. However I still find this habit to be valuable.  I will have a 10 minute phone call with someone and then write out a short email stating ""Mr. Scojajac, as per our discussion on 'date' I will be 'doing stuff we discussed' and 'other junk we talked about'.  If anything should change on your end you can reach me at this email or via the phone number in my signature below!  Thank you, 'Guy Who believes in CYA.'

Then if 2 weeks down the line Mr. Scojjac calls my supervisor stating I didn't communicate my plan I can pull up the email and say ""See, right there.  'stuff and junk'!""    

It's a lifesaver.  "
"At least you didn't have to wonder ""now where did this screw come from?""."
That made my morning thanks. 
Get your manager to come too.  S/he should be able to corroborate any such evidence.  That and the higher ups won't just see peon vs supervisor.
...out of a cannon... into the sun.
I work in emergency services. This absolutely happens all of the time.
"you get a few of those, some great opensource software gets shovelwared with the bad ones, things like MediaPlayer Classic, but yeah PUP's are usually harmless, just annoying shovelware although they are usually infested with Ad's "
"Dear future $users,    
Act like this and I promise I'll go the extra mile.    
Signed,  
Myself and probably a lot of fellow phone jockeys and tech dude(tte)s."
"Actually the customer was frighteningly right. Wrong timestamps DO cause slowdowns if not total loss of connection. 

Try setting your computer's time wrong (and disable NTP) and then try to connect to a banking website or a store... 

It's not ACTUALLY the reason the customer thought it was, but she was very, very close. "
"As much as mid- and high-level managers talk about efficiency and cost savings, when they have a machine or tech problem all of that goes out the window. It ***needs*** to be fixed, and ***right away*** so as not to interfere with their busi schedule, so just throw every resource you can get your hands on at it until he's happy!  I see it all the time, and there's a reason a lot of large organizations actually set up a seperate executive help desk (they called it the ""Gold"" help desk back at IBM) just to cater to these guys and their neediness. "
"this is pretty funny, good story :D"
"That's indescribably satisfying. I bet the user would also be fired from his company, after the company finds out that he's solely responsible for 500 phone outages in a call centre at the start of the day. Just because he can't be civil. "
"Remember, though: HR is not your friend. Their first thought when you walk through their door isn't ""how can we help this employee?"" but rather ""how can we resolve this with the best possible outcome for the company?"""
"Yeah, this. Microsoft ActiveSync would sync all your calendars via USB. 

Also, not sure how you thought Outlook was going to sync calendars without Exchange. Setting up POP/IMAP in Outlook on his phone and PC to @gmail isn't going to sync calendars.
"
"Classic case of ""It's time to fire this customer""."
"Hopefully they have a good boss who'll get rid of the client. 

In my experience, IT directors for hosting companies don't know wtf they are doing and will keep crappy customers like this."
One of us. One of us.
"&gt;When you're trying to find cancer in people's butts, you need all the kit to work.  

I think you have a new flair."
It's a great feeling to have a manager who has your back and doesn't turn a blind eye to people that treat you like shit.
"&gt;This is why even if they're in the same office I default to chat and email.

I have a years-long project with a user who refuses to communicate via email, always 'responds' with a 'quick chat'.

Wouldn't you know?  Every time we're close to delivering he magically summons up some new requirement that wasn't communicated before, but since it's not in writing...

Yeah, the struggle is real.  Luckily I have others involved in the project who have seen it too, so I know I'm not just taking crazy pills."
"If it works without it, then it clearly wasn't needed. ASUS have yet to respond to my compensation requests for improving efficiency of manufacture."
"To be fair though, handheld scanners like that typically need to have a Windows handheld software installed and drivers, only if they weren't though."
"I'm going to steal that one. 

 Sadly I know and worked Edith some systems, where this could have worked. For example you couldn't use chrome/Firefox but you could click on a link and that would open in your favourite browser. Before the site loaded there were 3 error messages but if you clicked cancel every time the page would load and you could use the browser. "
"I used to love calls that ended like this.

No lie; you'll do what you can about it.  You'll mention it to people (and post it on reddit) but nothing will happen because like you said, you DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER PROGRAMMING."
