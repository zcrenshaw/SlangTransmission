Hey we don't come to Boston and tell you how to make baked beans
Feel free to strike up conversations in places where people go to relax and socialize such as bars. I would not recommend striking up conversations while people are commuting.
"You have to be very persistent but this will work:

Every time it happens: file a complaint with 311 and your community advisory board. Record a video of the noise and upload it to/put in a link to 311 and community advisory board. The videos should all be in the same place with the date and time so they can see how often it happens. In your complaint mention that you also filed a complaint with 311/community advisory board. 

If you do this long enough the company making the noise will start getting fined and will have to continuously deal with cops."
"I'd explain to her all the precautions you have taken. Then say for one week you are going to do whatever you want. When that week is up she has a choice. To go back to your extremely considerate lifestyle and she shuts the fuck up or you do what you want when you want to since she is going great to bang anyway.

Her choice.
"
"It's very simple, really.  To eat a meal at Dunkies like a Masshole, you just buy a small cup of coffee, go into the bathroom, mainline some heroin, and piss all over the wall.  Do you guys do it differently here?"
"Central Park, and the subway, respectively."
"Don't molly-coddle her, it won't work. Live your life the way you want, and, more importantly, the way you *need* to live. Be considerate, but to a point. She bangs on the ceiling: ignore her. If she knocks on your door, answer it, listen to what she has to say, say ""thank you"" and close the door and do NOT open it if she knocks on it again. Do other things that are within your routine. Let her bang away. Live.

If she continues to harass you with the knocking call the cops. Document every time she knocks: time, date, how many times she knocked, shit she said, etc.

Do not blast music because that doesn't sound part of your life routine. Don't make extra noise for a week or things like that. That's not you. She needs to learn to deal with the way you regularly are, not the way you're not."
"No, they are not mandatory, lol."
"This is a tax on your time and effort she has no right to collect. I'm a cold hearted asshole, I know."
"This is a cocaine town, and we piss while seated."
that is really outside the norm on the subway. 
We don't come to Boston and tell you how to eat a meal at Dunkin' Donuts.
"Uniqlo is not bad either, lots of basics"
Block the sidewalk or the subway stairs and you'll see it.
"I've been on both sides of this situation, and the fact that you're hearing ""stomping, dragging furniture, dropping heavy items"" and not ""loud music, loud voices, tv noise, parties"" leads me to an option you're maybe not considering: that you have a considerate neighbor who's trying, but you have shitty insulation between floors so it doesn't matter.

Poorly insulated floors (let me guess, you're a 4-5 story building and they're wood?) are essentially an echo chamber between apartments- steps will sound like stomps, a book dropping can sound like free weights.  

And your neighbor may be making a lot of noise past midnight because, well, that's when your neighbor is awake, and that's a pickle- because while you definitely have a right to quiet enjoyment and peaceful sleep, if the only thing that gives you that is when your neighbor stops moving and goes to bed, well, you can't make a neighbor go to bed.  So I'd say don't jump from A to E and start texting incessantly and calling 311 and the landlord yet.

Here's your savior: rugs. Specifically, rugs with thick floor mats under them.  It will do wonders for footsteps and noise in the apartment below.  And this is not a new discovery, most standard NYC leases actually have a clause somewhere that says a certain % of the apartment floor must be covered in rugs.  The problem you're having is the exact reason this clause is in there.  Does he have rugs down?  If not, asking him to do so is absolutely where I'd start.  

When you talk to him about it, be cool- keep in mind he may be as frustrated and bewildered at your constant complaints as you are frustrated and exhausted with his constant noise.  He doesn't know you, so from his perspective, he has no idea if you're making a reasonable complaint or if you're totally insane.  You may or may not offer to throw in on them, as these are more for you than him.

I would definitely try this before escalating to complaints."
"I've lived all over the country in a variety of places since I became an adult. I've found that it takes at least a year of actual social effort to create a new tribe - and I'm saying that as someone who is reasonably sociable and generally enjoyable to hang out with, if I might toot my horn. 

The trick is being a regular somewhere. You just have to pick a place that seems like the kind of place where the people you would want to meet would hang out and get your regular status. You hang out, you converse, you meet the other regulars. The others do stuff or would love someone who would organize doing stuff. It's really a lot easier than it sounds, but it takes a lot of effort and you have to be willing to really get to know people and not judge them early. In college and high school, proximity over prolonged periods forces you to give people second chances or be patient - you have to do it here, too. "
"Trains are just a no-no. People are uncomfortable. The subway is just an environment that no matter how interesting the person is I just don't want to have any interaction on the subway. If the same person asked me a question on the street, no problem. Something about the subway just makes me not want to be bothered. "
What the fuck is FoHi?  Is this a joke?
File a complaint with 311. 
"No one, since the first plane hit about an hour before the markets opened. NYSE and NASDAQ didn't open that day and remained closed until the following Monday, 9/17. "
My best guess would be a lot of people whose kids are going back to school and so aren't vacationing this week.  But whatever the reason this is often a slow time -- my wife and I often staycation at a nice hotel in late August / early September because they're largely empty and thus cheap.  
"This dude did it from bowling green to wall street a couple of years ago

Coney island is faaaaaaaaaaar from everything else on your list
"Please don't. I'll get annoyed and if you're persistent, I'll get scared. Only people who want money and guys making weird sexual comments talk to people on the train. "
"If you're signing a new lease, you should be leaving a security deposit with the LL, who should inspect the apartments current condition. 

Your roommate should be getting their security deposit back from the LL, not you.   "
"You could take them to Chelsea Market and set them loose on the place? With the fear of god that if they're not back in X minutes, etc. That gives maximum choice to everyone, lots of affordable options, and it's a big tourist destination anyway"
Id hate you if you tried to strike up an extended conversation with me especially if Im going someplace in a rush.
"Yeah, no. Don't do that."
We got mary-fucking-poppins over here..

"&gt; in some of those cultures it's way more acceptable to be intrusive with women.

And a lot of people use that as a cover, but it's actually not acceptable in their culture. Source: lived in Latin American country where cat-calling was prevalent, and everyone was grossed out by these people."
"Which will do absolutely nothing about it. I called to complain about a car dealership next door unloading cars at 5am making tons of noise. They filed a complaint, sent it to the police department to investigate, then at 2pm the same day I got a notification that my complaint was closed since when the cops got there they couldn't see what I was talking about.... Well obviously if you go 9 hours after the time it happened you're not going to find anything. "
"No.


Also, if a stranger tries to initiate a conversation with you nine out of ten times they are trying to hustle you for money.   Do not give strangers money. "
Visit financial aid services at your school and see about getting your financial aid package adjusted for your current situation then visit student services at your school and talk to them about your situation
Just order a coke. Problem solved.
"My theory is the people perpetuating the myth are the slow - slow walkers, slow talkers, slow movers, slow thinkers. They feel it is rude when people grumble as they speed-walk around them on a crowded sidewalk. They think it is rude when someone sighs after they ask the person the same question for a third time in two minutes. They believe it is rude when others inline at Starbucks at 7:30 AM on a Monday say, ""If you don't know what you want, step aside until you do.""

And they are not entirely wrong. NYC moves at a rapid pace and those of us who live in it day-to-day quickly become intolerant of those who slow us down. We moan, grumble, sigh, and do not hold back from pointing out how they are annoying us.

But they are not entirely right either. I've found the people of the city to be, on average, welcoming. Ask someone how to get someplace and they will tell you (but not more than twice.) If you're walking up the escalator and someone is standing on the left, they will move over (conversely, if you're standing on the right and someone rushes up passed you, they will not grumble.) 

It is the slow who think New Yorkers are rude. They are the ones who trigger our abrupt reactions and experience the worst of everyday New Yorkers. "
"The shuttle is more reliable than the 7, and more frequent since it literally just goes from Grand Central to Times Square.  The 7 stops at Bryant Park between the two. 

I'll use the shuttle if I need to be on the southwest side of Grand Central or the southwest side of Times Square, or if I have to catch the N/Q/R/W from Times Square since that platform is pretty close to the shuttle. 

The 7 is good if you're connecting to the 4/5/6 at GC, or need to go to Port Authority and the ACE.  
"
Because the streets are crowded and there are A LOT more pedestrians than in most places.
"&gt;With some of my background laid out in this post, do I have any shot at finding a job out there while still living here?

Yes. It is possible to get a job, if you aren't in the area, but it is more difficult. Apply and talk to some recruiters. Periodically check your linkedin page as activity seems to get you in more search results.



This is the only question (other than how is this username not taken?) in your 7 paragraph post. Get to the point, bro :)
"
"&gt; Write her a note about all the things you've done to lessen the noise you make and that even though you've done all these things

Don't do this. OP owes nothing to the lady downstairs. She only needs to meet the standards listed in the lease.

&gt;Tell her that if she bangs the ceiling once more, you will... 

Sorry, this neither. This makes the OP the aggressor.  

&gt; Right now she has you trained: she bangs her ceiling and you quiet down. Stop enabling her.

Dead fucking right on. "
"I haven't had enough to call it the best, but I did have a malt chocolate shake at Eddie's Sweet Shop in Forest Hills that was really great. Plus the place is straight out of the 50's and was an experience in of itself."
"Nice try, /u/notacop."
"&gt; I don't even know if I will enjoy it.

Stop right there, a move to NYC should only be undertaken by folks who have a high expectation of enjoyment - or for a significant career move.

You didn't say if you've ever visited here. If you have, you should have an inkling of whether NYC is for you. If you've never been here, you need to visit and decide for yourself whether or not you'd enjoy it.

Food shopping is within a block or three of everyone's apartment - there is no travel time required. And people with lower salaries live with roommates, a walk or a bus from a subway.
