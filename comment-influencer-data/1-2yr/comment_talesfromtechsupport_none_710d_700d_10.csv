"It's not just school policy, it's FERPA.  Next time go with ""So you're telling me that you want to enter into a conspiracy with me to violate federal law?  Could I get your name again?"""
We take FERPA a step further. All students fill out FERPA and then another thing like FERPA thats for the school.
That is actually FERPA. You are not even supposed to verify enrollment to anyone unless the student signs a FERPA release. 
I approve of your school's policies. Good on you and your manager.
"You encountered what's called an ""advanced, but confused"" user:

""Ok, I fixed it, what does it say now?""

""Welcome to Arch Linux.""

""That's better.""

""Why does my internet not show up?""

""Are the required kernel modules installed? Have you checked /etc/hosts and is systemd-networkd running?""

""Yes on all. I am computer literate, you don't need to tell me these basic things.""

""What icons do you see on your desktop?""

""Desktop? What's a desktop? I only use i3wm.""

&gt; Oh boy. Should've installed Gentoo instead.

""Could you check  /etc/sysctl.d/01-disable-ipv6.conf for me? It's either that or the DNS.""

""Already checked. I think I need to reload tmux to apply the changes ... ah there we go, my irc channel just came back online"""
"Yeah I'm aware, but as IT we can't check FERPA status, but we can check what they put down for the schools privacy form. They're supposed to be the same but while FERPA is just on or off, the schools thing has a few different tiers of what we can and can't say."
"&gt; The PC is [definitely] on. I can hear the fans. But I don't know about the screens.

I don't want to devalue your contribution, but you did seem to have a bit of a unicorn user; she used evidence-based troubleshooting **and** was willing to admit she might not know everything."

"FERPA FERPA FERPA

There we go. Now it doesn't look like a real word."
"My dad used to call those kinds of people the ones who should just unplug it, put the pc back in the box, and return it from whence it came."
"&gt;  thinking that all she had to say were the words ""Make me a website"" and it would somehow magically be set up with all the relevant information for her department.

She didn't know you need  `sudo make me a website` for that..."
Yeah me too. They're serious about privacy
"&gt; Because I had spare machines, parts and backup servers in my lab, I had been pushing for some time to get a card reader on the door. It was always “too expensive, maybe next year”. Keys were tracked, but we all know how well that works. 

&gt; When I got in the next morning, there was a crew installing my new card reader. 

I don't know what it is, but whether or not it's physical security or digital security, they never have the money to be proactive until something terrible happens - and THEN the money for it magically appears. Sigh.

(I've been bugging my project manager since April about putting out a quick release to upgrade the version of Struts and add some bugfixes in one of the apps I'm responsible for. Guess what they suddenly care about now?)"
TIL: Stepcopter parent. Worse than the normal death chopper parent.  
"&gt;I had executed the HD.

Call me strange but that brings to mind a hard drive facing the wall being shot from behind. 

(yeah yeah, hard drives don't have a facing or a behind really, calling the label side the front here)"
"Ah, cheap ass Chinese capacitors losing their smoke. Happens all the time. I had an episode with Cox Communications over spotty connectivity. Replaced the cable modem, same issue - my firewall was recording the disconnect/connects too - so I'd send them log snippets. 

Took about 2 to 3 months to convince them the problem was on THEIR end. One of the reps I talked to tipped it, said the modem should be replaced every 3 to 5 years. So I said, well it's because of the dodgy capacitors in the modems and then I mentioned, wouldn't this also be true on the amplifiers up on the poles? 

That got four Cox trucks parked outside my house - turns out the amplifier was wonky. "
"&gt; Friends, this is how bad foresight turns into $7000 worth of iPads.

Damn, you were only 3 iPads short?"
"Next is...

""I connected to the wifi but there's still no emails, it *must* be the servers!""  
""Okay I checked, you had no new emails since this morning""  
""..."""
"""i can't read things i don't want to deal with"" aka ""I'm not going to do my job, you do it."""
It wasn't a real word to begin with.
***TWITCH***
"I got used to this happening in a previous company so I solved it by.
Scheduling approval meetings
Presenting change plans and risks for not doing change, and then requiring active rejection(and email documentation) from decision makers. It's astounding how quickly people change minds when you close a meeting saying ""to confirm I will be sending an email out to all parties documenting your rejection of the change and acceptance of risk."""
"No, it was...

That TI should not work in IT.
"Try pulling that shit in scrabble, mate."
Cross post this to /r/raisedbynarcissists. They will love you for it.
"""Boss, there's something wrong with my eyes.""  
""What do you mean, something wrong with your eyes?""  
""Well, I just can't see myself coming to work today."""
"Well, nice work if you can get it, I guess.

Of course, not the $ISP fault.  They made their deal, nobody cancelled.  But $Client needs to be more aware of where their expenses go!

"Well, at least she already had some idea that tablets and desktop computers are a little different."
"Talk about a memory dump...

I will see myself out... lol"
I hope you keep a recording at your school. Student may need it for his future restraining order. 
How on earth do you forget that you just stood up from the computer and walked away??
For the company she is quite a unicorn. Most people here give me that ~~doe-eyed look~~ deer in the headlights expression when I ask them if they're using a browser.

As someone who's familiar with the difficulties of getting insurance claims paid in the US: users like this may explain a few things :/
"The ""acceptance of risk"" part is a nice piece of buck-passing, I may steal that wording."
"&gt; I'm not very good with computers

This excuse pisses me off to no end. Computers have been around for nearly 70 years, possibly longer. There is literally *no* excuse for not having at least the basic minimum knowledge in 2017.

I can give people in their 50s and older a break, because yeah computers existed when they were young, but they weren't as common as they have been since the 80s.

On **that** note, if my 79 year old neighbor, who is not techie at all, learned how to use a computer with *some* advanced  knowledge, then someone in their 30s and 40s have no excuse. **Especially** when basically every job uses some form of computer, tablet, or phone.

Aka: she just initiated a resumé generating event.
"Wow, talk about evil stepmothers."
"As someone who had such a parent during my college days, thank you for standing firm. Having your parents actively go about ruining your life in the name of ""being concerned about you"" isn't something a lot of people understand and often do take the parents side (regardless of legal/privacy requirements). It's nice to have someone on the side of the kids of 'copter parents :)"
I have an email in my inbox from last week with a strangely similar subject line...
"I turned around and told the other guys in T1 what she said.
""HAH! Classic Cust!""
That should be a pretty clear as to what we are dealing with here."
"I've had this one several times! Usually followed up with the ""but I always get emails on a Tuesday morning"" comment as if it's still the server's fault somehow."
"Definitely make sure that lawyer has your direct line or personal number in case he ever needs help. 

Networking is king nowadays."
"&gt; Here's how I said it went down.  

I love this bit. As I read it I figured I was about to read a list of excuses. In the end, I can totally see me doing the exact same thing. I hated after hours support and those middle of the night calls, sometimes for an update on a ticket that's been open for days or weeks. "
Of course.  PCs and Mobile devices both come in 2 styles: Regular and Apple.
"I had a ticket this morning because a guy lost a bunch of his desktop icons. Not all, just some.

They were on his second monitor, which was physically overlapped by his first."
Of course you can.
**laughs in poverty**
Did it come out ok in the end?
"Yes, Twitch did install Arch Linux at one point."

"One of our techs cleaned up the phone bills for a large aggregate company a few years ago and got rid of **$20,000/yr** in unused lines. 

""Cool, thanks. No, we don't want to upgrade our 2003 servers."""
It's more like she ran the command with no parameters.
"""Yes, ma'am. I will be filling out a identity theft notification and forwarding it to the police department for them to process and file charges. Have a nice day and thank you for calling!""

I always tried to leave them with a happy sign off. "
"Wait... Both the phrases

and
