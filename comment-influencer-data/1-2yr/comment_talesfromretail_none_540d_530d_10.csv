So she basically tore up her own driveway and was worried that she destroyed every road in the world.
"When I worked at a popular donut/coffee place that also does breakfast sandwiches, I had a similar conversation.

""I want a sausage egg and cheese croissant without the sausage"".

Me, thinking I must have heard wrong decided to check: ""So you want an egg and cheese croissant?""

""No, I want a SAUSAGE egg and cheese croissant without the sausage!""

Okay. I ring him up for an egg and cheese croissant, make an egg and cheese croissant, and give him the egg and cheese croissant, and off he goes. 

People are strange."
It‚Äôs amazing in our current society how people such as yourself doing something as simple as your job as good as you can will impart that huge of an impact on someone‚Äôs life. Amazing. Congrats. 
I apologize for our lack of good public education.  As soon as you said they were American I cringed and thought oh great how are we going to be embarrassed today.
She thought she was going to be getting life in prison.
"I used to work in Glastonbury Abbey, in the UK. One of its selling points is, they claim, it's the burial place of King Arthur.
The amount of fully grown American adults who would come in and ask me legit, serious questions about the *wizard* Merlin... 
Like, sure America. The UK has magic. 
What do they teach over there? "
"Wow, this brought tears to my eyes. It was so nice of you to be so caring and attentive. I wonder why most people can't just be nice."
"This is the most wholesome, adorable thing I have ever read on this sub."
You were not wrong for asking her to help sort the yarn. She is obviously one of those people who don't have anything better to do with her life than complain. 
"Yeah I don't get why people have to be mean all the time. I'm a police officer and when I was on training (riding with a senior officer) and would make motor vehicle stops, my trainer would always argue and lecture the people for minor violations. They would always get angry at us because of the way he would treat them and they'd end up fighting the summons in court. Now that I'm riding solo, I still issue tickets, but 99% of the time the conversation goes very smooth and it ends with them smiling, and me small-talking with them about life. There is a way to treat people and that is with kindness. I've seem so many cops close to retirement who are so salty and hate everyone because at some point during their career they gave up on caring about people and end up with the ""fuck the world"" mentality.

 I know this story is not retail related, but I worked retail for 10 years before landing this career, and I really believe those 10 years shaped the way I talk to people and it worked. 

Be nice to someone today."
"Whenever they say ""xx let's me do it"" I always reply, ""then if they are comfortable doing that, you'll have to take it to them"". Most of the time they are lying to try to make you give in, because obviously you don't want the customer wasting their time. What they don't realize is that I have grown a spine, in my many years of customer service, and I'm not afraid to respectfully decline something I know would get me in trouble. And if they are an ass about it I call our closest location and tell them what transpired and that they shouldn't give into the customer if said customer comes in. Mostly because I've grown a bit of a vindictive spine. "
"I feel bad for whoever's working at that other store. She's already in a bad mood about being wrong, and the no returns policy is sure to turn her into a nightmare!"
Maybe he should stay outside and be a display customer? 
"A great documentary, highly recommend üëç"
"I honestly can't imagine working a retail job that not only doesn't have scanners, but also expects its employees to offer super speedy service too... 

I know it's not the point of your post, but that place sounds horrible to begin with, regardless of what the customers are like!"
"It means leave, now, before you're laid off."
"There is this one place that only has cheeseburgers on the menu, so I habitually order a cheeseburger without the cheese. Only because they don't have a hamburger listed though. "
Well...Harry Potter?

"Next time: ah, mam, I've found the information, we don't have them  here, they're sold out! You could try online though! Have a nice day. click. "
"I use to work at a high end grocery store, and my department sold specialty goods (wine, beer, cheese, coffee and chocolate). The powers to be decided that coffee was going to be a grocery item, so we relinquished power to them. Probably 6 months later, coffee came BACK to our department, because grocery couldn't handle it. I ended up finding bags, and bags, and bags of coffee months out of date. Something like 200+ bags. People were just too lazy to stock properly, and were refusing to look at dates. I was so angry/embarrassed. "
Oh come on... Michael Jackson wasn't that bad.
"I think you mean, *He-who-must-not-be-named*. "
This is one of the few times I would pretend to not be American to avoid embarrassment.
"Add electricity to the wire, just enough to shock them into STAYING THE FUCK OFF THE MERCHANDISE!"
"Not even tore up the driveway, it's like if she just blocked it off with trash cans and thought all the roads in the world were also blocked. "
As an American living in Europe I have been Canadian a few times. 
Probably a stolen card and that's why he was trying to buy as much as possible.
"""Can I have a milk tea, only with neither milk nor tea but a $25 gift card inside? But the other location gives it to me at the regular price!"""
Knit picking
This reminds me of when I was a small child and I was playing with a globe and I asked my dad if I touched a country on the globe if my finger would come out of the sky in that country. 
"Long ago did a few days helping out at a local store when one of the regulars was out for a while.  Got presented with an obviously home made driver's license with ""California"" spelled wrong."
"&gt;""I guess even a garbage man takes pride in his work.""

Yes, ma'am, which explains how your mothers ob/gyn can hold his head up."
"People like that live to try and make you feel terrible about yourself. I think you handled the situation extremely well, if you reacted he would have probably caused a big scene. Keep up the good work."
This woman will make things out of yarn for people that don't have any use for them and don't want to talk to her. She does it because she wants a tangible reason to be angry at ungrateful family members. 
As an American I've learned many things in school but I have yet to see a class that teaches common sense
"I think it's fine for you to ask for help and it's even fine for her to be upset with your store but yelling at you isn't okay.

Your store should really get scanners."
OMG SON YOU JUST KILLED HONG KONG
"Reminds me of an old story here about the customer who came to pick up her repaired ride-on lawn mower in a Geo Metro:

&gt;$Customer: How do you expect me to fit that into my car?!

&gt;$Manager: I didn‚Äôt.  I expected you to bring a *truck*."
I checked his ID. Name on credit card matched. He was delusional.
Never thought the police would actually attempt to practically rob a place...interesting. The intimidating cop was out of line too. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong! I‚Äôm angry for you
Glad it‚Äôs not me! 
"I work at a home improvement warehouse.   I was selling a dishwasher install to a guy wearing a '*University of xxxxxx Law School*'.   Guy starts grilling me on the fine print in the contract, things like an arbitration clause.   His wife finally said 'you always do this, you know this is a multinational company and they aren't going to give you a special contract.   Just sign it and let's go'

Thank you lady. 

Edit to add the guy told me he was s law professor at the school.   So he just gets his kicks fucking with people. "
"I got to the point where I reply ""So then why did you go to a different place this time?"" "
