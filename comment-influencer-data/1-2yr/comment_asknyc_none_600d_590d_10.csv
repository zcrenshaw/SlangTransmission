"Fun fact. The first thing you should do if a nuclear device detonates nearby is take off all your clothing. The fibers in your clothes will absorb more radiation than your bare skin will. Wrap the clothing in plastic bags and get it as far away from you as you can.

Take a shower but do not scrub at all. Use soap gently to cleanse your skin. Washing yourself will help. You can use shampoo but do not use any conditioner as that will increase the likelihood of radioactive particles getting stuck in your hair. If you can't shower, a damp cloth and a gentle sponge bath is better than nothing. You want to avoid scratching or any other injury that could make it easier for radiation to get in your blood stream.

Drink fluid only from unopened containers. Refrain from drinking tap water unless it's all you have. If you are far enough away, food in your refrigerator should be ok if you must for a while. Do not warm it up. Evacuation should be your priority, though.

Put on clean clothes, preferably clothing from as near center of your home. Stuff from the back of the closet is better than clothes in a laundry basket. 

Friendly psa that radiation exposure mitigation can save your life. Just because you were exposed, doesn't mean you can't minimize the impact it has. Exposure to radiation dies not mean you're going to die, but you need to help yourself. Rule 1 for radiation exposure: don't ingest it. Rule 2, minimize skin exposure. Rule 3, get away from the radiation as soon as possible by whatever means necessary."

Every woman has had this happen. Run. Yell. Call 911 on your phone. Go to the middle of the street. Do not worry about over reacting. Do not be shy. Get mad and go into I WANT TO LIVE mode.

"Judging by the responses so far apparently I'm in the minority, but I'd definitely be weirded out by that."
No one is going to charge you full retail price if you order over 100 units.  Find one you like and talk to the manager.
I don't wear work shoes on the street. I keep work shoes at my desk and change my shoes when I get to the office. 
I quit 15 years ago. So I smoke vicariously through these people now.

"Was the A train running local and this near 96th? If so, I was on that train and they did check cars for passengers who were ill. It took long enough that I just chose to take a Lyft the remainder home. I’m not sure the resolution but by the time I was beyond the turnstiles they were closing the doors. I don’t know if they found the sick individual they were looking for but they did end up checking. "
"Give it time, you just moved to a new place less than a week ago."
"1. Take the 7 train to Flushing Main St.

2. Board the Q13 bus and ride until you're on Northern Boulevard and start seeing Korean writing on nearly every sign (about 10-15 minutes).

3. Get off and eat just about anywhere."
"Manhattan

* West Village: Adorable little blocks with shops and restaurants scattered about. What's not to like?
* Upper East Side: I really like 2nd and 3rd Ave between 72nd and 86th street.
* Lower East Side: Doesn't feel as neat and tidy as most of lower Manhattan.
* Washington Heights: There are some cool spots around here. Nice parks, and walking or running across GWB and back is very enjoyable.

Brooklyn

* Brooklyn Heights/Cobble Hill/Caroll Gardens: I love walking these quiet, leafy green neighborhoods in the spring/summer
* Bay Ridge: Just a nice little area far removed from the bustle of Manhattan.
* Sunset Park: The contrast between 5th Ave and 7th Ave is fascinating. And likewise with the contrast between both of these and 3rd Ave. It's really a shame Moses was unwilling to run the Gowanus Expressway along the industrial waterfront as the neighborhood wished.
* Greenpoint: Another spot I enjoy in the summer. Quiet and charming. Nice place to bike around. 

Queens

* Forest Hills: Nice homes with spacious yards. Doesn't feel like the city at all.
* Astoria: Lots of great restaurants and bars.
* Jackson Heights: A melting pot of a neighborhood in a city often called a melting pot.

Bronx

* Woodlawn Heights: Katonah and McLean Aves are very Irish. It's pretty cool. People around here greet you when you pass them on the street.
* Kingsbridge: I stumbled upon the armory not knowing it was there. What a cool building. 
* Spuyten Duyvil/Riverdale: Another one of those areas that doesn't feel like New York City (though Spuyten Duyvil was, sadly, carved up by another one of Moses' highways)."
"If price truly doesn't matter, the best bus is... Amtrak."
"Parks

* Go to the Ramble and the Loch walking trail in Central Park if you haven't been, they are very empty and beautiful.

* Walk or bike along the Hudson from 125th Street to at least 96th. If biking, consider going all the way around Manhattan.

* Walk along Riverside Park (both down in the park itself, and on the walking path next to Riverside Drive).

* I'm not as familiar with Prospect Park, but The Ravine is nice

* Hit the boardwalks (Rockaway, Brighton, Sandy Hook if the ferry is running)

* Take Metro North to Cold Spring for some awesome hikes

Food

* Go to Flushing and eat real Chinese food

* Go to Brighton Beach and eat Russian, Uzbek, Georgian, etc food

* Go to Mitsuwa in NJ and load up on Japanese groceries

* If any of the ""brand name"" street fairs or markets are on (Queens International Night Market, Pickle Festival, Pop Up NY, etc) those are usually worth checking out

Shopping

* Take the bus to Woodbury, bring a suitcase

* Go to St. Mark's in EV, Williamsburg north of Metropolitan Ave, or Greenpoint along Manhattan Ave, for some nice small clothing/accessories shops

* Go to Cobble Hill, lots of small shops and cafes along Atlantic, Smith, and Court. "

"This is an illegal airbnb situation. The leaseholder is required to be present. Report it to airbnb...

Also, you can just refuse to let people in if she does it after you try to get her to take it down. How is she expecting anyone to get in if she's not around??

Light up my bong lol. At least I live in queens so I might live
"A few notes

* If you want to stop on the sidewalk (to take a picture, get directions, etc.) move to the side. You can expect people to be walking behind you at all times and you should behave as if they're not paying attention to the person in front of them. 

* When exiting the subway station, do not stop at the top of the stairs to get your bearings. Clear the staircase entrance and move to the side. This is in the same category as the above, but it happens so much it needs calling out

* If you're visiting with a group, do not walk more than 2 across on the sidewalk

* For the most part, avoid giving money to panhandlers

* Don't stare at people, especially on public transportation

* Unless it's impossible, avoid the subway during rush hour. The subway, while a novelty for many, is a critical part of the daily commute for millions. Anything you can do to relieve the burden on the system at the busiest hours will be appreciated

Honestly, any of the ""rules"" here can be understood in the broader context that NYC is massively crowded and people live essentially on top of one another.  The polite thing to do is to avoid infringing on other people's lives unnecessarily because they get their lives infringed on enough as it is. "

"My neighbor plays piano. Lots and lots of piano. However, it doesn't bother me because it is *always* during daytime hours. Never before 9am, never past 6pm. Even during weekends. It gets old sometimes, but it really doesn't bother me because it's respectful. 

I'm glad it's not drums or bass guitar, however!!!"
"Oh yeah I forgot about the time my neighbor literally crawled into my bedroom window via the fire escape, bleeding profusely from the face (and scaring the shit out of me) after her husband beat the shit out of her and locked her in the bedroom.

When the cops came, she denied it was him. I lived there for another year and they were still living together when I moved. "
"I'd start by just telling her, you're sorry to say, that you're just not comfortable with that. It's possible that'll be all it takes"
"Since you seem to be the only one here who knows what he's talking about, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the actual question at hand: where would you go and what would you do if you had 30 minutes advance notice that a nuke was gonna detonate?

"Where are you planning to propose?  That may help guide it -- if you're planning to whisk her away from there to a romantic dinner you may not want to spend an hour on the subway to get there, obviously.  So the general location is something to think about. "

Good. I hate people who sit on the stairs.
