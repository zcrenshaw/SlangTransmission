"&gt; ""Sorry Josh, you're father is a piece of shit, and I just ruined our relationship with the family, because I wasn't paying attention.""

DON'T YOU DARE.  You're not a piece of shit, don't even think this.  You're an awesome person, and an absolutely fucking amazing dad.  I would've killed to have had a father like you."
"My only thoughts are:

- you’re an incredible father.
- your sons sexuality is so ‘normal’ to you that it doesn’t even factor in as something to hide. This is, without a doubt, one of the most incredible things you can do to accept him.
- you stood up for him and Sean and their happiness.

Your son is one VERY lucky person to have a role model like you."
we’re at home on our phones on subs like this
"It's not the mistake he will care about, what he will care about is how you went full beast mode to stick up for him, it will mean way more than going to some BS birthday thing by homophobes who are disgusted by the real him.

You fucking rock. "
well you were fucking in her bed so id be pissed too. lol Id be like fuck in my bed?! OOOOH MUM
"If he doesn't respond to being it given orally, you should try giving it to him as a suppository."
Uh oh lol... didn’t see this coming. This wasn’t in the gay agenda of 2018 pamphlet 
Youre definitely pregnant.
This post made me straight. I’m getting rid of my pride flag and donating all my money to organizations that want to preserve the “traditional family.”
"Because of the release of the movie ""Love, Simon,"" some Tumblr users decided to make ""I like your boots"" code for ""You're hot, are you gay too?"" It's meant to be a phrase used by gays to detect other gays in the real world. The phrase is based on I like your shoelaces. Appropriate response is ""I took them from a unicorn!""

Edit: here's the clip from the movie

"My friend's ""code"" is asking ""Do you know my friend Sean Cody?"" and watching the reaction."

"When he is nearby, play a Ladygaga song backwards which will summon Satan, then you can sell your soul in exchange for turning him into a homosexual.    
I thought this was common knowledge to be honest."
"Exactly. And trust me OP, if i was your son i wouldnt even like to go to my grandpa's house. Just imagine all the awkward questions: ""So when is the girlfriend coming??"" ""ohh i met with Sarah the other day, she has a beautiful grandaughter, maybe you would like to meet her!""

Believe me Op, you've done your kid a favor. I believe you should tell him how it went down. He will love you for standing up for him."

At least you know your gaydar works
"I'm sorry you have to go through this. I think you need to quickly talk to your son. Don't beat about the bush, just be honest and open about what happened. Apologise for inadvertently outing him but say his happiness is all that matters. It's obvious that you see him and his boyfriend as so normal you just forgot to be guarded. It wasn't done with malice. It's that you must focus on, not your parents prehistoric  view of the world. Throw your own party for them and make it a good one.  It's a shame but your parents seem happy excommunicate you and your family over this so you'll have to let them be assholes by themselves. Ultimately it will be them whos losing out on the love and affection they would have got from you, your wife and kids. Lastly i would also say that your reaction to them, whilst fully supporting your son, maybe shows that you have some unresolved grievances you have over your beliefs too. 50/m with kids here."
Wear a shirt says Sean Cody or Tim Tales or any of the gay porn sites. Straight people will never know and you can still secure your masculinity

"I can't think of anything right now. Men's fashion is pretty good these days. Things started to improve after the 90s when people realised that men's bodies don't have to be hidden under folds of shapeless, ill-fitting clothes. Pants especially are so much better now because you can actually see the outline of legs and butt, and I don't mean the crazy skin-hugging ones but the ones with a nice masculine slim cut."

First WOW! Way to be an amazing fucking parent!!!!! Seriously you’re the fucking DAD in the world. You let his boyfriend roll off your tongue so easy and natural because it is! You stood up to your parents to protect your child. No one could ask for a better dad. You love you son and you should never apologize or feel guilty for that. Your parents shouldn’t have put you in that position!

"He wants regular sex. Would you feel comfortable being 'obliged' to have sex with him? Don't forget he's 11 years older than you, and so there's a power difference that's there already. With money involved, that bends the power difference even further in his direction. "

Plus he's Mormon and on a mission where he literally can't even date.

A lot of Mormons seem surprising gay because they act super nice and actually dress fairly well.
But in reality most of them are not (sad, because most of them are hot).

But it's always possible he was hitting on you, I know of and know a few people who went on missions even though they were gay because they still believed in the church."

"Ok, let’s talk. 

First of all, babe, I’m sorry he hurt you. This betrayal will be with you a while, it ended a two year relationship, wreaked your feelings of self esteem, and damages your ability to trust going forward. For all of that, I’m so sorry and wish it was different, but it isn’t, that is life. 

Second, this isn’t about you. No amount of you being a “perfect” boyfriend could have changed his isolation, secrecy, and hidden actions, all of that was on him. 

See, in a relationship, he had a responsibility to share his emotions, his feelings, and his challenges. Most guys share sex, and they share the public parts of their lives easily. But dealing with their private thoughts, which is where he made a decision to cheat, is more challenging. A relationship is shared space. He didn’t talk about his fears that he wasn’t good enough, sexy enough or a good enough lover. He kept all those feelings inside. Then when he began to doubt himself he sought out external validation. Without mentioning it to you, he started flirting, Grindr searching for hookups, and FaceTiming his ex. These actions are about his own inadequacies and self esteem, not yours. 

This was your first time out. Your partner had a lot to learn about how to deal with himself. Your end was clean, you did the right things, were a good boyfriend, but the relationship crashed and burned because it isn’t what I do, it’s what we do. Everyone has to work and pull on the rope together and so on. 

Put the blame where it belongs. - accept that it is always on them to carry their fifty percent, and that you can’t make the relationship work without their half. He let you down, he should have realized where he was at and suggested talking, fixing, or a break while he figured out what he wanted to do. 

Treat self well. Spend time in nature, do some things, keep your body moving, and know that other guys are just like you, we have all experienced being lied to, betrayal, it is kind of a rite of passage, human relationships are defined by shared truth right? 

Love you kiddo, and so sorry he hurt you. "

I find some conventionally unattractive people to be sexy as hell because of it. "
So does literally every other shirt out there 
Thinking about the fact that I love men and one day a man will love me just makes me want to run forever into the sunset. It puts such a smile on my face. Being gay is better than anything.

"I also get the feeling that the grandparents/grandson aren’t really very close.

"I love this. It's a great example of how people's minds don't change in one sitting, but being patient and working with someone is how people learn things. That's cool that you put real labor into sharing information with him. I'm sure that alone sticks with him.

I didn't grow up JW, but had a mix of private Christian education as a kid and there was so much in there about doubting scientists. Even if  you don't fully buy the 6000-year-old earth theory, you still have this agnosticism built in that's super skeptical of scientists. You never really shake that unless you learn more in-depth how real scientists do their work and why they come to conclusions.

At the same time, my school had Ken Ham visit (the Aussie Evangelical that built Noah's Ark in Kentucky), and listening to him was the first time my brain thought, ""Y'know.

"Some of the worst homophobia I ever experienced was working in financial services in New York City.  This was a few decades ago, and it's a lot better now, but I hear it's still a bastion of homophobia in certain areas of finance.

The worst single memory I have, is the Monday after Gay Pride, which always was a terrible day to hear homophobic innuendo in the office.  One guy was telling a group of my colleagues that he and his wife were in Central Park the morning of Pride, and there was one particularly obnoxious gay guy who was taunting straight people who were scared of the gays, and was yelling, ""run away straight people, run away!!""   Now, as obnoxious and repelling as that kind of behavior was, this guy in my office said, ""I wish I had a baseball bat so I could have bashed him in the head.""   Everybody roared with laughter, except me who was sitting off to the side observing this.  Even people that I thought were good hearted people laughed very loudly at this, which was the most disappointing and hurtful thing of all.

How did I deal with it?  Like I did my entire career, I was in the closet.  That career would never have happened if they knew I was gay, and there was only tenuous job security, at best, for many years.  It was an incredibly toxic thing to do, but I viewed it as a necessary evil at the time, to put myself in position to expel any homophobic person from my life in the future.  That part worked out beautifully."

"The problem with wearing such _identification badges_ is that almost everyone recognizes rainbow stuff as gay and can treat you according to it, whether it is for the better or worse. 

The same way I wouldn't wear a political party badge while at the grocery store, I wouldn't disclose my sexual preferences in that casual way. If you bump into someone on your team while shopping, that's great, but if the cashier has the opposite political view he/she could be mean to you. This is a stupid example, but...

I mean, out in the street you are just another regular person and no one has anything against you from a start if you don't give them something to base their judgment on.

Being out means embracing your sexual preferences, being true to yourself and your people, it doesn't mean that every random jerk in the street has to know, nor that you'll have to face uncomfortable situations because of it."

"in my basement bedroom after school

sophomore year of high school, I came out to my best friend. he responded by confessing that he had a crush on me... we spent the next ~2.5 years doing about what you'd expect 2 teenagers to be doing at any opportunity.

we were both in the closet, so my parents didn't give it a second thought that we'd hang out in my bedroom after school to ""do homework"" or ""play video games."" also helped that with both of my parents working 2 jobs, they were functionally only home and awake for like 3 hours Monday-Friday."

"Don’t panic, but this is a clear case of someone turning gay due to homosexual icons in media (Modern Family, Days of Our Lives, Always Sunny in Philadelphia, etc.).

It’s a good thing you caught on when you did. Both you and your boyfriend need to start saying “no homo” after you have sex; it’s the only way to halt the gay and prevent its contagious tendrils from spreading to our children. 

Also, remember to thoroughly establish who is the boy and who is the girl in your relationship ship. Tell everyone you see, so they don’t get the wrong idea.

Bless you both, my str8 boiz."
"In my experience, people will tell you. Multiple times over your life. Sometimes I think I'm attractive, sometimes I definitely do not. But people have told me I am attractive."
"Yeah, nevermind I lost sympathy for you"
you have such a way with words
The man bun has to go
This story has a really fake feel to it.
I refuse to believe that gay dudes who chase straight guys are the ones doing the depositing.
I'm a gay top and have deposited plenty in straight guys
Exactly.
"I disagree with you.  For me, it has nothing to do with gay men not being masculine.  I actually think it's cute when a guy is a little effeminate.  

Throughout my life, a LOT of the men I've known and have been attracted to were straight.  Coworkers, guys in my classes in high school and college, etc.  I never pursued them because they were not at all interested in same-sex relationships.  That didn't stop me from wanting them, developing crushes on them, fantasizing about them, etc.  When I see the ""straight guy has gay sex"" trope in porn or NWS stories, it turns me on because I let myself suspend disbelief and fantasize about how maybe, just maybe, they'd let me fool around with them a bit.  Even if it's just a ""Hey I'm drunk and I'll let you suck my dick,"" it makes me think of guys from my past that look like the dudes in the porn.  One of my favorite videos is a guy that's a dead ringer for a friend from my major in college doing the ""just suck me off"" thing 

It has NOTHING to do with femme vs masc.  "
Use of the word bussy or mussy. 
It’s difficult to find an accessory when I’m not into jewelry. But damn it I’ll get a bracelet. Anything masculine but visible you can suggest?

"I know this is sarcasm, but what seems to get my straight friends curious is when I completely ignore the idea of hooking up with them. I don't give em compliments, I don't really discuss my sexuality- but occasionally will drop a ""damn, he is hot"" about someone else when they're around. They usually can't figure out why I'm not into them. It drives em nuts to where they're almost pursuing me. 

This sounds all well and good, but I really don't like messing with friends, or guys that won't have a future with. Its just nice knowing I could if I wanted. "
Congrats you found a scam that plays into the fantasies of some gay men.
It looks like a resistor.
So what? It’s Grindr. Just keep the cap on while fucking. Problem solved. 
Someone wise once said: “Trust is like a mirror - you can fix it if it’s broke but you can still see The Crack in that motherfucker’s reflection.”
My sexuality has NOTHING to do with my ability to obtain a degree. I’m sorry you are in that situation. 
"I had this relationship with my grandfather on my dad’s side who had beliefs like OP’s Dad. I would only go visit him for my dad’s benefit and it was awful every time. The questions about settling down with a woman never stopped. I didn’t see him for a couple years before he died, so you can imagine my surprise when it came time to move the coffin that I was told I was to be one of the pallbearers. That fucked with my head, and not only because the graveyard was a mud pit and he kept bouncing around in there. "
"Do it!

I remember when there was this cute guy who worked the front desk at my gym I used to go to and after 6 months months of me saying nothing but ""hey"" to him only when I walked in or walked by him briefly I got the courage to finally ask him out for drinks and when he said yeah I was on literal cloud 9. "
"Not I, but I knew a guy who got his asshole licked by his dog. He was on all 4s at the edge of the bed. His bf went to get the lube. During that brief interlude, tragedy struck. Doggo lick the donut hole."
Tell him to turn that shit up.
"Don't do it. He's doing it because he's passionate about it, not because he craves the attention of viewers. Participating in the chat is probably going to be better for his channel that inflating his view count. "
"He can’t deal with anything less than 9”? So what’s that, 0.001% of the male population or something? Even less when you filter out straight guys. Way to make your hook up chances even slimmer, but hey ho."
"""That guy has an awesome ass."" I hear that all the time in the gym. Just stand somewhere near the squat rack and wait for it. Some dude will say it like it's not a come on."
"I'm glad to hear he is making progress. It is hard for some who grow up as JWs, if is difficult to understand concepts and ideas that they are told over and over again are false or immoral, I've seen this with my own siblings, but from a young age, I was always interested in Science and invested a great amount of time learning about, and so I never really bought the whole ""creation"" nonsense. "
"As a trans guy with an actual vagina, the term has always made me uncomfortable. I usually don't say anything because I know a bunch of transphobes will show up to tell me I'm not a real man, I'm just a straight girl appropriating gay culture or fetishising gay relationships. That, and all the gay dudes talking about how gross vaginas are and how real gay men don't like pussy. It's really depressing. I wish people remembered that we exist. I wish people we weren't constantly invalidated even within the LGBT community. I wish I wasn't considered this bizarre, exotic thing just for being born with different anatomy. "
"I feel like I would stare. 
Not because I’m judging. 
Because I’m *jealous*"
“Straight”
"When it meant equality, yes. Not this 3rd wave man-hating bullshit."
Daddy i want you to impregnate my boy pussy and breed my cunt with your cummies
If the birth process doesn't start within 15 minutes then you're legally allowed to leave 
"&gt; Not from you, but from the fact that bottoms are feminised lol

TBH I think this is what I find annoying - its a kind of weird covert heteronormativity. Just because you're getting fucked doesn't mean you have to pretend you have a vag.

"How you've written it, obvious answer is they're nuts and kinda nasty. So at the least distance yourself significantly from them."
People that use Internet Explorer
That’s sad for the human filth who felt better about himself for doing that.  
FYI you’re the man I hope to be someday to my son
"Some guys seem really flirty when they're just playing gay chicken while straight.  Especially in gym and sauna environments.  When someone in comfortable in their own sexuality they might compliment, admire, etc. without being gay themselves.  It's not an environment where you're supposed to be having sex, anyway.  If you think a specific guy is checking you out and you're interested, I'd do it in a different environment unless he ends up coming on really strong."
Russians being a bunch of animals? How unusual.
Gay dudes are thirsty as fuck. They WILL tell you. 
#you've been banned from r/beards.
Always creeps wearing those shirts 
"Good friend? We can talk about it.

Acquaintance? Why, how do *you* like to fuck, Cheryl? Oh right, that's none of my business."
Push out their colons so it looks like a prolapse. That freaks me out.

"Yes, you are overthinking. Move on."
"Holy crap. I'm the exact opposite... again.

I'm a cashier, and just yesterday I gave my number to a regular customer.

I was so nervous. I tried multiple times and told myself I would do it so many times and I finally did.

They never did text me. I'm still a little sad about it.
But I'm glad I finally got it over with."
"Hit them with the ""have you ever had sex with a goat?"" Response, since they don't seem to realize that you don't need to endlessly experiment to understand what you're attracted to"
Please don’t respond to my comments ever again 
"""Right infront of my salad!"""
Im so triggered that i’m literally paying for my own hit. 
What's his #?
"I personally was straight for 30 years before I got injected with Marijuana several times. That seems to be a sure-fire 100% recipe for turning anyone gay. Good luck if you choose this route because from what I hear the only cure is the Church. From what I hear, and don't tell anyone, is that if you suck Jesus's cock well enough you hit max level, and then start back again as a level 1 straight.

Good luck!"
Why was i trying to sing this?!?!
"I think the main issue is that the vast majority of people in this country are white, so the vast majority of attractive people you see are white.

Really, going to the popular party and seeing tons of hot white guys gives you a distorted view.  You don't notice that 90% of white guys aren't attractive enough to sleep with those guys - choosing to spend their time somewhere else - so you get a false sense of racial bias being the reason for your rejection.

Hot guys are hot - regardless of race.  If you see a white guy who has tons of people flocking to him, well, hate to break it to you but he isn't average.  An average guy wouldn't have swarms of people wanting to be with him.  You may look at a guy and think that he isn't very attractive and is getting more attention than he deserves, but the reality is attraction is subjective and determined by the individuals.  Its not really fair for you to say ""average white guys get more attention than they should"" because no one is entitled to any kind of attention, and the amount they get is exactly what they ""deserve""."
"I never understood catfish.
Do they expect to turn up looking totally different and have the person go “oh well, it’s ok.”?

I’d be mad as hell."
Where do you live? This is definitely not a problem where I live. I went to Philly once and can definitely say there were a lot of attractive men there but it's also a wealthy part of the city and any large city attracts high achievers.
Tell him it's a new kind of nail polish that's gender-neutral.

"No, but you may be pergnat "
"Honestly, as the top, I'm pretty concerned with whether the bottom is having a good experience when I'm having sex.  Reassuring me that things feel good really turns me on, even better is showing it through movement and taking more control.

TBH what gets me going more than literally anything is eating a guy's ass.  So let me eat your ass and we'll have a good time."
Hell yeah! I'm going to get flack for this until I quit haha...

"As I always do with this kind of posts, I'm gonna assume this isn't fake. Depending on your age, how is your family and the perception of LGBT people in your area I'd come out first. Also, why does your sister want to tell your mum? Because she's pissed you were having sex in her bed, because she doesn't accept your homosexuality/bisexuality or both? Because that would change things as well."
Wash the sheets dude. 
"&gt;Appropriate response is ""I took them from a unicorn!""

This is some 'the narwhal bacons at midnight"" tier shit"
"&gt; I just feel like I failed as a parent on this one. 

On the contrary. You did what an awesome parent would do. Your kids will understand and whether your son realizes this right away or at some point in the future, he'll be very proud of you for standing up to him and treating his sexual orientation as the non-issue that it is, that you even said ""we're taking him and Sean for sushi"" without hesitation, because why should you even hesitate? If anyone has a problem with that, it's their problem (your parents included). It's all so fresh right now, and there's a lot of high emotions running through you right now, but just give the whole thing a little time and things will settle normally. To respond to your question of what do you tell your kids about going/not going to your parents house next Sunday, I would just be honest with them. Relax, buddy.  :)"
"that's fair - and I agree - but OP could also slip him the number and leave - he doesn't have to do it in a way that traps the cashier or makes it inappropriate, at least IMO"
"Please go with Google. This is a dream job and a once in a lifetime opportunity. I know you think he may be the one, and I’m not saying it’ll be easy to get over him, but you’ll find someone new that’ll love you too. If you stay, the ‘what-if’s could eat at you until it turns to resentment in your relationship; on the other end, guilt could spur things on his side and cause things to end. Go for Google."

"Both my Dad and my older brother were/are gay.  My Dad faithfully kept his wedding vow to my Mom, and just suppressed it.  It was my Mom and sister who told me about him.  My older brother had his kicks in the military, and then came home to suppress it all.  He is on his sixth marriage to a woman.

The old axiom is quite true: Deny what you are, and become what you most fear."
Just wait until he tries to initiate plans and if he never does you have your answer 
"I posted what follows on another thread but it may help you so here it goes again (worked in my case :). *It happened last night. The guy on Tinder asked me about my dick size during a fairly innocent chat. Once I told him (around 6""), he said he can't deal with anything less than 9"" and instantly unmatched me. 20 minutes later I was getting into another chat with someone else. We ended up talking sex and it turned out we were both tops. I was ready to move on but he suggested trying other things and yes, asked me about my dick's size.... I expected the same outcome but after thinking for a while he just said: ""OK, you can fuck me"" :) I suppose it's a good example how your dick size can work to your advantage.*"
"Oh wow. IM SOOOO shocked. Do you mean Russia,the best country for human rights? But all joking aside Russia has been HORRIBLE since the age of the empires. It hasnt changed much. Im not surprised by this. Russia is a desperate country which has no real future aside from its MASSIVE amount of nuclear weapons."
"Controversial opinion here. If there was a button to switch my sexuality, I’d hit it without even have to think about it. 
But it is what it is and it is not that I’m not having fun, but I would definitly change it if I could."
Yeah mine is beyond defective.
Did you see OP’s comment about the Star Wars shirt? That’d be funny if he was talking about you.

"I don't know your situation. Projecting that to my life I would rather not be manipulated and blackmailed. every day she blackmail you she will get more and more leverage and demands. You are already lost, she cannot forget your 'secret' regardless of what favours you do for her. 

Anyway decide for youself"
"Better than my  ""got drunk as fuck in the annual party and hit upon a senior manager then told him I was gay"" story haha. He found it amusing. "
"Just remember that you were born into your shitty family, you didn't choose them. Once you become an adult its up to you whether or not you want to keep the same shitty family, or find a new one (friends that will actually accept you for who you are)."
Beg for my load while I’m fucking them.
Denial. Plain and simple denial. 
You’re gonna hit the prostate like crazy. 
Hmm i thought the point is to drop subtle hints that you're gay without letting straight people know
"It depends... do you want to keep fucking this guy?

If not, run, it’s a trap.

If so, let him haha."
Much larger heteronormative dating pool certainly will skew such a statistic. If only 1/10 potential partners is homo then 2/10 being in gay relationships seems good. 
That's so fucking cute

"I think it depends on how you take it. If you can put up with a certain amount of homophobic humor, then that can really grease the wheels.
