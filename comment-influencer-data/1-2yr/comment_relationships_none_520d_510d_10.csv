"You’re absolutely right. It helps too that OP can’t support him anymore so no one is there to pay the bills if he doesn’t do anything. Survival mode may have kicked in when you are pushed to the edge. I mean what is the number 1 advice Reddit gives after a break up, delete Facebook, hit the gym!"
"He will be receiving individual therapy and seeing a psychiatrist. He is supposed to get out of the hospital on Friday and will be doing a partial hospitalization program for the next month or so. I just think we should also be doing family therapy.

I don't think CPS could intervene as it's not like she is keeping him from treatment or anything. She's just not very emotionally involved."
I'd run your plan for discipline and structure by them too. I can see how some of it would be really beneficial and can also imagine some of it backfiring. Good to get a professional opinion. 
"You two need to sit down and plan for the future as a team. He knows how this job affects him, so you two need a plan in place to mitigate it - therapy, more outdoor activities after work, 30 hours instead of 40 (not so he can weld, but so he can be less stressed), a job transfer that he can work towards. The solution isn't ""stay in job he hates indefinitely, harming the well-being of everyone in the family"" and the solution isn't ""drain finances indefinitely until we have no money even if he doesn't want to"". There are a lot of in betweens and you two should be discussing a 5 year and 10 year plan for maximum happiness while not sacrificing saving money."
"You’re not breaking up with him because he went it to dinner with his friends. You would be breaking up because he LIED again. If he truly thought he did nothing wrong, he would have been honest from the start. "
"Not meaning to offend but can I assume you're of a non Asian background? 

I come from a similar background as OP with some slight (but crucial differences) in the household. The cultural difference is so stark, but we can normalise it, just a perspective:

Sadly it's not that shocking to read that the parent saying she has no redeeming quality, it's hard to describe but they pretty much say what they think. I have a friend who has monolids which are considered less attractive in our culture and the dad has literally told her to get double eyelid surgery and has money set aside for it. It sounds harsh to everyone else, but many of us from my background can see that it's out of love (not saying I agree or not to it) and want their child to be the best

Also, unfortunately, for many growing up in a strict Asian household, especially for girls, there's a higher standard, less freedom with who you can be with, it's very controlling, mostly due to being protective (and OP is an only child too). My close friend's mum literally told her when she broke up with her boyfriend (immense family pressure) that it was a good thing and her studies is the only good thing she's got going on for her in her life. Yes, it's so so harsh, but from their perspective, it's love"
abuse is a choice my dude
"&gt;They spent their whole life raising us, educating us, paying for our every need.

I get so pissed when I read stuff like this.

That's their obligation for conceiving you and bringing you into this world. It's what they were supposed to do.

I'm not saying I don't owe my parents a lot, because I do.  But meeting parental obligations does not mean you get to control your kids lives.

Sorry, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but my reaction to stories like this is always fuck them. So I really have no advice for OP. "
"I don't want to offend anyone, because I have enormous sympathy for you. But caring for someone with a chronic condition is very difficult and it's not for everyone. It does not sound like this relationship is fulfilling for either of you anymore. I think you need to take some time not in a relationship, and really consider what kind of person you want in a relationship given the circumstances and the best path to finding them. I also think you need to reconsider what your life is going to look like in terms of medical debt, medical care your work situation, and disability filing."
"u/LambdaPhageT4, please listen to this. I wish I had been given advice like this when my first girlfriend (who I had been dating, at the time, for 2.5 years) cheated on me and I found out about it. 

We were watching a movie, and the whole time she was texting and seemed upset. At the end of the movie I jokingly said, ""Man, maybe I need to go look and see who you've been texting for the whole movie!"" She replied telling me, ""Go ahead, I don't care."" She had been texting the other guy the whole time during the date with me, and then she had the audacity at first to be upset with me for looking in her phone.

After that, however, it quickly became the tears and self-loathing you described in your original post. She had been struggling with depression and anxiety for a while leading up to that point and I had been a large part of her support, but she began to seek additional validation from other guys. Things began innocuous enough, with just long text conversations, before they escalated to sexting, sending nudes, etc. 

When it all came out, that night she was devastated. The person she had been texting during the movie was apparently in the process of telling her how he never actually thought she was attractive and so on (which was why she was constantly texting and seemed upset). I didn't want her to do anything rash, because she was making the same threats and statements about herself that your SO was doing. I let her stay the night, and I woke up to find her missing along with one of my kitchen knives with a goodbye note left for me. 

It started a long spiral down. I thought it could go back to how it was, that it could be brushed aside. I thought it worked, but then she cheated again saying something about how she was looking for something new. The process repeated before she cheated a third time. We then tried couple's counseling (I know, I know, wasted money after that many problems but I was stupid) and everything seemed well for several months. It seemed like we were on our way to a new relationship, before there was yet another guy except this time I was being left for him. 

It really fucked me up. I had been there to support her in her hardest times, even when she had stabbed me in the back. I think it's worth waiting a while (more than 1 week, preferably at least 2) to allow the immediate longing to pass, ideally with minimal contact with her. It'll suck, and you'll feel like ass during this time. At the end of that period you need to put together a pros and cons list of staying with her, and answer some real hard questions as honestly as you can.

u/LambdaPhageT4 if you're going to have a relationship you need to lay some new foundations for it, with clear expectations for both parties. You're going to need to find a way to move past the cheating yourself, whether it be individual or couple's therapy. You're also going to need to answer the biggest question of all, which is whether or not this is someone you can ever trust again. A relationship without trust is empty and hollow, and you can believe me because I lived with one for more than another half year.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I understand where you're coming from and why you think your relationship is different, I really do. Trust me, I've been in your shoes almost exactly. Please take my advice there in the second to last paragraph above the line break and at least take a break from the relationship for right now. Step back and take 2 weeks to yourself once you have taken steps to ensure her immediate safety (report her suicidal threats to law enforcement to get her some immediate help, and to her parents/friends/family to get her some immediate support). At the end of those two weeks, put together your list and answer the questions that I know seem far to overwhelming to deal with right now."
"&gt;He says that he is a really nice guy, and pretty girls never give him a chance. Now I've seen some of the DM's he has sent to girls and he's always talking to them and talking about what a nice guy he is, but when they turn him down he flips out and calls them assholes.

Sounds like every guy ever posted about on /r/niceguys 

&gt;I really don't want to kick him out of our life because he blows all the money I give him, and I am worried he will become homeless, and blame everything on me.

He probably will end up broke and blame everything on you, but the alternative is continuing to allow this guy to stomp all over your boundaries and disrespecting your girlfriend. I'm sure she didn't appreciate the dick pic. 

On the upside I'm sure other people have seen through his behaviour and won't take it seriously when he inevitably starts badmouthing you. 

Whilst you may not like the idea of cutting him off, I can't imagine the idea of your GF getting tired of this and walking away is preferable to you, which isn't a completely unlikely scenario considering this guy is getting worse and worse, and you have told her not to provoke or anger him. 

Seriously, what does this guy provide in your life that makes you this hesitant to get rid?"
"&gt; You’re entitled, and it’s not going to go well for you in the dating scene.

This right here makes me question OP's previous experience of being led on, since in this case he was so quick to assume that they were dating without having the conversation. It's become pretty standard to actually talk about it and discuss boundaries and such."
"&gt;She had a dog, who I despise, before we were together and the dog creates all sorts of problems for us. She is a huge responsibility that we frankly don't have time, or space for. It's a great dane, and she is a constant reminder of, in my opinion, a very irresponsible and costly decision that I am now suffering for.

Getting a dog is not an irresponsible decision just because you don't like dogs, OP.  And you knew that she had a dog going into the relationship, so I don't know why you're acting like that was something you expected to go away."
"Your standards are based on how the relationship rewards your need to feel better about yourself. If you feel good about yourself going in you're more likely to meet people who contribute to that good feeling rather than being the entire source of it. 

What you've described is a pattern of finding people who don't have as much life experience as you so you can take on what you think is the emotionally rewarding role of teacher or rescuer. You need to get down to what it is inside you that can only feel loved or special when you're responsible for someone else's emotional process."
Is she purposefully touching his face after touching the cat...??
"You owe him neither diddly nor squat.  He was given an opportunity to discuss it, and he physically hurt you - on top of all the emotional betrayal - instead.  Now he's just feeling guilty - as he should - and he wants absolution.  Guess what? You don't have to absolve him of his actions.  If he's feeling guilty, it's because he know he screwed up.

I'm flashing to the 1995 movie, ""French Kiss.""  Meg Ryan's character is discussing with her now ex-fiancee (Timothy Hutton) how to break up their relationship, and he's talking about how guilty he feels. 

&gt;**TH:** You don't hate me?  
&gt;**MR:** No. I did, Charlie. I really did, but...now...No.  
&gt;**TH:** Kate. I...   
&gt;**MR:**  Sweetie, are you crying?  
&gt;**TH:** No. No, no. I...You know, I just feel so totally, horribly guilty.  
&gt;**MR:**  Listen, don't feel guilty, because I'll start feeling guilty that I made you feel guilty and...you know...actually, that was the old me. Just feel guilty. Swim in it 'til your fingers get all pruny.

So unless you think you can be all self controlled and tell him to just swim in his guilt because it doesn't impact you, I don't think there's anything you can get out of having a conversation with him.

Enjoy the life you're building.  Sounds like a good one."
"&gt; His position is pretty legitimate

No it isn't.

She's 16 and can't afford a car.

There is no solution he couldn't help her with, either.

If he cared about her safety, he could enroll her in classes or buy her pepper spray. She is his child, instead of forcing her to walk home in the dark with nothing, he should be doing something. This entire spin about being self-reliant is complete BS, since no one is completely self-reliant at 16, nor should anyone expect that of them."
"Safewords are only necessary in relationships where the couple agrees to use words like ""no"" and ""stop"" to enhance sexual activities. If there is no such desire, and no conversation establishing safewords, ""stop"" *is* the safeword."
"Forgive her for yourself, not for her. But don't talk to her.

During the course of a marriage this happens. People gain a few lbs to more than just a few pounds. She probably would have gained up to 20 to 25 lbs if you guys had kids. For her to be so shallow about your weight gain but having body image issues, it reeks of problems with her personality you don't want to ever deal with.

She might get stressed by work. She might develop gestational diabetes. You might get injured somehow and be unable to work out. You might have a sick parent in the home to take care of and simultaneously work full time giving you no time to work out. What I'm saying is, throughout a relationship there are points where our spouses will gain and lose and a truly happy relationship involves supporting them and loving them during these times.

I'm not saying you should stay with someone who gains 50 lbs and steadily keeps gaining and never loses. I am saying that her dumping you over this speaks heavily of the fact that you don't want to stay with her. Her selfish and shallow reasons are her own and not you to forgive her for, and you need to just forgive her internally and move on. Which means, forgive her because it will make you feel better, but don't let her back into your life."
You fell in love with a dud who has failed to adult. Happens. Stick around for as long as you want. Don't expect anything to change.
"Still report to CPS. In no way will you have to take them in. First, CPS will offer resources (probably including subsidized daycare). In a last resort, the kids might be placed elsewhere. Even if no bio family will take them, there are plenty of good foster families - mine and many friends of mine included.

We had a foster kiddo who came to us at twelve who had been “homeschooled” his entire life. In reality he was watching his younger siblings. He couldn’t read, write, or do any double digit addition/subtraction. Once he entered school, he ATE IT UP. Give these kids a chance."

"Dang.  Your art teacher is rude, and your mom got mad at you?  I don't even know what to tell you.  It's not really to tell your mom that she shouldn't take her fear out on you, but that's what she's doing.

Do your best in class and try to survive the term, I think.  Or talk to the school counselor about the way the art teacher is treating you."
"I know, babe. I'm sorry to be the first person to teach you about divorce."
"Damn dude, your wife doesn't even empathize with you being an introvert...?! Yeah I think y'all have bigger issues than her frequent need for ""family time"". You should probably have a deep talk about introverts, your ""family time"" needs vs. hers, and come to a compromise. Cause you seem close to burnout. If she won't compromise, couple's counseling. Y'all may be incompatible if she refuses to understand your POV and concede a bit for your needs."
"I'm a firm believer that there are multiple soulmates in our lives: romantic, platonic, maybe more than one of each?  There's also more than one type of love, and I would hope you love more than just one person in your life.

My platonic best friend is my soulmate.  We're both straight married women who have grand plans for living together Golden Girls style once our husbands kick the bucket ;)  But I think my husband is also my soulmate too, in a ""this person gets me"" sort of way.

So I don't really see anything wrong with her being his soulmate and you not, particularly this early in your relationship.  What I *do* see a problem with is the way he's going about it.  He should try to calm your fears rather than shrug and tell you that you're insecure (unless that's his personality in general).  But I don't think their relationship is necessarily weird.

It may have to do with this being his first real relationship, like you said.  Someday, whether with you or someone else, he'll love someone in a completely different way than her, and at that point maybe he'll decide that's his soulmate."
"Hi, I can probably relate to your husband a lot. I had a relatively normal upbringing and both my parents are about as altruistic as they come. My girlfriend however...her mom might give yours a run for her money.

When we first started dating and I began to hear the stories from her, I missed a lot of the subtext from our conversations and made the same missteps. While she would sometimes tell me things about her mom to help cope or de-stress or simply prepare me for meeting her, I would sometimes take it as sort of a joke because of how outlandish it could sound. She might tell me a crazy story with an air of it being so outrageous, but for her it was traumatizing and not really funny at all. So later on the few times I shared these stories inappropriately, to her I was making light of her anguish and in a sense betraying her trust. It was also a problem because she was still trying to kindle a working relationship with her mom, and me mouthing off and making her look bad to people or my family only served to make her situation more complicated. It didn't take until later that I basically realized to shut my mouth about family matters and run stuff by her otherwise.

But yeah something to consider that if the stories involve him directly, that might be another matter.

Wish I could offer more advice but that's just my basic insight. If you haven't already, I'd just calmly explain how these stories affect you and how he's hurting you when he really doesn't have to share this stuff at all. "
Yikes. I think this is a sign I need to get off Reddit and go to bed. 
People generally can't smell their own smell unless it's something unusual/out of the ordinary for them. You're just used to it and it's normal to your senses. 
If nothing else I would print out the selfie and a pic of the tattoo face and put them side by side in front of your boyfriend. 
"You are getting plenty of measured and sensible advice here, but I couldn't resist sending a text or email regretting that you ""can't make her party because one of the gremlins is having a bad case of the  weirds."""
Yup.  There's some folks who don't see it so much as an umbilical cord as an un-severable bungee cord.
"You get $200 per month, but also have to buy them food, and use your own gas to pick them up. So you “earn” about $10 per day for 12 hours minus expenses. Honey even if she covered your gas and food for them she is only paying you about $1 per hour for two kids. She is overly taking advantage of you. I am so sorry all of you are in this position. She kicked you out, so you have permission to stop helping her. She has consequences for her actions too."
I wouldn't call breaking up with someone b/c you no longer find them attractive is particularly shallow.  Physical attraction is a cornerstone of almost all romantic relationships. If that goes out the window then there's not a lot there.  I was in a sexless marriage for years and it'll eventually destroy things
"Not only that, but had she gotten pregnant I practically guarantee she would’ve kept her mouth shut and OP would’ve been stuck raising and financing a kid that isn’t even his."
"There is going to be a lot of conjecture on my part (especially because the timing on him going from her to you has been left out), but here's what I think happened:

You were the greener grass that wasn't greener.  

He was experiencing the 7 (or 5) year itch, and you were new and exciting.  He gave into those new and exciting feelings and broke up with his girlfriend to be with you.  Assuming there wasn't a long gap between breaking up with her and dating you, it's natural that they were still in contact.  

You say you weren't progressing, but starting slow is natural, but I think he just didn't end up liking you as much as he thought.  You've settled down into the relationship routine, and he's realizing your grass isn't as green as it looked.  

Look, no one needs to meet up with an ex in a cabin because they are not in a good place.  If you've broken up, and have moved on, there's no ""place"" to need to be.  He's going to talk with her, and if she wants to take him back, he's going to go.  "

"To be fair most 4 year olds bear some resemblance to movie gremlins if we actually Venn diagram it. 

It's hardly a heinous insult that implies malice towards them or danger. It's just dislike and annoyance. 

Clearly OP should not leave said children in the care of SIL with that attitude but it sounds like no one wants that. Gremlins is hardly a heinous insult. "

"1) you should blur her details. I don't care if it's the rules of the sub or not, she didn't consent to having her private convo splashed on reddit and less so with her handle on it. 

2) it's a bit of a stretch to call an internet friend you presumably haven't met a girlfriend, but either way, her interaction with you is messages which apparently now also include some racist or hurtful stuff - not only are you not able to shield her from your terrible family, you can't even shield her convos from your brother - or reddit apparently - so now she has no reason to believe it won't keep happening. 

3) time to move on. Try dating locally, it helps to have relationships where you actually know the person and not only whatever online persona they want to present."
Maybe she had the audacity to be born with different colored skin.
I agree mostly because it sounds like they haven't been productive and more him wanting to pick a fight than actually move forward.
"Respect yourself enough to be with someone who does healthy activities, and doesn't do drugs.

Your future kids/self deserve a better parent/partner, were you to go down that route."
"You do realize that saying ""I can't cook"" is complete bullshit, right?  
You have the whole internet under your thumb. Learn.  
Do you think other people are born knowing how to cook? No, we all have to learn it at some point.  
  
But yeah, that boyfriend is a selfish asshole no matter what. "
"This is a serious incompatibility. We can't give you magic words to say, as someone noted, to change him. Your choices are either to stay with him and accept that he'll never do anything more than pick up McD's for you, no matter what, or move along to someone more adult and considerate. "
An anniversary is usually a yearly occurrence. People don’t usually celebrate one and a half years.
"I respect your decision and your thinking, but imagine the scenario in which you'd actually be called upon to be a full time guardian; your only sibling would be out of the picture. Your parents might be too. Your nieces/nephews might be your only biological family left. 

It's good to know enough about yourself that you wouldn't be a good option as a caretaker/guardian, but man, I couldn't ever imagine a situation in which my sister dies and I'd ever refuse to look after her kid. And she hasn't even given birth to it yet. "
"wow - welcome to adulthood, where no one gives a shit how the college you went to was ranked.  your girlfriend is going to have a rough ride of her twenties until she realizes that people are judged on their merits (...and personalities), not their college transcripts."
I told my sister I won't take her kids and explain all my reasons by email. I would make a bad parent even if I have the financial means to take care of them. She was really hurt at first but eventually came around to see my POV. We have other family wiling and able to take care of them and I'm glad we had this convo early. I wonder how OP put it to his sister. 
"There's a reason nobody is responding to you and it's because all your points are addressed in the comments you're responding to. Read better.

Also fyi your kids-boats comparison is absolutely horrifying."
"Presumably OP wouldn’t sexually abuse his sister’s kids, so yeah, it actually is still a shit ton better than foster care."
"Honestly, this is dealbreaker material. He's a fucking doormat and can't even stand up to his own friends. Coupled with not making your anniversary a priority...FUCK THAT SHIT.

You can do so much better. He's older than you, but way less mature and probably won't be changing anytime soon. He showed you who he prioritizes (his friend's feelings over yours) and you deserve to be with someone who respects you more. 

Dump his ass and hang in there 💕"
"Well if he gets hit by a bus and becomes a quadrapelegic i hope he's ok with becoming a ward of the state. After all, his sister and mother didn't ask or want to take care of a severely disabled man "
"I’m the child of a mother who stayed with a man who was unfaithful to her for half my childhood. I have no respect for my father and very little for my mom for setting a horrible example for me and being an enabler. I would’ve rather had divorced parents than constantly have been exposed to their bs and water under the bridge - children can feel it. 

Take all the evidence you can and split. Fuck him. "
"You can break up with someone for any reason.

I would handle this by talking with your boyfriend.  Ask him if you can take a photo of his back before you talk.  Tell him that he may not realize that his back tattoo is different than the drawing he showed you.  Ask him to compare the photo to the drawing with you.

Tell him that the tattoo looks like his female friend.  That the idea of him having a tattoo that resembles a woman that treats you badly is a sexual turnoff for you.  Ask him to have Dan change the facial features.

If he doesn't take you seriously, then you can make your decision.  "
"He does give a shit what others think of him, and the reaction is exactly what he wants. He wants to lord it over others that he doesn't care about ""fashion"" and they do.

Turn it on him. Make sure he knows that by wearing these things to public places and events that it means he cares. If he truly doesn't give a shit, he can slip on a plain black tee."
"Accuses OP of negligence

Abandons child during medical emergency (where he cries over his mother's behavior instead of his broken arm) for a week (during which he cries for her)"
"&gt; Sister is the older sibling and takes on the ""mother"" role.

No. That was never really our dynamic. I never viewed her as any sort of parental or authority figure and that wasn't really the nature of our interactions. If anything, she was my friend.

&gt; Sister takes care of dad when he's dying. Sister also having to take of younger brother (who is only one year younger) because guilt and family. Dad finally dies. Sister helps to take care of estate. Sister tired. Grieving. Very young still and having a freak out moment. 

The college I went to was in state (hers was out of state) and I was the one who was primarily taking care of my dad during his final time (taking him to chemo, helping with his medical arrangements, driving him to the hospital when neccesary). I was the one who primarily planned with my dad what we would do in the event of his death. Neither of us really was interested in the house, so after asking for her input (and getting her okay) I had our father draft a will basically saying that his assets (really just the house) will be sold, debts paid, then my sister and I split the net.

&gt;Sister has never really felt like she is able to relax or have fun or be a young girl because responsibilities. Younger brother is leaning on sister still, sister is protecting him and shielding him like she always did but it's just too much all of a sudden.

Like I said, we weren't attached at the hip close. I never really viewed her as my protector or anything. We would only ever talk maybe once or twice a week on the phone and wouldn't see each other any more than 2 or 3 times a month. She's more of a peer to me than anything. I'm sure she would have been responsible for me if she needed to be, but I've never been dependent on others to do things I can do myself.

&gt;Sister goes, I need to take care of myself (for once in her life) but realizes if brother stays she will continue taking care of him. 

Our dynamic was never really one of caretaker and caretakee. If you remove the biological connection, then we were really just good friends. There was no lopsided dependency or anything like that. 
"
What if you contact him and your brother finds out later ? This feels like something you should tell him upfront. I think you tell him you want to get to know the young man and it's up to your brother what he does but you are being open about it.
Tell her that she should send you an email with a damn good reason why she abandoned you and not expect and feel entitled to any response. 
"Have you asked your therapist if you could write down what you can't say out loud?

"Sounds like OP actively pursued a man in a relationship. Now that the guy has come out of his cheating fog, he's probably freaked out."
"I’m his first serious girlfriend, he’s dated a bunch of women before but not long term. So I have no idea:/

I think he gave into what she ‘needs’ instead of setting boundaries. I’ve tried to stay out of their personal relationship as it’s complicated, so I’m not totally certain of what happened. This whole side of their relationship is new (basically since we were dating), the issues they had were deep seeded for years, but now they both seem happy with the result? "
"My husband died unexpectedly and he was not close to his family. However, his sister did reach out to me after the funeral and we have spent time together talking about who he was since they really didn’t know him for the last 11 years of his life. It has been very healing for both of us. I hope you do reach out to her. I’m very sorry for your loss. "
"Good job!

Please don't stop taking medications because ""you feel good"""
"I think other commenters have provided some more helpful advice. 

I’m going to provide an alternate perspective. 

My dad sounds much like your SO. He wasn’t particularly affectionate with me growing up (still isn’t). He would say the words “I love you” and I’m sure he did. As much as he could. He grew up in a family with minimal affection. I get why he is how he is. 

He’d go on business trips for weeks and my mom would barely get a peck on the lips. I’m not saying they should have had heavy makeout sessions in front of us kids but I recall it feeling perfunctory and forced. I don’t remember them cuddling on the couch. Holding hands. Any of it. 

And my mom lived with that for almost 20 years. But she’s much like you, she loves little signs of physical affection. Holding hands. Snuggling on the couch. Kisses that aren’t rote and obligated. 

And after that long she just couldn’t do it any longer. He had no desire to change. He was content as is. He didn’t care she wanted more and didn’t understand why it mattered to her. In his mind he loved her and things were fine. But they weren’t. 

So my mom left him. And rightfully so. I don’t blame her at all.

Some years later she remarried. My stepdad is the opposite. 6-7 years into their marriage he still holds he hand. Happily kisses her. Snuggles her on the couch. It’s adorable because I’ve never seen my mom so happy! She finally gets to feel the love she deserves. And I couldn’t be happier that she made that change in her life. "
but was it sent under duress?!
"I'm not going to jump on the same train as everyone else and might get downvoted into oblivion but I think it's important to note these things.

There is no compassion for your wife or her position in your post at all. You want to ""fix"" her, you want to bring her to a therapist, you outline her flaws etc but as far as I can see there was no effort to help her through the hard times aside from you trying to force her into therapy. As someone with a long history of mental illness I can tell you right now forcing a person into therapy will not work. She might have done it for you but seeing as your relationship is not doing so well I can't blame her for not continuing to do it for you. She needs to want to do it for herself. And your role in this is to help her see why she will benefit from therapy. ""It'll help you get happy and therefore make me attracted to you again"" is the wrong reason. ""I noticed that you've lost joy you used to find in your art and I know it's important to you. Therapy can help you find that joy again"" is better.

All that being said, I'm not sure this will work in your relationship. OP, you honestly seem a bit selfish and unempathetic to me. Losing her art, something that was so important to her, was a huge blow and I don't see much in your post to suggest that you worked on this issue together and that you were supportive and encouraging her aside from trying to force her into therapy which it looks to me like you did for you more than for her. On top of that you later just found some eye candy to daydream about to distract you from your wife's misery. 

Yes she's not an angel and dealing with her issues the way she has been is not healthy. But again, she's been gone for a day and you don't seem the least bit concerned about her whereabouts or well-being, just whether or not you should bail? 

Yeah, I don't think you should be together but not for the reasons you outlined.

"No? She likes him because he is pretending to be a good guy. Very poorly, but it's not like he is making clear she is just some side chick."
"&gt; Why do you see it as control when he might see it as putting the kids first? 

If he thinks it's that important for a parent to stay home, he should stay home."
"Not all women like the same thing or want to date only tall muscular guys. 

This lack of success in dating isn’t caused by your looks, it’s caused by your inability to see women as unique individuals and your low self esteem. Fix those two traits and you’ll find more success in dating. "
I went off tonight after reading all this thread and unleashed all this to him in a fucking parking lot. He backhanded me in the face. Threw me against a car. Screamed at me in public. I have a broken kneecap (because of him) and he picked me up and dropped me on it. I’m embarrassed to say any of this but I’m getting more mad as the minutes pass by. Fuck him. I will never look at him again. the last 10 years of my life have been a slow death by a thousand cuts. 
"You were not a creep, she is being very rude. There’s nothing wrong with what you did especially after dating for 6 months."
Like can you imagine seeing your partner seriously depressed and turn into a zombie because of medication she's taking only because of her situation and then make plans to keep her in the situation. So callous.
Date his enemies then.
"Your wife is a teacher and is thinking about running for a state representative seat...which is fine, but she could really use some time to hob-knob some more. 

I just can't believe she finds it hard to understand that this is a difficult time for her to be doing this:  you work full time, are in a masters program, and have two kids under five??  Most--or at least a lot-- of people in graduate school just do that only (grad school),  maybe  a part time gig on the side for some spending money. I can't see how you can pick up any slack at this time. 

One way that people get involved in politics is to run for an important but ""lesser"" position, such as the Board of Education. They get some experience, get some exposure, start networking, and then they go for a bigger seat. With her background in education and the fact that she admits she really doesn't know what's going on, this might be a good plan of attack for her to get that State Rep seat in a few years. 

And of course, in a few years, your life will be calmed down some, and the kids will be  older. 

Laying this plan out to her might also be a good way to gauge if she is serious about this, or if she is simply getting swept away by the urgency and passion and excitement of the events that are transpiring right now."
"

He should see a neurologist to determine the extent of the damage done by his injuries.
"jfc girl, you are so young! be grateful you are still in your early 20s, GTFO, you deserve better and have more than ample time to find it."
"I agree that they should definitely have told you before they gave out keys to a place where you also live, but you did say they'd been dating long term and these are dudes you know. Nobody's a stranger, and you don't mention any of them being badly behaved or making you feel unsafe. So, while it was uncool of them, IMO I don't think it's worth ending your friendships over."
"It's quite possible your wife is on the asexuality spectrum. Has she considered that?  If not, maybe you both could read up about it and see if it fits how she feels."
"Have you told him what you think? If not you should. 

I know it’s cliché here, but he needs to go to therapy. Yes, I get dealing with businesses is frustrating, but he’s doing himself (and you) no favors by acting this way. "
"*Major* red flag to me. Being in a relationship with any man who fetishizes your lack of experience means he's interested in the idea of being the one in charge of that for you, the one to dictate stuff for you. It'd be pretty creepy on its own to me, but given your history, it's especially scary. At the very least, please consider seeing a therapist to work through remaining issues from the very, very predatory and awful relationship you were in before. "
"So, you now know that that kind of behavior is a deal breaker for you.  Let her know that, end your FWB situation, and move on.  It shouldn't be hard for her to understand that that kind of behavior is a bit squicky for people, unless she's just that clueless and dense."
"Why not? If she were to be a stay-at-home mother, she should get a separate allowance for her own fun stuff, so any expensive clothing, hair, make-up, art, movies, theatre, pottery course, books, whatever. If she decides to save up some of that money so she can make a big purchase some time, you shouldn't criticise that. Would you want her to criticise you when you would decide to blow a couple of hundred on a bachelor party, gambling, game tickets, a fancy phone/watch/gadget? She should be able to do whatever she wants with that fun allowance. If she spends nothing for 4 months so she can then buy one expensive bag, that's her choice."
"It’s hard to believe a guy who deliberately downloaded a dating app, flirted and chatted with MANY women, agreed to meet one, and then kissed her. You had lots of opportunities to NOT do any of those things. And yet here we are. So yeah you’re only sorry you got caught. Enjoy that single soldier life. "
I'd say requiring the mother to admit to her lies publicly to be a perfectly reasonable request to show she's willing to mend bridges and that she wants to make up for the harm she caused.

"DING DING DING

Found the problem, OP."
"End this, because your GF deserves someone who thinks she's hot.

Also, you come across as a jerk here, just saying."
my question is why are you with someone that holds your relationship and emotional state hostage? 
"Your boyfriend rules, and so do you for all that progress."
"This is getting into the verbal abuse territory. You guys need to learn to effectively communicate your opinions and debate without getting personal. (Your husband is 30, not a 8 years old child.) Avoid dismissing each other's opinions or saying things that can be interpreted as personal attacks. Take turns when speaking - don't interupt one another. 

Sit him down and address this problem. ""Husband, I feel we often get frustrated at one another when we are just trying to express our opinions on an issue. We would sometimes verbally assault one another to prove our point. Now, I don't think you mean what you said during the arguments, but it hurts me that you feel that it's okay personally insult me. Can we talk about why that happens and how to fix it?"" This might not work if he can't have a calm conversation with you. In that case, I think you are in desperate need of marriage counselling. 

If he denies insulting you or say that his insults are valid - I don't know why you would want to stay with a man that give you 0 respect. "
"So she's a loser that got sucked into MULTIPLE pyramid schemes?  Man, I don't know you, but I KNOW you can do better than this.  "
"Who said anything about using? If OP can easily afford it and had never minded paying, why would the friends think it was an issue? 

I say this as someone who, like OP, has a far poorer friend. If I want to do something and invite her, I pay. She doesn't ask at this point because it's been this way for years (and we were friends long before I started making good money).

It's not using me. I want to do these things with her and I know that the only way to make that happen is to make her dish out money she can't afford to spend or to pay, so I pay. 

If these friends are picking the places or buying the most expensive food, then there's a problem, but if all they're doing is coming out when invited and letting op pay as he's always done/when he offers, then that's not using."
"So he has insurance, right? Can't he just go to a private therapist rather than using whatever resources the department provides? 

I mean, no therapist can call your supervisor or partner/coworkers and rat you out. It's like going to the doctor; covered under HIPAA, completely confidential. 

And I hate that police culture stigmatizes people getting help to cope with trauma. That is despicable. There should be no shame in it, nor should there be any professional repercussions. "
"Yeah, sorry but that's not ""normal"" for you to feel guilty about it. You making more money than your friends does not mean that you aren't an equal to them, which means that you are in no way obligated to pay for their share. That would imply that you're of higher status when you aren't. 

If your friends assume that you're going to pay for them every time you go out, then you are not their equal in some way. I would stop paying. "
"It sounds to me like she might still have feelings for the guy. She may also just be suffering with trust issues. She was open with you when you got together due to vulnerability and the fact that you're growing closer may be the thing making her retreat a bit. 

Finding out someone has cheated on you is never an easy thing to go through and it's understandable that she's still a very ""to herself"" kind of person but I wouldn't worry or think badly about it. She just needs the right amount of time to come back to being herself in a relationship. All you can do is show her that you're there to support her and that you won't hurt her.

Don't be direct or start acting different yourself though, at least not straight away. Liken said she's more than likely suffering with trust issues that will eventually go away. 

Hope it all works out"
Children's name shouldn't be anyone that you have a past with or that mother or father have strong feelings for (positive or negative). That's only fair. Not the name of your old crush or your ex. Speak up now.
"That sucks, he sounds really immature and unable to own up to his behavior. But you know the truth about what happened with him, and ultimately everyone else's opinion doesn't matter. "
"So just try to give it a few weeks.  A lot of unpleasant things are big shocks but become okay with time.  You like this girl, she regrets it, don't make any snap decisions.  Plus, if you break up now and lie she'll see through it and know the real reason anyway.  Either do it now and tell the truth or wait.  I recommend waiting.  A few weeks won't kill you and you may end up okay."
It is if you don't give a shit like them.
"&gt; But after 4 years of rejected attemps, it gets a little bit old.

This just breaks my heart for your stepson.  He's not working on *your* schedule so you what?  Just want to move on to another child? 
You agreed to be a step parent.  That doesn't have an expiration date!  That didn't come with qualifiers that if your stepson didn't come around and fit into your perfect scenario in your head you could just give up.

God damn this kid has to feel so unloved.  There is no way that he isn't feeling this from you considering how much you unknowingly reveal with you comments."
He also says he has anger and jealousy issues. Yikes.

Depends on the state but probably not.

"Absolutely. My god, I cannot imagine the pain of this family. They’ve lost a daughter and now this snake will be parenting their grandchild."
"Are you really projecting $5000 a week of sustainable profit based off of 3 days??? This is way too soon to be making that your long-term plan. 

You sound like a hungry hustler which is good. But it also sounds like you quite often bite off more than you can chew. If you haven't been able to save enough money when all you pay for is cable, food, and sometimes house supplies then how in the world are you going to afford a $1650 (Security, First&amp;Last months) rent?

I'd suggest you do go back to college or part-time certification in business admin or the likes. That way, when one of your endeavors do take off, you'll have the financial know-how and awareness to forecast reasonable earnings and impress investors down the road. Right now, your mom's right. But, you can always choose to move out. "
Yeah my gut is for sure telling me something!! Hard to do a slow fade when you work in a small office and plus I’ve acted very friendly towards her as well... I’m hoping once we both get busy the slow fade will happen on its own! Thanks for the advice! 
"Dude, it seems like she's into you. I haven't met many strippers in my day, but I don't think you'd date a customer unless you actually like them. Us women try to avoid situations where bitter angry men can come to our work and harrass us. 
Take a chill pill and enjoy your dates."
I don’t think anyone is suggesting that statement be used. Just to leave that information out of the discussion. 
"&gt;she still comes to my place

Don't open the door.

&gt;saying that I'm a shitty person and that I'm just trying to get away from her.

Start saying ""yep, I'm terrible, but you're even worse, that's why I'm trying to get away from you.""

You don't have a moral obligation to treat someone well who treats you so hideously. You just don't, whether mother or stranger. She's clearly got no sense of moral obligation to you! If she has nowhere to go, well she should have thought of that before treating you this way. I get that it's easier said than done, but there's no solution here except to shine up your spine and tell her, possibly literally, to fuck off. Yes you'll feel you can't do it, yes in the short term you'll feel guilty. But stop letting this awful woman define you to yourself! You know you're not a liar, you know you're not a ""piece of shit"". She can spout whatever lies she wants - let it roll off your back. The more distance you get the easier it will be to see this for what it is - **abuse**. You don't have to leave yourself open to it. Shut her out of your life, or at the very least your home, and start healing."
"She has a problem that is affecting her happiness to an extreme level. As nice as it would be to rely on her life partner to help her fix the problem, at the end of the day we are all responsible for our own happiness and she should shoulder the burden. That’s just being an adult"
It doesn't have to be outright hatred to be racist. 
Absolutely fucking not. I cannot believe you are stitting here at 20 asking us how to date a 16 year old child with no shame about it. Fuck directly off until she is 22 and the age different is remotely acceptable.
"I like to approach matters of the heart with cautious optimism. If you feel like you two clicked, go out with her again and find out if the connection is real. I don’t know if it’s necessarily fair to make assumptions about her motivations  based on her job. Maybe she’s stripping to pay her way through school. Maybe she’s just a sexual being and found a way to make money off of it. Or maybe like some other replies said, she’s interested in a few free meals. Just make sure you’re thinking more with your mind/gut and not your man parts :)"
"I actually will use that word as someone studying to be an attorney thank you. This is sustained and widespread regular harrassment based on a protected class characteristic (depending on location) and not depending on location, its unacceptable behavior HR would like to curtail. The only thing that makes this inactionable is a lack of compiled evidence. "
"It took me 5yrs of misdiagnosis to find out I had fibromyalgia. I was told I was too young, it was all in my head, etc. I was excited to actually get a diagnosis and a treatmemt. But its seen as an invisible illness. 

Unfortunately, as much as it might suck, it's best to surround yourself with people that are concerned with your health. I got tired of people acting like I wasn't being honest about my pain. Everyone that's in my life now is really supportive of my illnesses and limitations."
Are you willing to do ANYTHING to help your wife? I feel like even a roommate might have the empathy to do more for her 
"So? She should. Any decent couple’s counselor would have taken you seriously and refused to continue treating you and your wife together. If she can’t meet that bare minimum standard, then she shouldn’t be practicing. "
"You can get realistic. Of course this will be a relationship changing event. He won’t be “scared off”, like it’s a misunderstanding. He’ll decide if he wants to continue a very young relationship with a girl who will soon have a baby that will dominate her life. 

You need to tell him ASAP and not take his decision personally. You have much bigger things to worry about."
"&gt;is it time to throw in the towel?

Yes it is.  Lawyer up and keep seeing the counselor for yourself.  Change your diners so that you aren't distracted by a friendly face while you sort out your life."
"No, it's because of your immaturity displayed in your post. "
"if you think she's cool and you're sure she's not going to star in any more porn, I don't see why you should break up with her. It's really easy to think of a hypothetical situation as a dealbreaker before you really encounter it with an actual human being. think about all the reasons this is a deal breaker for you, and weigh them objectively."
"That literally is a cop out. Reach out to a friend, family, someone. Any option is better than what you’re living in right now "
"It is not your fault. It is you husband's fault. This is his family. You have been together for 6 years. He should have set boundaries long ago. Instead you have sacrificed moments that were supposed to be about YOUR happiness, to keep his family, specifically his mother, happy. At this point you both could use a marriage counselor because you need to sit down with him and have some serious talks. 

I understand he has done a lot for you and your child these past 6 years. But at what cost? You and these children are his family now. He needs to realize that sooner than later. Because this type of environment and family dynamic is going to start taking a toll on you and your children. In fact it already is. 

You don't want to deal with this. I don't blame you. his family sounds selfish and self-centered. It would be exhausting for anyone. That is why you need to sit him down and say you are done. His sister is not invited to any family event. You will also not attend any family events where she will be. Apology or not until her behavior shows actual change. Anyone can give a bs apology. What matters is showing change. 

You married him. Not his mother. There is no reason why she had to be dictating you bridal shower. The whole thing should have been prepared by someone you chose and trusted. That's why bridal showers tend to be prepared by the maid of honor, not the MIL. There is no reason why she should be dictating your baby shower or anything to do with your family.  

If he wants to bend backward for them that is his issue. But when it comes to things that affect you and the family, that is between you and him. Not him, his mom, his sister and then you."
"I mean, Dick is a pretty funny name. "
"Honestly, if YOU don't make a formal complaint, I guarantee someone else will and she'll lose her job anyway."
I would pour bleach in my eyes if I saw a sex tape of my sister. I would have hidden and password locked that folder. Maybe he forgot; Maybe he doesn't care; Or maybe he wanted you to find them. That's all I'm saying.  Can't you just say you know about him and this guy without possibly embarrassing him by saying you saw the sex tapes
"&gt;I wrote him an email from my own email account telling them that my fiance is a grown man and that while it's sad that their daughter is dead the reality is that he's moved on with me.

You are WAY too immature to be thinking of marriage to anyone, let alone a family unit that's already experienced a major loss. I don't care if your fiance's dead spouse was Attila the Hun Jr. and her parents are Attila Sr. You should have had the maturity to step back, talk to your fiance, and *not* throw the dead daughter in your future in-laws' faces. There are some nasty comments that once said, can never be un-said or un-heard by the recipient. I'd be very surprised if that wasn't the case here.

I'm not saying you need to roll over and be a doormat no matter how your in-laws treat you. But you are going to be a stepmother to your fiance's son whether you like it or not. And your fiance's son is going to grow up and want to know about his biological mother. For the child's sake, this is a set of relationships that needs to be navigated with sensitivity, care, and yes, *sacrifice*. You're crashing around with a sledgehammer, very selfishly placing your own feelings above that of a child who lost his mother and is in danger of losing his grandparents because of *your* power plays."
I know a dude who gets a boner every time he yawns without fail. I think it's pretty funny. He's def not turned on by it being beddy bye time lol
"Sometimes the reality is terrible. You would probably have a sex drive if you weren't so exhausted all the time. 

So this dude does the fun parts of parenting, leaves the hard parts to you, doesn't have to do housework, and gets a homemade meal cooked for him every night while he relaxes on the couch. That's a pretty sweet deal for him. 

The thing is, he's 50. He knows what he's doing. I wonder if he's been married before and his relationship ended over this same scenario..."
"No, this isn't true. Libel has to be both defamatory *and false.* While this sounds like it might harm his reputation, the statuses he mentioned only said, ""soandso a 30 year old slept with an 18 year old, how creepy"". The first part is true, the second part is an opinion. No libel.

Calling him a predator who shouldn't be near young girls is a little dicier. But it would be hard to prove that this is a false statement rather than an opinion.

If they were saying, ""OP is a registered sex offender, keep your 12-year-old daughters away from him"" then we'd have a different conversation..."
Honestly there is no way he talks about jizzing on the windows or his buddies bending over. He is lying to you.
"&gt;and he said he would help if he could.

this means he would be sexual with her, but is prevented from doing so by his relationship with you. He presents it like you're a weight holding him back from doing something he wants. I've cheated before, this is exactly what i'd say to the girl i actually wanted to be with before we actually started cheating. You should ask him to see the messages, if he declines or wants some time alone with his phone first (so he can delete select messages) then you'll know for sure."
"You look how you want to look, it's not decided by him. I'm getting he isn't s Greek Adonis with perfect body and hair. Don't let him dictate how you look "
I'm really thinking that this one is a bit of a raging troll. 
"I'm an operating theatre nurse and when I end up scrubbing for long cases, I usually let my fiance know I'm scrubbing for one so he knows I'm not in any sort of trouble. If we go out to do other things and the other doesn't respond to an urgent text, we call each other and usually we answer. If after ten calls the other doesn't respond, it's usually a good cause of concern for us. We are each other's family in a foreign country. We do not have any other family here nor any close friends. So we are very close.

Bottomline is if my fiance behaved this way, I wouldn't be offended by it. But that's us. That's *our* relationship.

Only you can really answer if this is right with your relationship or not. And if it makes you uncomfortable, it's worth discussing with your boyfriend. Explore why you're bothered by it so you can articulate yourself in an open, calm way instead of sounding accusatory. I honestly believe this isn't an issue you should just ignore and set aside. There are things both parties in a relationship need to discuss in order to clear the air. This is one of them. "
Yeah I was a bit surprised by the 5 hour lunch. That’s a long time to go without even glancing at your phone.
"Did you actually ask her in person? Was she involved with the planning? After all she is your girlfriend. If the first she knew about it was an invite on Facebook then I understand her reply.  Quite frankly if I received an invitation from my partner on facebook only I wouldn't be responding maybe, I'd be saying nope, wtf. 

Edit: she is quite rightly pissed with you for not asking her in person. "
"You're both finding your way as a newly married couple, as your own, new family.  Lucas is still finding his way as an independent adult and needs to get on with that, asap. He's 28 and married, so it's time.  His parents need to find their way as the parents of an adult who need to respect you and Lucas and let you live your lives.

You sound like you've got your sh!t together.  Lucas still needs to work on that.  His parents ... not looking good so far but with a lot of firm boundaries set by you and Lucas, *as a united front*, you might set them straight. Or not. The key is Lucas here. They're his parents, therefore his responsibility to set firm boundaries with and to support you as Number One in his life now.

I'm sorry but this scheduled meeting to discuss your ""offenses"" ... did they actually put it that way?  If so, you should be offended as they are treating you like misbehaving little children which is inappropriate.  The fortune cookie thing was a bit uncomfortable for me to read about but sounds like they have zero sense of humor and would find offense in anything.  That's about the only thing I can find ""fault"" with, and only slightly at that, considering the audience.  If it were me, I'd apologize for that but nothing else, just to try to mend fences. They sound like unpleasant people who won't let their baby boy go and who dislike you for taking him away, and would dislike any woman for doing that.  Good luck. You'll need lots of it. "
"It's one thing to include others into their family. Another to recruit a DIL to guilt trip their son into interacting with them in the quite unauthentic exalted level of communication. If his mom wants him to gush over BS in postcards, she has to tell him herself, not rope his wife. "
"If you try to force anything, your family will never trust you. There is a child's well-being at stake here. The child's needs are more important than your sense of entitlement. If you can only stay sober when someone is dangling a carrot in front of you, you are not ready."
"Just focus on your work and the next couple of months will fly by.

Look, this may sound a little harsh but the fact that you ended up getting sweet talked by someone who was so rude to you that you almost slapped him (don't hit people that offend you, btw, but I digress) suggests you have extremely low self esteem. You didn't like this guy!! At all!! But you still made out with him, went on a date, and even while in the middle of the worst date ever that you *for some reason* still were trying to salvage got offended that he didn't want anything serious with you. 

Your behavior is mystifying, and I can only assume it's because you don't have the confidence to know you deserve better. You *do not* have to settle for whatever attention is thrown your way. Up your standards. "
I thought the same thing.  This is coming up out of nowhere after two years?  Bet anything he has his eye on someone else that he's comparing OP to.
Keep hold of the anger. It is productive and a reasonable response! It’s all positives from here. 💙
"Okay but he was cheated on over 4 years ago...OP has NOT cheated on this guy for 4 years...time to cut the shit. If he's still that paranoid after 4 YEARS of faithfulness then the dude needs therapy, stat."
"You are selfish. So selfish. At some point she is going to suggest you both see a doctor, and that doctor will go “he had a vasectomy, that’s why”. Instead of telling her you want one and letting her make the decision, you want to lie and be selfish. People like you suck and she deserves better. "
"I spent my childhood looking after my grandmother with dementia, I didn't get to have a childhood, from 4 I was looking after myself and a much older woman who thought I was a stranger and thought she was being held somewhere against her will.

To get to the point, my mother and I have made an agreement that if my mother goes through dementia and is as difficult to look after as my grandmother was - I am to put her in a home and not tarnish my memories of her by seeing her so hobbled by illness. 

Do not act like you speak for everyones experience and expectations of dementia. He still loves your grandmother, but that woman is no longer your grandmother. He is nearly 90 years old, this is such a gigantic burden for a man who's already been through enough death. You aren't even considering how hard this is for him. "
"Honestly this guy sounds exhausting. They don't seem to have much in common, and their communication is terrible. There are so many people in this world--it's silly to waste even a minute with someone you're not compatible with. This does not sound like a fun relationship. He tells her to pick what she wants, but really he's playing games to see if she will read his mind and pick what *he* wants; when she actually picks what *she* wants, he pouts like a child. That sounds sooooo sexy. /s

I would totally bail. "
You need to get used to the fact that she’s not a little girl anymore. I hope you’re not helping her through school to maintain some type of leverage over her. She’s an independently-thinking adult and she doesn’t have to give up autonomy just because she accepted your offer to help with college. 
"Honestly having had a back and forth with OP already and having read many of her comments, it is abundantly clear that she is not ready for any relationship.

She has this incredibly warped view of men in general coupled with a toxic view on sex.

She really is not ready to be with anyone. At this point I suspect that OP's ex left for reasons not related to sex, but the only way OP can spin it in her head is that he only wanted sex which is why he left.

She has a lot of baggage that needs to be dealt with before she can ever hope to have a normal relationship"
"He's not caring - he's controlling.  He needs to get help for his issues.  

Honestly, even if he does offer to get help, you should still get out while you can.  There's no guarantee he will follow thru and get help or change and you deserve much, much better than this. 

"
"Well according to OP, he's getting DMs about how he needs to pick the best friend over his future wife...yeah sure..."
"They can't, OP already said in another comment that they've squeezed her in already and honestly the finace has more important things to worry about than reschedule her doctors appointment. "
"First off, let me say that you sound like a really intelligent and emotionally healthy woman. You got together VERY young and he never really got to find himself as an adult.  

This reads like a movie where he leaves, has a few bad years, and realizes what he wanted was right there at home the whole time.  

This stinks of mid-life crisis.  

The whole music and concerts thing, maybe he feels like he missed out on, since that's the life a lot of guys live in their early 20s. "
It sounds like you wish your best friend were your fiancée. 
"I'l admit, even with the seriousness of the situation, I am still laughing pretty hard about the gf disliking the sister over the wrong type of pizza. "
"Based on his description it sounds like she has perinatal depression. I'm not sure how he can address that if she won't go to doctor's appointments, but it makes sense to look into that before your rote lawyer/custody/divorce advice. These people who write in for advice aren't paper dolls; they have lives and feelings and talk about loving their SOs. Why not try to help them?"
"Did it somehow escape your attention when you met her and got to know her that she looked like this?

Having preferences is fine, and you’re allowed to be attracted to what you’re attracted to. 

But why did you even start this up if you knew you weren’t attracted to her?"
"I disagree about the party. I think OP needs to work on her social anxiety, with therapy and possibly medication being a primary step.

I do also agree, to some extent, that she should make some effort to face her anxiety. But going to a party for 20 minutes and throwing up twice is not healthy and not going to make her comfortable. A first step needs to be something like a walk around the block, or picking up one item from a supermarket with self checkout. Little steps that don't involve as much interaction, and realizing that people aren't staring at and judging her. "
"I'll be honest - it sounds like your SO has a c**khold fetish on top of the insecurity.

Insecurity wouldn't lead to him pretty much demanding you sleep with other men or he won't move in with you. Getting turned on by the idea of you being with better equipped men on the other hand. I can almost guarantee IF you did this he'd want details. and I do mean DETAILS.

Honestly? You can't fix this. On the one hand is an issue that is on him to fix. On the other is a kink YOU are not into and one he is trying to force on you.

Neither situation is ok.

Point his ass in the direction of FetLife. I am sure some one will straighten him the fuck out."
"Yep. That is really freaky. A sorry guy doesn't stop you from leaving, that is always your own choice over which he has no control if he has healthy boundaries.

His hit was clearly a punishment (for trying to leave) and then he chose to hold her hostage. Those are not the actions of a sorry person, that is doubling down. All the tears he has now, saying he's sorry- those are crocodile tears. He believes he should be in control of OP, and he will enforce it with any means he has, including physical. She needs to leave. This will happen again. 

Heck, even if he was that dang angry- that is the perfect time to elect to be alone (or allow the people you care about to leave). I expect adults to be able to control themselves- and if they cannot, then place themselves in adult time out until they can be civil.  Deciding that someone else is to be the punching bag of your anger and cannot leave...unacceptable. 

"
lmao I'm so sorry I meant older
"They're recent pictures, we've been dating for three years and they've been broken up for about 5 or 6. They dated for 6 months and she broke up with him."
"Exactly. Self loathing is extremely common in the LGBT community, unfortunately. A lifetime of repression and being told by your peers, your family, your school, your community, your religious leaders, and conservative politicians that you are a blight on society and that you are going to hell tends to lead you to having some issues.

I know many of my fellow gay men who might be out to everyone in their lives, have had several serious boyfriends, who still get hung up on issues of masculinity and feminity and do their share of gatekeeping in terms of what they think of what they think is an acceptable way of being gay.

Sometimes you can get through these people, sometimes you can't."

"I've never met a woman who doesn't wear her engagement ring daily, though I have known some who specifically remove them in a situation where they're worried it might get damaged (many of my coworkers don't wear it to work, my mom takes hers off at work, ect).

"No. Dump her. If she was all in on you, she wouldn't have spent the night in a hotel room with another guy and she wouldn't have kept it from you. 

Forget about her. Plenty of other women. "
"Yes, I see now that my reason for keeping it open was pretty bizarre and likely to cause questions.

That makes sense. My gf has mentioned her boss is single. She could easily be projecting her feelings towards men in general onto me."

"Your other post is locked and this one's unlocked, so just carrying on from our conversation on the other post:

I'm not in the US, so I don't know the terms, but I meant more someone who is a liaison who can help advise you if it turns out you are having to deal with formal processes around academic bullying (which is what this is)."
"You should go to couples counseling, but the reality is that she might just not be very sexual. It’s one of the reasons waiting for marriage can be problematic. You don’t really know what you’re buying. You need to ask yourself if this is something you can be okay with for the rest of your life. If the answer is no, you may have to have some really tough talks soon. Good luck. "
"THIS. Take a step back and see that she might be overreacting a bit by giving you an ultimatum, and also is not taking your side into consideration. It's not her way or the highway - relationships are about compromise, and putting that strain on yourself at such a young age will only make you angry and bitter, especially toward her.

Edit: grammar fix 
"
I suppose... But it didn't feel right leading her on when I didn't feel the same way to begin with. I should have let her down gently rather than letting things get to that stage.
"She's going to drag her feel and try to ignore the fact that you've asked her to leave for as long as you let her. She was like this before she lost her father and she has shown you multiple times that she will take advantage of you and when you give an inch she takes a mile therefore you should just come out and say it straight. When you remind her she needs to move out don't follow that sentence up with 8 million qualifiers such as ""we'll help you move"" ""take your time"" ""no rush"" and all that. Just lay it out clearly ""you have x weeks and you need to be moved out by x date"" that is a perfectly normal thing to say and it's not rude at all. Shes the kind of person that needs to feel a fire lit under her ass and all of the nice things you offer to do for her make her feel like you are a pushover and therefore she can extend the timeline again and again. Normally all of the help you've been offering (like help moving) would be super amazing and incredibly appreciated (I would love a roomate like you!) but with her it makes her see you as soft and easy to manipulate. Good luck man, don't feel too bad you've been extremely kind and way more understanding then most people."
"Can I ask you something honestly. Is there data that supports this idea, that women routinely seek to accuse the people they're actually sexually harassing of sexual harassment if they get turned down for a date or whatever?"
"Why do you want to build intimacy with someone who doesn't care if you're around? Someone who you think thinks you're annoying? 

Your text (your short essay) is... Honestly it's really too much. Like another commenter said, you sound terrified. You also come across as incredibly insecure. I used to have a friend who would text like this. Used to being an operative phrase. Stop apologizing for existing. ""Hey, heads up I'm going to the movies with Jack tomorrow"" would have sufficed. And if he's not into it... Well... I'm sorry but it doesn't really sound like he's that into you.

Go hang with your friends. Join some clubs and organizations and meet new people. You're a freshmen in college and you're surrounded by opportunities to socialize and meet new people who actually want to hang out with you."

"&gt; I've never wanted to live on my own because I hate being alone. My mom has always been a wonderful and accommodating parent.

I'm not saying this is horrible, but I also don't think that's too healthy.

&gt; I don't go out, I can't get a job

You need to get out of that house. Sitting in a Starbucks sipping hot water is probably better for your health that staying in that house.

&gt; I worked from home as a nanny

Look for a nanny job where you can work and live at *their* house. I've got dustmite and pet dander allergies and very rarely some mild asthma, and every room in my house has a hepa filter, and my wife and I have two small kids. I'm not saying it will be easy to find, but allergies are pretty common and there likely are people who have homes that would accommodate your health requirements who would love a live in nanny who doesn't have pets of her own."
"&gt; wants a co-parent to take care of the kids so she can work

So what?  OP's BF gets to spend a bunch of time with his kids and visit a place he has always wanted to go to on with someone else subsidizing the cost.   It's perfect and OP should absolutely give her blessing on this.   "
"This is one of those things in relationships that truly can't be compromised on, which you probably know. My instinct is that if he's still flip-flopping on whether he wants children, he hasn't really been thinking of the reality of what family life would be like.

Because of your work you clearly have a very good sense of the realities of having a child, whereas it sounds like his reasoning is more along the lines of ""societal duty"" than any deep desire to be a parent. What would his roles be in the childcare duties? Does he have experience with kids?

I think you need to sit down with him and have a series of in-depth, realistic conversations with him. You need a much clearer picture of the nitty-gritty reason of why he's deciding he wants a child, and you need to assess what sort of parent he would be. This doesn't have to be hashed out in one evening, it should be an ongoing talk. But now that he's brought up this potential incompatibility the two of you need to become crystal clear on what it means for you as a couple."
LMAO... Texting your partner of 1+ years once a day is high maintenance and needy? Are you high? 
"I met my exhusband at 19 and I started falling out of love with him at 27, for similar reasons to what you are going through. However, it took me till I was 35 to leave, mostly due to guilt. I did try talking to him about my issues in the marriage. I tried marriage counseling, I tried individual counseling. 

In the end I wish I had ended it at least 5 years sooner than I had and saved us both a lot of time and emotional agony. It’s been 3 years and I have never once doubted it was the right decision. 

If you are done, you are done. It’s going to suck for awhile for your wife, but don’t live your life based on what’s best for someone else if you know what’s best for you is something else. "
"No, OP told him she'd stay out of his hair and he reassured her that they would text and he'd send her pictures. "
"Did I say he had to stay with her? No I didnt. But Im letting him know a lot of the problems are on him because he was pushing her to be something she didnt want to be. 

Frankly this is because OP got hooked up so young. Young marriage is terriable because neither party is grown yet, they dont even know who they are, let alone how to be with someone else.

Should he go to therapy? Probably at least once, that way they can have a honest convo with a 3rd party and his now wife can understand that shes not at fault, but its time to move on.

Do I think the OP needs to understand he cant shape people, or he cant force people to become what *he* wants? Yes I really do, that way he wont make the same mistake again next time."
"Yeah I was going to say, having threesomes or friends with benefits, doing kinky stuff etc doesn’t mean OP didn’t “love and cherish her body....” that’s just a weird statement to me. Being truly comfortable with your body and sexuality means just doing FWB for some people! It sounds like OP has a lot of weird sex shame that requires therapy."
"This is what I thought. He's so insecure and he went from taking it out on her in one emotionally abusive way, to another equally emotionally abusive way. 

OP, I think the only way you should stay in this relationship is if he gets individual therapy and you start seeing drastic improvements within 3 months and no backsliding after that. 

However, I personally would dump, and find someone healthier and more secure. What a turn off!"
"Yup. OP's husband is openly contemptuous of her.  I wouldn't put up with that in any relationship, spouse, family or friend. "
"There is a big difference between ""conventionally attractive"" and ""I am incredibly attracted to someone.


My husband went bald at 18 and all the hair migrated down. He's hairy and overweight. And I love him more than I could ever imagine. Shared experiences, respect, passion, support, etc. I wouldn't want anyone else. I am incredibly attracted to him.


But, right now, I am sitting on my couch watching Terry Crews' pecs on Lip Sync Battles. There is no way my husband would believe me if I told him that he looks better topless than Terry Crews. But he absolutely believes that there is no one I would rather be with than him...romantically, sexually, emotionally..."
"Agreed. Friends aren't to blame here unless they start getting upset if OP stops footing the bill.

I don't blame your GF for bringing this up, OP. Your heart is in the right place but this is a bad financial lifestyle."
If you don’t want kids then having one child isn’t going to be a compromise. Please don’t have a child with this man if that isn’t what you want. 
"&gt; I respect her immensely

Don't. She sure as hell doesn't respect you.

Of course you didn't overreact. You weren't nearly reactionary enough! She cheated on you! Not kissing anyone other than your partner is not an unreasonable expectation. That is not something that needed to be explicitly established beforehand. She knew it would hurt you, but she didn't care, so she did it anyway.

She is toxic and not mature enough for a romantic relationship with anyone. 

Who the hell cares what she feels now? She in not the victim; you are! You should not engage with this person in any capacity going forward. "
And women often prefer men who feel secure in their relationships. Guess you're out of luck.

"If it ever comes out I’d be like “fuck her we don’t talk and I don’t claim her as family.”

It's good that you think this way - it's better to be too cautious when it comes to boundaries. Just ask if there's any line you shouldn't cross and otherwise have fun with it (if it's something you want to try)
"I didn't even know athletic socks couldn't go in the dryer, I've washed mine several times"
"I'd even go so far as to say she knew what path she was headed down as soon as she brought up the depression and not being sure she was still in love with OP before the visit. She was feeling confused because of this guy and wanted to be with him but also wanted to stay with OP. She knew she couldn't have both, that she had to hurt one of them, so that made her feel bad.

So if I'm right, she essentially blamed cheating on wanting to cheat, only adding an extra step of depression in the middle, likely because she knows that OP supports her when she's depressed.

The saddest part is, if you choose to believe her, that she didn't have control, then that's even more reason to not trust her. If she didn't know what she was doing and ended up with another guy inside her, how would she ever prevent it from happening again? If she is so weak that she goes along with whatever the guy she's currently in a room with wants, how could you ever expect her to not do this again?

At least someone who chooses to cheat and owns up to it has control over themselves."
"It is not wrong, you are basically his taxi!"
"Yeah, if she really knew what she was doing, she'd say something like ""Oh, cool! Say hi to Dr. Bob for me!"" Instead she fed him some BS about him also being in Jamaica at the same time as her, staying ""across"" from her, because *of course he is, it makes perfect sense*. "
"Well, the relationship has ended so you're both away from each other for the better.

Either there's a LOT that you're not telling us, or she's easily influenced. Whichever, this break up is for the best."
"This arrangement needs to end immediately. Go to a lawyer and see what the fastest, legal path is to living separately from her. In the meantime *stop talking to her about all personal issues.* "
"&gt; Divorce is not an option. 

It’s honestly your only option. Your husband is a creep."
"What? If you don't mind living with roommates, then sharing an apartment is a frugal decision regardless of your financial decision. Not having your own place doesn't mean you're poor. "
"I would let your husband take point on this since it's his sister, but ultimately her hissy fit over this is hers to have and she's just making herself look immature. I would choose a canned line to pull out anytime she or anyone else asks you about this (because I get the sense that she's the type who would try to sic other family members on you with a twisted tale of how you've deeply wronged her because that's how melodramatic drama llamas act). Something along the lines of ""we have chosen [best friend and husband] to be our kids' guardians because that is the best choice for our family."" And then change the damn subject, what would happen to your children if you were to hypothetically die is literally nobody's business except you, your husband, and the potential guardians. 

And then just ignore your SIL. She's behaving like an ass and it's on her to mend the fence, not you. Like any child, she'll wear herself out with her tantrum. You've already got two babies to deal with, you don't need another one. "
" Yes, if someone doesn't appreciate something you are doing for them,  stop doing it."
"Not sure if this helps at all, but in my (F) 20's I was a major snooper.  It didn't have anything to do with looking for something.  It was just my weird way of getting insight into people.
I used to be a bad communicator and I guess it seemed easier to look around then to ask questions.

Over time, the urge to look at people's stuff faded away.  Now that I'm older, I feel like I can just get to know people and ask them stuff.   Also, as a teen, I was seriously screwed over by a boyfriend who lied to me.  I think I wanted the ""power"" of knowledge as a hedge.   Or maybe I was just nosy. :)

I guess my point is that it may not mean she doesn't trust you or anything.  If you're really private she may feel like it's an easy way to learn about you.

Or maybe she's creepy.  I don't know - just putting another POV out there.

"I really can't get over the second point. So he claims that she walks away, clearly upset and he doesn't know what upset her. So he thinks ""oh well""? He doesn't consider what might upset her? Like she's feeling sick or she's had a fight with a friend or some drunk guy was intimidating her and she wanted to get away. Then he decides not to go and check on her, even via text, he just goes ""*naaa* I'll carry on hanging out with her friends and won't go back with her, oh, you need to go back and get something? I suppose I'll go too.""

Drunk or not it seems such a strange dynamic to me and I'm not surprised she feels insecure. (Either that or he's lying and knows she was mad at him for flirting)."
"You should definitely remove yourself from the situation as much as you can.  Call a lawyer first thing tomorrow morning and ask if there could be any complications if you leave the house in the immediate. If the lawyer says it's okay, go stay with family or friends or in a cheap hotel.

If I were you I'd go sit in a park or something to get out of the house just to get away from his weird manipulation. Don't worry about whether he's accepting it. He'll figure it out soon enough."

He is disrespecting you imho.  Maybe find someone else mature.  
"For a normal relationship, sure...but when his red flag behaviors are passive-aggressiveness, clinginess, and over-reactions like almost calling all her friends and family because she didn't respond for a few hours...I think it's appropriate."
"You seem to just be validating what a commenter replied to your previous post:

&gt; **Flowers are great but her reaction will just give you more to read into**. I recommend you ask her if she'd want to go on a date sometime, and if she isn't an enthusiastic yes, that you smile and tell her ""no problem"" and give a bit of space so you can recalibrate your feelings.

Emphasis mine. Body language is great, but you know this thing our species invented that's basically its defining characteristic, and likely a big reason for its evolutionary success, this thing that is a lot more efficient at conveying complex information efficiently and reliably? I'm talking about language. Use your words. Ask her out. Maybe she's not interested because it hasn't occurred to her to think of you that way, and unless she knows you're interested it never will. Maybe she's not interested in you enough to try to flirt or get close to you, but she's also not so uninterested that she wouldn't be willing to give it a shot and get to know you better.


Of course if you're happy not going out with her based on this interaction that's fine too, you're not obligated to move heaven and earth to go out with someone just because you have a crush on them. ""You are invisible to them"" seems a bit self-pitying for someone who's happy with the situation though."
"Mine says I'm single and I'm married now.

"This is what I came to suggest. You can specifically set relationship status visible to ""Only Me"" or even custom. With the latter he could change his profile to in a relationship and have it only visible to the 2 of them.

She claims she's had it her whole life. She says one of her alters is a dog and she used to bark at her moms boyfriend. But honestly I don't think it adds up either.

"Speaking as someone with a Crohn's and who was in a same situation - you will eventually break up. You are emotionally broken and you can't get tougher. He wants you to be as ""normal"" as possible. And because of that he feels guilty.
What you need is some personal space, time to get over this by yourself and let this experience be a teacher for future relationships. Ones in which you will, hopefully, find a person who understands and is more mature. I also got shitted on by this disease but I kept on pushing. You are feeling sorry for yourself, blaming it all on the disease and that is a relationship breaker. Believe me, I've been through hell and back (6 surgeries, 3 years in a hospital, gruesome procedures done on me, etc) and I was feeling sorry for myself. That only annoyed my then partner and eventually we broke up. And we were 27 when we got out of our 9 year realtionship. You two are only kids.

"Hmmmm. I think I would try to focus on how her improvement in these areas would make her a better manager, i.e. how she can improve her own professional development. Maybe something like:

""Maryann has a tendency to take over significant aspects of the projects that have been assigned to her staff, which limits the staff's opportunities to develop new skills and grow professionally. It would likely help her team's productivity if she allowed them more autonomy and maintained more of a ""big picture"" perspective on their work; she can get caught up in scrutinizing small details, which leaves her with less time to dedicate to the more essential tasks where her input will have more of an impact."""

Cats make me Ill, cat hair, cat sweat, oil from their skin, anything a cat touches makes me f**king ill. What about this do you not understand? Your cat is a walking virus to me. If you were in a situation where you could physically see herpes in a human form; would you go give it a kiss or rub your genitalia against It? 

If she carries on being childishly ignorant of your health, showing a complete lack of consideration, you need to get rid man. What happens if you break a leg?

Instead of working to communicate effectively, you let your emotions get the better of you over insignificant nonsense, and started verbally and personally attacking him, making sure you were cutting as deep as you could. I almost reconsidered giving my thoughts here, because you frankly deserve learning and experiencing your consequences the hard way.

To everyone else reading this, I implore you to upvote this post, rather than downvote it, so we can get some visibility on this post. Clinically, this is an interesting insight as to how an abuser will make excuses for their horrible behavior. "
"I am a stay at home mom but still make a little money online. He's the main provider however. He's a good dad to our son and does a lot for him when he's not working, but he also spends a lot of time at work.

"To your second edit: yes, that is kind of how it should work. The SAH partner is foregoing building their resume and gaining experience to keep house and raise children. They should be able to keep the money they make on etsy or whatever so they can at least have a little savings in the case of a divorice."
"I agree. 5AM is way late, and there's so much time in between when bars closed until she gets home. Then, she won't tell you who she's out with. It seems like she's living a double life. That being said, you know her better than we do obviously. I'd demand the truth. It's amazing how much pours out when you demand or apply a little pressure to the situation. Also, you need to read her texts, look at her call log, Facebook messages, pictures. Everything. If you really want to make this work, she needs to be as transparent as possible so that some trust can be reestablished. Good luck, OP. I'm sorry this happened to you. "
if I could give you the opposite of gold I would. Med school and residency are absolutely ridiculous
She's having Baby #2 now. I'd definitely reconsider marrying this person. 
"Well, since the house is paid off, she doesn't have a mortgage payment, so she definitely benefits from OPs family too. . And the range rover isn't a past mistake, it's one that she repeats every month to the tune of a $900 payment. He says he'd be willing to cover the bills if she sold the car so that her only payment is her student loan. That's pretty reasonable.

What's not reasonable is going 50k in debt to buy a car when you work at Walmart. "

"I think using a phone in a movie theater is incredibly rude to other patrons because of the light of the phone distracting from the movie.  However at home, it is not your business.  Stop worrying about other people and how other people watch movies.  I’m similar to your gf.  I never watch movies or TV without something else in my hands like my phone or knitting or craft, etc.  You do not know how she processes information differently from you.  Some people are actually capable of multitasking and it’s highly annoying to have one’s SO attempt to dictate how you can or can not watch a movie.  Worry about yourself not other people."
"Her parents *chose* to have her, knowing they would have to provide a roof over her head. She didn't ask to be born. Don't act like them providing a roof over her head whilst she was a CHILD is some kind of amazing act.

Also, it's clear in the post that the mother of the OP was addicted to drugs whilst pregnant with the sister. I don't think that's a projected issue of her being a shitty mother. Also, look up the cost of full time childcare and compare that to the 200 dollars a month she's being paid. "
"I don't doubt that she has some issues she's dealing with, some even directly related to sex. But, none of those things can unconsciously make you go seek out someone else to fuck. And, honestly, it's insulting to other people who struggle with similar conditions that she's using that as an excuse to cheat. And, if she knew that she couldn't keep herself from fucking someone else, what in the ever loving hell was she doing in a relationship with you while not getting treatment? Why is she only considering seeking help now, after she's hopped on someone else's dick, and not before when she simply had the urge? She's convinced you, utilizing your empathy, that she holds no responsibility for what she did. That's very emotionally manipulative."

"Holy crap. I live within ten minutes of my mother and stepfather, and I love them both dearly, but I would lose my ever-loving mind if I had to spend that much time around anyone but my spouse and child! Your SO needs to get a grip. It is not reasonable for her to expect you to spend three days a week minimum with her family. She sounds painfully enmeshed with them. "

"Eh, that advice is actually starting to be given to both men and women who post about their partner being upset about their weight gain. It's really bad advice because attraction is incredibly important and weight loss is hard but simple. But given that 70% of Americans are overweight or obese, a lot of the advice in those threads is going to be from overweight/obese people who don't want to believe gaining weight is bad and it's normal to lose attraction to a partner who gets fat."

"wait, I'm confused. if you say you believe your wife and that nothing happened, what did you want your friends to do? (and why, if nothing was happening, did you want them to do it?) maybe they didn't think anything was happening either, so they didn't think they needed to tell you?"

Honestly, I disagree with a lot of commentors on this thread.  You shouldn't have to be constantly fighting back to get your partner to give a crap about your desires on basic stuff like going out for a meal.  The fact that they don't seem to ever take your opinions into consideration is definitely 100% a problem, you deserve to be considered more and respected, which is not happening right now.

  The sad and harsh truth is that if they don't think about your feelings at the beginning of a relationship, it will be near impossible to change their attitude in the future.  Personality is not something that changes much even in a few years.

It's a personality issue, which means making peace is NOT going to help, though your heart is in the right place.  When you see these red flags, stop trying to work on them.  Get out.

Unfortunately dating is a lot of trial and error: you're gonna meet a lot of people who don't gel with you or have personality issues like this.  The faster you weed out these kind of people, the faster you'll be in a relationship with someone who actually *deserves* your time."
"Everyone has their limits and what the deem as acceptable behavior. Just because yours is different from OP's doesn't make yours more correct.

Example. My girlfriend said she would dump me if I ever took up smoking. Tons of women have partners that smoke, its just something my GF is not interested in.

If OP doesnt want piss bottles, she shouldnt have to deal with it

"Indeed, this guy fails hard at adulting 101. This attitude might be tolerable at 16 years old but at 28, he's way too old to be acting this childishilly. I'm a dude and I'm disgusted by this guy behaviour and attitude. "
"I see my husband’s family six times a year. I get so bored in the boonies, and I do get on my phone during that time. They’re nice people, but I get bored af. 3 times a week is a ridiculous amount. Cut that down. Once a month sounds healthier. 

She told you that if y’all werent married she would have left you? Plus all that other crap... my advice is to go see a marriage counselor together. I don’t know how long you’ve been married, but this is NOT how mature people think/act in a committed for life marriage. She needs to grow up. I am also 24 and my husband is 28. We’ve been married for about  6 months now, and I can’t imagine telling him I would leave him over something that petty. I can’t imagine telling him that unless cheating/abuse was involved. She should feel ashamed, and if she doesn’t, then you need to go to a marriage counselor ASAP. Make an appointment and go together. Issues like these aren’t going to be resolved unless she gets some sense in her by herself or by a counselor."

"Yeah like everyone else is saying, schizophrenia has a significant genetic component. I get that these responses are freaking you out, and you probably haven't had to think much about mental illness before. That's okay. But consider that schizophrenia and other significant mental illness are *way more treatable* today than they were for your grandmother. If you are developing it, and you ignore this, it will only get worse. Schizophrenia is a serious, scary disease -- but lots of people who have it manage to lead normal, happy lives. They can have careers and family. *If they get treatment*. 

Please take a breath, and then talk to someone about this. Your college almost certainly has affordable (probably free) mental health services for students. If it turns out that you have no mental illness and this chick is your dad in drag (???) then hey, no harm done. Plus, in that case you might find it helpful to have a therapist you can talk to about your *very weird father*. Good luck. Please take care of yourself and don't avoid this just because it feels frightening."
"Reversed, but similar here.  My fiance is an early riser, so he gets in bed pretty early.  Sometimes this can be disappointing if it's a Saturday night and we're in bed by 10 pm, but we've developed a compromise over the years.  I don't stay up as late as I would before I lived with him (I would stay up until 4 or 5 am) and he stays up later than he would before we lived together too (bedtime on the weekend is more like midnight instead of 930.)  Sometimes we'll go to bed and I'll get back up after half an hour or so, but I think our compromising has worked best.  OP's wife is right that it's unhealthy to stay up all night.  I feel better if I don't sleep my weekend away and I don't screw up my sleep pattern as much by Monday.  And on the flip side, my fiance doesn't get made fun of by our friends as much for going to bed at 930!"
"Because when you're in a relationship, you say things nicely so that conflicts can get resolved. You don't use the fact that you're right as an excuse to fuck someone up. Have you ever been in a healthy relationship before?"
"This, exactly. 

From what I'm reading, OP probably thinks that his yt girlfriend is above him too, deep down. Like, seeing him talk about going from Harlem to a wealthy neighborhood indicates that he took the attitude that somehow, his coming of age problems stemmed from things that he couldn't control, and so he will do the thing that he can control, which is associate with people not from that life and therefore 'higher'. Gratitude or escape?

The worst part of this is, his gf has a point. At no time in the story above did he demonstrate that he was loved well or loved right. Even with the auntie hitting upside the head shows a sad fact : Black culture  largely advocates for corporal punishment as a means of preparing them for the harshness of the real world. 

So if OP cares to answer: how would you describe the way your birth family treated you? Did they care about actions more, or feelings? Do you keep in regular contact with them, and if so, how do they react to your life right now?
"
Fight doesn’t have to be literally throwing punches. She confronted. He ran. 
"Yes, I feel like clearly you’ve never been through a traumatic event if you don’t understand that the people to take the first brunt of angry feelings are secondary folks to the situation because your brain is trying to figure out how to process the whole thing, and it’s easier to be angry with your roommate than with two men you don’t know in the initial aftermath. 

"
"I don't, when the context is someone making a joke about their own experience. I know plenty of victims of sexual abuse who make jokes about it. They're not joking about ""Hardy har, isn't it funny when people get raped."" They're using black humor as a coping mechanism to talk about their own experiences. For what reason would OP's girlfriend's discomfort over similar jokes take precedence over OP's right to talk about his own experiences? Unless she thinks he's going to treat his own future children similarly, she should just accept that black humor is a thing. If she doesn't want to hear the jokes, she could have a discussion with him about it. But this ""How could anyone joke about such a thing????"" schtick is, frankly, bullshit."
"Sounds like there are three choices:

  1) Your relationship is 50/50, but your activities and expenses are based on what you can afford. So no trips, no fancy dinners, nothing that you can't afford to chip in on

  2) He pays more, because he wants to do more and 50/50 wouldn't be fair. I.e. He wants to take a trip that you can't afford? Well if he wants your company, then he pays for that trip. The same for any other dates or excursions that you wouldn't normally do because they're not reasonable expenses for you

  3) You only chip in on things you agree are reasonable (like going out for coffee) and he can go off and do things by himself that you can't afford (like trips)

Honestly, it sounds like he has no concept of money and that he's incredibly cheap. You may want to try an exercise to get him in touch with reality, like get him to live off of your budget for a month.

Under no circumstances charge anything to your credit cards - that way lies madness. "
"Chiming in with everyone else. Nobody in your family contacted her for at least a month and that was obviously normal. He was giving her a place to live, seeing her daily, obviously cared far more about her than the rest of you did. You have no right to complain 1. That she trusted him to follow her wishes 2. That she didn't want family who showed very little affection around in her dying days 3. That he was respectful to her and did as she asked."
"I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who's been on Reddit maybe too long. It's bizarre though, unless OP is seriously lying to us, I can't imagine why a family member close enough for multiple phone calls a week would just up and cut someone out. Incestuous attraction is admittedly unlikely, as is someone else's idea of her joining a cult, but honestly what else is there? I'm drawing a blank tbh. 

However, the running theory of her coming back *now* because she's wanting money now he's an executive makes perfect sense to me. I've personally witnessed someone nuke close and long standing relationships over (not even that much) money, hitting up what is now a near stranger for ""help"" is very plausible. "
It seems pretty clear that OP’s brother and SIL are on the same page here and were sharing a private joke that OP overheard. 
"&gt; It does show disrespect. 

I get where you're coming from, but a ring is just a piece of metal.  I'm not sure how disrespectful it can really be considered to be before someone is just overreacting.  "
"I think their point is that we all think negative things about other people. You do, I do. Honestly, my cat even doesn't like my kisses. :(

At times, we share those thoughts with our closest confidant, which is  not the same as gossip, imo. I tend to view a relationship as a, ""what happens in vegas stays in vegas"" sort of thing, and to me that's what it seemed like was going on here.

I think it's a problem that this was happening when other family members were around, though. That seemed pretty thoughtless."
Not much of an option if he’s going to be vilified for not giving the answer his sister wanted 
"That should have been your warning sign.  HE, as an adult, could have decided ""nah, this is embarrassing that mommy treats me like a 2 year old"", but instead, he liked it and decided to move in with you, so you could keep babying him.

You're already ""quietly resentful"".  It will only get worse.  Far, far, worse.

And on top of it all, the boy sees marriage as a business proposition (hence waiting until certain things are true with money, etc).
Fuck that.  Marriage isn't a business.
In fact, marriage is not ANYTHING that makes sense.  It's a completely irrational commitment, whose entire reason for existence is that it's NOT rational.
His dourly faux-""rational"" approach to marriage will kill whatever little joy is left in it for you at this point -- until you finally start to agree with him that marriage is a business.  At which point yr best business maneuver will be to take him to the cleaners without an ounce of remorse.

Ugh.

Hard reset.

"""Spending time together"" while you're both asleep is a lame excuse. It's more likely that she doesn't approve of your hobby.

"You are on a sinking ship and everyone aboard is a terrible swimmer. There is only one question you should be asking yourself:  Do I want to stay here with the other drowning people or should I try to save myself? 

Your mother is not ""great"". She is a grown adult who has let her need for companionship and gullibility for leeches endanger her children for decades. She has put the needs of these users and abusers before the own safety and well-being of her own children and her own mother over and over and over again. She makes horrendous financial decisions. From the sounds of it, this cycle has been going on for generations.

You need to get off this ship and swim to shore and let all the other adults sink or swim, or you are going to drown along with them. Move out. See to your own needs. Don't give your family any money no matter how much they beg. Don't allow your family to guilt you into feeling bad or wavering on your decision to help yourself. They are adults. They need to take responsibility for their own needs and their own absolutely terrible life choices. If your mother or sister or grandmother try to pull you back in with their drama, limit your time with them. I get that you love them and want to care for them, but you need to love yourself and take care of you first. You know that saying about making sure your own life jacket is secured before helping anyone else with theirs? This is where you're at now. Put on your life jacket. Secure it. Swim to shore. Save yourself."
"It's breathtakingly contemptuous, honestly. Like holy shit. Does she even like him???"
"She told you that you could keep going if you wanted to, you didn't want to. That's not a complex situation. Sure what she accepts as possibly OK is not precisely what you do, but she gave you the option to choose so she hasn't imposed anything on you. I think you need to consider carefully how many FWB you are likely to be able to get in life if your requirement of them is ""same sexual standards as  me"" not ""is OK with me not being involved in stuff that offends my standards""

Also the fact she answered the call at all isn't an issue is it? I mean you're not feeling slighted over it? You're just FWB and you probably have no idea of the details of why you each set your priorities of answering calls from family members. She could have ill elderly relatives, she could have family members who are very emotionally needy.

You're FWB, you don't need to give detailed reasons for splitting up. ""just not working"" or ""moving on"" work OK.

"Honestly it sounds like he’s fetishized you completely in a weird way. I dated a woman who was 38 for about a year when I was 24 and that behavior is all around baffling and kinda gross, I don’t really know what would explain it unless it’s an odd obsessive fetish thing. Sounds like sex is 99% of his interest and not much else genuinely. "

"Why do *you* have to do anything? Seems like your SO doesn't need a supervisor to stay with some cats. You could stay home and relax in a bubblebath. 

If she's so worried about it, she can say to them ""I don't think I need to stay over so I'll just hop on by a couple times a day to check on them."" He could also tell them that this is a one time favor and it can't happen frequently.

Just let her define and set her own boundaries with this one."
What’s the problem? She’s having fun learning about part of her identity.

"&gt;He's also had schizophrenia when he was a kid, Miraculously fought it and he doesn't have it anymore, but has been told back that some cells of his brain might be damaged a bit, and he suspects it caused him to have trouble understanding some human emotions.

Nobody could possibly be gullible enough to believe this, could they??"
It sounds like something I’d do to make my gf break up with me when I have no balls to do it myself 
What she said about beating you up is really messed up. No fight is an excuse for physical violence. 
"Ok first of all, that was not flirty. You were talking to a fellow employee and you were being polite. If you had the same conversation with a woman I am positive you wouldn't see it as flirtatious. Being polite != Flirting. 

Second of all, that was not just a bit abusive. He **pushed you off the bed and dragged you to the stairs and caused bodily harm**. This is a HUGE red flag and should not be ignored. He needs serious help and counselling. You should NEVER be afraid to have simple conversations with your fellow employees, no matter the gender. 

I also work in a mostly male environment (in the field of mechatronics engineering) and my boyfriend never has a problem with me speaking to other men because he respects and trusts me, and understands that we work together and it's customary to have conversations. 

You need to take a hard look at the way he treats you because this is only the beginning and that is no way to live. "
"I agree with this and u/ladypuffsalot, however I particularly wanted to highlight:

&gt; ""you're going to have to pay attention next time they're around, and try to pick up on it before it becomes a problem for her.""

If they behave similarly again, it may be worth it to point it out as it's happening (as long as your girlfriend is comfortable having that discussion). Say ""remember when I asked you to apologize before? This is why. These specific comments, [direct quote], really offend my girlfriend and I, because [reason]"". 

There's not the same room for miscommunication as a phone call, and it puts your parents on the spot to analyze their actions, as well as giving your girlfriend an appropriate floor to voice her feelings with you there to support her."
"I agree. I was so young at the time and such an idiot, I could kick myself. Since then, he's actually turned into a very considerate partner and we had what I thought was a loving relationship-- except when it comes to anything Cat-related.

All smoke and mirrors. I'm definitely leaving, but I hate myself and I hate ""young"" me's decisions."

"The way you're acting like a victim is making me sick. Accept the responsibility of the choices YOU made, and quit being a terrible person. It's as simple as that. You had no ""friendship"" with this due, just an inappropriate relationship with someone, because you didn't give a shit about your boyfriend's feelings over your own. 

You did forever ruin your relationship, and you're going to have to face those consequences sooner or later. "
"How are these issues outside of his control? From what I read he could change them all. You are in no way an asshole, I think he just needs to take control of his life and stop letting others baby him or push him around."
"Thanks :) not a parent, just your run of the mill human trying to make sense of our very strange world."
"&gt; And in the end I’m afraid that I’m in love with him and he’s just having a fun experiment until the right guy comes along

That's the first thought that came to my mind when reading your post. Not that he's having ""fun"" in a purposeful and malicious way, but that he's holding on tight to you while he figures his shit out. And I agree with him that he can be gay and in love with a woman, but that's not really fair to you, is it? That effectively means you're wasting your time in a relationship that will never get to the level you deserve.

On top of that, I'm reading your comments about him being your manager and how co-dependent you two are, and I agree with the commenter that said it's unhealthy and it would do you well to create some emotional distance"
"I'm a foster parent and I've had the boob brigade tell me I'm being selfish by fostering a child that could go to a home where there was a breastfeeding mother.

I nearly fell off my chair at the stupidity. How many breastfeeding mums want to foster? Not as many as there are foster kids. "
"He sounds manipulative. Which means not good friend material. It never ends well friending someone out of pity, it will always be a lopsided friendship. He's going to demand more from her than he can offer and the friendship will end when he oversteps boundaries again. But not before he drives her nuts demanding the emotional support of her friendship. She should avoid him. Let him learn from his mistakes and make healthy friendships with other people. Neither of you need him in your life. You can be friendly with him without having to be a friend."
This stood out to me in the original post. OP's parents do not trust him to manage his own dietary needs. They weren't just undermining and talking down to the girlfriend. They were completely disrespecting OP.
When you finally leave you could always leave a note or text him that you know about everything then block his number
"Sweet baby angel you’re only 22, you’re so young! I know you said you’re not the kind to throw away a relationship, but listen, you weren’t the one who threw it out, it was him! And if you chose to leave you’ll find someone a million times better (that doesn’t have paranoia episodes projecting his infidelity onto you) that you actually want to shower with affection because you truly love them. 
If you do chose to stay, make sure you both get tested for STDs because you don’t know what kind of girl he cheated on you with. "
3 words: Sunk Cost Fallacy
"I think you are spot on but missed one additional point. After Mark brought forward his feelings about TJ, OP went to TJ and checked with him then defended TJ over her partners feelings. I mean she is directly choosing her relationship, although not romantic, with TJ over her partner."
"Plenty of cheaters only cheat once and never again, or even cheat many times but at some point stop. But it's important to think of it like any other immoral act someone takes. If the reasons and mindset behind the action haven't changed, then that person is likely to repeat the action.

Someone who cheats obviously doesn't care very much about not hurting their partner. Their partner's emotions and safety are worth less to the cheater than their own interests. That doesn't magically change once the cheated partner gets hurt. The cheater is still likely to value their own wants over the other person's physical and emotional health. (And often, the cheater is placing more value on their own wants than on the emotional/physical health of not just their monogamous partner, but also the ""other person"" in the equation who doesn't know about the main relationship. The cheater is fucking over *two* people for their own selfish gratification.)

You'd be pretty skeptical about hiring a lawn service guy who scammed even one former client, right? You probably wouldn't allow a ""former"" burglar to house-sit while you went on vacation. If you found out a coworker was a regular shoplifter you'd probably think differently of them, you know?

It's not that any of those people couldn't possibly have turned over a new leaf. But generally when someone is a bad person, they don't just stop and become good. Particularly when we're talking about grown-ass adults who know better. "
"Don't do that!  Don't think that has anything to do with letting his family disrupt yours.

Your husband should probably be in counseling, working on buffering his spine."
"If you want to see how a story like this could end, go look up the stories about a woman named Competitive Little Chaos over in r/JustNoFamily. Spoiler: It didn't end well, for the parents or for the woman who had been indulged her entire life, or for the son who finally stood up to his parents (and his wife was along for the ride).

Your SIL needs mental help. You are expected to expose your children to someone who is unstable, violent, screams, and throws fits. Why on earth are you considering doing that? Do you not realize how fragile babies are? The first time she throws something at your baby you're going to be willing to go to prison if that's what it takes to stop her. So preempt that and stand firm now. 

Her parents ""forcing"" an apology will do no good at all - if she doesn't sincerely apology and change her behavior, then there will just be another incident and you all will have to go NC again. Why wait? You're pregnant and stress is bad for your health and bad for your baby. His parents' feelings have no place in this discussion at all."
"Honestly dude, it's been three weeks. It sounds like she's away from her support system, doesn't know anyone, and isn't taking her medication. Of course she's depressed. Does she access to her doctor to get a new prescription? Do your friends have girlfriends that you could maybe do some double dates with to introduce them?

You may not be compatible, that happens alot when people move in together. It is also fine and healthy to also have different interests as a couple, but being someone's sole support system is exhausting. Give a little time, help her network a little and once she has a friend or two that can share interests things will even out :)"
"They are, which is why a mom traveling internationally for the first time in a long time is usually prioritized over a girlfriend of less than 3 mo."
Being a birth mother does not make someone your mom. 
100% agree! One thing this girl is spot on about is how mature OP is.
"I agree. OP, sleeping with this girl will make things  100 times worse. "
Good news!  They won't be mad at you then.  They'll be mad at your GF.
"Yeahhhh, the buck would stop with me as soon as my husband said, “Let’s compromise with my mother on how you handle this pregnancy.” Uh, no. "
"So all of you went to the same college together as well? Have you been friends with them in person since high school? 

Honestly, it's hurtful, but I would move on. You're 25 and they don't seem like receptive or kind people at all. Delete them and work on finding closer friends."
"This exactly. These two have never had the chance to be their own people, which is probably why she’s trying to control this situation. She doesn’t know a world where the relationship is different or doesn’t exist, and is scared. 
I hope OP does the brave thing and moves in with friends, and I hope she learns she needs to grow too. "
"First, write a lot of it off to booze.  Idiotic things can be super-upsetting when drunk.  Second, I once said to my son's father (a redhead) that I hoped our kid wouldn't be a red-headed boy.  I said that because he had told me about all the shit he'd copped as a red-headed boy, and I wouldn't want that to happen to child of mine.  In hindsight, I can understand why he was upset, but it was nothing about disliking that quality in him, merely wanting the easiest possible life for a child.  I'd say it's fairly accepted that short boys/men have a harder time - it's likely just a really cack-handed expression of empathy.  "
"I contacted my cc company because I had given someone I knew my number to allow them to use it in an emergency. After the lament went through I called the cc company, told them my number had been compromised and requested a new card number.

They issued me a new card that day.

As far as OP dealing with auto pay, he could easily call the provider and let them know that his card is being used to auto pay an account he is no longer using and would like the payment method removed to prevent any ""legal issues"" with fraudulent use."
"It sounds like your sister is some type of addict. She is broke and she is ""sick"" and she needs her ""medicine"" and constantly needs money and constantly shacks up with deadbeat guys.

My thought is some type of harder drug but it could be alcohol I guess."
"This is so awful, I'm so so so sorry girl. My heart actually hurt reading this, like I just can't understand why someone would do this. He's upset about not getting to experience dating because you were his first relationship?? I'd say he was lucky he didn't have to wade through the cesspool that is the dating world frankly.


 Whatever though, he sounds like an absolute coward and guaranteed he'll try to crawl back at some point. It's nice when a SO gets along with family but that is never something that would dictate if they're someone I could spend the rest of my life with. So long as they're not like enemies and despise each other obviously, in this case his mom can keep him. Horrible people, both of them. 

I hope you feel better, and know that you deserve so much better &lt;3"
"I'm going to approach this from the perspective of your girlfriend, because I am someone's girlfriend and I have experience in this area. 

You and your girlfriend are being treated a little bit differently in this situation, and with this being such a long-term relationship (you've indicated over 5 years, at least) you need to see this difference for what it is. You were yelled at, she is being treated like she is the reason you had sex. Your mom is publically humiliating her, that is not acceptable.

Realistically, your average person would be understanding of the fact that you and your girlfriend mutually chose to have sex. You didn't trip and fall inside her, she didn't trick you into sex. Your mom doesn't really seem to accept the fact that you share the equal responsibility in this situation, and I think that it is time that you approach your mother about the treatment of your girlfriend. This has gone beyond the point of it getting better with time, this needs to be addressed in some capacity.

Your mother is upset you had sex but is taking it out on her in a way of hurting both of you. I am not saying it is to drive a wedge, but I'm not saying that is isn't meant to drive a wedge. As a former religious human, I know of the double standard when it comes to sex all too well, and that is what is happening here. 

You have a few choices, you can choose to not say anything and let your mom do this- but that will eventually wear away at your relationship. You can choose to tell your mother ""if she is not invited, I'm not coming to future events"", and deal with the fallout (an option that is valid but prevents future communication). I think your best bet is pulling her aside and stating explicitly that you have noticed her treatment of your girlfriend, telling her point blank that both of made the choice, and then leaving the door open for future communication but taking some space in the meantime. That can look like, ""My girlfriend and I did not make the decision lightly, and we are content with our relationship and the choices we have made. We would like to move forward with a mutual relationship, but I will not accept mistreatment of my partner. We are adults who make the decisions in our relationships, and we will not be punished for exploring our relationship in the ways we choose. When you are ready to move forward we would love to talk to you and agree how we can move past this uncomfortable situation. Nothing can be done about the past, the future is what we make it.""

Good luck, I'm sorry."
"If he is aware of your past and doesn't hold it against you, you have nothing to worry about. It sounds like you have changed a lot, so you have to evaluate yourself based on who you are now. You can't change your past self, but you can do everything to make sure your present and future self are the person you want to be for your partner! "
"Having standards shouldn’t result in verbal abuse when people don’t reach those standards. That’s the controlling part. I have high standards for others, and i quietly fume when i’m wronged, I don’t take it out on them loudly in a public setting or attack them with personal information that’s unrelated to the situation. When people don’t meet my standards, I remember that i don’t control others and my wants don’t always line up with their reality.

his standards have nothing to do with his behavior, he just wants to be a clever bully."
This has to be the Eurovision song contest. 
Is anyone else here really glad that they aren't with scumbags like OP?
"1) be less attractive. 

2) be less friendly. 

If you're both attractive and friendly, men will hit on you. "
"Dude, run. She's been toying with you from the start. She just wants someone to ""chase"" her. She seems really unstable (I'm no doctor but her constant random hookups, mood swings, and attention-seeking leave-me-alone-no-wait-come-back type shit SCREAMS Borderline Personality Disorder) and she doesn't give a single fuck about your feelings, only her own - which seem to change quicker than the weather.

You already told her you're done, now cut off contact. Be polite but neutral if you have to be around her in person. Stop texting back and answering phone calls. Stop giving her the attention &amp; validation she so desperately desires and she'll soon get bored and leave you alone when she finds another schmuck to torment.

Sorry this happened, man. At least your friends know what kind of person she is - it'd be way worse if they weren't on your side."

"As someone with an absent father, it sounds to me as though he has nothing better in his life right now and that's why he is reaching out to you. I think that you deserve better than that. I understand the need to feel wanted and to have a relationship with your father, but it should  be on your  terms, not his. Also going to a foreign country with essentially a stranger is not the best idea. If he wants to hang out with you he should make the effort to come to you. In this situation I don't think your mum is being overprotective. She doesn't want you to get hurt. If I were you I would be cautious and take things slowly. Make sure that he genuinely cares about you before you get too emotionally involved. Good luck. "
"Yeah, I definitely understand that.  I'm sorry maybe I didn't make it clear in the post, but it bothers me so much because when I first met him, he wasn't as awkward with meas he is now.  He made a lot of effort to talk with me, but now he's just given up it seems.  I've also talked with my husband and he has no idea why he's acting this way. "
I hate these kind of guilt trippy coercive replies. You can choose not to date someone for ANY reason. You can choose not to date someone if you don't like their fingernails. 
"You are at very different points in your life.  You are still having fantasies about having found ""the man of your dreams"".

He's 20 years older, been through some serious shit and knows all that ""soul mate business"" is a load of crap because any long term relationship is more about compromise, hard work and dedication.

So he made a joke that other people at his stage in life appreciate, and it rocked your ""unicorns and puppies and princess gowns"" world-view.  He doesn't really think he should have killed his second wife, he just really wishes she'd never happened.

If this is really going to shake your faith in the world, by all means call it off.  Otherwise, just understand it was a joke (in bad taste perhaps) and no one is going to remember it.  Go ahead and get married.  The joke will make more sense in 25-30 years when you move on to your second marriage."
"&gt;""Why can't you just agree with everything I say?""

WTF. Yeeeeeaahhhh...no. Overbearing much? If she won't go to counseling it's probably time to bail. "
My wife did a milder version of this. I believe either she wanted to purposefully tank the relationship and didn't have the guts to do it herself or she was cheating (or about to) and wanted to unload her guilt. We'll be officially divorced in a few weeks.
"&gt;he is anxious so control is part of how he deals with things

Everything that you say about this kid indicates that therapy would be extraordinarily helpful for him in the long run.  It's hard growing up in a broken family.  It's hard coming to terms with the idea that you're not the centre of the universe.  It's also hard growing up with an older brother who torments you.....so for everyone's sake, make the appointment with a family therapist, stuff them in the car, and go.  "
"&gt; Many of the things you say you miss fall in the category of performative femininity.

Thank you for saying it!

Her priorities are elsewhere. If she misses her femme habits, she'll pick them back up when she isn't stretched so thin already."
"I mean... The sum of the issues you're briefly describing combined sound to me like grounds for divorce.  But, also, the only grounds you actually need is just not wanting to be married to him anymore. 

Even more so considering how demanding his job is and his age. Job stress will likely start taking more serious toll on his health pretty soon. Sticking around in a marriage could be signing yourself up for even more caretaking, even after the little one is in school. Just, things to consider. 

You're still pretty young."
"I’ve found that drinking water helps suppress crying. It’s worth a try, in addition to something else that addresses your emotions specifically."
"I feel your pain. I've had to cut my own mother out and it's the fucking worst. Have you been to /r/raisedbynarcissists ? You might find some help and commiseration over there. If it makes you feel worse or brings out the worst in you, stay out of there. "
"Work wife is a common term where I'm at. I don't like the term, it's part of standard office misogyny. But it's recognized as platonic relationship, I've never seen it confused for office romance. It's the equivalent of your work best friend.

OP needs to stop using the term because it makes his real wife uncomfortable. And in general I find it makes most women uncomfortable, so his ""work wife"" might not like it either, but just keeps it quiet toavoid conflict. That doesn't mean end the relationship. Just use another label."
"This comment makes me so very grateful to NOT have a dick. 

(ETA: because of random boners. I would be so paranoid about that all the time!)"
There's family guy jokes about this in the episode where Lois works there. It's nearly impossible to get fired from there.
"I understand that you're not replacing his mom as a person, as in you won't erase her memory, but how does it work being married to the kid's dad, but not being in a motherly role?

Will you live in the same house as the kid? If he starts drawing on the walls with crayon, will you tell him to stop and put him in timeout? If he's crying about something that happened at school, will you dry his tears? If he asks you whether his shirt and pants match, will you tell him or just say, ""ask your Dad, I'm not your Mom, kid""? If your husband wants to forbid him from joining a sports team because his grades are low, will you say, ""I think that's a little harsh""?

Do you see yourself as like... A babysitter who does those things but not in a parental way? A stepmom? Someone who is dating/marrying a Dad but never sees their kid?

Are you going to have kids of your own with your future husband? Would you be a mother to them, but treat your stepson differently?"
"If it were some random person that sent that email, sure I’d be upset too. But if I were engaged to a man who’s wife had died two years ago, right after she gave birth to her one and only child, I hope I’d have the presence of mind to not be an asshole them and show them a little kindness, even despite having concerns about me. 

Not liking what they said? Understandable. Thinking she gets to forbid them seeing their only grandchild? Appalling. 

Then again, the whole thing is a hypothetical since I wouldn’t be reading someone else’s email, so...."
I know! I don't even know who I am anymore. 
"It's really unfortunate that she's hurt and furious, but you really didn't do anything wrong.  It's also unfortunate that there's such a stigma attached to opiate addiction, but it's a reality that she's had to deal with.  And you had to deal with it as well.  To be blunt, if I was your friend and I knew your girlfriend was using, I would have advised you to back away from her.  And if she'd only been clean for a few months, I would have still been a little bit extra careful to put my medication and valuables in a safe place when the 2 of you came over. 

(Note that dealing with addiction is a lot easier in a place like Portugal, where they supposedly do a much better job of treating addiction as a medical issue.)

But anyway, at this point neither of you can change the past.  If she's mad enough to end things over this, than it's something you may have to accept.  If she's willing to move forward with you, then you can work out something of a plan to rehabilitate her image.  If it's something you're up for, it's best to start with your better - and more worldly friends who might have a better chance of understanding why what you're doing is important.  But take it slow - to minimize the pressure on both of you."
Yeah I know. It just pisses me off that he would put someone else through that. 
"Just go see a lawyer, like, now. This is abusive and you gotta get the kids away. 

When it comes to eventual child support and custody none of this usually matters. Unless you have evidence of physical abuse, or drug/alcohol abuse (with DUIs and arrests, not just allegations), courts usually assume people are just talking crap and give one parent primary custody and the other one every other weekend unless you two agree to something else. If you want primary custody you are better off showing that you’re the one who is most able to care for them, like you have a flexible job schedule and you’re already the one doing the primary care of them, driving them to and from school every day and so on.

"You are an adult. Your father is abusive and controlling. He cannot make you move. He cannot make you break up with this girl.

Stop allowing him to control your life through intimidation. Get a prepaid phone. Find a place to live. Move out. Or else 10 years from now you will still be treated like this."
"Call Adult Protective Services TODAY and ask them for advice.

Also, absolutely stop tolerating any talk about fucking women. Literally leave the room.

"I'd imagine at least to some extent it's sheer bloody-mindedness at this point. Wouldn't be surprised if the more you force the issue, the more she'll dig her heels in, because no-one likes being told what to do, no matter how sensible the suggestion! If she's otherwise OK, all you can do is tell her it's her decision, but she smells bad and people tend not to like hanging out with people who smell bad. Sooner or later she'll reach a tipping point and sort herself out, but she'll have to want to do it on her schedule, not yours. And FWIW I'd also say whenever she does shower, don't make a big deal about it (""oh you've finally cleaned yourself, thank goodness"") because that'll just make it into a ""thing"" again. Let it pass without comment and she'll move past it herself."
"Even 99 pounds is underweight at 5'3""."
Oh SHE is immature???  Your fiancé cheated on you.  Your fiancé is immature.  
"Maybe this has freaked him out because he considers what he did serious cheating. Your reaction makes him think that you don’t see it as serious, so he thinks you wouldn’t feel guilty if you went out and did the same thing."
"It sounds like *you've* decided that the issue is that he's not physically attracted to you and wants to fuck other people. I wouldn't leap to that conclusion. It's clear that you want him to want to have sex with you, and something is going on with him if he's not doing that. Four months after a back injury is still very soon, and it's probably hurt his physical confidence (his own view of himself). I injured my back in my mid 20s and the mental part of dealing with it was about as bad as the physical pain. And if he's always had low libido, that's probably affecting his confidence and self esteem too.

If I were you, I'd give him some more time to recover from the injury, and maybe encourage him to see a doctor for the libido issue. Stop assuming what the problem is, but you also shouldn't expect a miracle in terms of his libido. If the prospect of him only wanting sex once every few weeks (when he's healthy and back to normal) isn't enough for you, then you have to consider if this is the right relationship for you."
"Just because he wasn't a minor doesn't mean that abuse didn't happen. This is a person he trusted his entire life. 


Abuse by definition is an improper use of something; the cruel or violent treatment of a person or animal. Sexual abuse included."
"Look. He's invited you, which means everyone involved knows you're not ""just friends"". He doesn't want to use official words with his family because it's early and they'll get way too overexcited. 
If he didn't care about you he wouldn't have asked you to go. Two months is way too early for this anxiety about labels. Breathe, and let it go, and try to have a good time."
"There’s a very interesting theory going around the works lately about an intersection between mental health and emotional range.

I encountered it myself at an eating disorders conference where it’s referred to as being a “super feeler.” I conceptualise it by comparison, as sort of like having access to a broader colour spectrum than someone else might, or being able to experience louder or quieter noises at greater range / with more intensity. Like for a super feeler, there’s eight hundred kinds of sad and they’re much more intense and distinct, whereas for a regular feeler, there’s maybe like seven, and they’re quieter and less disruptive. 

In a pure sense it’s like we walk around with the emotional volume turned up louder, all the time. There’s super awesome aspects of this - super feelers make brilliant, adept carers, artists - (most of the population who sort of vibe with this are often in healthcare or performers in the arts, authors, painters, lyricists, actors...) but as you may see there’s also downsides - much more vulnerability to mental health issues, less ability to cope with the ups and downs in life. 

Like every innate asset or predisposition, as human beings we are intelligent, cognitive creatures and we can work to leverage and/or fine tune what we’ve got to work with. You might do well with some time in therapy to help process out the range of your feelings. Age and experience I often find just sort of naturally equips us to better handle how we’re built. When I was six I would cry if I saw someone looking sad in the street. I’m 30 now and I’m a clinician (zing), I’ve learned to contain and modify my responses so I can fit into the world but I can use my range to analyse and detect subtle issues in my personal life amongst friends, as well as in my work, which enables me to problem solve at a level that some of my blunter or less tuned in acquaintances would miss, or struggle with. 

Hope this might be helpful, and as ever - it’s only a hypothesis, I could be completely off. See a GP if your daily life is a struggle due to yr emotional burden, you may need a work up slightly more thorough. Kindness and thoughts in yr direction anyway! "
"Nobody would want to be a single pregnant woman going into grad school with no money after my ex dumped my ass in a bitter breakup. Fuck that, she made the right choice. Calling her out for making a choice that could have ruined her life? Please don’t do that. "

"I don't understand the whole ""oh, kids his age tend to act like this"" excuse.  My stepson NEVER acted this way, even when he was a toddler.  Making excuses for their behavior overlooks the fact that it's been allowed for this long. Kids know right and wrong (as in ""do VS don't do"") as early as three.  Stop making excuses for this crap.  It's not ""normal."""
"The whole waiting X amount of time before having sex with someone is fucking weird. Sex is a big part of relationships, if 2 people aren't sexually comparable the relationship uaually won't work out. Why potentially waste 6months just to find out you don't click in the bedroom? I feel like anyone willing to wait some arbitrary time period before sleeping together probably has some issues themselves. That shits a red flag and I'd bail instantly."
"That’s not true.  I had sex with my fiancé maaaaybe a week after meeting him, and he still put a ring on it.  If a guy really likes you, he doesn’t care when you sleep with him.  

Not all women view sex the way you do, so that’s why they don’t tie it as tightly to emotion/their worth as a partner. 

You can absolutely wait to have sex as long as you like, that’s your right! But I’d also consider talking to a therapist, because you’ve got some deeply internalized, lowkey misogynistic views about sex that I think are affecting your relationships.  You should not be feeling bad after you have sex, and you should not view sex as something you “give up.” "
Does it matter? *She is mean to you.* The last thing you need to do is waste time trying to understand her in the hopes that you'll find some magic shut-off switch that will make her stop.

"They aren't necessarily horrible OP - most are worded very nicely and politely - but they disagree with your worldview so you denigrate and discard them. If you came on this subreddit for sycophantic support then I think you're going to be rather disappointed.

In truth, your comments read like you have simultaneously very low self-esteem and no hope in your situation ever changing. Do you feel happy?"
"Wow, she sounds like a nut job. It's a shame that something that's supposed to be wholesome got ruined by shitty people, but that's the world we live in I guess. :/

"to be honest though, that had nothing to do with this. he should just be totally honest and transparent. there’s no reason to throw in some bogus and not authentic shout out to the me too movement or anything like that. if he’s not saying it from the bottom of his heart or it’s not relevant, why bother? just be honest and then hopefully move forward and not feel so hopeless."
"I disagree, but let’s say that’s true. Let’s say OP is an obnoxious loudmouth who has an opinion on EVERYTHING. Let’s say she laughs way too loud and doesn’t hesitate to tell you that she thinks the shirt you’re wearing is fugly.  Even with all that, this is between OP and Lucas. If he’s ok with her behavior (he married her so I think he is) or maybe he thinks it’s an adorable part of her character, then his parents need to stop complaining about it. This is not their marriage. Stop directing criticisms to her. If they really can’t take it and they’re going to stop being around OP, they need to work this out with Lucas.  

If Lucas agrees with their assessment and want OP to do things differently, then he needs to sack up and tell OP what he’d like her to work on but it needs to come from him as his issue. Not “my mom thinks you should stop singing raunchy songs in public” but “hey it’s embarrassing to me when you sing Irish drinking songs at full volume in Mcdonalds.”  If he disagrees with his mom, then he needs to tell her so and tell her to either accept it or stay home. 

Bottom line, OP doesn’t have a good relationship with MIL so Lucas needs to be the buffer there. MIL needs to go through him if she wants to complain. Lucas needs to do his job, too, and stop MIL from harassing his wife. "
She said he was abroad often so she probably didn't have to look at him 10 out of 12 months a year. Now he is back for good so it's time to move on.
"&gt; If I wanted to be with her, I could be.

"If my boyfriend, who I’ve been with for 4.5 years now, went to his female friends family’s funeral instead of my biopsy appointment, I’d probably think that I’m not as much of a priority as she is.
I’d feel like he chose her over me, not just a funeral over a doctors appointment.
If you don’t go with your fiancée, you’re making a mistake. I get it. Your friend is hurting. But she has her family. Other friends. Other people there for her. She’ll be fine. (speaking as someone who lost a sibling to suicide)
Your fiancée? She wants YOU there. Just you. Do you realize how much she loves you that the one person she wants there, no matter the news, is YOU? You are her priority. It’s time to make her yours. "
"I think questions you need to chew over with him are the following: 

1) Will you be expected to submit to your In-law's opinions on how things should be done and how will your BF support you if those opinions differ from your own.  This is something that needs to be discussed explicitly, because the expectation often is that the new daughter in law, irregardless of what background she is, is going to fall in line.  I also think you should make a list of things you absolutely will not compromise on for them (percentage of income sent to them?  Medical issues for children/yourself/BF? where to live?....anything that's SUPER important to you value-wise or safety wise).   Then you should think about things you are definitely willing to be flexible about and ""give"" them say on, so that you still can still involve them in your life on some level, where they (by Indian standards, not N.american ones) don't feel shut out.  This could be things like consulting them for cooking, wedding planning, family holiday traditions, decorating your home, deciding on school for kids (and by ""deciding"", you have already picked 2-3 schools you like, but are letting them give you feedback/advice on which of the three for example). 

  If you choose ahead of time the decisions you're going to let them go nuts on (rather than trying to maintain your independence at all times), then you'll have an easier time when you need to stand your ground for something else. Once you've thought these lists outs, make sure BF is explicitly aware of what you'll happily go his family's way on, and what you are absolutely expecting to have your way.  Chances are, there's going to be a few things that he's going to want to add to List 1.  This is so he's not caught off guard when you disagree with his family and so he knows he has to back you.  But also, so that if you can't think of some way to bond with his family, he can give you ideas for things to help smooth things over. 

2) How traditional are the roles in his family.  Are his female family members career ladies or SAHMs? Is there a mix? Do the men opt out of emotional labour and equitable childcare/chores? Or do they pitch in and help without prompting?   You need to ask him about this explicitly.  I know Indian families who go both ways, so while Indian culture as a whole can be more traditional, there's definitely more progressive folks and very equitable families.  You need to figure out exactly what he means when he's saying ""you have to be prepared for this based on my culture""..... you need to get him to explicitly define what he means by that.  What he perceives as his ""culture"" could also just be patterns that his extended family has, and not necessarily the be-all-and-end-all of Indian ""culture"". 

These are two big questions that I think will lead you guys into a lot of smaller discussions. 

Some other tips - I would start making a stab at learning whatever dialect his family speaks in India.  This is two fold - shows commitment to integrating yourself into his family and also protects you from people attempting to gossip about you or talk about you in front of you, which is something I have seen happen in a few cases of white friends/acquaintances marrying into Indian families. I'm not saying his family will do this, but neighbours and family friends will likely try it at some point, even if it's not overtly malicious and more gossipy dumb ""wow, that was weird"" type observations.  However, I wouldn't necessarily look to your BF for teaching you beyond basic greetings (good partners are not always good or patient language teachers, particularly if they have no language teaching training.)   Seek out lessons online or through a local temple or tutor.  

 As well as the dialect, make sure you research the exact region he's from.  There are HUGE differences between Indian states and attitudes between different cities, so a broad ""Indian"" label often isn't very helpful.   Learn the history and any inter-group conflicts that may have happened in the area, so you can be on top of any inter-group hostility may crop up.  Not that'll it be directed at you, but so you're aware of what may be less tactful to bring up in discussion.  (For example, I had a friend from a super white, slightly red-neck-y area ask a Hindu friend why he wasn't wearing a turban.  She was honestly puzzled and thought it was a personal choice.  We had to explain to friend A that Friend B was not sikh and that hindu and sikh were not interchangeable, and that while turbans could be a personal choice, they wouldn't even be on Friend B's radar, cuz they weren't from his religion.   That may seem rather basic for anyone who's grown up in a multicultural area, but learning that India had dozens of religions and dialects was mindblowing for Friend A. And with those dozens of cultures comes a lot of baggage) "

Agreed. I saw it as kind of controlling. 
"I haven't shaved in over a decade. It's no big deal. It's no bigger deal than the fact that neither my husband nor any previous boyfriends have ever shaved their armpits, legs, or pubic hair. "
"Shave on sex night and for parties.

All other times go as you please.

There's your compromise. It covers actual social events and sexy time. If his only real argument is that it's embarrassing then he's a child who cares too much what other people think of him. Honestly he shouldn't be treating you like an accessory anyways. Why does he feel he is being judged for YOUR appearance? It's not like you're wearing rags and you're un washed and dirty. You look like a regular person doing regular shit."
"I never stated that there weren't other factors that could be affecting her. If there are, she should communicate those with OP and if she did, I doubt OP would be posting here about it."
"This is a horrible situation for you.  The thing is,  he's valuing this girlfriend above you and it SUCKS, especially since you can see that she isn't a nice person.  But ultimately this is a reflection of your dad,  not you.  He isn't seeing this as leaving you, I'll bet.  It's just that leaving you,  to him,  is a byproduct of what he wants to do.  You can't make him stay.  Lean on your mum and your friends.  Ring your siblings,  even if they're away in college.  But whatever you do,  don't blame yourself."
Lol that's quite interesting how you think everyone works the exact same way you do. You seem pretty bitter about open and polyamorous relationships too. There's probably a easy explanation for that though.
"Medically speaking, warts really aren’t that big a deal.  It’s the strains of hpv that don’t cause warts but do cause cancer that are the problem.

Interesting I'll try this 
It's not scummy to turn down this girl because you're prioritizing your relationship with your brother. It's called being honest. I agree with you on the latter part but this someone else isn't just someone else. It's your brother. 
"I remember my cheating ex doing exactly this. He'd get this look on his face, sigh and be like ""FINE, I'll show you"" after I confront him. He'd turn around or walk slow, tinker around on his phone while I wait for him and then be like ""here you go."" He'd do such a bad job at delete-editing the conversation to make it look innocent, but there'd be remnants from the inappropriate conversation where you could tell something was deleted. Or he'd delete it ALL in front of me so that I could never know what it said, but I'd have to live with the fact that there was something there while he'd gaslight me and tell me I was overreacting, that it was nothing serious but that he knew I'd get mad anyway so he had to delete it. It was a horrifying experience because I stayed for so long and I really hope OP gets the hell out of there sooner than later!"
"While I agree, he is very dense about this whole thing, especially since he clearly knows that he would be uncomfortable with this situation himself.

On the other hand though I don't think this girl is mature enough to be in a relationship

&gt;she felt like just another number because I’ve had relationships pretty consistently since I was like 17. She told me this had bothered her the entirety of the relationship to this point

Sounds kind of like she may have been looking for anything to be bothered about. Not that I am justifying OP's actions but there are two sides to this

"Your ex (and he is your ex) is gaslighting you, look into finding a new place, inform your coworkers that you are no longer involved and that he was duplicitous, and block him on social media.  You don't owe him anything and it isn't your fault he decided to act like a child.    "
"You need to define your own relationship boundaries with your MIL, and they will be different than your husband's boundaries for a variety of reasons. The key is that your husband must stand up for your personal boundaries and not see your relationship with his mother as the same as his own. It is not and never will be. She did not raise you. 


Speak with your husband about your new, firmly defined boundaries. Do not leave it with him as a choice - he will have to accept those boundaries and be prepared to speak to his mother about them if needed. You, as the spouse, should be his primary emotional concern now, not his mom. She has her own spouse to play that role. 

When she gets inappropriate, do not answer or give any information. Grey rock her here - no response, no squirming, no reactions other than ""I am not discussing the details of my personal life with you."" No excuses or explanations needed. Then change the subject or leave the room.

If she continues, spend less time with her each time she crosses your boundaries. You can even tell her ""You insisted on bringing up a subject that I said was not up for discussion, so I will not be able to see you for a few weeks. Hopefully this will be easier for you to remember when we do speak again.""

MIL also needs to be on a permanent information diet. Your private lives, whether personal, sexual, financial or emotional, should not be topics of discussion with her, ever.  "
"Oh man, this sucks, and I'm sorry that you had to be put through this. Honestly, you know what you gotta do- pack up and move on. She's essentially trying to get you to cheat on her so she has a reason to cheat on you too.

It's unhealthy and it could be that she's polyamorous, but if you're monogamous, that would make things very very difficult for the two of you and your children in the long run.

Has she ever brought up instances like this in the past ten years? Or only of late?"

"My partner and I are the lease holders. We sublet a room to her. Partner and I have a great relationship with the landlady and she trusts us to find suitable roommate. In fact one of the things we have brought up with current roommate in the past was that if the landlord were to do an inspection (inspections are typically done every 3 months here, although our landlady has only officially done one so far) she probably wouldn’t like what’s going on in that bedroom and it would put us at risk.

"Did you read my comment? This person has already sloughed off every adult responsibility at their feet. He is not her mother. Short of leaving her, which I assume OP does not want to do, not catering to her by providing drama and a reckoning for her perceived (and maybe real!) failure to be a good mom seems too much like giving into her grand plan. 

There are different ways to treat children. You rear the ones that turn out well by not giving into their every whim. Other parents might try to ask the child what's wrong and ""give in.""

No, I don't think this is happening because she is a new mom. It does seem as though she can't handle her own choices, by OP's description. And absolutely, this individual can't seem to even be bothered to try to handle adult obligations she selected. He's doing his best and he'd be forgoing a portion of his dignity, in my opinion, by going any further and trying to ""make nice"" with someone that some might say is just a plain bad person. But that's not what I'm saying. 

EDIT: tdlr, whatever that means, I am telling OP not to give her the satisfaction of being the bad guy. It sounds as though it's what she wants, and it's not true! She'll cope. Tough love works."

"The nastiness and stupidity you get in comments against your SIL (yeah throw her out of your life, the fat sobbing aunt) honestly are a result of your original post.

In comments I see the deep appreciation you have for your SIL, but you did paint her as a slow learning fat single dramatic lady in your OP as her most prominent features, and I have the feeling that that might have shown in the way you talked to her or handled this whole thing. I don't say you should've chosen her nor that she's right, but I do believe you hurt her unnecessarily. 

I'd say look for a way to show her how much you care for her in a way that comes of as genuine and natural as the image of her you projected here and perhaps projected to her too."
"I don't think it's an unreasonable boundary at all, I can see completely why it would make you feel uncomfortable.

"If you want to smooth it out (I would because it’s really not that big of a deal) J would write her a card and give her a little gift. Thank her for her help with the babies and for being a wonderful Aunt. Make it clear that she will always be a part of your children’s lives. Don’t mention the guardianship. Then your husband can ask her to please respect you as parents, even if she doesn’t understand, for the sake of your relationship and for family. 

If she has a history of disrespecting you or making your life worse that is one thing. If she’s been moody and childish over one thing patch it up and move on. If she can’t handle that then take it from there. I imagine she just wants to be reassured that she matters and is appreciated and you love her. "

And if you never start a conversation with your ""friend""...you're not her friend. Some people in life will be interested in you, some won't. Them's the breaks.

"It wasn't against his core values. Many couples have therapy and continue having great relationships. Therapy more than anything helps you understand yourself and those around you better. Our initial problem was that we weren't ready and prepared, we rushed it instead of getting to know ourselves and each other first. "
"I'm a sub with a really patient Dom and a history of physical, emotional and sexual abuse dating back to birth. I had never had a functional relationship with another person of any type until I met my Dom.

Unlike you I had always been interested in power dynamic based BDSM but a) didn't have the words I needed to articulate that, b) the awareness I could have any say in my life or chance to express my needs and c) had been shamed and abused within that context repeatedly.

I was incredibly uncomfortable about getting into D/s with all that baggage and I spent months deciding to enter the relationship. I didn't give my Dom any details at all. He was completely unaware of my history beyond my 'I've had some bad partners and I'm not close to my family' one line bio on our second date.

And instinctively he made it clear he still wanted sex even if it wasn't D/s based and he went at my pace which was glacially slow. I deliberately didn't tell him my past because I wanted to leave it behind and start something new as he felt like a turning point for me.

Three years later my D/s with him has worked me through so much of my trauma about my childhood and my sexual abuse in a way that therapy has never managed. He has become my boyfriend, my love and the person who knows my personality best. I trust him with my life and he has healed parts me I didn't know I had let alone how broken they were.

He still has absolutely no idea of the details of the abuse and trauma I have been through. I walk a line between disclosing what is needed and not letting that negative energy come with me into a good new life. 

I'm a massive believer the right person can help you further than you can go on your own and I'm a living testimony to how trust through D/s can literally save someone's life and soul. I have spent years as a rape crisis counsellor and using sex positive talk to heal (sexual) trauma and correcting misconceptions about D/s and other non mainstream sexual practices.

And I think your husband is a red flag so big you could wrap the White House up in it and still have fabric left over to tie you up. He's approaching trauma in the hinkiest fashion possible and he's approaching kink like a massive creep.

Even if he didn't have the terms for his D/s desires (which is highly unlikely since he hit sexual maturity when 50 Shades has been the biggest cultural phenomeon of the last 15 years and D/s is now casual chat in the bus queue unlike my pre internet adolescence) he would have exhibited inclinations toward it that show patterns if you've ever discussed sexual ideas, fantasies, porn or anything else. 

D/s lifestyles do not pop up out of a vaccuum. There are small tells and hints which you (and your partners) may not totally understand until later but you will look back in hindsight and see like 'oh that's why he always grinned like that why I snarkily said yes Sir when he tells me to put the dishes away'

Kinksters are also like every other hobbyist in that they get super excited why they find the 'in' to the hobby (and it's a game and hobby as much as D&amp;D is when you take the smut out) and talk about it endlessly and want to show and share their knowledge. They want you to know all about rope bondage or pet play too and have to told to stop sharing fascinating facts. 

Yet your husband appears to be educating himself on the subject and not sharing that knowledge with you who is nervous and not sure. He's deliberately withholding stuff that might make you more interested and relaxed and he's not encouraging you to find out more. You have to ask him to stop pushing the idea but not the details and he's not opening up now the subject is broached but is being evasive and constantly flipping stuff round. 

He's pushing you to decide at speed, not giving you room to think and giving the impression he will be angry or withholding if say no or ask questions. He's making it him versus you when D/s is at heart teamwork. You cannot submit without Dominance and you cannot Dominate without submission. It's symbiotic and it relies intrinsically on the consent of both people.

Every single thing your husband is doing is using kink as way to abuse. You need to read two books to educate yourself. You actually need to read 50 Shades because Christian Grey is exactly the man who thinks he's a Dom and is a straight up emotional abuser and that's probably your husband's guidebook so it'll make you aware of his moves.

And the other book is Why Does He Do That by Lundy Bancroft which is the classic text on understanding the abuse dynamics. Because you are in an abusive relationship and snapping at Redditors isn't going to save you. You've been set up and you need to get out safely.

Kink is just the cover here."

"Fair play. You can definitely ask him for a ride.

"You're both adults now. It's perfectly acceptable to say ""Ok, I love you, but if we're going to have a future together, I want that future to start now. You've been saying you want to get a better job for years. Is that the truth? Are you *really* wanting to do something else, and if you are, what is it that's stopping you?""

See if you can get him to have a real, honest conversation with you about it. I'd bet a tenner on the truth being that this is the only job he's ever really known, and that he's terrified that he'll just fail at anything else he tried to do, or something similar.

He's watched you go from strength to strength so he knows that it's possible. But maybe he isn't confident that it's possible for *him*. Either way. Man's got 5 years before he turns 30. He needs to either come up with a plan for where he wants to be going by then or he needs to admit that he's actually ok where he is and would rather be comfortable in his rut than strike out for something else.

It's ok to want a partner who is careful enough with their finances that you're not forever hanging back on one thing or another. It's also ok to want a partner who is at least somewhat ambitious and it's definitely ok to want a partner who can be honest and rational about his situation.

If he were saying ""I actually really like working here, and I don't mind being a bit broke all the time"" then that would be one thing, but he's been there since he was 19? 18? And he's still doing the whole ""any day now I'm going to go do something with my life!"" thing. He's had six years to do something with his life. What's he waiting for?"
"I am going to echo others who are saying that you should just not tell him and leave, because abusive relationships can escalate to violence when you try to leave. 

I was in an abusive relationship years ago. There was a time I had made up my mind to leave, we actually had enough money in the bank that I could afford the gas (he had alienated and isolated me 1000 miles from home), etc. He picked me up and threw me across the room. I thought my leg might be broken. He told me, ""How are you going to run away when you can't even walk?""

&gt;I started going to therapy in January because he said that I was at fault for all the problems in our relationship. 

He is gas lighting you. He has convinced you that you are the problem when he is clearly abusive. 
You might have some issues that you could work on, it's possible, but YOU ARE NOT TO BLAME FOR HIM BEING ABUSIVE. You ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ""ALL"" THE PROBLEMS. Normal people can have disagreements without abusing the other person. 

If you tell him you are leaving, he will be nice long enough to ruin your plans and then he will go right back to his old habits. Get out of this toxic relationship as soon as you can before you end up stuck.

I have male friends at work and I think we'd be SUPER uncomfortable if anyone used the term. The term IMPLIES a level of intimacy. Work friend doesn't.  
"I love this woman. I was going to mention her also with a poster above. She has a podcast called “where should we begin.”
The first episode is a couple who had been married for decades and he cheated on her the whole time - more in a sex addict, with sex workers way than the OP here. But one thing I understood is that there’s a serious sense of shame from the wife for staying and trying to work things out. Doubt, shame, no one understands. Their kids don’t even understand why mom is staying. So she feels completely alone and has no one to validate her. 
Anyway - I hope OPs wife has some support, some people saying it’s ok to stay and work it out. "
"I will say that my mother is completely incapable of being abusive, it's not that there is another side to her I can't see. My mother sometimes can't express herself very well in english, so she's always blunt and expressive and easy to read and my sister is a bully, a liar, an attention seeker and a complete diva and always has been.  
  
The money was collateral for a car I lent her so she could work, which disappeared during her holiday and I never saw a dollar of it. I'm still extremely upset over this as well, and I was HOPING that her new career would finally get me some recompense (until she suddenly quit, that is). I haven't loaned anything else since."
"Dude just stop bringing him around these girls. Don't invite him, they are uncomfortable, what the hell! "
"There's still a problem here, though. It sounds like the OP has been fairly explicit with her about his love language (""I've told her that physical contact makes me feel attractive and wanted""), and she has shrugged him off and shown no willingness to compromise.

ETA: And OP's comments do come off as rather rigid, as another commenter pointed out down thread. I wonder what her love language is, and whether he makes an effort to accommodate that, or whether he expects her to be the only one to change because ""this is what a marriage/relationship should be like."""
"These kinds of insecurities shouldn't be validated like this. When my girlfriend asks me what I think about a style of shoe she's thinking of getting or a shade of lipstick she's trying out, she knows I'm going to be honest even if she doesn't like the answer.

That's not to say I'm a jerk about it, there's just no point in asking for an opinion if you don't really want one. At that point you may as well say ""tell me I'm pretty"". Alright. You're pretty."
"Hi OP, know you’re not alone in having a family member lie about abuse etc. My cousin has diagnosed BPD and has convinced herself she had an abusive, dysfunctional upbringing when the opposite is true. She was actually spoiled, coddled, babied, allowed a lot of freedom, got away with a lot of bad behaviour etc. She loves to be a martyr and desperately needs attention/to be a victim. I have had people tell me ‘her experiences are real to her’ and that ‘you don’t know what goes on behind the scenes’, but I and my family, and anyone who hangs around in her life long enough, all know it’s complete fiction. Her lies have destroyed her parents lives, meanwhile they’ve poured all their love, attention, time and money into treatment for her. So I understand how incredibly hurtful it is, not only with her behaviour but also the fact people are manipulated into believing it. At the end of the day it’s your mum who suffers and I know it’s really, really upsetting.

The fact your sister is dysfunctional in other aspects of her life makes me think she is mentally unwell. Part of my cousin’s disorder is needing to be a victim and moving onto new people that can give her sympathy, before having a huge depressive episode that often has ‘suicide’ attempts or pretending to collapse and going to hospital etc. My cousin is currently living on benefits (welfare in the UK) after rehab for alcoholism - she’s never had a job, spent £5,000 of her inheritance in about 6 months on drink until her parents pulled the plug, constantly has new ‘best friends’ who then turn into enemies when they realise what she’s really like and pull away, etc etc.

The fact your sister lies about everything, manipulates for attention and has only managed to hold a job for 2 months before going off the rails sounds A LOT like my cousin. I cut my cousin out of my life as much as I can (see like once a year at family events if she bothers attending) but only after she had 10 years of therapy, in-patient treatment, rehab twice, multiple ‘deep’ talks about how I can try to help her etc. I gave up because there is NOTHING I can do until she wants to change and she doesn’t want to.

So if you feel up to it, my advice would be to try to have one last conversation about whether she wants treatment. She may actually like the idea as being able to say she’s in therapy plays into the official ‘victim’ role - my cousin loves it and just bounces from therapist to therapist for validation but none of the treatment. But the point is at least then you’d know you tried and she had a shot at buckling down and trying to change. But I wouldn’t blame you at all if you didn’t want anything to do with her."

"Have you apologized? Apologize once, professionally and in writing, and then let her take the lead. You likely have no chance at friendship, but the least you can do is try and salvage whatever working relationship you have.

In the future, it's not a good idea to try and date coworkers. It's also best, especially if you're talking to people over text, to take a few moments to craft your response especially if you're feeling strong emotions. The luxury of having conversations not face-to-face is you can take time to edit your initial reaction to avoid these sorts of overreactions."

I’d start with Michele Weiner-Davis book “Healing from Infidelity.”
"I was thinking the same thing! 

My two youngest are 18 and 20, and if I had to actually sign a permission form for one of them??? Should I go brush their teeth too? 

If you’re old enough to have a child, get married and slam back a tequila, my days of granting permission is long over. 

(I know that some places, like the States, have higher drinking ages but since that is completely ridiculous I’m choosing to disregard that)"
The therapy is because three years later she hasn't let go of the anger and hurt. That's not normal.

Not bad at all!  I think it's the perfect solution.

That's not someone worth keeping around, and it's probably for the best for both of you since she's decided this stuff is so important to her."
"Of course it's nothing to sneeze at, but I think OP has a point in saying that being actively miserable the entire week is different than just the normal not liking work.


If he can find a job that might not pay as much, but still provides for the long-term financial goals, that would be a fair compromise.


Also, it occurs to me as I write this - does OP work? If not, maybe she can start working and that will let him take some of the pressure off. "
It would probably be good to remind him that you are currently a minor and thus he is still responsible for you and your safety.
"I can at least try though, and I think that in the country that I currently live in my parents signature isnt required"
"As a chronically ill person (who cannot be vegan due to that) developing debilitating food intolerances turned out to have a silver lining on this front.

I learned that someone who will not acknowledge the realities of your illness such as seeing it as fake, not accepting there is no cure or forcing their beliefs on you about it is telling you they think you are lying and they know more about your life than you do.

For years I put up with so much ableist shit like this and only when I had to adapt a little known medical exclusion diet did I realise I deserved better and it was a fantastic bullshit detector.

I now give three strikes and out over it and then I'm done unless I have evidence it was in good faith such them helping themselves that way. And you know what? My mental health has improved hugely and so has my physical health by cutting out people who basically gaslight  and bully me.

I don't want to be friends with anyone who displays cultish behaviours of any kind. (And on that note I'm off to Skype a vegan friend who never bugs me about going plant based and help her with a vegan business she's working on proving both carnivores and vegans need not be arseholes to each other...)"
"THANK YOU.  That part really irritated me too.  She IS WORKING, just like OP.  Wtf is this nonsense ""get your husband to pay for your lunches"".

"Hard skills can be taught.  Soft skills not so much.  I wouldn't worry overly about her thinking that you are snooty and patronizing.  I doesn't sound like she's able to pick up subtle hints based on her interaction so far.  Give her the curriculum, let her know the reason you ""know so much"" is a mix of education and experience.  Strongly suggest she follows the curriculum.  Definitely mention that work related events require her to have no more than max 2 LIGHT drinks.  A sprizter etc.  Good luck"

"Her friends tolerate and are nice to you because you're with their friend. Rest assured, they will all breath a sigh of relief when you two break up because they'll know they won't have to be subjected to that creep again. I promise you, regardless of how nice they are to your face, your friend reflects poorly on you and has definitely affected their perception of you "
"I did not realize that we actually have more of a hormone that makes us cry in everyday life. Thanks for the explanation :) I'm another crier. I can end up raised voice and crying when I'm angry. It sucks. It does make you look weak and out of control. It can make it harder to think because the crying can be distracting for the crier. I also tear up at sappy happy stuff, and a big trigger is disappointing someone I respect. I had a huge problem with tearing up during criticism from this one boss that I made the mistake of putting on a pedestal. I worked really hard to get past the crying in the work environment. It helped when I switched to being a contractor for a while -- you are spending most of your time with equals or people you are advising so the power differential is reduced. Getting confidence and getting a bit of emotional separation from work helped. But, in personal life it is still an issue because that emotional separation is not going to be there.

"You don’t need to keep having these conversations. You are not obligated to explain your feelings to his satisfaction or justify yourself to him. Just like he is not obligated to explain or justify his desire to transition. This is your own personal decision and you are entitled to make it irrespective of how he feels about it. There is nothin g to rationalise here. People fall out of love and lose attraction for each other all the time for all sorts of reasons. A person fundamentally changing their body, gender and appearance is a pretty damn good reason. Stop being so worried about him and his feelings that you neglect or minimise your own. What he is doing is almost gaslighting you. You don’t need his permission or agreement to break up with him and end your relationship. It sounds like that’s what you need and want to do. If you want to still be there for him as a supportive friend you can try to do that. "
"So, I think it's admirable you want to support your boyfriend and do whatever you can do make this process easier for him/her. I think when someone transitions, the focus is immediately on the transitioning person and how difficult it is for them - which it absolutely is - but the people around them often get cast aside or treated as carnage and then labeled transphobic if they aren't immediately supportive. 


**It is okay to not be attracted to him/her after he transitions.**

**It is okay to not want to be in a relationship with him after he transitions.** You have your own attractions and preferences and there is *nothing* wrong with that. You can still be supportive of him/her.


**It's okay to put your feelings first.** S/he just dropped a huge bomb on you, considering you felt this came out of left field. Don't feel like the feelings you have now have to define this entire process. Let yourself work through them, take some time apart if you have to. Just take care of yourself because you and your feelings matter.


Your boyfriend is going about this pretty terribly if s/he just expected you to go along and have no issue with it entirely. I think that's a ""best case"" scenario but is certainly not typically real life. You need to really think about what you want and whether that involves your boyfriend anymore. 

Adding as well, I skipped down and read some of your responses here about the conversations you've been having. I think it would be good to do a joint session with an LGBTQ friendly therapist who has experience with people who are/have transitioned. S/he is being very immature about this entire thing and disregarding of your extremely valid concerns. S/he seems like they are looking for an argument and your conversations don't seem to be going anywhere but in circles. "

"Thats not how it works, they have commited tax fraud. There are very strict guidlines to being able to claim someone as dependant.

Op, you need to file a paper return and mail it in. Then the irs will sort out the rest. 

Your parents are likely not going to be happy they will have to repay the money they got. It was probably quite a bit more than 500 something. They are lying to you. No legal tax preparer will do this as they could lose their license, have a HUGE fine and go to jail. 

Call the irs and find out everything you need to fix this before YOU get charged with tax fraud also. Letting this go means a possible felony charge."
"Oh dear...this post is making me think of giving up on dating and starting to accumulate cats.

But yeah, this whole thing has maybe made me a bit more cautious in regards to dating. I mean, I know there's dishonest people out there, and I thought I was a pretty good judge of human nature, so this was fairly jarring.

That's roughly 10+ hours per day, 7 days a week.

Add in an hour for commuting, 6 for sleeping, another hour for personal hygiene, another hour for meal prep and eating, and you're left with 4 to 5 hours per day to do everything else, including the hours over ten per day, the times you try to catch up on sleep, running errands, and so on. There's probably not enough time or will power left to workout or plan/prepare healthier meals."

I've spent so much time in therapy dealing with it. People don't realize how traumatic yelling and fighting like this can be to a little kid. I still get upset when someone yells around me, like my palms will get sweaty and my heart will race. OP needs to get divorced and put his kid's wellbeing ahead of everything else. Neither of these people are prioritizing the children in this situation. "
He's looking out for your health. I'd be more concerned about the fact that you're calling a long distance penpal you have never met your boyfriend!

So you wasted three years of this woman’s time while holding something stupid she told you in confidence before you even dated? THAT is the real deal breaker here lol. 
"Personally, I don't see any reason why you should ever trust this girl again. Along with the infidelity, she's a total hypocrite and doesn't seem like a good gf at all. Why do you still wanna save this relationship? Your gf doesn't."
"So he has a habit of LYING that is so bad you felt you needed to check the value of your ring. Now that you have the ring I assume you guys are going to get married? And then he suddenly starts acting uber possessive over your attention and money and is now forcibly trying to control you. Example, he threw a fit when you spent money on your kids, he stole the items hou bought for your kids, tries out a bit of manipulation by saying he's worried about you, takes it further and implies you have a spending problem, and tells you he is going to return all that stuff that is for your kids. All the signs of an abusive partner who is just now starting to show who he really is the moment you got engaged and put that ring on your finger. "
"&gt; I guess I should've quit asking, but I just wanted to help him.

Sometimes the best way to help someone is to just believe them. I'm not 100% on the timeline of this event, but it does sound like you went a bit overboard on the ""professional care mode"" and trampled over your boyfriend in the moment. There seemed to be a lot of apologizing in a short amount of time. To me, a more reasonable response would be to ask him if he was alright, offer ice once or twice, and then tell your boyfriend to let you know if he's experiencing any signs of concussion/head injury later.

There's not much you can do at the moment except give him space. Check in again tomorrow, but *no more apologizing*. It can get exhausting for both parties if a relatively minor event like this keeps getting brought up."
"I scrolled to find this one. I, myself am allergic to deodorants. I used to be very sensitive, to the point where walking down aisle at the store would make me feel itchy. When i got break outs, they'd stick around for about a month - just awful. That said, rock and crystal deodorants are a safe alternative for me. I was very skeptical about trying them, for fear of a break out, and made up excuses to do so, so i can see why the GF wouldn't give it a shot.  But bad B.O. can hurt her outside the relationship, such as at work, so it's either this or, idk breathable clothes?"
"I know that, that's why I said IF your brother is abusing his girlfriend. 

Step 1: Talk to the girlfriend. Get the facts. Make sure you watch for signs because she might lie and say everything is fine. A lot of abuse victims will try and protect their abusers or pretend it's all fine. 

Step 2a: IF she is being abused, **help her**

Step 2b: If she's not actually being abused, maybe talk to your brother about how it's not really chill how he interacted with her during dinner. Because that's still not right even if that's just a one off

"
"I was you for a VERY long time.  I gave and gave and always ended up feeling like I was being taken advantage of.  It stops being you're doing something nice for them because you want to, now it's because it's EXPECTED of you and that doesn't feel so good.


This sentence is very telling: ""So I started to bend my time and MY schedule and put my life's little inconveniences aside when he felt he could be bothered with the relationship.""  Stop doing that.  Once you start to see the give, give give pattern emerging, just stop.  Even if it means you don't see each other for however long.  Either you're a priority or you aren't and you don't want to be with someone who isn't willing to make you a priority.  Will a lot of guys not step up? Yes, but better you find out before wasting too much of your emotional energy.  Expressing your boundaries verbally means nothing if you don't back it up with your actions.  

I recommend the following book ""Why Men Love Bitches"", its a humorous read, but also has some really solid advice.


One final thing, and I know this sounds super cliche, but I really put effort into making my life as amazing as possible without a guy.  I took up hobbies, threw myself into my career, got in shape, spent time with family.  The purpose was twofold 1) in case I ended up never meeting someone at least my life would be enjoyable on my own and 2) when I finally did meet someone, I didn't NEED them for a great life, I had one.  When I eventually met my husband, I had the attitude ""My life as-is is fantastic, I really enjoy being single.  If being with you makes me feel LESS than that, why would I waste my time?"" Put you first.

"Is this the first time she has flipped out and threatened divorce? I can’t imagine this being a one time thing. Are you having marital issues otherwise? Perhaps she is looking for an easy “out” for some reason? 

Because this isn’t your fault. Kids have fun and break bones. It isn’t the worst thing in the world. Her reaction is unnecessary. "
This isn’t agreeing to disagree. This is showing he isn’t willing to make any sacrifices in the event of a tragedy because he values his freedom more than the well-being of his niblings. 
Unfortunately that's not how it always works though. My (super Catholic conservative) mom's best friend from college is a gay dude. She still thinks he's going to hell and shouldn't date or get married. Some people are so far down the rabbit hole they'd rather double down on their prejudice than check themselves.

"&gt;I cant really grasp how someone with an abusive childhood can come out of it unscathed

Honestly? You can't *really*, but if you leave early enough and cut out the abusive parts, you are actually doing more than full fledged adults are sometimes not capable of. Just the act of changing your situation at such a young age, when abuse is involved especially, can really reinforce that you have power in your own life. Which is what abused children lack. It's quite empowering, and stays with you. "
"Though try to say it in a less aggressive way. You don't want her to think that you're not on her side, just that you think she's being a bit jealous."
"dude, she kinda sucks...maybe she said something she didn't mean out of anger but I really think this is more than enough cause for you to look back over your relationship and see if outbursts like that are the exception or the norm."
This relationship definitely sounds normal. Boys at the age are typically reserved and going through middle school. They’re not interested in bonding with their dad’s girlfriend. 
"Your son deserves a life where he believes in love and trust and not settling. He deserves to grow up with a Mum who is happy and sets a great example for him that you take happiness wherever you can and don’t put up with shitty behaviour . If it is your son that is holding you back you will only cause him harm if you stay because you are his role model right now and I am sure you don’t want him to grow up thinking tensions and crying and mistrust is normal , or to believe that women are interchangeable and not of equal value to him. Your husband is setting a bad example for his son, do want him to grow up that way ? "
That’s why his sister asked. To give him an option...
"I know, I was just thinking my username is so appropriate here! 
But you are talking about insults about people you actually like and we have no reason to suppose that SIL actually likes OP’s kids, nor is she obligated to like them. She was making a private comment so while it is regrettable she was overheard, I’m really not sure why it’s anyone’s place to judge what kind of private jokes are appropriate with ones spouse. I have heard my childfree friends call kids far worse things than gremlins, by the way! 
"
"So if you overheard someone saying this about you, you wouldn't feel more negatively about them and maybe reassess how much time you're spending with them?"
"If your uncle believes in life after death, then he could reasonably feel bound to his promise even after your aunt died. Feeling angry while grieving is common, and it's often misdirected. That seems to be the case here, in my opinion.


More importantly, your family is creating a problem where none exists. They can still grieve. They can still hold a memorial against your aunt's wishes if that's what they feel they need. Get an enlarged photo printed and framed as a substitute for a body or ashes. Remains are not your aunt, they're only symbols of who she was, and it is possible to grieve without them.


Good luck to your family. I hope you can all patch it up with Tom.

"I think it’s relevant insofar as it shows the GF isn’t just suffering a momentary personality lapse due to excessive disappointment; she sounds like an all-around snob and a petty one at that. You could *maaaaybe* come back from the former, but when you factor in the latter it becomes a case of “dude, she doesn’t even sound like a nice person. Time to walk.”"
"Very possible! Don’t worry about it- if your girlfriend wanted to see other people, she would do that in America. Now, of course I don’t know either of you but sure it is POSSIBLE anyone could be unfaithful. Wouldn’t you rather find out she doesn’t want to be with you now/abroad instead of when she learns she needs more independence 5 years from now?

I think your friends are being very judgmental, and based on their talking about this behind your back AND confronting you on this- it seems like they are the ones who lack maturity. 

In my opinion, everything will be fine! Long distance has their own challenges in every relationship, but navigating pets, moving in together, dating long term all have their own challenges you’ve overcame also! Just make sure you are both communicating your needs (for example, when I’m long distance my significant other and I always make a commitment to text each other goodnight even if the other person is sleeping/busy/can’t respond etc.. for some routine which really helps)"
"Your mom goes 3 weeks without speaking to her own sister?  If that is the case, then they were clearly not close and she has no right to complain. "
"Just based on what I'm reading here, yes you are being really irrational. Just because they are muslim and religious doesn't mean they are going to kill you.  They have been in the US for twenty five years without killing anyone.  You'll be fine."
"I'd call it a yellow flag. Maybe he considers your inexperience a plus because he's insecure about his sexual prowess and doesn't have to worry about measuring up to other guys with you. Or maybe he's the kind of creep who fetishizes virginity because it lets him imagine his dick is powerful enough to fundamentally change who a woman is.

I'd keep my eyes open for signs of controlling behavior or indications that he sees you as lesser-than outside of the bedroom. If this is part of a larger pattern, then it's time to worry. "
"The point is she was having a private conversation with her partner. We all at times disparage others in private conversations with our SO or say things that would be hurtful or angering to others if overheard. That’s called being human and honest, not rude. The only thing SIL did wrong here is not being more careful not to be overheard.

I’m not really sure what “calling out” (whatever that means I. This context) SIL and her brother would achieve for OP. She heard what she heard. Sure, she can confront them about it and probably get some awkward half-hearted apology or reassurance or justification, but she already knows they don’t like her kids, what she overheard was just proof of that. They are not obligated to like her kids and confronting them won’t change their sentiments. In fact, pressing them on this could just lead to more hurt feelings for OP if they say other things she doesn’t enjoy hearing. 

What would I do if I overheard someone say something about me that I found hurtful? I would recognise that I had gotten a true and authentic insight on how that person really feels and what they really think of me. Then I would assess how to react - if what they said about me had a ring of truth I would try to address that about myself. If I thought it was such an awful comment that I couldn’t get past it, I might not interact with them anymore. What I would *not* do is confront them - what would that achieve. People are entitled to feel how they feel about others and sometimes one overhears things they don’t like, that’s life."
"You should break up - not because of the insistence on therapy, but because she used the term ""people like you"" and is too immature to express her real issues (she thinks you're late too often, she wants to clean more) with her actual words so she uses your past against you. You said she's your stereotypical white hipster liberal and let me tell you, from experience these types of women are 10:1 the most condescendingly racist out there because they feel that they're ""helping the poor oppressed poc"" and as a result they fall back on hurtful stereotypes while talking over the people they claim to want to help in their pursuit for accolades for being ~super enlightened~. You should sit down and truly evaluate her behavior and see if it's true concern or if she falls into the category I mentioned."
"Yeah my ex husband tried to use my childhood against me all the time and acted as if he ""rescued"" me from it and then was supposed to be grateful to him for marrying me because otherwise I would be ""living like the rest of my family.""   In reality I had been away from them for 8 years before I married him. I thought he married me because he loved me but he acted like he had done me a favor and tried to control me.  When I wanted a divorce he said ""of course you do.  It's in your blood.  I should have known you couldn't hold a marriage together because of how you grew up"".  That made me stay longer than i should have, but the day I left was another huge victory in my life.   I have now been a divorced single mom for 10 years, mainly because I didn't want to screw up my kids' lives by dealing with a bad step parent and just never have met the right one.  They are adults now.  I may be single forever, maybe not.  But I sure won't be with someone where there is no mutual respect.  "
"This is awesome. Victims of controlling situations can sometimes lose their own voice, start helping her find hers. She's so used to having someone else's opinion control her, she might not even think of her own anymore. "
"How is it foisting responsibility on to someone else when the sister is trying to set up a contingency plan in case she and her husband DIE? Isn’t asking someone to take care of your children after you in fact more responsible than not setting up a plan?


&gt;I think it's wrong to have children, and then expect others to take care of them.


This is in case the parents are dead, it isn’t just abandoning them or their responsibilities. "
"For me (and this may not be what the OP feels, but perhaps it could be as well, so I'll say it anyway) posing this question to me would be like those ""your relative is standing on the train tracks and a train is barrelling towards them, you can divert the train and save them but doing so will kill 2 people standing on the alternate path"" scenarios. I personally am not psychologically equipped to care for children, and certainly not financially for the near future. I know this about myself. I also know that in any given freak scenario it would tear me apart and crush my conscience to say no. But I might have to, just from a sense of self-preservation. I honestly don't know what I'd do. 

Maybe OP's just a little more decisive than I. I don't get the feeling that he doesn't love these kids. At the same time, I can absolutely understand why one would refuse such an enormous responsibility. "
True
The “childfree” movement is a perfectly valid way to live a life. Give me a break. There are so many sexist and heteronormative ideas entrenched in the idea that we must all have children or else we have no worth. 🙄
"I think there is a massive difference between being a posturing defender-hulk stereotype and using your power to defend the powerless. This looks like a lot of different things. If you're a white person and you see someone harassing a black person, you pull out your phone and tell them you're filming. If you're a Christian and you see someone harassing a Muslim, you get between them and stop it. If you're a man and you see someone harassing a woman, you tell them to leave them alone."
"From what you've described both your parents make good points.  Some of the things you talked about are legitimate problems.  Others sound like he doesn't do things the way you would have - which is the necessarily a bad thing.

Let it go before your insecurity drives the relationship off a cliff. "
"You're having to realize that the person he is now, is not who you used to think he was. You would not have married him if you had foreseen these were parts of his personality. Those pieces of him *existed before you got with him though*. You feel like this is your fault, but mental instability happens in a lot of people. It's often genetic. Be happy you didn't have children with this guy. For what to do? Continue no contact with him. Then, find every single thing you have to be grateful for and thankful for, and meditate on those. When you have a negative thought pop up - replace it consciously with a positive one. Even if it feels forced at first, do it until it becomes  a habit. He is the one responsible for his choices, not you, and on a main level you know this. You're now having to understand that he is not who you thought he was. Is it easier to blame yourself than to accept your own perceptions were skewed back then? When we're young it's so easy to be blinded by people. It's so easy for our bigger mental health issues to not show up until we're older as well. But none of this is your fault. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

My sentiments exactly! That life sounds so dull. 
"People don't normally react that way to a simple question, you're right. So how did you ask the question? What words did you use? What was your tone like?"
So what work is she doing then? Is she talking to a counselor? Did she go to Al-Anon?
"I think you're incredibly brave for dumping his sorry ass. I'm in a similar predicament as you, with the depression and being cheated on, but the only difference is I've got a stupidly soft heart; I'm still in the relationship because he cried and begged a thousand times. So here's my advice for you: don't listen to whatever he has to say. Burn those bridges. Turn to your friends and family for solace and happiness, and listen to your head. Focus on yourself! You're going to be a much happier person without that filth.

Edit: if I were you and still had access to that email, I'd take pictures of it or forward it to myself. Then put it on Facebook and watch the fire lol."
"Oh, I'm sorry, I wasnt questioning your dating habits. I was more curious about what amount of sex a women has to implicitly be possibly having before it's okay to strangle her.

For what it's worth, you didn't deserve to be attacked, and there is no amount of sex you can have that would have justified it either. You could have been riding a train of dicks up and down town and not 'incited' or 'deserved' a violent assault, and it's scary there are people who think otherwise.

And unrelated to that attack, I think maybe you need to consider if doing the same thing you've been doing for four years is going to get you a different result now than it has before. The hard thing is that there is no advice anyone here can give you to make your son talk to you. If there was a way to do that, you already would have found it.

Have you ever considered stopping for a while and putting the onus of initiating contact on him? It would at least be something different than what you've already tried."
Is it really something that needs to bother you or are you being picky? She enjoys learning about her heritage. It’s a fun hobby. 
"Welcome to the problems that seemingly 99% of non-monogamous people run into.

You're 21 -- I'd end the relationship and go have fun for a bit.

"There are lots of different positions and seats she could run for that are not a RIGHT NOW proposition. I am getting from your post that the timing is the issue, not the ambition. I would make sure she knows that. Plus these things come up every four years!

Getting into the public realm is something that needs to be seriously reflected on for a long time. It is tough, stressful and puts her and her family in the limelight.

I would strongly suggest she gets involved in the local realm first which is a little less onerous and is closer to home. She can even join committees etc for your local municipality that don't require being elected. That way she can get a real taste for what the public life really is before she makes a huge leap to the state level. She can also work to make contacts that could help her in the next run.  "
"You guys are not compatible. Like when someone is awesome, but they want kids and you don't or when someone is the best but straight nd you're gay. It just doesn't work. It leads to unhappiness and resentment. Get out before you end up hating him. "

"No mate, women still menstruate today and imo that rule still stands. I don't ask anyone to bring me stuff from my bag in case they get the wrong section and a handful of tampons.

Edit: That said, OP's gf's reaction is odd, hurtful and OTT."
Then she can decide which she dislikes more. Saying no or sleeping alone she doesn't have a 3rd option. Your really making this out to be a bigger problem then it is

"That really is interesting to hear recovery programs don't recommend dating during the process. And your whole message was really well put, and gave me a lot to think about. Thank you.

I guess I always saw my recovery as something I had to do alone (My family asked me why I was getting fat when I got above 100 lbs, and I didn't feel comfortable opening up to my friends until very recently)

So I never thought much about how my lifestyle changes interacted with my relationships with others. 

But looking back on the people who were attracted to me when I was underweight (Including my boyfriend now, I suppose) is a little disturbing because I can't imagine how someone could see a sickly looking gal as hot.

(Sorry if this is all over the place, im a little tipsy and emotional tonight haha)"
"Omg your comment literally made me tear up a little. 

First things first, super proud of you about all the hard work you made towards recovery. 

As for my issues, I guess it's hard for me to really tell myself i deserve better. I've been dealing with shit on my own for this whole time, Ive got a kinda crappy mindset of ""I got myself into this mess, I gotta get myself out""

But seeing my friends I confided in, and strangers on the internet, being more supportive of me than my own fucking boyfriend... That hurts "

"My divorce was the worse thing I ever been through, but given enough time, yep I got over it.  I was married 8 years, she was my whole world.  It took time, there is no easy fix.

"You’d think after 5 years he would respect her dreams and what may be best for her career. Conventional wisdom says that the woman should take the backseat to the man’s aspirations.  

She shouldn’t rush to accept because she has until the deadline. I don’t think anyone will care whether she waits until then. However, if the bf isn’t willing to help plan, I don’t know what else she is supposed to do? I highly doubt that they’re going to have a level-headed discussion right at the deadline when he thinks she is selfish. "
"Let me repeat myself again. Tell her straight to her face, ""I'm not interested in sleeping with you."" ""I don't want to sleep with you."" Be straightforward. You can be straightforward with your friends. Plus, she isn't really a good friend if she's pressuring you for years and literally ignoring what you tell her. You are not being rude. So, saying something like ""I'm going for the no-fap challenge"" is completely pointless and is *not* direct. You're 31. I'm sure you can communicate with your friends at this point. You can do this."

"Your story makes it sound like he only proposed because you got pregnant and had a rushed wedding to make sure you were married before the baby came. In fact, it sounds like the only reason you are even Facebook friends is because you got pregnant.


And his parents approval obviously means something to him.  He didn't friend you on Facebook because he was worried about what his parents think.  He lied about why you came to texas because of what his parents think.  If his parents views weren't important to him, and he was secure enough to be himself, he wouldnt be monitoring who he friended on Facebook"

"Your mother hasn’t apologised to Martha? The fuck? If she’s not contrite in any way she has no business being at the wedding, and you are being a crappy partner for trying to vouch for your rude, unapologetic mother. Giving her an invite is giving her your tacit approval to be horrible to your spouse. 

If your fiancée came on here and told her side of the story, she would be advised not to marry someone so spineless. You don’t have her back. 

Tell your mother that unless she makes a full and sincere apology, she will not be invited. And make sure she knows this is *your* decision."
"He is pathetic. Not a single dude I've ever dated has ever even done this to me, let alone try to convince me it's normal, or turn try to tell me *I'm* pathetic for having normal boundaries....and I've dated some jerks. Calling *you* pathetic over this is him pathetically trying to gaslight you.

Your BF is a dud if I ever saw one. "

"Divorce, you made an innocent mistake, sure it was hurtful to Shantelle, but that doesn't give her the right to assault you.

Oh, and call the police and file a report."

from the way you write about carol here its very clear shes is not a good friend and you were right to end the friendship. i guess my only question is: has she always been controlling/jealous/unsupportive or this is a new thing? it's possible she's going through something you dont even realize. but that doesnt excuse her behavior

and make no mistake when she finds out you signed the lease she will be PISSED. but that doesnt mean it was the wrong decision and the sooner you tell her the sooner the unpleasantness will be over with. just be careful when/if mark has her over the apartment. could get awkward"
"What awful people.   Why should you put up with that?  I'd never see them.   And they'd never see the baby.   If that's how they act, you'd honestly be doing baby a favor.

Or, if they insist on you - an adult woman married to their son - calling them ""Mr XXXX"" or ""Mrs XXXX"" then you should absolutely insist on their referring to you formally as well.   

Even better, make them call the baby ""Mr Baby"" or ""Miss Baby"".  No - even better: *""Ms. Baby""*.

"Right??? Known each other for seven years, video chatting and calling every night, then after she tells him how she feels he makes sure to assure her that he wants to continue a relationship with her and wants to remain close. I would have been feeling a bit confused when I was 20 too, whether the object of my affections was 17 or 27. 

This situation is hard to deal with from both sides but I don't see any reason to think the girl is crazy or anything.  I think OP probably needs to just cut her out if he doesn't want what she wants, not reassure her that he loves her etc etc etc. They're both young and immature and this is the kind of high drama situation many of us go through at that kind of age"

"I wouldn’t want to be with someone who’s first instinct in that situation isn’t to rush to my aid. If I get to pick ONE person to be with why not pick someone who’s going to have my back?

As I get older, I become less picky with physical traits and more picky with character traits. I used to be able to ignore a lot for a very attractive partner with whom I had great chemistry, but not anymore. For a long term relationship, a good and kind person is priority #1. I’d leave him. 

Up to you to set your priorities though, and obviously I don’t have all the information and context. "
"OP if this relationship is affecting your mental and physical health you need to get out, it's becoming toxic and suffocating for you. A relationship should enhance your life, not make life harder and less enjoyable. This guy doesn't sound right for you, you don't have the same values anymore. "
The existence of a purity ring suggests that she was exposed to some anti-sex religious views at some point. Those rings aren't part of secular culture or even mainstream Christian culture. 
It would be sexualharassment if she persisted after being asked to stop.

"Dude you failed. That's why she broke up with you. Coddling her? What the fuck, are you her dad? Good on her for getting away."
"Wow. Usually they wait until after the pregnancy and kid to start behaving this way. Somehow he's actually trapped you by being a jerk and promising better after kids.

This is who he is. He is not behaving this way because you don't have kids. And if he's this bad now, he will be worse after kids. Guaranteed. Do you even want a guy who behaves this way to be a model for your children?

Your husband treats you like shit because he wants to. Not because you haven't had kids. I really hope you rethink this relationship, and keep your bc up to date and close. "
"My ex was abusive, and one of her things was being very sarcastic and rude to me, constantly commenting on my personality or looks. I tried telling her what she did hurt me, and i wanted her to stop. She claimed that what i was asking of her was too much, that she cannot change her personality (and asking her to do that was abusive) and that i needed to stop being so sensitive. 

What your girlfriend is doing is gaslighting, plain and simple. I went through it. Relationships take work, and if she isn't willing to change and grow with you then she doesn't deserve to be with you on your journey. 

I guess this is because I'm biased, because I have gone through similar issues and it raises many many red flags for me, but I think trying to calmly put your foot down. Explain how she's hurt you, and how you need to talk this out.

Couples therapy is never a bad idea. Me and my fiancee are in couple's therapy as well as individual therapy. It helps TREMENDOUSLY and we've gotten closer and worked through a lot of issues this way."
"She is on a business trip! It is common to network and people lose track of time. 

You said you are not freaking out but you are. No one can tell you if she is cheating or not. It is about trust. She only went on a single date with another girl when you two weren't exclusive. You still hold it against her? How long you are going hold your grudge?

I think you need to work on your trust issue. So far I don't see her doing anything wrong and you can't control what she does when she's isn't around you. 

Yeah, this is life. You have to trust your partner more. If she cheats, she cheats. If she is faithful, then she is faithful."
"&gt;“That’s not a choice I have to make at this point, and we have a great life so of course I’m glad we have what we have.” This sounds to me like the answer is “yes.”

"Dude, you're jelaous of a DEAD PERSON, this guy can't take your girl or do anything, at all. So if i were you i would just let her use it because of why not."
"Yes I have, this happened before with my niece and her mom's boyfriend and her mom assumed the boyfriend was a pervert so I kind of warned my boyfriend to be careful with that because her mom tends to jump to conclusions and I didn't want her to think anything of him... I'm not sure if telling him that changed his behaviors though. He explained that he truly does just get random boners and that it has nothing to do with her. Which I believed because like I said it's happened before at truly random times "
"No where does it say that the boner was BECAUSE OF THE BABY.  Geez - the guy gets boners easily.  When I was younger that would happen sometimes just thinking about what I would get up to w/ my GF later that night -- regardless of the situation I was in at the time.

It probably was from him rubbing your back, like he said.  Although, it could also have been the sight of you holding a baby stirred some hard-wired trigger in his brain for procreation.  I went through a phase when I suddenly started finding pregnant women super attractive, and I think that was a ""biological clock"" bc it passed (to some extent) after I had my son.

Guys can't control when they get boners, don't hold that against your boyfriend.

I have no clue what to do about your neice, beyond maybe having a talk w/ her about not getting to handsy w/ him?"
"This is abusive and controlling. He just punished you, woman. Listen to our advice. Go. It always gets worse AND you don't need your child to get their ideas on how a woman or man should act from the 2 of you... like this.  Get outta there. "
"Really? You read all that and THAT'S what you take away from the post? That I fucked up one timeline? Obviously I read the post. 

I made the edit. Now can you see any value in what I've written?"
"&gt;You made a promise to her in front of your loved ones and god himself to try. Since then you have put yourself first at all times and seemingly haven’t tried at all.

Yes. This, this, this, this, this. So well said."
"Time to get a new new boyfriend. You know, from your past history, that your meter for what is ok may be a little off. (New boyfriend is better than old boyfriend, but is he really ""good"" or is he just less bad?)
My suggestion would be to provide the opportunity for him to course correct (hey, boyfriend, you don't get to tell me how to live, or tell my housemates how to be. so stop) if he doesn't stop, it's a very very reasonable time to end it. This type of controlling behavior seems to be a red flag - as his time with you increases, his feelings of what he gets to control about you are increasing too?

Now it is possible that he just doesn't realize his griping about your household situation is coming off as controlling and not caring, and by giving him the opportunity to shut the fuck up, you are being generous, but you also can end it."
"Seconding the sentiment to not bother talking to him, OP. It's a waste of breath, but worse, he'll probably just tell you what you want to hear in order to placate you and keep you there. 

He might respond with some type of emotional abuse, but it's likely he'll say he's sorry (he's not) and that he'll change (he won't). 

Just put your time and energy into figuring out how to get you and your child out of there."

"Try to think of it from your wife's perspective, rather than just your own.

Her husband spends 8+ hours a day with another woman that has become known as his ""work wife"" (which is a stupid term in the first place). You're eating lunch with your other ""wife"" often. You're texting with your other ""wife"" about things that don't involve work. You have a relationship with another woman outside of work.

I think a big thing that needs to be addressed is whether or not **YOU** are calling this woman your ""work wife"". If so, you need to cut that shit out now and have some respect for your actual wife.

Additionally, I think the fact that you're more worried about your work relationships  than your wife's feelings is pretty sad. I honestly feel bad for your wife. That's a pretty low blow and you should seriously take a look in the mirror and consider where your priorities are. I couldn't ever imagine putting any other persons feelings, aside from my child, over my wife's, especially someone at work. 

Finally, it's fine if you don't see a problem with it, or don't think it's inappropriate, but that doesn't mean you get to decide what your wife finds inappropriate. She is entitled to her feelings and is allowed to set up reasonable boundaries, which her request is, so don't be surprised if there are consequences."

"There is literally no ideal way to do this. Break up with her. Be honest and as kind as possible. Give her some time to get her situation together and leave the apartment--two weeks, maybe more. Possibly plan on staying nights at a friend's house if you can while she's still in the apartment.

Chances are she will want to get out immediately so it won't be a big deal, but it's going to be super awkward if you are both still trying to live in the apartment, so don't."
TIL water is wet and boiling water is hot.
"Well, I guess that worked, but it seems a little harsh.  Again, this was a child who has very likely been sexually abused in some way, if only in being exposed to her mother's sexual activity.

You're dealing with a damaged child here, not some chick on the next barstool."
"Like any government job, once you do a certain amount of time it gets really difficult to fire someone.  That being said, your record is still your record.  If you're at a point where you are calling your customers dumb, or other derogatory remarks... I'd hope someone would muster up some stones and send the ol' bag home.  Though, 6 months from retirement means she's done some time and the higher-ups, like her boss, are just trying to get her out of there ""peacefully""."
"Your bf needs to learn this, and understand it for what it truly means:

**Wanting true freedom of speech means accepting all of the consequences of speaking freely**

So tell him that he's welcome to speak about his ideas as often as he likes, but you strongly disagree and him voicing those opinions hurts you.

He can either choose to moderate his speech or he can choose to accept that he is hurting you.

He doesn't get to say ""Hey, I feel like my ability to just say whatever I want is more important than whether or not the things I'm saying are really hurtful to you, so could you just never let me know that I'm hurting you, or stop having feelings, so I don't have to be at all considerate, please?""

That's not how this works.

It's an important life lesson (and frankly I'm a little shocked that he's gotten this far in life without learning it) that the things you say and do have consequences. That the ideas and opinions that your boyfriend is so proud of having strong feelings about actually do affect the real lives and the real feelings of other human beings.

I mean, it's nice for him that he has all these lofty ideas about religious dress and whatnot, but at the end of the day he can talk all he wants and throw those opinions around, but when he's done he gets to go home and get on with his life, because they don't actually affect **him** at all. He isn't being philosophical. He's speaking out about issues that have a real impact on people's lives, *but not actually on his own life*. 

Right up until it comes to you.

So it's unsurprising that he's finding the consequences of his theories and ideas uncomfortable. Because he is really just playing at having theories and ideas. He doesn't want them to actually have a real impact on his life, and it's much more comfortable to have strong opinions on something when it really doesn't make any difference to you either way.

Tell him. What he's experiencing is a direct consequence of his words and actions. If he is finding the consequences uncomfortable, maybe he should more closely examine his own words and actions."
"It doesn't matter how ""nicely"" you do it, she will still act like that. *You* have to learn to stop feeling guilty (even though she guilts you) over having normal adult boundaries and living your own life. She's 54. For at least 44 years sues been getting her way by acting like this, so it's part of her now and will continue to be for the rest of her life. *She will not change or get the message no matter what you do*, so you have to change the way *you* react to her. 

I'd she calls you crying, hang up. If she starts with the whole ""oh I'm such a bad mother, guess I can't talk to you"", hang up. If she calls back, ignore it. If she shows up at your house, don't open the door. Tell her you will communicate with her again when she is done crying/acting like a victim. And follow through with that. 

I know it's hard because she's your mom and she is so pitiful, but you have to be strong and show her consequences for her actions. It's literally the only way. "

They should end things here, I think. "
"If you truly love the one you’re about to marry, that door should remain closed. "
"I mean, would you want someone to tell you that the photos you post aren't to their liking so you need to change them? Clearly she's happy with them. You need to keep your opinion to yourself unless she specifically asks for relevant feedback."
"You should not have tried to meet up with her, considering your state of mind and what-if's.

I think you two should get into premarital counseling ASAP.  It's a great place to talk through these kinds of concerns, but you HAVE to be honest about them.  If you can't be honest, you aren't ready to be married."
"Yes it's so ""generous"" for her dad to treat her lesser because she's a woman. I hate people who justify parental abuse. It's disgusting."
Erections can happen for a variety of reason. They aren't necessarily sexual. I get erections from pressure if something is in my lap a lot of times I get an erection. It could be a cardboard box it doesn't matter. It's not always sexual
"The example with the man at the car dealership: it wasn't even him who fucked up though, just the man who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time to take on this asshole's wrath. The man is acting like trash, and OP should be embarrassed to be seen with him. "
"Eh I still disagree. You've known your mom your whole life. I'm assuming your best friend for more than 2 or 3 years. 
 
It's just important to distinguish between infatuation and love. They typically happen together with romantic partners but they are not the same. Love really means you'll basically do anything for each other which I doubt he would for her. Which is good since he should love her yet. He can be infatutated, but not love."
"The first one! Maybe have a water bottle handy? For some reason, the act of drinking something gets rid of the built up feeling of needing to cry. It has something to do with my throat getting all stopped up when I need to cry? I really don’t know if it would work for other people, but it’s worth a try!"
She (potentially) wants to be your friend and that’s all. You don’t want to be her friend. Go ahead and send that message you were gonna send so she knows what your actual intentions are.

"Forget uninviting family, my girl didn't want my best friend to come to an event and I left her on the spot. I absolutely hate it when people force you to choose between things. Who was I going to choose? A girl I met not long ago or a guy I consider a brother. When I did that she got a reality check and came back running.

So choose your family."
Your mom is right: she is keeping you from your family. Do you think this relationship could end in marriage? Is she going to not let your family come to your own wedding too?
"She's not being a good friend to you at all. I can't imagine messing around my male friends like that, so selfish and rude.

I think you need to give her a bit of space to grow up. Enabling her isn't going to help anyone. Hopefully she'll be able to take a step back and realise her mistake."
I would just be honest and tell her you want a relationship and if she isn't really then we can't talk anymore. I've been through this before too.. Except I was the one that wasn't ready and once he told me that I thought I was really going to lose him so I just made myself ready and we've been together ever since almost a year. 
"Denial is a natural response to something we desperately wish wasn't true. However, facts and evidence care nothing for our feelings, and the fact is that your SO organized a secret hotel rendezvous with a man you know she has had feelings for, and the only reason she would do such a thing is so that she could have sex with him.

"This is a long shot, but worthwhile.

"&gt; he's just not sure if it can because I don't find the same happiness in his interest

This. This is why he's not prioritizing your relationship. Because he's a selfish insane person.

Couples don't have to have identical interests. He just doesn't want to put in the effort to make this work so you're expected to mold yourself into his life and not vice versa."
"At 27 he is probably considered way overdue for marriage and children by his family. So try to find out their preferred timeline, and his timeline, for those things. Indian culture doesn't exactly have dating, typically people get engaged after knowing each other very briefly, his family probably has very little framework for understanding (or supporting) your relationship unless you get engaged very soon. 

What about religion? How would you raise children with regard to religion? If he's Hindu, that religion can seem very fluid and flexible to an outsider, but once married, and especially after having children, you might be under pressure to follow lots of unexpected rules. If he's Muslim or Sikh there are even more rules."
"I can't believe you are planning to pander to a guy who has cheated on you. Is he literally the only penis in the world? He's using you, and treating you like crap, and telling you not to hassle him, and you're going to ""cook his favorite meal""?  

Forget this.  You're wasting everyone's time. IF you want to play the sucker for him, play the sucker. He's using you.  "
"Your girlfriend does not have DID, it is extremely rare and she's botching her act embarrassingly. She doesn't have this disorder, she has a deep need for pittying or interested attention. What's she going to do in the future when she doesn't feel acknowledged enough?"
"also, dont suddenly become an asshole about it.

as a young male, i've found this is more difficult to do than one might expect. 

damn defense mechanisms..."
"Please don't go around telling guys women are only into confident men, it's not true and you'll only damage the confidence of less outgoing guys further."
"So she's in therapy but has not talked to her therapist about having multiple identities? She's so casual about talking about them with you, but never brings it up with the therapist? A hallmark of DID is that you don't really have control over who's in front at any given time, so that would imply either A) Simply by chance she's always the same person when she goes to therapy, a person that doesn't feel like talking about her identities, B) She isn't mentioning which identity she is and the therapist is terrible at their job and doesn't realize they're talking to someone with different feelings, characteristics, and possibly even memories or C) the therapist never sees the other identities because they don't exist.

I don't want to make a statement about whether or not DID exists here, that's above my pay grade, but I feel like it's likely it's a manifestation of her PTSD. Part of the idea of PTSD is that it's caused by something so traumatic that the brain can't process it in a normal way, so instead it can lay dormant for a while, then the exact same feelings from the event pop up at inconvenient times. So her PTSD may be manifesting in a way that makes it easier for her to ""switch"" identities, even though it's really just her putting on a mask for a little while, so it's not her that's dealing with the trauma, it's someone else who's currently buried in her psyche.

All this being said, it doesn't sound like there is much you can do, except encourage her to talk to her therapist, and probably go beyond regular therapy to someone with the prefix 'psycho' in their title. Someone who can analyze this deeper than just ""tell me how you feel today"". 

If she's not willing to do that, I don't see how you could possibly stay with her. Even if this is true, bona fide DID, it's still an evasive disorder that will prevent her from ever being able to truly engage with you, because as soon as things funky, she'll be somebody else and you'll be expected to just live with your emotions and wait for the host to come back around. It quickly becomes untenable to be in a relationship where your emotional state isn't being validated. It's a short road to depression because if you're not allowed to feel angry, upset, etc. you instead have to bury everything until you can no longer feel anything.

Encourage her to get real, serious help, and if she won't, get out of there before you end up traumatized too."
"I appreciate the rant! My family believes that being gay is a temptation or trial God puts in your life. Like being an alcoholic, you have to lean on God and resist temptation and live a celibate life... "
You repeatedly disrespected her. She’s totally justified in not being friends with you anymore. Leave her alone and learn a lesson from this.
"&gt; I want to make amends because we were planning on living together in the future.

I hate to say this, but as a woman, if I were considering moving in with 2 men who I considered friends and they started asking me weird sexual questions, I would immediately rethink that decision.

I'm not gonna lie, nothing you wrote here actually sounds that remorseful. You're trivializing her feelings by calling it a ""stupid incident,"" when obviously it really hurt her. If you want to apologize, make sure you do it correctly, and don't just try to make it go away. There's always the chance that K was sexually assaulted or bullied for being a virgin or not a virgin. Even if she wasn't, the only time you should be asking someone about their sexual history is if you plan on having sex with them."
"What it sounds like they're doing is volunteering through WWOOF: the worldwide organization of organic farmers. You live and eat for free in exchange for about 20 hours a week of work. 

Lots of people travel that way for long periods of time. I've travelled this way too, and I highly recommend it for anyone who is curious about farming, permaculture, homesteading, etc.

I don't think they're committing to a life long journey. They're in their early 20s going to travel around the country in a van. Sounds hella romantic. "
"The fact that you took the time to write this out and reflect further about the situation and still not find it weird is also very weird. But since it’s causing a conflict between your family, explain to them that it was all accidental and innocent, and hope they move on from it."

"Have you considered the possibility that having sex with someone who isn't really into it is, like, the biggest bummer? 

You say that your ex broke up with you because he ""got what he wanted."" If he was getting ""what he wanted,"" he would NOT have broken up with you. He broke up because he WASN""T getting what he wanted. I'm not trying to be harsh, or to say that it was your fault or that you should have some how done a better job of being what he wanted--I just want you to see that flaw in your own logic. 

Look, its not uncommon for people to put a ton of effort towards being the kind of person they *want* to be in the first few months of a relationship, and then crumble when they can't keep up the facade. Maybe he ""changed"" after you started having sex because he'd put it on a pedestal for months, and set himself up for a let-down. Maybe he got bored of being in a relationship (this happened to me a lot when I was around your age). Maybe the honeymoon period was over, and he started to notice other issues in the relationship that lead him to feel it wouldn't last long-term. It doesn't sound like you were happy either (you say you felt objectified). It doesn't sound like an ideal relationship. It sounds like it was good it ended.

Making the whole downfall an issue of sex, and how long you waited, is an oversimplification, and likely not accurate. It might FEEL like that's what happened--it's totally normal to look for an easy answer after a breakup. Breakups are *often* incredibly frustrating and disorienting, and it is *normal* to try and figure out what went wrong, and how you can avoid such a thing in the future. But I don't think that it's as simple as just waiting longer to have sex. I do think that you will likely be frustrated by how small your dating pool will become if you impose this artificial six-month boundary on sex. I do think that plenty of good men will not want to wait 6 months to figure out if you are sexually compatible. I'm a woman, and I'm not sure I would have stuck around had my husband been uninterested in having sex for the first six months we were dating--sex is a thing I enjoy, it's important to me, and I'm not interested in committing to someone before we've had the chance to test our sexual chemistry. I have dated wonderful men who I did not have great sexual chemistry with, and that was the sole reason those relationships fizzled out. "
"Agreed, just be gracious and accept her gifts"
"Because he’s chosen to spend the rest of his life with this person. That they are going to share a life together, maybe have children. They’ve agreed that they are important to one another. They are coming together as a unit where they promise to love and support one another in good and bad times. 

That’s a completely different level than a friendship. "
"Why do you want to talk to him more? Do you want a relationship?


I mean it's pretty obvious he just sees you as a fuckbuddy. Low maintenance is a mild way of describing someone who just comes over to fuck. "

If they're past the point of no return and they attempt to stop, it can be MORE dangerous since they are stopping too abruptly and run the risk of being rear-ended. The bigger question is did he go through the intersection when it was red? "

"You're going to have to explain your options a bit. 


It's been 2 weeks, obviously her parents know something is up. 


Is there a way of divorcing where you wouldn't tell anyone she cheated? "
So if you're that strong you should be fine to go to other schools. 
"Hm, I'm going to go against the grain here a little because I think the idea that your partner should 'not be emotionally bonded with everyone else, ever' is both unrealistic and kind of unfair. Though your relationship with each other should be special and sort of exist in a different sphere from your relationships with other people, those relationships /will/ and /can/ exist. 

It seems that many people on this forum, though usually just implied and not said outright, feel like men and women can't be friends. She's not OP's husband's 'friend', she's another woman which makes this a RED ALERT. That's silly, consider her how you would consider a friendship between men- now is the situation different? It probably shouldn't be. 

Since you respect both of these people and you're sure there's no cheating going on, it seems like they could just be developing a healthy friendship through a shared hobby- it's also likely that she's spending a lot of time with you both because she's new to the area. Do you spend a lot of one on one time with her? 

Since you are feeling this way, you do need to address your emotions- I think that you /should/ ask your husband how he feels about her, so you don't have to feel paranoid anymore. However, if he says she's just a friend, you have to find out why you were feeling envious. 

Is there perhaps another issue in your relationship that is making you feel insecure or unloved in any way? Maybe you're feeling jealous because there's an issue with you guys- you might potentially need to set aside some couple's time etc."
I can overlook the boundaries being crossed there because those are expensive. Thats dedication to get a whole basket. Bonus points for a rainbow of colours.
"&gt;  he has gotten physical with both me and my son in the past.

Your husband is a violent abuser.  He is not a good guy or a good father.  He does not have a normal relationship with his son.

You are subjecting your child to his abuser every second that you do NOT remove him from the home.  

GET OUT.  Your husband doesn't feel terrible, he's only worried he will get caught.  You have a duty to protect your son.  Start doing it."
"Clean freak here checking in. It’s extremely anxiety-inducing for me to have a dirty, cluttered space, so I think about how to keep it clean very often. 


First, let’s draw the line between “dirt” and “clutter.” Dirt is stuff like empty pizza boxes lying around, mold growing in toilet, liquids spilled on counter tops, grease lining the oven, dust, etc. This needs to be taken care of as a priority, and a weekly or monthly cleaner can really help with this. If this is your main problem, start with a deep-clean and then maintain. 


I suspect your problem lies more with clutter. Clutter is stuff of indeterminate usefulness taking up space. It becomes especially a problem when it’s 1. Not organized in a logical order and 2. Block hallways, closets, and areas to the point where you don’t know what’s behind it and can’t reach those things anymore. There is no point in having things if you can’t find them when you need them. 


Solution to clutter is two-fold: First you go through area by area and separate trash from objects worth keeping. This is the hardest part for a hoarder because their brain says “keep everything!” This is where your therapist can help you most. Do you know what items you have the hardest time getting rid of? For some people it’s old food containers, or paper documents from decades ago, or clothes that no longer fit, etc. What gives you the most clutter? 


Second step of dealing with clutter is organization. Think about where things are useful. Kitchen items should be in the kitchen. Bedroom items in bedroom. Drawers and boxes labeled with what’s in them. Tools all in the same place, etc. The main point is that if you or your husband need an item, each of you knows where to find it. 


Finally, there is maintenance. Best way is to make rules. If you see a cup outside kitchen and it’s been used, move it to the kitchen. If you see something out of place, put it where it “lives.” Each item in your place should have a “home.” At the end of the night, all items not in active use should be at home. 


I can give you more tips if you have specific questions, but hopefully that helps a bit! "
"There was also a strip club gift card in the basket that he left out of the OP. Granted, it was for a club 2500 miles away as an “inside joke,” but it’s a lot easier to paint his girlfriend as crazy if “it was just a basket of candy!!”"
"I think it is overdue. It was nice of you to give her that chance, but I think this relationship has run its course. Some people aren’t meant to be in your life forever. "
Yes I do live with parents. She was housesitting but was expected not be there today. 
"Your girlfriend was curious, sex-positive, and experimented in what seem to be safe environments. Just because she had many sexual partners and experiences in the past does not compromise her ability to form a meaningful relationship with you. So get over it. "
"It's a lot of other little things. Not being invited to some events. Arguments on Facebook (which thankfully she disabled recently), one of which started because my sister-in-law compared having a foster child taken away (they were fostering a little girl for about a year) to finding out a family member has a terminal illness. My girlfriend's dad passed away when she was 12 so that argument pissed her off. I don't think she'll ever forgive my sister-in-law for that comment. And it's not that I'm making excuses for her, I'm just trying to give more context to the situation and why, in her mind, she feels this way about my family."
"This is only the second time *that OP knows of.* From his reaction and inability to fess up before OP found out on her own, I'd say this has happened a **lot** more than two times."
"by all means, if you want to wait then you should, but you have hang ups regarding break ups that don’t have to do with sex.

sexual compatibility is important to me in a relationship so i have sex pretty fast most of the time. one time i decided to wait. take it slow. really slow. i think i was dating this guy for like 6-8 months before we had sex the first time, and it was terrible.

after that, in a neutral setting, i attempted to have a conversation with him about the experience and explain what i like. he was completely unreceptive to my interests and was not willing to have a further conversation about it, or take part in anything i expressed interest in (and it was nothing too wild). that’s his right, but ultimately we just broke up in that same conversation because i realized the relationship had hit a dead end as far as i was concerned. it was a long time to wait only to find out the relationship was never going to progress further when i could have come to the same realization a month into it.

do what you want and what makes you comfortable, but not everything is as good an idea in practice as it seems in theory."
"You can wait as long as you want to wait to have sex for whatever reason.

However, I think you might be misguided on this one. Your association that he left you because he got sex and then decided to leave is very likely incorrect. There was much more likely some type of incompatibility or some other reason that made a long term relationship seem unlikely from his perspective.

You *should* wait to have sex with someone until you are comfortable. But setting a 6 month time line specifically makes no sense. There's no real rhyme or reason to it.

For many people sexual compatibility is a big deal. So many may choose not to pursue you because having to wait an arbitrary amount of time so that they can pass a ""test"" to see whether they might leave you is pretty unappealing.

Basically wait to have sex *until you are comfortable*. Period. This waiting period makes no real sense"
"After reading your comments I just have to say that you should not be trying to get in a relationship at all until you sort out your own views and feelings. People commenting here are really far to ""kind"" with their answers, probably just trying to get some easy karma for being nice. 

To answer your questions. 

&gt; I brought this up in conversation and my friend says I’m doomed and that no guy will put up with waiting 6 months. Is this true? Is my friend correct? Will I suffer from finding a boyfriend because I’m abstaining sex for 6 months?

My personal belief is that probably 95% wouldn't be bothered to wait that long, and 6 months is extremely long by todays standards. You are definitely allowed to do whatever you will though. I do however think that the only guys who will stick around for that long is either truly desperate or religious. You WILL miss out on decent men. 

I would probably never wait for 6 months just to get a chance at a relationship with a girl. Most likely she just isn't worth the wait. If the sexual chemistry isn't there after 3 dates, why are you even dating? 

Let me ask you this, do you think you are worth waiting 6 months for? I certainly don't think I'm worth a 6 months wait for sex. It's simply not worth it in terms of the risk you take. There are so many other options available. Why would you go for the person who has this absurd rule of waiting 6 months, it's like you want to open a can of worms."
How do you know this? Because literally anyone with a decent amount of sexual experience will tell you it's absolutely not true.

"You have been together eight years and are talking about marriage and kids. You are going to break her heart.

But you also have to understand that the longer you wait to do this the worse it will be. And more time she will have lost that she could have been working on recovering and moving on. Your reasons for wanting to leave her aren't morally wrong, but leading her on while you lie about the future you want with her and have sex with prostitutes is. Every day you keep this from her is another day you are wronging and hurting her worse. 

You just need to rip of the bandaid. It's going to suck. But you know it's the right thing to do and needs to be done. "
"It happens. I know a married couple who met when he came into the strip club she danced at. Proceed with the caution all new relationships require, but it's kinda douchey and weird to automatically assume she is some kind of weird, cheap, ineffectual prostitute based on what you've said.

You clearly love the guy, your heartbreak is obvious. I'm so sorry all of this happened to you, and I'm sorry to be blunt - but this guy is a dirtbag. You are worth more than that. Cut your losses, drop ALL of his friends, and move on. Even if you're pregnant. That's a whole other issue you unfortunately have to deal with on your own.

"The details here would matter, because one would fit into that 'first single screwup' you mentioned, and the other is a prolonged pattern of behavior that he was invested in, and that he thought through and worked at lying to you about over a period of time.

I think you sound naive, trusting, and very easy to take advantage of. This man has proven that he has no problem with taking advantage of you, too. Remember that he did not come clean out of remorse; he only came clean because he *needed* to, under threat from the other woman.

"“What are you implying?”


“Why are you asking me all these questions?”


“Why are you staring at me like that?”


“I feel really uncomfortable, what exactly is the problem?”


“Please don’t stare at me/stand so close.”"
So what did his ex wife do that made you judge her? You had plenty of nasty things to say about her in the post and in comments lol
"I try to tell her that all the time. It's getting less nice. I don't want to keep fighting with my family all the time, but again and again I tell her she's just enabling him. 

I know I should back away and say this isn't my circus and these aren't my monkeys, but I do love my brother. 

It's really hard to sit back and just let him turn out to be a loser at best. I know she's still sort of trying, but in her heart of hearts she's given up on him. "
"Omg. This is so close. And describes my younger self. If something was ruined, I'd be pissed about everything and could not let it go. Luckily it was when I was 16-23. I've grown up since then. I just wanted to be mad.  "
"I lived in the fat activism world since my late teens. I won’t Question your credentials as a healthcare provider but I can tell you with 100% certainty that your version of HAES is not the one practiced on the streets.  You know what happened when I was diagnosed as a food addict?  My former fat activist friends came out of the absolute would work to tell me that food addiction is not real. Do you know what happen with my girlfriend when she lost weight? Our former HAES friend started showing up at our house with pizza, buffalo wings and gallon jugs of soda— all her trigger foods. It wasn’t until she basically drop them as friends that they stopped and then they started blogging about her of all things and it wasn’t friendly as if they were happy for her or watching her making a change was a good thing. No they’re all Thinley veiled insults she was a traitor to the  The cause. I’m sorry but I wasted most of my 20s on HAES and fat activism and I can tell you from the inside it is nothing more than a cult of people don’t want to see anyone else change. since you are health provider I strongly urge you to look into it and see the motivations behindp the people that pedal things like those health cards that you present to Doctor‘s.

I mean that's all fine. It doesn't justify her taking a trip to Jamaica with her new fuck buddy while she's still engaged.

"Used to work in the lingerie department of a popular clothing store, and we heard (and saw) it all without blinking an eye. Promise you none of the clerks there would think something like that was any big deal, certainly nothing we'd care to remember a week later.

"The next time he threatens suicide, call 911.  He needs to be hospitalized.  You can't ""handle"" his depression.  HE has to and he refuses to get help for it.  Next time he threatens suicide, you drop what you are doing and you call 911 and you get him that help.  

OP, you are smarter than this or you wouldn't have bothered to write any of this out.  WTF are you doing with this guy."
"You sound like a nightmare to deal with. Amy doesn't sound like a peach either, but the way you describe yourself makes me think you're very difficult to get along with. If you don't think you can be civil, and not ruin the trip for everyone else, then don't go. It sounds like you won't be able to maintain your composure for several days straight, so I suggest you back out."
"Why is it your job to sort out things *he* puts in the laundry? If my wife puts something in with the laundry and didn't want it washed well - oops? It's not my job to go through her clothes and try to decide if she *really* wanted them to be washed or not.

I do all the laundry for us and I am happy to do so - but if you put an item in the laundry *it's going to get washed*. That is the whole entire point. You don't want it washed *don't put it in with the laundry*. This is super simple stuff and he's a massive piece of babyshit if he thinks he's entitled to ask you go through all the dirty clothes piece by piece in case his dumb ass accidentally tossed a sock in there. He needs to take some personal responsibility for his own life choices."
"Go to Walmart, get him a separate hamper, apologize and tell him you have come up with a foolproof solution. You won’t be doing his laundry any more. You don’t want to risk another incident that is apparently unforgivable."

You're making excuses for him. Please listen to what other people are saying. That is not cool.
"I was in a relationship like this and it was a serious red flag. Be very firm that you’re no longer going to accept his behavior. Sometimes you have to face conflict and that’s too bad, but put your foot down now or this will always be acceptable treatment towards you"

"Your brother did this to himself. She was doing what she could to protect herself. Once he pulled the trigger there was nothing else she could do. They weren’t together. He wasn’t her concern anymore. 

Again, you don’t even know if this baby is his. A baby wouldn’t have saved him. Your brother had some issues and they ran deep. It’s not his fault. 

This is also not her fault. You need to get into therapy and stop pointing the blame at this poor girl. "
"Strong no. Not only is it illegal, it's also going to complicate your own life. What if you meet someone yourself and they discover you are already technically married? It's just too much sacrifice. Don't sell yourself like this."
This comment is so passive aggressive and gross. Get out of here with that bullshit 
Don't do it :). It is illegal. The consequences far outweighs the little reward you are receiving. I'm fairly familiar with the process. It takes years and will take a toll on you. Side note: people I know who do this pay up to $50-$100k (you getting ripped off)
"Eh, my guess is she was curious. Maybe she had an insecure moment, wanted to see if there was anything being hidden, or just let her curiosity get the better of her to see what you had stashed because you know, after 3 years of being with you has never been in this major personal space that is where you sleep. 

The lying is not cool, but she probably felt really caught out and was scared of  how youd react to the truth. 

Heck though you've got me curious. 3 years and she hasn't been in your room?"

"This is not a communication problem.  And you cannot get him to hear or understand you.  This is because he is abusive, not a bad communicator.  He shows all the classic signs of a controlling, emotional abuser.  Please read up on loveisrespect and go through their resources.  You will never get him to change, because he does these things on purpose, to hold you down and make you cut off from other people."
"I hope that there are sex - positive therapists near you that could help with this (if you've not already found one).

My instinct is to say that you've only just got married - it's difficult enough to establish a fair and equitable relationship (given societal pressures) without experimenting with sub/dom play.  

Heal from your prior relationshiops, build a strong foundation of mutual respect (e.g. another year to 18 months together), then and only then revisit the idea.  (just a suggestion, but this is what I would recommend)"
"Sorry, does that justify predatory sexual behavior towards a child in your eyes? Those laws exist to protect impressionable and naive children. Just because emotional and sexual abuse is normalized and commonplace in many cultures (including the US, actually) doesn’t mean it’s okay."
So much therapy and she'll be lucky to have a relationship with her daughter as an adult.

"&gt; ""Well then I won't fucking stay here again, I'll get a hotel.""

Fantastic! I do hope you'll remind her of her threat next time she wants to visit.

Honestly, you've set reasonable boundaries and she flaunts crossing them. She is a mean bully, and you are used to it so you just shrug it off. It's one thing if you want to expose yourself to someone like that, but to invite them in to your home and watch them do that to your spouse is pretty indefensible.

I think you are sugar-coating a lot of her behavior and not really being honest with yourself about how it makes you feel. You are allowed to feel hurt and angry at your mother's behavior. Don't just keep letting it slide, because it will never stop. Refuse to tolerate being treated like this. 

Consider sending her an email outlining specific actions that will no longer be tolerated. Demand an apology for you and your husband. Tell her the consequences of brushing this off are that she is no longer invited to be a guest in your home. 

I get that this is how she is, but she's allowed to be that way alone. You do not need to comfort her bad behavior."
"&gt; but I guess I thought since I had been so open about that through our entire courtship that I had covered my bases. Maybe that was naive.

That poster is so full of crap.  Its not like you sprung on your husband that you have to move after you got married.  You were upfront the whole time and he agreed to move with you.  Now he changed his mind!"
"Honestly I feel if you confront your coworker, it will create more drama between you two. Don't excite her comments. Don't show emotion. She is only feeding off of your reactions. That's what insecure people do, which she sounds like she is. Respond with short answers to her, like ""no."" And just go straight to your boss! Even if he/she may not trust you since you haven't been working as long as your coworker has, you have clear evidence you aren't lying: surveillance cameras. Let us know what happens, and good luck!"
"""I don't negotiate with terrorists"" is a sassy way of saying you aren't willing to negotiate PERIOD.

"&gt;He said I don’t have any redeeming qualities or personality traits that would make him respect me as a person; he only loves me because I’m his daughter.

Thanks dad, right back at ya. Respect is a two-way street OP. If he wants YOUR respect he needs to earn it, but he doesn’t seem worthy of it imo. This is all about control...you need to get away from these people."
"I'm not trying to be unsupportive. I will always be there for him, but a sexual relationship is something else. Like I said, just because I'm bisexual doesn't mean that my tastes in men/women are perfectly interchangeable. 

My attraction to men is broad and varied, but my attraction towards women is pretty much all or nil. I have very specific types (appearance + personality) that I feel extremely attracted to, and all other women I feel absolutely nothing for. Unfortunately, like I said, my bf could physically not become the type of women I feel any attraction for. I am not being transphobic or unsupportive, this is literally just how my individual sexual attraction works and has always worked. "
"The fact that he’s been telling everyone this is a disturbing gaslighting and manipulation tactic. He is trying to shut down and shut up your own views and feelings and making it more difficult and painful and socially onerous for you to leave. A decent partner should want you to be with them because you genuinely want to be with them, not because they trap you and effectively coerce you into staying."
"I see a lot of blame placing and little taking responsibility. Your wife didn’t get herself pregnant. You agreed to wait two years but clearly not enough to be proactive with birth control. 

You expect your wife to get rid of the dog she had before you? I’m sorry, but that seems a bit ridiculous. 

You may have already checked out of this marriage, but you are placing the blame on the entirely wrong person. Why don’t you look inside yourself and see why you ended up here? 

Have you voiced any of this to your wife? I see you say that she tells you to “get over it” and I have to agree. Step up and take some responsibility for the mess you created. She’s probably tired of hearing you whine about something you got yourself into. "
"Sounds like dad has no clue what grown women do to avoid being assaulted late at night.

"""I don't want to ruin his vacation but obviously we had different expectations and nether of us addressed these before we left.""

"Whatever you do put in needs to be phrased as a way for the bottom line to be improved, rather than anything that could possibly be construed as ""here is why you suck"". Being able to gobbledegook it up with managerspeak is a bonus."
"Great advice. Keep the sleazeball and bring in a new batch of girls for this guy to harass. 

You sound like a peach."
"Why did this sub seem like the right place to ask this question?  My honest advice is to hit the gym, and only offer to spot for black guys with big arms.  Make sure to talk about how you're not racist and complement their form while you're doing it.  Sooner or later one of them will invite you over to their place for a chance to discuss and demonstrate your good will for the black community with a private session."
"I'm not blaming OP. I'm thinking along the lines of helping him recalibrate his picker, because clearly it's not working. Maybe he's overlooking certain traits or ignoring red flags or what have you. If he can narrow down what drew him to these women or any commonalities between them, then he can start examining what needs he might have that may or may not be fulfilled by these relationships and thus be better able to determine whether or not this person is worth keeping in his life. "
This is what I thought too. My mom did this to me constantly when I was a kid. 
"&gt;In my mind, the trickle truth is far, far worse than the act itself.

Came here to say just that, then you beat me to it. Yes, because without TRUST, there can be no healthy relationship. I'd say this relationship is not worth keeping alive.

&gt;she's confused and immature

She's 25, she's old enough to know better: the rule is not confusing: ""Don't""."
"Being a ""know-it-all"" and ""knowing it all"" are two different things. Even so, your partner doesn't seem to mind if he willingly asked you for help since he figured you would know what to do. And the fact that he said ""it's charming"" should be a sign that it really isn't an issue to him. He said it trying to praise you, not confront you. 

There's nothing wrong with flexing what you know. He obviously appreciates your intellect. And if nobody has brought this up to you in the entirety of your life before this, then you don't need to worry about anything."
"Yep. That's why vows include ""for better or worse"" ""in sickness and health"" etc. Most people don't know what a marriage is these days."
"If my partner that I have been with for five years, bought a home with and live with, was actively looking to move to a different country without considering how I would be able to immigrate with them, I would feel unloved. 

Also, you stated above “I think I do” about loving her. This is something that’s black and white. You either love them or you don’t. 

Edit: read your post again. you’re a shitty partner. "
Seconding this. It's not even about the allergy - accusing one's SO of being a liar is a SERIOUS matter. I don't think I could stay with someone who believes I'm a liar.
"Yeah am I gonna be the only one to point out that the ex could have been legitimately depressed after his father died, a depression which maybe he’s getting treatment / therapy for now, and it’s a little harsh that OP said he was “wallowing in self pity”. I’ve struggled with my mental health and my SO has always encouraged me to get the help I needed, not judged me for laying on the floor crying if that’s all I could manage for the day. "
"Soft skills can definitely be taught!! I learned most of my soft skills from my parents, who directly taught them to me (""This is the best way to handle X situation.."" ""Maybe this is a better way to rephrase this..."" ""Always write a thank you note for this situation..."" ETC). I learned others from observing other people. Soft skills don't come naturally to me but I like to think I'm pretty good at them. "
"He did it because he cares about you and wanted to do it. I think you should buy him a nice thank you gift (nice wine/alcohol or something would be good), and then just basically pretend everything is back to normal until eventually it is."
"She's set this situation up so you can't win. I'm not sure why, but I have the feeling that she really wants you to live with her cats and just suffer through the allergies, almost as if to prove you care about her.  

She's acting like the fact that you're making it easier for yourself is a cop out. 

That shit's fucked up. "
"I've literally told him it's OK ifhe treats me just as he would if I wasn't crying.

I'm still able to hold a normal conversation when I'm crying, I'm not doing it for attention or drama... It's just something I can't help when I start to open up emotionally. "

"Run a fucking mile. It wouldn't be wrong to leave at all! This guy spontaneously attacked someone you randomly spoke to, whether an ex or not, then started shouting and swearing at you. **None of that is OK, and none of it is the behaviour of a normal person**. You can absolutely take the baby and leave. If he can do that to your ex, he can do it to you."
"You’re in a tough spot.  She seems way behind the curve, to the point of needing pre-101-level education.  And you’re being asked to smooth over a hiring error.  On top of that, you’re considerate.  
    You may need to just pull her aside and explain her situation to her, express that you’re willing to help, but that her pride may get jumbled in the process.  And does she want that?  
    Good luck. "
"Is it gross to pig out so much that your SO literally cannot stand to be in the same bed as you? Ya. 

"
I would report him too. He is clearly not mature enough for the workplace.
"Your relationship is weird. I don’t mean that in a bad way - what I mean is it’s a very uncommon arrangement, that most people won’t have come across in their lives. Most people won’t understand the dynamic of a relationship with three people. 

However, your friends don’t need to understand your relationship to be happy for you. They just need to accept that you’re happy and being treated well and this is you decision. If I were you, I’d be looking to move away from this friend group and find more open-minded people to hang around with. 

Oh, and congratulations on finding happiness :)"
Maybe he feels the same way and wants to know why he wasn't worth the effort to stay married? 
"She clearly likes the attention and it doesn’t sound like she plans to stop. This behavior is not ok and you need to enforce some boundaries or it will continue indefinitely. Try to have a serious talk about why it bothers you and needs to end, and if she isn’t willing to abide by these perfectly reasonable boundaries then it will show you that she cares more about the attention than she does about the marriage."
"If you really think you got nothing out of this relationship, then blame yourself for not getting out of it sooner."
"Not looking for a casual hook up, not looking for something serious. She's either telling the truth and wants something mysterious between those two things, or she's letting you down gently because she doesn't see it working out. Doesn't sound good either way, I'd pass on this one my dude."
"""Sorry, do you need a link to a dictionary?"" LOL"
Just pay the ticket. You sound incredibly selfish and petty for not wanting to pay her ticket. She offered you her ticket out of kindness. Now you're hesitating because now you have to pay for negative consequences. 
The U Lock is also for hitting!
If this is real: listen to your mom.
Please go into the dressing room of a strip club and say this. I want to see their reactions. It'll be funny.
"On top of that, OP is 16. She's still a kid and she's still firmly in the ""It's the parent's job to teach some things"" camp. If dad doesn't like her solution and genuinely believes it's a bad solution, then he needs to actually explain to her why that is. He's playing a game here, by just repeating ""self-reliance"" over and over again. If he has a real thing in mind when he says that, it's clear at this point that OP isn't getting it; it's incumbent upon him to realize ""Oh, my kid is 16, and I'm still going to have to explain some things to her."" Him not doing that suggests that either he's doing it to be controlling or that he's kind of a shitty parent. You can't decide what the lesson you want to teach is and exactly how you want to teach it, and then refuse to change anything when the lesson doesn't work. That kind of rigidity is totally unhelpful when you're dealing with kids, or even just human beings in general. 

My dad used to play these kinds of mind games with me, and it was very unpleasant. I think this guy has worse intentions than my dad did, but even with moderately good intentions, it's still shitty to be treated this way. "
"First, I'd say that you are looking at being divorced as a sign of personal failure, and that makes being married feel like a heavy thing. Marriage starts to feel like win/lose, pass/fail. It's not. It's not a test. It's a choice. It's a relationship. It's something you have the power to shape.

My therapist says that at the root of every fear we have is a feeling of powerlessness. One thing that really jumped out to me in your post is that you sometimes feel like if your wife did things your way, that would be better. I think, and this is me just guessing, you feel powerless about the general shape of your life and marriage so you respond by taking control of where you can, on a daily level of routines. I think you would start to feel less anxious and overwhelmed, and you would feel less resentment and control towards your wife, if you could find ways to feel more in control of your life. They don't have to be big things - is there a way, on a daily level, you can change your routines to be more in control of them? A hobby you can pursue? Some space you can carve out for yourself? A trip you can plan back to the city you love?"
"Next level: The concept of vaginal tightness as we understand it does not exist. OP’s man is abusing her with a myth.

But yeah, he should stick to his hand for real. He doesn’t deserve a partner."
"My ex did this to my daughter. Nothing stopped it and she became so depressed she started to cut and wanted to kill herself. I fixed the problem and he is out of her life, got her in therapy, and now she is happy and doing amazing."
"Same, mine was a huge relief. I felt like singing."
Or do date him and get therapy
"To be fair, only the first example was from her childhood - the other two were about their house &amp; their kids.

But I agree w/ your point... her childhood stories should be out of bounds for him to tell, regardless of whether or not she's explictily asked him to stop.

The shared experience ones, they are his stories as much as hers, but if they are causing her pain, and she communicates that, then he should respect that."
"Probably because this sounds like one of the dumbest ideas of all time and is unbelievably offensive to what the **actual** greenbook  stood for. What a shitty rip off of something so progressive and one that actually provided needed assistance. You two sound fundamentally incompatible and he's trying to save you from near definite financial ruin. I wonder how much money you've wasted on this effort over the past half year.

EDIT: As a sidenote...""Body Positive Doctors""? Huh? That's not a thing.  "
"Stress, constant arguing, sex life takes a nosedive etc. You guys want fundamentally different things. Not having what you really want is going to eat at you both and the relationship. 

Go find someone who wants kids with you. "
Having an allowance is pretty common when you're a housewife. How else could you do anything? She's certainly not making any money taking care of the kids 24/7. What if she wants a new plant or new shirt or ANYTHING. 
"Your behavior is fine, it’s the teacher behaving poorly. "
"1- A woman with experience will know how her body works and will be able to be an active participant in telling you what she likes/doesn't like and is more likely to communicate her personal boundaries.

2- more open, honest, healthy, knowledgeable discussions about sexual health because sex is not a taboo subject.

3- fewer jealousy issues because they don't see sex as a commodity, but as an experience that two (or more) people share for the enjoyment of all parties involved.

4- fewer puritanical hang ups, leading to being possibly more adventurous.

Should I go on?"
"This is about his messed up relationship with his own mother. Don't take it personally. 

I understand that it is disappointing, but let it go. Never interject yourself into drama between an adult son and his mother. If *you are asked* you can answer honestly. If your BF wants to manage his mother through silence and lies of omission, tell him it is shitty (because what he is doing is kind of shitty) and then shrug it off. You can't fix this."
"Her sister is the adopted one. Also, her mother went to rehab and has substance abuse issues. She may be the biological product of another woman (like her sister) but the woman her raised her is her mother. Calling her her aunt doesn't help anything."

You're only 17 and he's enlisting soon - you will meet loads of other boys in your lifetime who you'll crush on and will like you back - don't been too disheartened if this particular boy doesn't, be proud that you took the initiative to find out."
"Neither one of you sound ready to date.   Yes his reaction was over the top but he had already made it clear he didn’t want to talk about ex’s.   It doesn’t really matter if you don’t remember why he divorced or if he even told you.  It doesn’t sound like it was anywhere near a steady dating relationship more like a FWB, so I can’t really see why it matters why he divorced.   If you’re dating, and wanting to spend time with someone- especially in the beginning, it doesn’t really seem appropriate to keep reminiscing about ex’s and how you could tell your ex husband anything or why was it he divorced again etc.   you and your ex divorced for a reason, so don’t go about trying to compare any new relationships to how he made you feel.    This guy probably thought he was in for a nice evening and sex and just didn’t want to deal with anything about ex’s.   But that’s no reason to scream at you.  And you should remove yourself from the situation.  Not stay and subject yourself to more of his temper tantrum "
"""Soulmate is a romantic word. I know you care about her a lot but saying she's your soulmate is saying you love her more than me. We've been dating for a year, we're using the l-word is regards to one another.

And if he doesn't take it seriously, tell him you're moving on to find someone who has relationship intentions that better match  yours."
"30 days isn't enough time for either of you to have changed since the break up. He is probably just lonely and not adjusting well and looking for at least some validation from you or he wants to get back together. Again though, if you do get back together you'll probably run into the same problems unless you both are interested in really talking through these issues rather than running away from them. "
"Even if she's never made one before, that's no excuse. She's 33 years old, she knows how to read instructions on a box."
"&gt; On my way to become a wizard.

Wat?"
My parents argue and fight constantly. It's usually little stupid stuff but they're always yelling at each other. I dont remember many specifics from my childhood but I've always been the class clown and have used humor as a defense mechanism. I wonder if that's how I got like that.
"If you forgive her again, she'll know 100% that she has free reign to fuck whoever she wants, whenever she wants.  If you have kids with her, you'll never know whether they're really yours."
"Call CPS and report that she has taken the 13 yo out of school and he is not receiving any education at home. By law he has to be enrolled and *participating* in school and she is actively destroying that poor boy’s future by depriving him of his education so she can get free childcare. 

You should also report it for the safety of that baby. A 13 yo just isn’t mature enough to handle that sort of responsibility every day. That baby needs to be watched by an adult and the 13 yo needs to be in school. 

And a visit from CPS isn’t a guarantee that they’ll take the kids away. Their priority is first and foremost to keep families together (as long as the situation is safe for the kids). They would most likely require her to enroll her son back in school, maybe take a parenting class, and will hopefully get her connected to needed social services to help with housing costs and childcare for the baby. "
"Nope. Nope. Nope. 


Even after 20 - 30 years of marriage, an individual is allowed to be individual with their own secrets, boundaries and life. 


Being in a relationship is not the same with owning your partner. You don't have to know every single thing about them."
But is he a nice guy or a Nice Guy™? This is really what you need to determine.
"&gt;Their job is to have her and our interests at heart, like his friends had his at heart apparently.

It's not their ""job"" to do anything.  They aren't responsible for your wife's actions and it's not their responsibility to remove her from a situation.  She isn't a child.

I think you're making a lot of assumptions.  I also think you have high expectations for your friends.  It's fine if you would have acted differently in that situation, but at the same time, they aren't wrong for acting the way they did.  "
"I would probably have your girlfriend talk to her. She might feel ""set up"" in revealing anything to you. And your gf shouldn't ask too many questions but only state your opinion as a couple: That your concerned for her, that you will help her out or back her up if it's ever needed, and that if she ever feels unsafe, she can call you guys for a ride/pickup at any time. Don't ask her to out your brother as an abuser. Just let her know you're on her side."
"First off, I think it's awesome that you're acknowledging the way you act. I think this is step 1 to bettering yourself. I think goal-setting could be helpful. What is it that you want to change? Be specific. Write this all down somewhere. Have someone hold you accountable for this, maybe a family member, a friend, or a therapist if you have one. But that's another thing--therapy can be great because your therapist is supposed to be non-biased, so they'll give you legit advice. "
"Yes. Silence and privacy help him, not her. 

Otherwise he may use her hesitance to try to argue with her that he isn’t grabbing her sexually so it’s okay. He already doesn’t respect her boundaries. He won’t be embarrassed, he will be exposed fir the groper he is. "
"Well maybe that's how she wanted it. Personally if family members that never really came around or talked to me started calling just because I was sick, I'd be a little upset. "
"Yeah, it's definitely your fault that he's insecure and accusatory. /s

He's not joking and if he is he has a shit sense of humor. It's not funny to accuse your partner of indiscretion as a joke. 

I think you're right that you're seeing red flags from his behavior. You sound like a social person with a health social life. Absolutely do not let him ruin that for you."
"And i guarantee if an oopsie baby were to happen from the affair, she would try to pass it as his"

"Don't give him access to your electronics, don't leave him alone with them. He's a major creep and he shouldn't get to hide what he did. Move out ASAP.

What he did violates so many boundaries that I'm a little fearful for you. Can you stay with family or friends until you find a new place? Take your dog, valuables (paperwork, birth certificates, etc.), and electronics with you. 

Get someone to go with you when you pick up your belongings/furniture/whatever. You can even request a police escort- you'll be accompanied with a cop who will just observe and make sure your crazy creepy AF ex doesn't do anything even crazier and creepier.

Seriously. That guy is bad news."
"It's 100% a troll post. Look at the excuses he gives - he can't call his dad because his dad doesn't use technology - as if landlines don't exist. Woody Allen. The egg story. Woody Allen. He's conveniently scared to call her phone as to not come off too strong but not scared to feel up her genitals for ""my dad's bump"". 

It's bs tailored to keep people's uncertainty going as long as possible. There is great mental lucidity in the excuses chosen to keep the story even superficially plausible as mental instability, an attempt to deny the reader from coming to closure - i.e. preventing anyone from saying ""why don't you do ____ to show they're different people"". Suddenly his dad doesn't have a phone, or he's too shy to ask hers, or he's out of credit that evening, etc."
"Its ok to be mentally ill the way it is ok to be ill in other ways. If you posted a pic of a mole on your arm asking if it looks weird, and everyone said ""thats cancer"" its not judging"
It's pretty bad.  Eventually she's going to get fed up with being around you 100 percent of the time and she's going to ditch you and you will be without her 100 percent of the time. Learn to moderate between the extremes. 
"I mean I've literally heard teachers gossip like that. Her mom is on the PTA, she spends time with these teachers and can lie to them, and some adults think the absolute worst of kids. "
I would agree if they were just friends and if things go sideway Op had an out of the relationship. But this could cost him his work environment. He is not in a position to be risking it unless he is prepared to leave his current job. Otherwise I think it is best to just keep interactions with this dude as professional as possible.

It funny how people try and justify not being the bad guy everyone OP knows is telling him he is the bad guy so he come here for support.  Scary thing are the number of posts saying its everyone who is wrong.
I feel like this is some super underrated advice. It’s so easy to keep thinking the same way unless there is something that logically beats our old ideas. Like you made her really think about it. She probably just had her parents feelings because she never felt a need to change them. Suddenly she found a reason to change and it wasn’t that hard it seems. 
"The way you talk about your girlfriend is very...not good.  You infantilize her with words and actions.  You should not be doing her homework or applying to jobs for her.  She needs to learn to do those things herself and your actions are keeping her dependent.

You seem to really like her immaturity and helplessness in a lot of way, so you can't really go around complaining about it when it causes a problem like this.  She is immature, she had a guy over for drinks but doesn't want you confirming a friend.  Dude.. if you want an adult relationship then date someone who IS AN ADULT.

For her sake, start expecting her to grow up. Stop doing her homework, stop applying for jobs, stop talking about her like a helpless 5 year old."
Or you recognize you aren't equip to raise children you never wanted to begin with. It takes so much more than money. 
"It might mean they’re incompatible, but there’s really nothing inherently wrong about not wanting to laugh about gang violence.  "
"Frankly, as much as I understand your uncle’s desire to honor his sister’s request, the rituals we engage in after a loved one has died are for the *living.* Funerals and burials and memorials are for us, not the deceased. I’d have forgiven him for everything right up to the moment your aunt passed away. At that point, I do think he had an obligation to at least notify his other siblings and any remaining parents. At that point he should have informed them of her wish to be cremated and let them be involved in the process. 

This is one of those sad cases where an entrusted survivor turned their brain off at the exact wrong moment. And he’s going to pay the price for it, however noble his intentions. Good intentions are no guarantee of a good outcome, and I think you and your family have a right to be angry with him for shutting you out of the grieving process like this. "
"&gt; It’s not equivalent because this wasn’t said about OP, it was said about the kids,

The kids are real people. Tiny, developing, impressionable people with real feelings. It is equivalent. It is no more appropriate to insult their looks than it is to insult an adult’s looks. Especially where they could hear you. In fact it is far, far less appropriate because it does so much more damage."
"If it was just ""real Miller's"" then the spouses would be out too and they were going to be but he said they were okay so what he really meant was ""not your adopted siblings"""
"To counter your ""isn't this so immature?"" What did you expect dating someone 10 years younger than you and what do you call assuming a relationship where none has been established? Going out once a week for a month isn't really significant. It sounds like you guys went on some dates for 4 weeks, that's not a relationship unless someone says so. You should probably focus on dating people your own age and clarifying the state of matters."
"The next time you and you're dad are home alone, just ask him ""do you want to talk about it""?   Let him know that you won't cover for him and that sooner or later you'll have to tell your mom because it's not something you can bottle up.   

Do not get involved in the particulars.  Your parent's relationship is theirs and they are the only ones who know exactly what has been going on with your marriage.   
This girl may have been the latest in a string of student affairs, if so, your mom is probably aware that he's been at again.

Note:  If this girl goes public, your dad may well lose his job so be prepared for some very rocky times.   It might be worthwhile to mention to your father that it would be  good idea for you and your brother to go to family counseling when/if things explode.
"
"I’m sorry OP but this completely sounds like a predatory relationship.  Although you are of age, this started when you were much younger - there is no reason a grown woman should be having a relationship with a 16 year old.  Plus, you’ve known her since you were a child, which had power and influence to this dynamic.  

I’m not telling you to end the relationship (but you should) because I know you will not, but regardless if you tell your mother  (you should) or not, please be careful.  "
"Thank you so much for posting this ""from the other side,"" as it were - this is right on point.

I am cracking up at this comment ha. 
"My initial reaction to hearing all of that was just a huge wow of shock. I think everyone reacts very differently to hearing about such horrible events like that one, and I strongly recommend not pushing yourself to feel strongly one way or another if that isn’t happening naturally. 

On a personal level for you, there’s probably also a number of pressures in relation to not offending your bf or his family, no matter how shocking you may have found all of this. 

I, nor anyone else, can truly tell you how to feel about the situation. I’m not sure how useful (or not) my observations are, but hopefully they’ll help relieve at least some of the pressure upon yourself to feel (something specific, or anything at all) about the situation and what happened. 

Btw, what you described at the beginning of your post about how you sometimes feel disconnected and disjointed with your feelings and circumstances, it immediately brought to mind depersonalisation disorder. You might find it worth your while to give it a google to see if that’s what you’re dealing with personally. All the best "
"I see. Yeah, I think you should tell him you know she said some awful stuff and that's why (or part of why) you don't want to be friends with her anymore. And reassure him that you're attracted to him etc. "
"Very.

I'm 5'2"".  I'm too old and heavy to pick up, but I still get LOTS of pats on the head, from a surprisingly large group of people."
"&gt; You could suggest trying to stay platonic close friends with this guy if that’s what makes you more comfortable in the long term, but you may already be on track to losing him as a friend if your relationship has already switched to full-on romantic mode.

To be honest, while it may be something Op does not want to think about, this relationship has too much baggage and toxic do-dependency for them to at this point in time to even be platonic friends. Maybe a couple years down the line. But they won't be able to move on as long as they still use each other as an emotional crutch. "
"When you marry someone, you combine pieces of both your ancestral cultures, plus your local/contemporary culture, to create a home.

"Most admit they have a fetish for fattening up a woman and having her be bedridden, I.e. unable to leave and dependent on them as caretaker. One admitted he liked the idea because it meant his girlfriend couldn't break up with him. It usually takes a while to get them to admit this, because they are aware that ""I like fat women who struggle to get around because it means she's stuck with me.""

But yes, generally that. And yeah I see I'm getting downvoted but it's the truth, and it's why I avoid chubby chaser meet groups."
"&gt; Even if she stays with him, she knows the complete picture and can make an informed decision.

Seconding this. Even if she stays with him, telling her wasn't a waste."
"I don't really know what kind of boundaries your gf has. But I can understand how going into her purse without her knowing can be unnerving. Really it's impact over intent. While your intentions were pure and loving, the impact to her came off as you being creepy. OP I'm on board with you as I would do the same. Even reading this we see it from your intentions and emotions. In reality it's subjective. "
"If you really feel you need to watch your drink around someone you've been dating for six months to make sure they don't date rape you, you have wayyy bigger problems, like breaking up with them immediately"
"Yeah this sad-sack melodramatic crap.  I have heard this several times over my life as I had a habit of going for the angsty type of guy.  

Don’t buy this for a second OP.  You can’t will someone to have self esteem, even IF this wasn’t manipulative crap, which it surely is. "
"&gt;Let's try and decipher what happened: You two broke up. You became exclusive FWB. She saw baby-dad. She slept with baby-dad continuously. Baby-dad found out about you causing accident. Baby-dad goes bye-bye

The ex wasn't even the baby daddy. He was just an ex who the girl told op was a ""father figure"" and he foolishly fell for it. The kid is 4 and op has been with her two years. Thus the kid would have been no older than 2 and have zero recollection of the ex. OP is just a straight up sucker."
None of that makes you a bad mom. You need to have a personal life too. 
"She never changed her mind. It was always her position, even back before they were married.

"I love what another user said. Be vague and make him go crazy wondering what it is. ""I know what's going on and I gave you every opportunity to tell the truth. Goodbye."" Leaving the screenshots lets him know what you know and how you know. Don't put his mind at ease any or give him a way to learn how to be deceptive to someone else."
"Tbh, it sounds like a lot of your hobbies exclude her. I play DnD on weekends and an average session can go for 6+ hours - longer if none of us have anything else we have to rush to afterwards. If you're doing this, AND Magic, AND video games, AND Art - every day - how much time ARE you actually spending with just her? And I mean quality time. It sounds kind of like you resent having to actually spend time with her on a more flexible schedule now that she's moved in. Like you don't actually like her even. 

Maybe you could try and compromise and find a hobby that both of you could do together. Like a photography class or something. That's art for you, and not necessarily as outdoors for her - and it'll take you to lots of different interesting places in an attempt to take new photos. This is just an example, but it doesn't actually sound like you're respectful of what she DOES like, nor are you willing to accommodate it or find out how to work your lives together."
"I think you did the right thing no matter how things turn out. One, there's no way of knowing *a priori* whether she'd leave him. She deserves the chance to make an informed decision whether to stay in the marriage or not. Two, even if she decides to stay, she'll at least know she probably ought to get an STD test, and reassess whether to have more children with this loser.

Thanks again. The world needs more honest people like you."

"Do not under any circumstances have kids with her for quite a while if ever.

Is this something that suddenly changed or has she been this way always?  If this is sudden then you need to find out what is triggering this.

The constant calling you when you were at a friends house and the interview, places she knew ahead of time you will be,  tells me she doesn't trust that you are where you say you are.  The dead giveaway was the text about calling the companies HR department.  She has no trust in you for some reason.  

if she has been like this for your whole relationship it's almost impossible for her to change and you have to decide if you can put up with this behavior.  Most people cannot."
I think it's actually pretty common for unhappiness and resentment to quietly fester.
"You do not ""need"" celebrity gossip sites. Stay away from those.

"I know plenty of adults who just don't prioritize hygiene and they aren't depressed. They just never thought it was important. Much to the disappointment  of people around them,  but they are perfectly happy individuals. There's armchair psychology bouncing around in this thread. It's all bullshit, yes not wanting to shower could be a sign of depression, but if she's not exhibiting more classic symptoms, or we don't know more about the situation, these folks are just talking points out their asses. There's no way a paragraph written from another person's perspective is enough to diagnose depression or any other mental illness for that matter. If they are worried it's a problem, take her to see a professional. 

Some people just do not prioritize hygiene, especially when they don't socialise often or leave the house for very long. Just because she's more of an introvert also doesn't mean she's depressed. I would recommend talking with her, see how she's feeling, pointedly ask her why she doesn't want to be clean and if there's some other underlying reason. Straight up labeling it depression is just a terrible decisions, especially if that comment is coming from someone who says things like ""well when I was depressed I..."" Using your experiences and symptoms and applying it to a complete stranger is irresponsible."
"Yes, it's well established that people who are being abused often make their bodies as ""gross"" as possible and this can take the form of not bathing. "

"Ya that's not normal. Aren't you all busy? If my partner called or texted me every hour 1. I'd get fired. 2. I'd breakup with them because they'd be driving me crazy  3. They would need a hobby, clearly. "
"Your ex is deeply lame, and she will never ever give you those photos as long as it's clear you still want them. My money's on as soon as you stop asking her for the photos, she'll start reaching out to you under the guise of giving them back, and there'll be a whole bunch of nonsense hoops you have to jump through before she gives 'em to you. Better to consider them lost and move on than to let her take a hostage.   

Think of your loss as a breakup tax. Rule of thumb here is that any girlfriend you ""don't know how to deal with"" while you're together will inevitably become an ex-girlfriend you straight up *can't* deal with once you split. "
"At least you have an incredible partner and a healthy (thankfully, the NICU part had me scared!) baby. That's all you need. Cut the negativity, focus on the positivity.

"I’m glad you’re pointing this out. It’s sort of sad to see people here even in the comments saying basically that my problems don’t matter because I grew up with money. 

It’s important to remember too that who is rich and who is poor can be very subjective. To half of my high school I was the poor kid who didn’t even have a pool, or fancy cars, or the latest phone. To the other half I was the rich kid because I lived in a house and not an apartment, and we even had a yard with grass. 

I won’t go into the issues I’ve faced in my life, because I work really hard to get past them. But I’m not just some lazy entitled person- maybe I didn’t face the same adversity, but I used the extra time and resources from that to volunteer a lot. I do so less now that I have less time what with trying to get my career off the ground, but my parents volunteer too. My mom was a stay-at-home Mom for a while, yes, but she volunteered more hours then some people work for pay. Just because I had a different experience growing up doesn’t make me a bad person. OP, try to remember that. Don’t only see people as a dollar amount. "

Reacting like that is just horrible - your mother is also bit.. I don't know, I wouldn't stay with anyone that treated my child like that, be it woman or man."

Sounds like he has a guilty conscience. Are you *sure* he's not still cheating on you?
"And why not honestly ""It makes me feel exposed and vulnerable, and that is scary""?"
"Yup. My partner would constantly accuse me of cheating and was super-paranoid about the fact that I had male friends. There was a zero percent chance I would cheat on him, and it was a horrible feeling to constantly have to reassure him when I'd done nothing wrong and nothing to deserve the accusations.

And then, of course, I found out that he'd cheated on me."

"You need to start treating your girlfriend like a person and not an object.  She is not for photographing naked without her knowledge.  She is not a vehicle for your fat fetish, either.  If she doesn't like you groping her fatty parts, doing that isn't okay either.

I honestly think that right now you are not mature enough to be in any relationship.  But if you disagree, the least you can do is come clean to your girlfriend.  Tell her about your preference and use the word ""fetish"" so she understands this isn't you trying to kiss up to her about her appearance.  Tell her about the photos you took without her knowledge, too.  

Maybe she'll break up with you.  Probably.  But let me put it to you this way: you will *never* have a healthy relationship with anyone until you are able to reveal this fetish to them and be accepted for it.  

And if you can't bring yourself to reveal your fetish, then you should break up with her and start over.  Tell people about the fetish early, when they can reject you and it won't matter as much."
"Yeah, this story stinks to high heaven. 

The detail that bothers me is Inexplicable friend circle that just magically forms in chemlab, with no individuals other than the evil pixie girl. This inexplicable friend circle dissolves as easily--no one has any agency under the power of evil pixie girl. 

Usually stories about a social conflict like this have an ally in the friend circle who provides a lot of the info--people almost always buddy up to one person in a circle more than to others. 

Here, all the info comes from a social media post no one in their right mind would make, if only because you can then screen shot it and post it to social media, which OP somehow hasn't done. 

"
"&gt;you still wasted 2 months of her time when you knew she isn't right for you.

That's an unfair accusation.  As other posters have mentioned above, they were virgins until they found the right person to have sex with and enjoy sex.  I don't think it was unreasonable for the OP to see if he could be the right person for his GF.  He's given it two months to see, and unfortunately is reaching the end of his limit.  He needs to break up with her, but that doesn't mean he just wasted her time for those two months."
I get that. It's not fair for him to try and railroad you into being a SAHM. If he can do school and care for the child that's what makes the most sense. Especially if you'll be making more than he is doing side gig stuff. 
"Given that you two are still in contact, I don’t see any reason not to just express your thanks. Say it meant a lot to you - encourage the behavior you want to see more of in the world."
Agreed.  I always wonder about a couple not on the same page before they're married.
"What you're saying is offensive and your anecdotal experience means shit. 


 Please disregard this incredibly sexist comment."
"&gt; But the love of her life should be the one she is most free and sexually open with.

I think this ideal is pretty toxic. Some people just aren't synced up that way sexually but that doesn't mean that they love each other less. This kind of thinking is how you get OP's problem in the first place.

Sex is just ONE component of a relationship, it's not the be all and end all."
Yeah OP I get the sense that you think your entire self worth is based on your willingness to have sex.

"OP, I would recommend spending a night in a hotel. Let him know that's what you're doing but not which hotel. Tell him he needs to think about his actions and you'll be back the day after to think about it. 

If there's anyone you can leave the babies with in case he gets violent again I would recommend that. "
"If she's actually flirting with him he needs to put his foot down. Ignoring her won't do anything, she'll just up her ante until he's forced to do something. He needs to be direct. ""These comments are inappropriate,  please can we keep our conversations strictly professional"". It can be uncomfortable but the alternative is he ends up in a situation where he is basically leading her on. "
Thank you so much! I think most of the friends I've had in my life are able to control me so much because I let it happen. But I'm glad I can finally stand up for myself.

I think you are right. And the distance would be healthy. But we have tried and we literally can not stay away from each other. We are miserable apart.

"He punched. A wall. After years and years of being manipulated and abused. Yeah, thats mr. abuser right there. I mean seriously, if his story is legit, and we have no reason not to believe that at this point, i dont think he is in any way wrong here. He just snapped for a second, and even when he did, he didnt deck his wife. "
"Honestly, I would look at your attitudes toward gender a little bit. I suspect you would not talk about how good-looking a man who died was, and I suspect that the gender difference here is what is bothering your gf, moreso than you commenting on somebody's looks. It doesn't mean you are a raging misogynist or anything, but maybe you are not valuing women as intelligent and whole people as much as you should. "

"I was married to a man who didn't work for 2+ years. I had a chronic illness and worked. I worked overtime to make ends meet. I would leave him ""to do lists"" and he would do nothing but read, game, and watch fox news. I made doctors appointments and he wouldn't go. I helped him with a resume and he had 1 job for a month and got fired. Everything was Obama's fault. He took no responsibility for anything. I agonized over divorce and ""breaking my vows"". My health suffered and he didn't care. He'd brag he made dinner but all he did was order pizza. He finally was convicted of a felony and lied to me about it (all not his fault, like everything else). That was my escape. 7 years. I should have bailed way earlier."
"From what OP is saying they're not missing stuff. I'm in my third year of uni and I need to go in maybe two days a week? I don't get up til 10 if I don't have a morning lecture. If I had someone in my house waking me up early I'd be fucking livid - regardless of whether they were roommates or parents. It's not lazy if you're not missing anything.  I'm sure OP can wake up if they have to, but if they don't have any reason to get up early then why do so?"

You can also add that OP gets angry and jealous if other men notice his wife. There is nothing right about OP's wife trying to cheat but I have a hunch that she has been deeply unhappy for awhile and that OP might not be the best partner. 
"We've been discussing this for a while, but he's completely opposed to the idea. ''I'm not crazy!'' he says when we bring up the idea."

I don't know where you live but this would be illegal in USA, Canada and most of Europe"
"You got the ""unconditional love"" part of parenting all backwards. "
"That hits the nail on the head! If you need to imply the same level of intimacy with a coworker as you have with your wife, something if off balance in one (or both) relationships. "
"You're not an idiot, you have really low self esteem and it sounds like your husband is either actively/passively being super manipulative. 

You've been with your husband your whole adult life, you don't know any other relationship dynamic than this. It might even seem like you don't have the option to break up and move your life in a different direction, but you do. What he's doing is not ok, he's chipping away at your insecurities then making you feel bad for that. My ex did that with anxiety, he'd do things that he knew would make me anxious but wouldn't take responsibility, he'd just blame my anxiety and say it's my fault. I found someone who loves and reflects me so much that he'd never do that, he goes out of the way to not inflame my anxiety or insecurity. You can find someone like that too."
"Yes, he is racist. So what difference does it make if he stops ranting when you know how he feels whether he says anything or not?"
"I'm a black girl with a long history of dating white guys. I've seen it all- racism, fetish issues, etc.

Your guy is insecure, controlling, immature, AND racist.

Life is too short to put up with half of that."
"&gt; He did offer that I could ask for him directly every time I come in

So, do this."
Soooo all those issues that caused you to break up 3 years ago are still there?
