"Probably the people who try getting on a subway before letting people off.

Or litterers. I don't see them often but when I do, it just frustrates me so much."
"I've talked with people who have lived in gentrifying neighborhoods all their lives. Obviously they don't have a problem with less crime, a better grocery store, whatever other improvements. But then the rent goes up, their friends, their relatives, all their loved ones have to leave. The community is destroyed and they end up feeling like a stranger in the place they grew up in. To call it ""progress"" makes it seem like everyone is advancing together. This is not the case. There are winners (developers, large landlords with no stake in the community) and losers. I don't think this is hard to understand, wouldn't you agree that there are values besides economic values?"
People who let their dogs shit on the sidewalk without cleaning up
"They know what they're doing. It's the same reason why they walk slow while everyone else is rushing. They have little control of their life (ie: they work a shit job, they live in a shit neighborhood, they live paycheck to paycheck, they have issues with authority etc.) so they try to be an inconvenience in the few things they have control over... being loud or smelly."
Yess people who walk around with speakers blasting music like they are some kind of DJ and the world is their nightclub
I feel like reddit isn’t the target demographic to ask this question to get first hand offender response lol

On the top right of this page is a red box that says ""Chat Now"". It should connect you to an online chat for domestic abuse."
"I am that friend. Please message me your address and I will be there ASAP. I will get a cab.

"Know where the doors will open so you position yourself right by the frame, letting people out first, and being the first in."
"A) The two prominent recent attacks have raised the public’s interest, and so the news is reporting it because it draws readership. The same thing happened with slashings and the knockout game. Sometimes the news gives people what they “want”—which is a narrative that they bring to the table and then the news works backwards to support. Before there was a narrative, slashings and attacks were likely still occurring, it’s just that fewer people outside those neighborhoods care. Now it’s a part of a larger story until the public loses interest and moves on.

B) You’re noticing it more because we love to seek patterns.

C) It’s summer, and people are hanging around outside more and for longer, and they get drunk or bored or stupid and they start acting like idiots.

"Folks who have rented are unhappy that their rent will go up, and they may have to eventually move.  And that the local businesses that have been part of their neighborhood and lives may have to close due to their rising rents.  And that new places coming in may be more expensive, or of a different character than how they see their neighborhood.  And that as rents rise there may be long periods where lots of store fronts become and stay empty, as landlords hold out for the higher rents they think they'll get somewhere down the road.

It's not really rocket science.  It's also of course not one sided, as you note."
"They're mostly for the homeless, but are open to absolutely anyone who needs to escape the heat. If you're just too damn hot, and you have nowhere else cool to go, don't hesitate to visit one. 

If you have money and time, the best place to go is the movie theater. Back in the day before people had their own air conditioners, the movie theater had them. People would flock there during heat waves. And that's the origin of the summer blockbuster."
Trumps and their supporters. 
"OP, I have a friend who lives on the west side that is willing to meet you and let you stay the night, but we need to know where you are. "
"Who cares? Would you rather embarrass everyone or end up dead? Besides, that's just his abuse talking. Leave, or try the hotline listed above. I know some will not call police as policy (I tried to do the same for a friend previously) so if you're in fear of your life then take the first stage opportunity to leave and obtain outside help. "
"Growing up here, I know that life can fucking suck.     

To make my commute a little better, I always try and imagine tha everyone else around me is having a worse day than me. Then, I try to be nice to them. It's not easy, and sometimes I fail, but I know that one nice interaction can really help someone have a better day."
"I think I could sum everyone up in ""People who stand in other people's way"".

This means the fuckers who don't let people out of subways, people that stop at the top/bottom of stairs, people who don't move to the fucking right, et-fucking-c."
Funny. I’ve been thinking the opposite. Used to see so many fireflies as a kid but I haven’t seen any in years around here. 
"Idiots with no awareness of personal space.

Ride the subway in Japan, shits like a temple with how quiet it is
"
"My impression is that while these are open to the public and taxpayer-funded, they are geared toward the homeless and other underserved communities. I probably wouldn’t go to one unless I was desperate, but good to know they exist. "
Embarrassing everyone is basically exactly what you want to do.
People who keep their backpack on when the train is crowded. +1 for tall people who do this.
"People who will knock you over to grab a seat and don't even say excuse me or apologize, they just get confused when you glare at them.

But really, anyone who cannot conduct themselves like a civilized human being at least 85&amp;#37; of the time.  We all have our moments."
Racists.
"They play for donations, as it's illegal to gamble. I tell them straight up if they win I will pay, but if I win I am walking away after saying good game. Never, ever expect them to hand you money if you win. They will laugh in your face."
The question was literally what group of people would you get rid of...an impossible question to answer without being momentarily close minded. 
"Gentrification often happens on racial lines (ie whites moving in, minorities moving out) which adds another layer "
Noyouve got it wrong - you're in the cat's apartment. 
It's fine if the train isn't crowded. Just avoid the morning and evening rush hours and you should be fine.
"Because there are rarely any seats at my stop, I get in a car thats near the next stops stairs.  

Better chance of finding a seat at the next stop.  "
"Catcallers/street harassers.

Honorable mention to the fucking Times Square costumed characters.

(Edit: I think I feel more strongly about a lot of subway etiquette violations, but they've already been said here! Have an upvote, all of you.)"
Drivers who honk excessively and unnecessarily. 
"Switch to a local train so I can sit down. Adds 5-10 minutes to my commute, but makes it less miserable."
"The demographic that does this are poor black and Hispanic 15-25 year old males. The reason they do this is to say “fuck your norms, I don’t care if you’re uncomfortable, I’m enjoying my damn self!” in a society that deems them undesirable.  "
The poorest urban county in the US is unlikely to have a lot of people who have time to dick around on the Internet on a site where the community is predominantly affluent white dudes. Not rocket science.
"I don't do that, but I do have some insight: people like that actually enjoy *rattling the cage*, provoking other people and get a kick out of their reactions.

It's like a troll, but with actions instead of just words."
"I would dine at any restaurant alone without any hesitation. I think it’s so common here especially, and I’ve met a lot of interesting people sitting at a bar alone.

I have to ask - since it’s going to be super hot for a couple months why wouldn’t you just get an ac unit rather than spending money eating out to be some place cool? 
They really aren’t that expensive and I couldn’t imagine not having ac over the past few weeks."
I'd talk to your roommates. There is little to no chance man that the cat got in without one of your roommates. 
"Walk. And walk. And walk.  I personally think the best part of NYC is how much there is to do and see if you just take a long walk.  This even goes for BK and Qns almost as much as Manhattan, and probably the BX a bit too. "
"I'm a leasing manager fir Manhattan buildings. Very trustworthy. It costs money to list on streeteasy and the company verifies listings.

CL is a lot more sketchy BUT you will find the best cheap listings there, particularly for outer borough ""mom and pop"" sort of listings. "
It’s not progress because those who live in areas that are being gentrified don’t benefit from it. They just get pushed into even poorer neighborhoods. Those who move in were already well-off to begin with. Gentrification is just a way to sweep poor people under the rug. 
"&gt;is personal safety regarded less important than the flavor of the neighborhood or even empty store fronts?

gentrification isn't equivalent to safety - this presumption is exactly what pisses people off. you're assuming wealthier &lt;=&gt; safer. poor and working class neighborhoods are for all intents and purposes safe as they are. yes there's targeted violence but there are very few random acts of violence. if you're going to point to things like what happened in the bronx re junior then i'd like to point to, as counterpoint, what happened in maryland re the newspaper. i'm not going argue that crime rates are lower in more affluent communities but there's a huge difference between statistics and the experience of safety.

edit. here's the thing that bothers me about back-biting like this from immigrants: they're almost always from people that were either affluent in their own countries or miraculously lucky. that is to say that your frame of reference isn't really as broad as you claim. i'm also an immigrant (not from india - where you seem to be from) but from the poorest former eastern-bloc country and i lived in truly rural subsaharan africa (no water, power, no paved roads, no brick buildings, etc.) for two years after undergrad so i have probably just as much first-hand experience with global poverty as you. still i would not argue that gentrification is fine simply because people from my country persevere on less than black people being pushed out of bedstuy by hipsters. further down you say

&gt; ...People adapt. If the they are offering goods or services in the area being gentrified, they can (and do) hike prices and I have seen real world examples of this.

can you give me on example of a service position (outside of unionized industries) in a poor neighborhood that has the bargaining power to hike prices i.e. demand a raise during times of inflation? or do you think that most people living in gentrifying neighborhoods are sole proprietors?

&gt;In the rest of the world, this is called progress.

for the record gentrification is still recognized as gentrification around the world (even in india):

Also sitting on the stairs where they know a ton of people come up in down.
Dumbasses who pull this shit are desperate for attention.
"Fuck this mentality  yo, I had a woman bark at me for not giving my seat to an older dude after I had just gotten off a 24 hour shift of hard labor. Everyone has a story, I know otherwise healthy looking people with severe back issues it’s no ones place to tell others what they do and don’t need."
Unless you’re a couple of black guys in Philadelphia
"Go [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/apps/311universalintake/form.htm)

Type EMERGENCY! in the description box and ask for a police response.  Make sure you say you have no phone."
"Nah I definitely don't want to ban everyone who has weed, or everyone who's even illegally downloaded music, or for that matter people who've crossed the border illegally unless they are also generally annoying"
"Please please please please please do not stick around to ""see what happens"". As you wrote earlier, this is an emergency. Even if this situation seems to have ended and your boyfriend apologizes, you are still in an extremely dangerous situation. Please get help. None of us know you, but we obviously care. No one deserves to be living in fear. Please. Get help before it is too late."
If I were mayor this would be an arrestable offense.
