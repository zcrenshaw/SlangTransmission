Watch a show called The Inbetweeners. Thats basically spot on for most male youth in the UK
"I've had a few American friends while living abroad (I am in my early 20s), I think the major difference not touched upon yet is humour. British young adults tend to have a far more acerbic sense of humour and are far more likely to belittle their friends as part of a joke (who are expected to understand it is part of a joke and not take it seriously or personally), whereas American humour tends to be far less at the expense of other people and more positive reinforcement of each other.

This is part of a far wider cultural split, there is no such thing as the 'British Dream' and British people are far more likely to come to terms with their own fundamental mediocrity and inability to change the world at an earlier age, which many people see as an important developmental step. "
Maybe get him a pineapple. It would be a nice treat for him. 
"You get a pay *rise* to *raise* your salary. Grammar, dammit. "
"When you can get it. A peculiarity of world trade agreements is that pineapples cannot be legally imported into the UK. Of course, some people have ""unofficial"" sources, but then the prices are sky-high. He'd probably be thrilled to the point of speechlessness to discover a pineapple as a welcoming present (hide it in his bed for added effect)."
"One of the biggest cultural differences: they drink together. Over here a few cans in the park at 16 is not uncommon, and obviously everybody is allowed to drink at 18; so a group of young people towards the end of their teenage years/starting university will almost certainly be at ease in a situation where other people are drinking, even if they choose not to, and at least part of ""normal"" behaviour for them will be to go to the pub or have a drink at home. Compare that to the US with drinking ages anywhere up to 21 (and *much* stiffer penalties for underage drinking, depending on location, and regrettably, skin colour) and ""young people having a good time together"" are much, much less likely to be doing so while drinking socially - which changes the group dynamic somewhat. Where they are drinking, it's probably in a much more ""big party"" atmosphere and often getting much drunker (in terms of felt effects, if not by units consumed) and fewer people will be able to handle their drink. In the UK there's probably one or two people in the group who are considered lightweights; among similar-age US groups there are probably only one or two who consider themselves serious drinkers. "
if i had to guess it would be high insurance
"Sounds about right for a 19 year old (new licence holder) in an MX5...

Have you considered?

1.  Being over 25-30 years old
1.  Having 2-5+ years driving experience
1.  Having held a licence for 2-5+ years
1.  Driving a (much) slower car that doesn't have a reputation of being the 'poor man's sports car'.
1.  Living in an area with a low crime rate.

Considering 1-3 and 5 will be tricky, that leaves only (4).

May I recommend a [Fiat Seicento](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Fiat_Seicento_front_20080127.jpg/1200px-Fiat_Seicento_front_20080127.jpg) or [Volvo 940](https://images.honestjohn.co.uk/imagecache/file/fit/730x700/media/6397510/Volvo%20940%20\(3\).jpg)?  

I hope you understand how cool your young friends will find it when you can fit them and all their golf clubs (or whatever young people do now-a-days) in the boot with room to spare for your fishing gear!

tl;dr: Yes, there's a reason the Inbetweeners doesn't feature an MX5."
The NHS. Best thing about our country. 
"If faced with this I would leave, unless the money was exceedingly good."

Jesus Christ. 
"Its not mythology. Just ask my grandfather. He sailed over in a modified Ford Cortina and brought back 24,000 Belgians in the boot."
Don't get offended if he doesn't like it though. If he  is at university age then there's a chance he's never even tried it. 
"It's very well known here, but probably also very highly mythologised. 

It's within living memory, and many people's grandparents were involved, especially if they lived on the coast of had a boat - or were even in the BEF at the time. My grandfather was an RAF ground engineer and my great uncle a pilot, and they were involved.

Of course, there were tall tales about it as well, and it was somewhat turned into propaganda, but it marked the moment when the war became something that everyone saw themselves as having to be involved in, rather than just something that was happening somewhere else. "
NO.
"""My lover"" is a traditional term of endearment in Bristol, so don't get your hopes up if they call you that."
"Yeah. It's quite controversial over here. I remember when I went to the US when I was younger, my parents we a bit apprehensive about even ordering a Hawaiian pizza. "
"Can't be arsed to find the link, but there is a clip of Stephen Fry discussing this. He says whereas in American comedy the situation is the joke, and the characters somewhat heroes, in British comedy the character is the joke. Or something like that. "
"I once went into a pub in south Manchester.

From the outside it has dark green 'bathroom looking' tiles up and down the building, a sign that was falling apart, frosted glass with that wire in between the panes of glass, old obviously alcoholic fella standing outside in the doorway with a fag on.

The sort of pub you walk past a 100 times and think ""jesus who goes in there though?!""

So me and two mates thought fuck it, let's see how bad it truly can be.

The room was lit by 2 fluorescent tube type light bulbs, one was only half working. There was no TV, no music, just 1 of the blokes playing darts.

I know its a cliche but when we walked in, all 6 of the people in there including the bar woman stopped what they were doing and looked at us, 3 obviously out of place students. 

It had a tiny bar with two pumps on, Carling or Guinness with the normal unknown branded spirits and wine behind the bar. The bar was wide enough for two people to stand at it.

Now I don't want to be rude to people with disabilities at all here, but of the 6 people in the room 3 had down syndrome and one of them seemingly did not know the other two. As I say, no disrespect to them at all. Just an unusual sight in an already unusual boozer.

We got 3 pints of guinness, it cost over a tenner which annoyed me. It tasted like sulphur. I couldn't stomach more than 3 mouthfuls. 

We couldn't leave though, we had shown our faces and paid so we were damn well going to finish that pint. Except one of my mates accidentally let out the eggiest, most disgusting fart I've ever smelt. Everyone heard it, everyone smelt it. Keep in mind this room wouldn't have been able to fit many more people in it. We decided we simply had to leave after the fart, it was both entirely unacceptable to the local punters and disgusting. 

As we left, with a shitty smell in the air and half drunk pints, one of the disabled fellas said goodbye with no hint of sarcasm in his voice which was nice. At least one fella in there didn't want us dead.

All in all, wouldn't go again. If the pints were cheaper then perhaps. "
I think the UK educational system puts more pressure on people to mature earlier. From 16 onward you're basically responsible for your own learning in many respects. 
Fuck this absolute bollocks. This is how people burn out. 
I've always thought that UK teens/young adults seem more adult and independent when compared to our US counterparts. Buts that just my experience with my British vs American friends. 
"Lack of imagination, guys.  Pineapples have a mass and an external skin that makes them suitable for aerial distribution.  They can frisk you for pineapples at the gate but nobody can stop you arranging delivery by trebuchet from half a mile off.  Modern GPS and laser rangefinding could make this a highly efficient distribution method.  

Although a better lesson is taught by arranging a time-on-target barrage on the ticketing staff.  600 pineapples incoming on their position at 40% of the speed of sound will ruin anyone's day"
I feel like Morrisons is cheaper than Sainsbury's and Tesco. I don't shop there all the time but when I have it has been surprisingly good value 
At least you are good at critical reflection.
"I think the fact that 'roasting' exists is telling of how that kid of humour is more compartmentalised off for a specific time and place in US culture, whereas here it's more like default mode of communication is like an ongoing 'roasting'. It's like how Americans will often flag up jokes with 'just kidding', I think they have a stricter sense of when taking the piss is and isn't appropriate.  

  I think the harshness of what's acceptable probably differs from person to person a lot."
It usually means shut up and work hard.
"American kids usually learn to drive way before Brits, cars are more necessary especially when not in cities "
"Decent financial technology.

America still uses swipe and sign which is so ridiculously insecure, it's laughable. Your card number is literally in plaintext on the magnetic strip.

Chip and PIN is so much more secure. We also have contactless almost everywhere now, which makes transactions so much more efficient.

We also don't have ridiculous charges to take money out of a cashpoint (unless you are in a club or something)."
"Linking with a previous comment on the alcohol difference between UK and US. 

It seems like when alcohol is involved, young people in the UK are more likely to look out for one another, whereas when alcohol is involved in the US then normally at a party when someone can't handle the alcohol or have too much they're kinda left to their own devices

It's not uncommon in the UK to have a group of young people who are plastered yet still mature enough to realise when one of the party members might have had too much and can't go on without help. "
"Sounds like he's moved on with his life, it's probably time that you did too. Either go home and burn all his stuff or do as he has done and find yourself a fifty-year-old male lover in the pub. "
"Actually, don't hurt your eyes."
"You should speak with the specialist brokers first - there's a chance it might be reasonable, but in the kindest possible way, you were rather crazy to buy such a car at 19, with no experience without having looked at insurance quotes.


It's very possible, depending on where you live, that *no insurer will offer insurance for less than £1,800/year (£150/month) on any car.*

(i.e. under £150/month may simple be impossible on all cars at your age.)"
"""These kids are about to enter some of the most secually experimental years of their lives. Shall we give them their own rooms? Nah, two to a room should be fine"" American uni is weird. 

In general though it should all be fine.

Oh, he would be allowed to drink in the UK from 18, so be prepared for a good moan about that. In fact just be prepared for a good moan. Brits love to moan. If he's complaining about stuff he isn't upset, it's just how we act. In fact often a way we bond is moaning about shared conditions, so if he's moaning about the room and the uni etc it's not because he's pissed off or wants you to find or offer a solution, it's just sort of ""we are brothers in adversity"".... Even if it's something like the sofa is lumpy."
Oh compared to some European countries English kids are babies but I'm talking relative to Americans. English people from small towns tend to be different from those from London or a big city as well in the sense of how dependant they are
"And if you have specific questions about Reading, you can probably try r/Books."
"I'm 25, and would find 17 to be disconcertingly young.  It's not just about physical characteristics either, but emotional maturity and overall mental development."
"I'm an MRI radiographer in a large NHS hospital in the UK.



Small Bowel MRI takes 20-45 minutes depending on local protocols. The scan will consist of many short scans of 10-20 seconds where you will be required to hold your breath.


The scans are very noisy, and you will be given earplugs and/or ear defenders - there is an intercom system built into these so you can talk to the radiographer doing your scan. 


It's important that no metal objects are taken into the scanner, as it uses a very strong magnetic field to produce the images (this is brilliant - as it means no ionising radiation is used). If you have had any previous surgery, or have had injuries where metal has entered your body (especially the eyes), you should let the MRI department know before you turn up for the appointment....they may need to do some extra investigations to make sure its safe to scan you. When you arrive, you will screened by a member of staff to make sure you are safe. 


Before your scan, you will often have to drink something for 30-60 minutes to highlight the bowel. This is usually a mixture of water, mannitol (an osmotic drug designed to draw fluid into the bowel). It is quite common for this to have a slight laxative effect, and it's normally fine for you to go the toilet if required.


You can often listen to music during an MRI, depending on the make of scanner or the set up in the department, you can request a radio station, or bring a CD, in our department we use internet to stream music from YouTube. Not sure how common this is elsewhere. 


Small Bowel MRI requires you to hold your breath for most of the sequences, it may be impractical for music to be played as you will need to be able to hear the breathing instructions given to you. The radiographer will explain all - as a general rule of thumb, keep still and hold your breath when instructed to, you can't go far wrong.


We give a contrast (dye) injection towards the end of the examination - this will not give you the side effects experienced with the CT dye. It's different stuff. You may also get an injection of Buscopan - this is a drug designed to temporarily stop the peristalsis of the bowel - it will greatly improve the quality of the images.


If you are claustrophobic, it may be worth obtaining a mild sedative prescribed from your GP before your appointment (its not commonly available once you get into the department). Make sure you know how long it takes to come into effect, and how long it's likely to last. It won't knock you out completely, but it should take the edge off. Warn the radiographer that you are claustrophobic, they are used to this and will be able to help you though the examination. 

Try to concentrate on your breathing and remember that you are in complete control of the situation - you will be given a panic button that you can squeeze if you want to stop the examination. If you are really anxious, it may help to take somebody with you - for MRI, it's perfectly safe for them to remain in the scanning room with you, they will have to be screened for safety and wear ear protection. Some people prefer to keep their eyes closed during the scan - it really helps.



I can answer more questions if you need more help.

"Good lord some of the responses in this thread! While it certainly sounds easier for us to ignore black identity in the UK, it's not quite so easy for someone who's going to grow up with that identity assigned to them. I've worked with many young people of colour who have experienced intense distress as a consequence of feeling disconnected from their racial identities. What OP is doing is commendable. 

It would be helpful to know where you are located and your daughter's age to offer more specific advice, but [Time For Kids](http://www.timeforkids.com/minisite/black-history-month) have BHM resources. Black History for Beginners is a good book for teenagers. I would also suggest giving New Beacon Books a ring and asking their advice (or just going there if you are based in London). I've taken a few teenagers I've worked with there. Can't recommend it highly enough. 

If you haven't already, it would also be good to get some positive writing around having black hair and skin in terms of beauty. These are really big issues for black teenage girls and a lot of institutionalised racism manifests around issues of beauty in adolescence. I strongly suggest looking into it - it's a growing space with a lot there. 

Edit: Forgot to mention, if you're anywhere within reach of London there are a few local black history organisations I've co-worked with who I can point you to. Let me know! "

"British people not liking British food is a new one on me, I've never heard of it 

Preferring to go for something from another cuisine when going out to eat is understandable. There's such a plethora to choose from, and picking something you'd never-cook / never-know-how-to-cook at home is a good restaurant experience.

The reputation of 'bad british food' is one of those tired old stereotypes that get trotted out by people who know nothing about Britain except tired old stereotypes. Like, we all have rotten teeth, or it rains non-stop every day all year round."
Definetly true. Traveling as two London teenagers none of the Americans could believe we were 18 and said their 18 year olds are still very much kids. Whereas all the UK 18/19 year olds they had met were always just more grown up all round (noticeable when watching 18 year old americans trying to cook by themselves for the first time lol)
"I have never understood why I feel so uncomfortable about the concept of ""Roasting"" someone , but would feel fine about insulting a very close friend. Perhaps the idea of asking someone to come and have their leg pulled is the odd bit. It should grow out of a natural situation , in my mind."
"If they're from Bristol they're probably pretty laid back. Don't worry too much. 

You might need to find a Bristol to English dictionary though. "
"There's a difference between American and British universities too (or college they call it) - here in the UK it's a fairly independent thing, you pretty much just sign up and it's up to you to do the work, go to lectures, ask for help etc. In the US, from what I've learnt, it's a lot more like a school environment. So that makes our kids more independent than American ones - they have to be when they move out to uni. "
"I think a more important question is why don't we as society give people benefit of the doubt before they are convicted and also legal protection against discrimination.

I was arrested for wounding with intent and criminal damage and held overnight and then released on bail for three months without charge and then eventually the case was dropped. In the meantime I was sacked from work. I even had to push hard just to get a letter from the police detailing that there was no charge or further investigation. Took me about another month to get back clothes and a bag containing personal property and also some hand tools that were taken from my house and even then I had to travel to a police building a few towns over where they held the stuff.

All my neighbours from that time that witnessed me being dragged away by about 6 police who arrived in 3 vehicles probably still think I'm guilty."
