"That is beyond fucking bullshit (I mean, we just had a thread on here about benefits &amp; the rules for housing benefits are that two kids under 10 of different sexes = one bedroom allowance, so the idea that this is a law is just utter made-up-on-the-spot horsecrap).

Either this guy is horribly misinformed, or deliberately making up total (and kinda obscene) lies to try to push buyers into more expensive properties.  No way on earth I'd buy anything from him, and yes I would write to the estate agency and say exactly that."
"Not sure how recent this is; in 2015 I was told by a nice old (white) lady in a remote New Zealand town that Birmingham, UK, was 'under shariah law' and a 'no go zone for white people'.
As it just so happens, I'm white and live in Birmingham, so we were able to have a little conversation, with phone photos of my favourite places, about how Fox News might not be, you know, quite right about this.

So, 'recently' as in the last 5 years, yes there's been an uptick.  There's always been anti-UK-propaganda for specific things e.g. trying to make the NHS look shitter than it is to justify not having decent state healthcare, etc."
Only Jacob Rees-Mogg &amp; he’s a right cunt. 
"My go-to response these days to reddit idiots who insist such-and-such a place is a Sharia law no-go zone is go to Google  maps and see far away they are from a pub. 

For example the Islamic Centre in Sparkhill is a 6 minute walk away from the nearest pub. That's a pretty crap no-go Sharia law zone, methinks."
"Complain to the estate agent, then the property ombudsman. "
"I've never heard that. Every married man I know wears a ring. Not necessarily an expensive one, but still a ring."
"The appropriate response is to put up with it until it is safe to overtake or the car is no longer following you.

If you are not on a road with a minimum speed limit then the 60mph is just an indication of the maximum safe driving speed. That does not mean that one has to drive at that speed, nor that it is safe to do so. "
Please put in a written complaint. This agent is a lying cunt of the highest order. Wouldn't believe a word coming out of his/her mouth.
"At the UK side: yes, there is absolutely no qualification required to launch and operate any boat (for non-commercial purposes) in the UK. Nobody will be stupid enough to rent you a boat for such a journey without some suitable qualification (say, the RYA Day Skipper qualification for the class of boat in question, and probably some kind of Yachtmaster qualification for a voyage like that).

On the Netherlands side: if the boat is more than 15m long or capable of speeds of 20kph or higher, you'll need a Klein Vaarbewijs, (Beperkt) Groot Vaarbewijs A or B, or Groot Pleziervaartbewijs, depending on the details of the boat in question. Depending on where you are going, you will probably also need an International Certificate of Competence. 


Also: fucking *don't*. Sailing across the channel is the sort of activity that gets people killed on a regular basis when they try to do them without knowing what they're doing. You are talking about crossing the busiest shipping lane in the world, at least partly at night, potentially in a storm (serious storms *do* blow up the Channel on a regular basis), including navigating out of sight of land for a good chunk of the route, entering/leaving a busy shipping port with a traffic control scheme at one end of the journey, and quite likely both (guess where most of the boat rental places are?). 


That being said, there is one reasonable way to do this: find somebody who does skippered charters. That is: hire a boat that comes with somebody competent who can keep you alive. Look for somebody with at least Yachtmaster qualifications for the skipper. 

Sincerely, somebody who has and teaches most of the above qualifications, and who has rescued other idiots who have tried to sail across the channel while being completely incompetent. "
"When I were a nipper, my Mum and Dad's friends' son was awarded a *gold* Blue Peter badge. The fucking Nobel Prize of Blue Peter badges.. As you'd expect, he was a swatty little cunt, and is now an MP.

"Ex-police.  Worked in an old pit town that became a ""no-go"" area for a few weeks.  We had to attend incidents in groups of 3.  2 people to attend the incident and one person to make sure the car wasn't attacked.

It was a maze of alleyways and shitty streets.  Had bricks chucked at us a few times, but the idiots doing it never had the guts to actually attack us.  They always ran.

We flooded the area and arrested a few and the whole thing died down.

It had nothing to do with race, the locals were just dickheads."

I'd probably quiz that agent on why they were thinking about my 2 &amp; 4 year old fucking.

"Ex-police (just so you know where I'm coming from).  I don't give a fuck either way, the only thing that makes me happier than not that it is illegal is because it stinks.  If you smoke it then you don't realise how fucking horrible it is.

That said, I would quite glady support legalisation but would be in support of it still being illegal to consume in a public place like they do in Amsterdam."

I think you mean a first home.
"You are thinking of [Recieved Pronunciation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation), the phrase 'Queen's English' refers to English with correct grammar and no dialect phrasings and doesn't necessarily involve accents, although they are generally closely related in any case. The stereotypical clipped voice of a 1950s newsreader is spoken by virtually none. 

Many people, myself included, can 'code switch' between RP and a more informal style of speech. I speak naturally with a mild-to-moderate Nottinghamshire accent but can shift to a much less distinct RP speech pattern as suitable, usually if I am speaking on the phone, to someone unfamiliar with my 'natural' way of speaking, or in a more formal setting like a job interview. A lot of people call this their 'Phone Voice'. 

"
"No, but then again I live in the UK rather than paranoid imagination land."
"It's honestly a little confusing. Like, how many times can you explain that the UK actually ranks higher than the U.S. in numerous freedom indices? I mean no, we're definitely not a perfect country, but all this 'post-Orwellian nightmare' stuff is just embarrassing at this point. I think there's just a subsection of the world that purposefully seeks out news or info that'll confirm their preconceived notions. Confirmation bias and all that. "
"Sparkhill? You're considerably more likely to find yourself fending off offers of free food than an Islamist.

As far as I know, the only no-go areas in the entire history of the British Isles have been in parts of Ireland. Some places in the North are still tricky now for people with the wrong surname but it's a lot better than it was 20 years ago. Thank fuck."
"I was home taught for a bit and on the day I was meeting my new teacher I wasn't feeling the best so I hear a know at the door and go and answer it. Half asleep and with a headache. 

Me: ""Hi there it's nice to meet you' *shakes hands* 

Teacher: ""Hi there RockinMadRiot, I'm Gay"" 

So I think for a few seconds looking shocked why they they would tell me that and answer with 

""That doesn't matter"" and smile 

I found out a second later that that was her name. "

"Your mate is on a mad one - bride(s) and groom(s) get rings at a wedding and each wear them daily.

That said, a wedding ring tends to be much more plain than an engagement ring. "
"Nope. I grew up in a small town which was literally divided down the middle by the high street - the white population tended to live on one side and the Muslim population on the other. 

The Muslim population is made up of the 2nd/3rd gen descendants of the 1st gen immigrants from the 1950s/60s, most of whom came from the same town in Bangladesh. When they arrived they experienced rampant open racism and job discrimination, being paid a pittance in the factories for work that white people were paid double for. 

It isn't really surprising to me, given that, that they a) chose to live near to each other and form a community and b) chose to set up their own businesses rather than be exploited as employees. 

And nor is it surprising that only a few decades later, despite social progress, those communities and businesses remain. For what reason would they voluntarily break up a thriving community?

So the suspicion around majority-Muslim areas and their 'refusal to integrate' has always confused me. People want to live near their friends, family, near to where they work, where they worship, etc. Isn't that natural? "
Internet shopping.
Then a local newspaper.
We're not getting on very well with Russia at the moment so I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians were pumping out as much anti-UK propaganda as possible and the US right seems to lap that shit up.

"I don't want to smell it wherever I walk. Manchester is bad enough at the moment. If it's going to be legal, it should only legal in your own home. Absolutely no need for people to be walking down the street smoking it. "
"I used to live in a lovely village. But my close and the neighbouring one were ruined by travellers who occupied the few social houses there. Always fighting, drinking out the front, playing music out the front, more fighting, let his horse on my lawn. Kept his horse in his tiny back garden and it got really thin. Blacksmith parked blocking the road for hours while the horse was shod. Broke the horse in on the road, resulting in it escaping and running dangerously down the road where kids were playing. Bred dogs. Dogs kept outside and whined all night. Dogs pooed on my path. Burnt rubbish in his garden. Kid shot my cat.

I was scared to do anything about it. I phoned the police when my cat was shot but they didn't do anything. I would never go out in my front garden because they were always out the front."
"They have a pretty flexible attitude to the law which can be rather an inconvenience to the people around them who have to deal with the consequences of their actions.

Substandard and fraudulent building/gardening/drive laying work, theft, distraction burglary and so on can be a real burden on the people who experience it and they don't tend to clear up their waste and litter when they move on either."
"&gt;They parked up in a leisure centre car park, which shut the centre

Surely this tells you everything you need to know about who they are? Overall on the things gypsies tend to do, shutting a leisure centre is definitely not the worst. But the fact that a group of people will still choose to use that car park knowing they are denying anyone else the opportunity to use a publicly funded service, you can start to understand why they are so loathed.

The only people that defend gypsies are the people that have not had to deal with consequences of gypsies camping illegally. "
"Yes, you can go to the Bank of England.  It's actually an unusual (and kinda cool) experience to have, and somewhat fun.  Enjoy it.

"Its the Boot theory of economics from Discworld.

Samuel Vimes earned thirty-eight dollars a month as a Captain of the Watch, plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots, the sort that would last years and years, cost fifty dollars. This was beyond his pocket and the most he could hope for was an affordable pair of boots costing ten dollars, which might with luck last a year or so before he would need to resort to makeshift cardboard insoles so as to prolong the moment of shelling out another ten dollars.

Therefore over a period of ten years, he might have paid out a hundred dollars on boots, twice as much as the man who could afford fifty dollars up front ten years before. And he would still have wet feet.

"If you get nowhere with them at first put in a complaint you may get better results. As a previous complaints manager for a bank (not Santander and no longer in the industry) I advise you go down the exec route and email the ceo (I Googled for you, it's; ceo@santander.co.uk) this will give you some level of priority as the ability to Google ""santander ceo email address"" elevates you to celebrity level (or did at my place at least).


The banks used to (and may still have) a habbit of paying zero interest on dormant and forgotten about accounts. Don't accept that. They had a Fiduciary Duty (use those words in your complaint) to look after your money in a responsible manner. And as you were 18 and a Vulnerable Customer due to being financially inexperienced (use those words in your complaint) you trusted them to look after your money for you. 

Also play the Ombudsman card and say you'll go the the FOS if it's not resolved to your satisfaction. The FOS charge banks £800 to look at a complaint regardless of the outcome so that always plays a part in their cost analysis. 

Good luck and I hope this may help slightly

Edit due to comments:

I did state at the start to complain if the 1St request goes nowhere. Should probably have made that clearer 

I agree that the exec complaint system is bullshit and I disagree with it. I hated working exec ones as, like I said, it's giving people special treatment for knowing how to Google. I am guilty of this myself but I figure it's not a hidden system and it's up there on moneysavingexpert and all those things so why not? Not totally justifiable but why not play the game 

I would fully advise not being a dick as that will get you nowhere. Be polite and courteous and if possible make them laugh/smile. I was far more inclined to help nice people. 

I stand by my original statement that OP is due interest on this money. That is a fact. I haven't told them to lie, I just suggested some correct wording so they get what is rightfully owed. Not profiting, and the company DOES have a responsibility to reunite customers with dormant funds as linked in this thread. 

I hope the 1St request is successful for OP but if not then a complaint is justified."
"I got told by a friend who lives in California that his boss says he will no longer visit the UK because ""it's not what it was"" and that there are ""no-go areas for whites"".

He’s putting it on too. That’s not how someone of his background would naturally speak.
"1) All depends on context - somewhere like a pub or with friends you know won't take it the wrong way it's totally fine. On the other hand, it is still the strongest swear word we have, I work in TV and it's one of two words (the other being MF) that we have to warn or apologise for no matter what time of night it goes out. If it is being said in an aggressive manner that is taken particularly seriously.

2) Put tea bag in mug, pour hot water, add milk.

3) Any time of day, particularly at work. I'm on a night shift right now and a colleague has just done probably our fifth tea round of the night.

4) On those rare hot, sunny days which happen from time to time. Or mad people in the middle of winter.

5) Class is still a big thing in society here and you can tell a lot about a person from their accent (it's astonishing to people I know from other counties just how small an area a particular accent can come from here) but I think Tafydoolboot is right, these days it won't necessarily tell you the whole story.
