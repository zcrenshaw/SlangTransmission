"I'm completely against them. Anyone suspected of doing a crime shouldn't be 'investigated' by a group of chavs. It's the police and CPS who are trained and qualified to investigate and prosecute. 

These groups are just causing more work for the police because they are committing crimes themselves; harassment, keeping a person against their will and hate crime for the person you described as special needs. Assault and harassment for the person dragged out his house."

Cornwall is one of the poorest, worst-infrastructure regions in [northern europe](https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/cornwall-second-poorest-region-northern-617199) let alone england.  In terms of reaching other regions/countries... By car it's a couple of hours from Truro to even reach the beginning of a motorway.  By train a similar story, there's nothing high-speed about the line beyond Exeter.  The only airport really is Newquay, which isnt very cheap.  Even local exploration is tricky without a car, population density is low = bus services poor to nonexistent.  Hell it's tricky _with_ a car, [typical cornish lane](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7c/42/c0/7c42c0b1a1554db61b89cdd29da2d6a0.jpg), no visibility, single lane, traffic is a mixture of locals gunning it at 50, clueless tourists, random farm machinery and animals....

Dont get me wrong, it's my favourite place in the world pretty much, so I'm not saying you're in for a bad time, but there's no denying the transport situation is pretty bad.  (I suppose thinking about it, probably if it had amazing transport links it wouldnt be so lovely...)"

No.
"Music started off as dance and rave (think songs like ""I'm a Dreamer"" and ""Ebeneezer Good"") then we had the Boyband and Girlband explosion (Take That, Spice Girls, Boyzone, Westlife) before the Brit Pop era in the late 90's.

There was also Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst and the whole Brit Art thing, which together with Brit Pop fed into the whole Cool Britannia thing.

Big TV events included Italia 90 and Euro 96 - the only time in the last 40 years our football team haven't disgraced themselves.  Everyone seemed to watch Friends too.  Oh, and you could seriously suggest the Simpsons was the best TV show of all time and not hear much objection.

You had the rise of Lad Mags and lad culture too, although I think this was just naming something that was already there really.

Politically, Labour winning in 97 felt like a big change, and a big hopeful moment, that obviously soured, but not until after the millenium."

"Do a search on r/policeuk, they generally find them distasteful.

Personally i think that police need to go about charging these ‚Äúhunters‚Äù with assault and false imprisonment if they keep it up. It basically shows that the UK police are weak and unable to do their job if they so much as tolerate these groups or fail to take into account their wrongdoing.

I‚Äôm all fine with someone pretending to go online as a child and *waiting* for paedos to contact them (its a fair bit of legwork by several people, often for months before they get a hit) but going out and actually confronting someone on camera (clearly for their own personal gain/recognition) is wrong if you ask me and could easily taint the jury pool leading to the case being thrown out.

They do it for their own personal gain, not to protect their community. Most of them couldnt pass Special Constable selection if they tried and a number are probably fantasists who get off on pretending to be a little girl, or use it as an excuse to receive/posess child porn (since probably some of them do it so they can get the pictures from pedos, beat off to them for a bit and then report it to police and say they caught a pedo)."

"The important thing is, you tried."
"In 1984 the government passed the Cable And Broadcasting Act, which paved the way for cable TV companies to start up in the UK. The country was divided into a dozen or so cable regions and the rights to run cable TV in each region was put out to tender. So initially there were many cable TV providers, but within about 10 years a series of mergers and takeovers meant there were now just two: ntl and Telewest.

Then in 1988 and 1989 two competing satellite TV services launched: BSB (British Satellite Broadcasting) and Sky.

In the mid to late 90s two more things happened in the industry: ntl and Telewest merged, and then the combined company was bought by Virgin Group. And BSB more-or-less went bankrupt, merged with Sky to form a company called BSkyB which later rebranded back to Sky again.

And that's roughly where we are today.

"I've never understood this. We had people in school who saw it as a badge of honour to say ""I've never had a shit at school"", whereas there was me curling one out every morning.

In uni me and my mates actively seeked out the best poo-ing toilets, my personal favourite was near the top of a tower block that housed all of our labs, for whatever reason the last cubicle was huge and didn't have frosted/privacy glass and the view over the city was good.

In work though, I don't think it is weird. I think perhaps that is down to the fact we have individually contained floor to ceiling walled and doored cubicles in our loos though.

I actively save my morning poo for work these days, the loo paper we've got here is beyond my wildest dreams compared to the crap I buy at home."

"The problem is that these people who go online pretending to be a child to try and catch a paedophile often, even if unintentionally, are doing so via entrapment. The evidence would never make it to court because it'd be thrown out.

"I've always been against them, for a few reasons.

1. If you're ""fighting"" against something, you should be able to spell it. It's Paedophile, not pedo or pedofile etc. If you can't, I don't think you're the right person to be investigating it.

2. There's a whole lot of complicated, psychological causes behind this particular issue, at treating it like ""you should be hanged for this"" helps no one - it doesn't prevent offending and doesn't help those at risk, either of offending or being targeted. 

3. Mob justice is wrong, and we shouldn't allow it, or vigilantism, to go unchallenged by the police. 

4. What these ""groups"" do can ruin ongoing investigations into alleged criminals. 

5. When they get things wrong, and they do, people's lives are ruined. We have no process for proving people innocent in this country, so if you're wrongly accused it can, and often will, ruin your life.

6. If these groups truly cared about justice, they wouldn't post it to facebook, they'd work with the police and hand in their evidence and allow the police to work out whether there's any crime, or realistic chance of a crime, being committed."

"On the war itself? I feel like it was a necessary evil. It was a military invasion by Argentina of a British territory, and the locals wanted to remain British. What kind of message would it send if we just let them take it by force? Particularly during the Cold War. It's one thing to relinquish territory through negotiation and handover a la Hong Kong, but if someone invades recognised British territory I think it's only right we defend it.

As for the dispute since then, as far as I'm concerned Argentina forfeited any claim they had to the islands when they invaded them."

Shut down some local recycling centres to save money with everyone using the more central main one.

"Swansea Council must take the cake. Here's a potted history of just one recent project - the Kingsway. Was once a popular street for shopping and bars/clubs, but had slowly been in decline.

Anyway, council wanted to improve traffic flow in the city, so in 2007-ish, they dug up this main city centre road to accommodate ""bendy"" buses, making the whole city centre a giant one-way system in the process.

- Businesses on the route suffered during two-year long construction, and afterwards due to lack of parking and lower footfall. Also, no one driving into the city would have a clue how to navigate the one-way route.

- New road system meant one side of dual carriageway traffic flowing only east but the other, for buses, flowing in both directions. Confusion caused no end of near misses for pedestrians and a couple of deaths.

- In 2015, the bendy bus project was ditched six years after council spent ¬£10m ripping up city centre roads to accommodate them: https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/swanseas-kingsway-gets-new-one-10370314

- In 2015, council changed the road layout to one-way on both sides of the carriageway to help prevent accidents. http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-33906459

- At the same time, they placed ugly metal fences the whole length of the street to stop people crossing except at designated points: https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/barriers-erected-swanseas-kingsway-council-9028330 

- Did I mention they covered over a pedestrian underpass as part of construction? Image: https://www.peoplescollection.wales/items/27138

- In 2017, the council decides to regenerate the Kingsway into a ""leafy digital district"". Part of project is to knock down old nightclub/cinema to move council offices in.

- The current council offices are on the seafront, and the building also houses the main central library, which was moved and rebuilt there from its home in the city centre (near Kingsway) in 2007. The whole thing will need to move again as well.

- New regeneration involves returning the Kingsway back to a two-way layout as it was originally, so the whole road will be dug up again, costing another ¬£12m.

"Because they just kept the numbering from the Kingdom of England.

There has been a suggestion that they take whichever number is higher out of the English and Scottish line. So for example if there were a new king James they would be James VIII as before the union Scotland had a James VII, even though England has only had two James's.

That's not an official rule though, it just happens to hold true for all the monarchs since the union as none have had a name which would have a bigger number under the Scottish numbering."
