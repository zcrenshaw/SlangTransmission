Pretty good. I'm spending £100 a week on fags and booze to ensure I will never need a pension.
"The superior feeling when you're finally in Year 6 and get to sit on the PE benches at the back of the hall during assembly, instead of on the floor like the little kids."
". Extremely poor worklife balance. Teachers can easily work eleven hours a day in some cases. 8-00am to 8-00pm is disgustingly common. Teachers often have to spend at least half a day each weekend working aswell. Yes they get more holidays but is it worth it too have your life crushed by work 85% of the year?

. What is crushing you and causing so much work? Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork! Teachers here will know better than me but the sheer amount is incredible. Of course they have to do homework, lesson plans, coursework and exams etc. But the amount of extra forms and spreadsheets that need doing is insane. 

. There is constant skull crushing pressure from those above. Be it school leadership to central government. More and more is being put on teachers with less and less support. These often resolve around academic targets for students. 

. Little space to actually teach and explore your subject, show your passion etc. Teaching for ages 14+ (Year 9) is teaching  for the exam. Nothing more nothing less. It can be soul crushing. 

. Poor pay. Teachers can be paid well but considering the academic and personal skills to be a teacher - they could be paid alot more working in the private sector.

I urge you too look at teacher dropout rates. They are crazy. The sector is hemoraging staff. It is now common to see teachers teaching subjects they are not trained and for schools to stop teaching subjects entirely. Any teachers in this subreddit - thankyou for doing your job, your a credit to our community and your work is thankless. Thankyou!

Edit: behavior issues vary majorly from school to school and neighbourhood to neighbourhood. Broadly speaking teachers struggle to discipline students due to lack of severre punishments, no support from parents (some parents in UK are complete shits) and the fact that the school has to keep the student until the final straw. It is shocking what kids can get away with. Furthermore if you take one wrong step as a teacher you and your pension can say bye bye.

If you want a good insight into British teaching look at the 'Educating [placename]' TV series made by Channel 4."
"All English people are British, not all British people are English.

The vast majority of people that are from England won't give two shits if you refer to them as English or British.  If anything, there will be a slight sway towards people preferring British over English.  ""English"" carries certain overtones of nationalism that some don't want to be associated with.  

On the otherhand, calling non-English Brits such as Scots ""English"" may cause offense.   

Sticking with ""British"" is the safest by far. 

EDIT:  I am from England.  Refer to myself as British but not offended if someone calls me English."
"There's a primary school on it, we have street only parking and parents don't give a flying shit if they block you in or not because their *special little angel* can't walk 15 fucking feet further so I'm not blocked in and able to go out myself.

Newsflash, Janet - nobody is going to kidnap your kids. They're only special to you, everybody that lives here wants to run them over so you won't fucking block us in any more. Park your Chelsea tractor somewhere else or god forbid *walk* the lard arse to school.

One of the wealthiest councils of the country also boasts the lowest council tax (Wandsworth). Council tax is set by the council depending on their spending priority and expenses. I suppose if anything it makes sense that wealthier areas have less council tax because there is probably less demand on council services. It could also be that they are simply run better or more efficiently. It’s not a means-dependent tax like income tax.
"Brown Sauce - HP, anything else is peasantry

Milkybar Buttons - Shits like crack cocaine

Tea - Yorkshire tea, obvs. (fight me)

Coffee - Get that Nescafe Al-Qeada stuff if you don't have a coffee machine

Milk - Semi-skimmed is the least offensive, usually green. Gold top for baller status.

Bread - Thick sliced minimum, Toastie Loaf is life.

Cheese - Real cheese, none of that plastic Kraft stuff, you're in a civilised country now.

Bake at Home Baguette - Good to have on supply if you fancy some warm bread and pate.

Pate - Duck and orange

Beans - Heinz preferable, even better if you get the ones with sausages in them. Branston would suffice.

Crisps - You'll, incorrectly, call them chips. Walkers are Lays but the colour of the packaging will be different. Vary your purchasing of these, you don't want to eat Walkers for the rest of your life when you could be living it up with Kettle Chips.

Chicago Town Microwavable Pizza - A gift from the gods quite frankly.

Carpet Picnic Ingredients - We're talk pork pies, scotch eggs, sausage rolls here. The brown sauce will accompany all of these. If you see anyone using Ketchup with any of these then you are within your rights to never speak to them again."

"My wife used to teach, and I used to refer to myself as a Teaching Widower for that 3-year period. We've told our kids they can become drug dealers, politicians, pimps/prostitutes or even Daily Mail journalists, just don't ever become teachers.

The final straw for my wife in wasn't the hours/workload (or at least not just that) - it was the complete lack of respect and support from *everyone*. From the kids, obviously; no support from fellow teachers who are all in self-preservation mode and enacting their own coping strategies, no help from the Head who is invariably forced to bleed every teacher dry in an effort to get 0.1% better test results than last year, but most of all it's the parents who are invariably the biggest shitheads of the lot. I remember one day my wife coming home in tears (one of many) because one parent had harangued her for giving out too much homework then another had harangued her for not giving out enough. 

Add to this that many scumbag parents expect you to actually parent their kid in all areas where they are failing to do so, plus seeing some really dark under-belly of society stuff like abused kids. Oh, and then OFSTED turn up and tell you you're not doing well enough.

She quit in spectacular style: right in the middle of an OFSTED inspection she had enough of being treated like shit, walked out of the lesson into the Head's office and handed in her notice there and then. Once she was out of there it was like the girl I fell in love with had returned to me, instead of the wrung-out shell of a human she had become.

Don't do it, kids. "

"The first step is to speak to your chosen university and see what their policy is on mature students, they may welcome you with no qualifications. It's most likely, however, that if you don't have any a levels then they will suggest you look into doing an access to higher education course. You can find information about it here. https://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/Pages/Default.aspx

I did this in my late twenties, it's a year long full time course that essentially prepares you to go to uni, gets you running at the education level you need to be, teaches you how to write essays etc. On top of this I also had to get an adult equivalency in maths as I seem to have skipped that exam altogether when I was a teen. 

Good luck, in my experience I have found that universities value mature students very highly as we have the maturity and work ethic a lot of the younger students lack. In my case I was a child that loathed school, never did homework, felt stupid and bunked off frequently, but in later life found I flourished in higher education and am now in the second year of my PhD. Some of us are better doing it it a bit later on."

"No - your phone is asking you what the voicemail number is. The voicemail number is specified by your mobile operator - you don't just get to make one up. It's a literal phone number you have to dial. E.g., 3 is 333 - on all Three mobiles in the UK.

"The estate agent is not your friend and is not working for you (despite the impression they try to give out). Their client is the seller and it is the estate agent’s job to extract as much money from you, the buyer, as possible. A lot of people do not understand this and destroy their negotiating position immediately.

Estate agents are also experts in giving overly positive details of the property but in such a way that they cannot be held to account for it. The use of ambiguous language, unquantifiable terminology and personal opinion is always used to overpromise with no comeback. It is essential that the buyer establishes the facts for themselves rather than trusting the agents."

"I can cook, and well, but I've lived with a number of people who had very strange eating habits when sharing...

One guy I lived with bought frozen breaded chicken fillet type things, frozen packets of microwavable vegetables with peas, carrots and sweetcorn in and oven chips, and ate that **every day**.

I currently live with a guy who buys tinned soup, cream cakes, crisps, bread and eats combinations of those things every day. I've never seen him have breakfast.

Much more commonly people I've lived with are the sort of inexperienced-at-cooking 'assembler' type people who can just about stretch to make a crappy spaghetti/chilli or something, but other than that they're lost. They'll buy ready meal pizza, curry, quiches, ready made salads and occasionally try and make something, but usually really simple things like mixing peas and sweetcorn and tuna into pasta, or buying a pasta sauce, which I wouldn't really count as 'cooking'. These people spend tons of money on eating! I've noticed a few friends of mine who were like this have got really into things like HelloFresh. I think it's more a fear of things going wrong or not wanting to spend the time cooking in this case."

"&gt; and the fact that the school has to keep the student until the final straw.

I can attest to this. Students can get away with a lot before they are removed from the school. This is extremely challenging for teachers because when a student is aware of that too, it disrupts your classes, adds extra pressure and ultimately becomes a consuming part of your job. A lot of it is to do with funding the school receives per number of students.

Teaching has become more about business than actually what it should be about - you know, teaching.."

"The French, Spanish and German people I've met reacted with nothing but indifference to mild irritation when they found out I was British. We're not super popular in Europe, it seems \(Although my experiences in Sweden and Denmark were pretty positive and friendly!\)

By comparison, I got a massively warm reception in Canada, and *especially* in the US.

Americans seem really genuinely enthusiastic to meet someone from another country, which sort\-of makes sense when the place is so huge that it takes hours to even get out of your home *state*. Also, I sort\-of hate to say it, but ""British"" is a very palatable, white kind of ""foreign"" that is pretty universally acceptable, no matter how potentially racist you might be."

"&gt; hermes 

Look here, Watson. 

What is it Holmes?

I think I've found the clue that will blow this whole case wide open.

Hermes nearly always mark your parcel as delivered way before they should. Presumably they get paid if they deliver on time, and they take on way too many parcels whether they can deliver them on time or not. 

In the time it takes for Amazon to be notified, chase it up, fanny around, etc, Hermes will sometimes deliver it, sometimes not. Sometimes the courier swipes it, sometimes they dump it outside the wrong address, in the bins, etc. 

Amazon don't really care (source: they use Hermes), so report it anyway and get a refund/redelivery. They're saying they'll get the police involved because from their point of view there's a good chance that you are the thief. This is enough to put actual thieves off. The police won't give a toss."

"I live next door to students, so that's not great.

I think my student neighbours are from Essex or something (I'm crap at accents but it sounds like the stereotypical accent from that sort of region). Their vocabulary is about 30% ""like"", ""literally"" and ""oh my god yeh"". They communicate by shouting in high pitched voices at each other for no reason other than having no concept of an indoor voice and/or possible hearing problems. Also, the one I share a party wall with thinks neighbours across the street should be able to hear when she gets laid so you can imagine how I feel. 

On the plus side they are moving out in the summer, so I can get some new ones. Holding out for a pair of well mannered geeks this time round.

On the other side is a baby. Fun fact - a baby apparently makes significantly less noise than your average pair of Essex girl students. The baby is fine so far. "
