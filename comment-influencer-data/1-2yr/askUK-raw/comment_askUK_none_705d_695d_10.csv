The Equality Act 2010 is the law that gives employees the right to challenge discrimination. It protects people from being discriminated against because of certain protected characteristics, such as gender, age or disability. Mental health falls under the category of disability.

"The three levels of Brit celebrities in the US -

Piers Morgan - You can keep the cunt

Gordon Ramsay - You're only borrowing the cunt

John Oliver - Never heard of the cunt"
Like their pow camps but with more annoying entertainers and less beheading 
Are you anywhere near the centre? I work near the hippodrome. I can take you to Tesco metro and buy you some food if you like.
"Stop voting Tory.

Encourage others to stop voting Tory."
"&gt; (it's not my problem)

Bingo. 

Hand in your notice, serve out your contracted notice period, move on up to a better paid job.

Succession planning within a team is 100% management responsibility.. Your manager trying to guilt-trip you into staying when you've got a better off is shitty beyond belief."
"This is exactly it.

Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm."
Pick your battles. Randoms  you pass by aren't worth your effort.
"Am I the only person who has never heard the phrase 'to be lifted' in this context?

Sorry to go off topic but to me if someone has 'been lifted', it means they were arrested.
"
"I'd say you're being a bit unreasonable, but at the end of the day it's completely up to you."
"Are bills included in your rent? If not then that flatmate should be paying more to compensate for their SO using things.


Or, in true British fashion, never bring it up and just stew in your anger. "
How about some excessive conversation volume.
"&gt;I got a call from the council about how someone complained there was some suspicious activity in one house and to lookout for activity.

&gt;I was collecting the reg plates of the fake taxis and the times the taxis pull up, as the council wanted the info.

I feel that this is not your job. If the council want this information, they should either be paying you to spend your time doing this or have some sort of enforcement team doing this.

"If this organisation is based in Scotland and is describing itself as a charity and it is not on the Scottish Charity Register then this guy is committing an offence.

If this organisation is based in Northern Ireland and is describing itself as a charity and it is not registered with the Charity Commission of Northern Ireland then this guy is committing an offence.

If this organisation is based in England and Wales then it is only required to be registered with the Charity Commission if it has an annual income of over £5,000. Unregistered charities still need to be organised and run as charities, for example they need to be run by trustees.

The payment part is a bit more complicated. Is your sister an employee of this organisation?"
"At 16, in what I'd assume in a high pressure environment job that pays you the bare minimum you can legally receive, you have approximately fuck all responsibility to even begin to consider addressing your managers shortcomings when it comes to forward planning in what's a notoriously high turnover industry.

Serve the notice period that's required per your contract."
"Ignore the passive aggressive advice in the thread and just be open, honest and nice about it. Sometimes I feel like everyone in this site is emotionally stunted. 

Nothing wrong with saying “hey housemate. I just wanted to say that whilst I do like X and I have absolutely nothing against X staying over from time to time I think it’s a little unfair on us that X is here almost everyday.  I feel like we’ve gained an extra housemate but without the benefit of paying less rent or bills” "
Don’t get a free prescription for paracetamol that would cost 19p in Tesco. 
"John Oliver has sort of sold out his Britishness in my view, because he makes terrible jokes for his American audience that are straight out of every bad British stereotype.  Yes, we all have bad teeth, wear bowler hats and carry umbrellas for the constant rain.  HAHAHA.

So yeah, not sure what he is getting at there.

As for the class system...sort of.  It's sort of constantly there in the background.  I don't think it's a deliberate conspiracy as such, just sort of ingrained attitudes, and simple human tendency to want to work and do things with people like yourself.

It's not a simple question to answer.  It is certainly *not* like an Indian caste system, where some doors are just 100% shut to some people.  But we are, to borrow a joke by Reginald D Hunter, quite good at finding ways to dislike  people the same colour as us."
If it was a random call out of the blue I'd be phoning the council back on a known number to verify it was actually them. It does seem a bit strange.
why wouldnt you just have it at GMT all year round?
"I'd like to go back in time and compare a Yorkie or Toblerone bar from thousands of years ago. Obviously they've been reducing in size slowly over the years, from when they were much bigger in the late 90's to the size they are now. Imagine how big they would have been in Roman times"
Replace the hot choc for Kool Aid 
"&gt; Sorry if I seem so autistic 

Can we not use ""autistic"" to mean socially awkward? Anyway, u/AldiPrice nailed it."
"It sounds like she has failed to pay on time three months running, and so the council are demanding a single annual payment in full rather than monthly installments. They are entitled to do this.

You do not receive a monthly bill for council tax. You get a statement at the start of the financial year, or when you set up a new account. After that you are expected to just pay on time each month, on the 1st or 15th of the month as agreed, either manually or by direct debit. If she has been waiting for the council to contact her each month then she was late with her payments.

Might be worth phoning the council to explain that you’re new to the country and unfamiliar with how council tax works. Otherwise you’re just going to have to stump up for the full year. If you leave early you should get the balance refunded. Don’t dick around with council tax - it’s taken very seriously!

"Totally illegal.

Ring ACAS. They should be able to help you challenge it with minimum hassle."
"Under the Equality Act 2010 if a mental health issue has a substantial, adverse and long term effect on your daily life it's classed as a disability. So no, that wouldn't be legal. "
Not many people know this but [The Pyramids](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/All_Gizah_Pyramids.jpg) were actually life size replicas of the Toblerone from ancient times
"It is a difficult situation, because while it is personally totally reasonable to want alone time in your car, and you don't *have* to give them a lift, at the end of the day they're going to think you're a selfish wanker for it.

Depends how much you care about getting on with your coworkers really."
Ask him how much more he's willing to pay you.
Send a pineapple! Unless you know the right people it's just not possible to get them in this country.
"Remember that a&amp;e is for emergencies.

Add James Corden next to Piers Morgan
"They sowed the wind, and reaped the whirlwind.

Yes, it's monstrous that it *ever* happened and I am infinitely grateful that humanity has (seemingly) moved on from those times, but let's not pretend Dresden was some oasis of peace and isolated from the Nazi war machine that established a precedent for area bombing of cities, without even getting into the other crimes that took place. "
"Do you mean electronic mail? I found one website named [Google Mail](https://gmail.com/) that seems pretty effective, but your recipient must also have an electronic mail address to receive your communication."
"In my experience, anyone who is ""anti-grass, anti-police"" is poor trash that lives in council housing (no offense to decent people who live in council housing, I grew up in it!).


99.9999% of the time you will not see someone with that mindset that lives a decent lifestyle."
"In my experience pretty much all doctor/dentist receptionists are a bit like this - I don't know whether I've just been unlucky, or whether you've been lucky to not have experienced it before. I wouldn't bother complaining. "
"Times like this I wish people would name and shame.  I know why they don't, particularly if they are a small employer.

Might be worth getting in touch with MIND the mental health charity as well.  You cant beat a bit of negative publicity."
"Right? Farmers can set their own schedules, still the same number of daylight hours in a day."
Only ever heard it on Rasta mouse. 
I mean I’m sure drinking beer at 11am in public is frowned in most places...

"KFC is a huge corporation that makes mmions by hiring the bare minimum of employees necessary and paying them shit money.
Hand your notice in guilt free."
I personally don't care about it at all and I've never met anyone that openly admits that they like it either 
"I don't know about charities law (but does ""running a Facebook page"" really count as charity?). The alarm bell for me was that this sounds like an abusive relationship. The Serious Crime Act 2015 created a new offence of ""controlling or coercive behaviour in intimate or familial relationships"" (section 76). 
The offence carries a maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment, a fine, or both. This may be something for your sister to consider *when she is ready*. "
"He wasn't - and isn't - nearly as popular as he is in the US here in the UK. I think he was popular in the stand up scene in the early 2000's, but he was never a major celebrity in the UK like he is in America.

He lived in my home town of Bedford when he was growing up. It's a fairly small insignificant town, so as you can imagine, I got quite the shock seeing [this](https://youtu.be/xKD6gzAz08E) on Youtube."
"First and foremost, do you have the right to live here?"
"You can say anything you like to your friends as a greeting, ranging all the way from ""hello"" to ""oi oi you cunt"". Depending on context  ""wagwan"" is as good as anything else."
"For whatever reason, I'm not sure stand-up translates well across the Atlantic. I'm genuinely curious to know if you've heard of Rich Hall or Reginald D. Hunter, two comedians from the US who are reasonably successful in the UK. "
Welcome to the real world and the way it has been for most people for the past 20yrs :/
Are you going to be on 'Can't Pay We'll Take It Away'?
"I once works at a big IBM fab plant that was out of town. There was a lift culture, normal thing was to give a quid a day. This was 20 years ago so not an inconsiderable amount.

Thing is I had been made late for work more than once, there was this one guy I was knocking up in the morning and he would still be asleep in his bed. So I stopped giving lifts, out right stopped. This went against the lift culture at work. 

So I came up with some rules.

If you were standing next to my car when I was about to get in to drive to work in the morning. You got a lift. 

The same going home. Also going home you get out at my house when I get out of the car. I don't drop you off I don't go out of my way. I would drive the exact same route to and from work irrespective of how many were in the car. They got to walk from my house.

In return I don't ask for any money. If you are not there you don't get a lift. I didn't wait, I didn't go out of my way, but you would get a lift to and from work if you followed the simple rules.

It worked well, there were two or three guys traveling to work with me. Most days they were there some days not, if not they would have to make their own way to work because I refused to be late for work for some piss taker not getting out of bed in the morning.

"
"This.  Don't get too hung up on whether or not this 'really' is a charity and lose sight of the fact that this is clearly an abusive relationship, and even if this guy genuinely is running a not-for-profit, he's still using it to manipulate your sister."
Had to stand behind some shirtless chav in the queue at McD’s and listen to him go full ‘Gordon Ramsey’ over some minor quibble regarding his Big Mac meal. As he yelled ‘Take it away!’ I pictured a low rent version of a French Duke dissatisfied with his foei gras.
"Like Takeshis Castle, but with more forced participation and less empathy for the guests."
"Ah, yes. These are things we should really be having dick measuring contests about."
"""Don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm"".

I like that, I like that a lot."
"Apparently it upsets the farmers, or something.

"Tube isn't for drinking. A normal train is the place for drinking at 10 in the morning.

You can talk to people you know on the tube, why would you want to talk to strangers though? "
