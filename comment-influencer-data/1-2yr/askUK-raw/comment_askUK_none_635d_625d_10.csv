"This seems like a really strange set of circumstances that is probably beyond anyone who trawls this sub. My advice if you haven't already would be to get in touch with a lawyer who specialises in death and bereavement and follow their advice.

Also consider that of they genuinely did not know he had a wife they are probably assuming you are attempting an inheritance scam of some sort.

Proceed with caution, good luck and of course sorry for your loss."
"At 16 you're allowed to make your own medical decisions, and you get the same confidentiallity as all other adults.

You're allowed to chose your GP, so if you're worried about someone at your GP surgery you can chose a different surgery.

You should discuss this with your GP, because there might be options that don't involve circumcision. 

Good luck!!"

"It's utterly outstanding in comparison to the vast majority of the planet (and I'm saying that with complete sincerity). Brits love a good moan and our problems are absolutely minor when viewed objectively on a global scale - so don't take much notice to the litany of woe you find on subs like r/uk and r/ukpolitics etc.

* **Weather** - Shit. Always has been, always will be. Although its hard to beat an English summer spent in a lovely beer garden.
* **Jobs** - Very good. Low unemployment and pretty much every industry has significant presence here. Wages growth is lagging behind inflation, but earning potential in the UK remains higher than most of the world.
* **Culture** - Very good. Hard to answer this one though - highly subjective.
* **Social Life** - Excellent. Amenities and leisure industries are enormous and readily accessible to all.
* **How well government functions** - Better than most governments in the world still. But still frustrating and incompetent in areas."
"Broadly speaking, it feels like the UK is like the world's tutorial island. 

We have mountains big enough to learn to climb, but not too big. Lakes and seas big enough to learn to sail, but not get too lost. Weather that teaches you how to wrap up, but not often where you'll die otherwise, and to top it off, a health system that patches you back up and doesn't then wreck your life.

Pretty good if you want to live life in easy mode, really."

"A degree from Imperial looks really impressive on any CV. With your prior experience you could probably get a really decent placement year if you wanted one of those, too. By the end of the degree, you'd probably be a very desirable person to employ. 

You're only 21, plenty of people haven't got shit figured out by the time they're 24. "
The British are polite to people they don't know or don't like. Friends are mercilessly mocked and insulted.

"You need to be registered with a GP. You can register with any local GP. You don't need to give your existing GP a reason for changing.

You'll need to make an appointment. You call them, and say ""I'd like to make an appointment to see a GP please."" If you want to see a male GP you say ""I'd like to make an appointment to see a male GP please"".

The receptionist might ask why you're making the appointment.

They do this because a variety of people call them - people who are just about to die from eg cancer; people who are having a medical emergency; through to people who are very stable and who just need a refil of meds.

**You do not have to tell the receptionist anything**. It's fine to say ""It's not an emergency, but I'd rather not say over the phone thanks"".

She or he will give you a date and time.  The appointment will be for about 10 minutes.

You walk in and say ""Hello doctor. I'm a bit nervous, this is personal for me, but I think I need a circumcision"".

**Your doctor should have a calm, professional manner and should be able to put you at your ease.**"
"Well that'll be a problem, you can do whatever you want privately but your doctor will ask questions "
"&gt;Plus, in America, we bury people within the week

Yes, I couldn't attend my BiL's funeral because he died on Saturday evening and his funeral was on Monday morning. We didn't know until Sunday morning, and couldn't have got there in time even if we had been able to get flights at such short notice.

In Britain it's all much slower, partly due to legal process and 'capacity'. It'll usually be at least a couple of weeks between a death and funeral unless there are religious reasons for it being sooner. Funerals here are also, generally, much shorter.

It's a bit of a wildcard, but you may be able to get advice and help via the US Embassy https://uk.usembassy.gov/

"They ask questions for your own health, to make sure they're not going to cause you harm/the procedure is something you need understand fully. It is for your own well being.

You aren't going to find somewhere you can just saunter in and have them hack at your bits no questions asked. Or if you do it'll probably be illegal. "
"Nobody here can answer this for you. They look very superficial and plaster cracks for a whole bunch of reasons - it's actually very hard to complete a job and not have to snag it later. Could be due to temperature or anything right up to subsidence.

Your best course of action is to get a structural survey done, and maybe enquire with the neighbours.

On my phone the one looks like cracks at joining pieces of plasterboard but it's very hard to tell. Is it a stud wall to you know? Could even be original lath if so.

What I will say, is that if things like that upset you a 100+ year old house may not be for you. I don't mean that nastily - unless it's been done, it's almost certainly overdue a full renovation."

It should be automatic. If it's a big chain like Tescos/McDonald's/Primark or whatever then I really doubt you'll have any issue. If it's some little local shop/restaurant then it might be worth double checking your first payslip after your birthday to make sure they've remembered. 
"Phone your bank and tell them you would like to dispute a charge, and tell them what you told us. This is usually for visa credit transactions but they may be able to do something for you regardless. 

You'll get the money back and they will then open a case with the merchant and they will usually have to prove you paid for it and received the goods. If they see sense then they may just not dispute the chargeback, however you may have to argue back and forth with them a bit if they do put up a fight."
"I've had it happen a couple of times but really only because I was trying to find a job interview with shit directions, or had just been picked up from the hospital by taxi and was on crutches, or when I started crying embarassingly from shock as a car had hit my bike and wrecked it, hence the taxi.

"To be honest I don't know much about the piping science but it was a pretty big deal back in the 90s, I think 1991, when plungers were declared obsolete in the UK due to new toilet pressures being able to overcome all blockages that were formerly fixed by a plunger. People actually organised big plunger fires down local parks. Today, kids have no idea what one is, sounds like a made up word to them. "
"Reddit is very fond of the word 'thirsty' to describe the attitude of some men, and that's how you come across.

"My advice is to make the commute time personal 'you' time rather than seeing it as something you have to suffer, and do things you enjoy or that improve your life. Avoid working on the train as that just means a very long day (unless your employer let's you skip out early in exchange for train working). 

For enjoyment, Amazon prime and Netflix (both allow downloads of much of the content now) for video content, Spotify premium and Amazon Music are good for offline music listening. Podcasts and radio comedies are also great for offline listening. 

For self improvement, Udemy do a range of cheap courses that can be watched offline. Duolingo is good for language learning and doesn't take up much 3g allowance.

Also buy some over the ear noise cancelling headphones, it makes watching and listening to media content so much better than earbuds plus you don't have to hear people's one sided phone conversations.

And think about what time you want to travel and start work, sometimes getting a train 15 or 20 minutes earlier can be the difference between a journey with a seat and a half empty carriage, versus sitting sweating in an overcrowded mass of people. "
There is probably a thermostat in a warmer location that is switching the whole system off before your room gets to your desired temperature.

"I would say you have every right to call his mother... your mother-in-law.  As his wife you cannot be left out of this.  

Making that call will help you to know whether or not you are being lied to here as well. Everything seems wrong about this.  

Are you able to phone his place of work and talk to his colleagues? How much do you know about his daily life apart from obviously having some sort of direct contact with his sister?  

If he is lying to you &amp; still alive, he needs to be found and exposed. "

Burn all her shoes and present the ashes to her  in a tiny terracotta pot. Australians love stuff like that.
"If your SIL didn't know he was married, why did she ring you? If you don't have an answer for that, I would be inclined to think this is some sort of scam on his part, and that he has got a sister or friend to ring you to try and 'get out' of the marriage. Did the police officer you spoke to confirm his death to you?

It does take a while here to arrange a funeral - my aunt died this year, not unexpectedly, and we had a 4 week wait for the funeral. Wednesday would, I agree, be the absolute earliest the post-mortem would take place, and it might even be later. 

If your husband died in a hospital, I suggest you see if you can contact that hospital's bereavement officer and see if they can offer any assistance. 

Whoever registers the death will need your full name and occupation - I suggest you ensure his family have a copy of your marriage certificate. 

This whole thing is awful and bizarre, and whatever the outcome, I am so, so sorry that this is happening to you. "

"Firstly there are 3 universities. Cambridge, Anglia Ruskin and the Open University. Next, Cambridge is a collegiate university. There is no one location. There are hundreds of sites all over town - colleges, chapels, libraries, halls, faculties, museums, laboratories, sports grounds, the press, the press shop,, Antarctic Survey, souvenir shop, administration offices, facilities management, the gardens, exam boards and so on. The one place you could say was the main building is Senate House but tourists don't tend to go there. 

Stand in any one location in the bounds of the city and there is University ahead of you, behind you, to your left and to your right. It is an impossible question to answer helpfully. "

"Greyhounds and some lurchers can be really fussy about cold/windy/wet weather.  

If you continue to recreate Australian weather she will never adjust, so keep the clothing for outside only,  don't have the heating too high, and keep her really active when out and about, if she is having fun she will forget about the cold, and generate her own heat.  She is sulking a bit , as the breed does given the chance, keep her mind on other things. 

Once she has had a summer she will ease into next winter,  Edinburgh is fantastic for dogs as there is so many interesting places to walk, and there are plenty of greyhounds and lurchers who cope with the weather. "
"&gt; He retired from a government agency a year or two ago

In his 40s and he retired already? I'm calling BS on that, CS pensions are great for people like him but not in your 40s.

Hate to break it to you but this sounds like a really elaborate catfish, did you two actually get married? Did you call the police yourself, rather than being given a specific number to call? You've been supporting him financially? He was getting paperwork together for a visa?

Seriously, you've been had. I'm sorry."
"Out of all of those go for Norwich. It's a really nice city, not too big, not too small. It has a lot of stuff to do considering it's size and there are a lot of beautiful villages outside the city if you prefer rural living. Do not go to Ipswich, great Yarmouth or lowestoft, they are a bit shit and not nice places to live, the only good thing is the living costs can be a lot lower for that exact reason. "

"&gt; the sister has warned me off.

There are a few moments in life where you really need to strap on your butt-kicking boots and, as we say in the UK, ""get stuck in"". This is one of those times. You must be reeling from the news but put the grief to one side for now - you'll have plenty of time for that later. You need a week of single minded determination, you can fall apart afterwards. 

Your #1 priority right now isn't to save anyone's feelings or to make new friends, it's to demonstrate to his family and the relevant authorities that you are his wife and that you demand to be recognised as such. This is a time when it is acceptable to be assertive, even if it's something that his UK family will find it difficult to hear. It's not your fault that they don't know about you - it's his. They will blame you though, because he's not around to question. Make your peace with that concept, they are not likely to become fast friends after this experience.

Get your marriage certificate and some wedding photos together, email them to the family and the police liaison officer. Tell them that you **are** on your way and, as his wife, you will see that the funeral is handled in a way that *your husband* would have wanted - but that you'll listen to their ""requests""."
