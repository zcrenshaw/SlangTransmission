Become Muslim. It's the only option.
"They're probably Northerners, who are a very tough breed."
"No, country pubs are for regulars. I mean it varies on how much passing tourist trade they get and rely on, but mostly they exist for the local population, and the local population are often bastards."
Jacobs crackers are the best
"For me, personally, being too hot is subjectively much more unpleasant than being too cold. 

There's no such thing as the right level of outer clothing that will keep you comfortable when you're inside a shop heated to 22 degrees, and outside in the rain and snow at 5 degrees. So I choose to be comfortable inside the shop. "
"Enjoy your prayer time at work (make them dedicate a room for you) and avoid paying or rounds. Nice one.

Ramadan is going to be shit though. Maybe time a holiday for that."
"Next time they offer you prayer time or something just say ""actually, I'm not really a practicing Muslim. I don't drink or smoke etc cos I'm not really into it due to my upbringing but beyond that I don't really pray or observe Ramadan etc"""
"On your entrance, all regulars in the pub are obliged to stop what they are doing and turn to look at you. If there's music, it should also stop. There must be an uncomfortable and silent moment as you are looked up and down, after which the pub returns to its former ambience."
get out the prayer mat and get on yer knees lad
I can't think of a time I've ever needed a pocket knife or would even have found one useful. I think it's perfectly sensible that people are not allowed to carry a weapon with them. 
Should I tell him guys...?
Die hard 
"Why would you turn to Reddit for this? ðŸ¤£

Phone the Council? It's called COUNCIL tax for a reason."
"Can you slowly get a bit less Muslim?

It might take a year or 2, but you could mention a ""change of heart"" and gradually drop the pretence."
"The uber driver hasn't stolen your phone, you left your phone in their car. You have absolutely no leg to stand on accusing them of anything."
"Premier Inn by far. They're all the same, every single one is perfectly okay.

Best Western, IBIS, Travel Lodge all vary wildly in quality in my experience. You know exactly what your getting with Premier - a decent room, decent bed, decent TV, and an overpriced breakfast. "
Maybe the nords aren't used to it because they wear big jackets
"Generally we don't care.

I mean, I know people excited to have Hamilton tickets, and I'm sure it will do well here.

This was actually one of my ""top 5 American misconceptions"" when it came up in the sub - we barely learn about the British empire, let alone the war of independence.  I've learned more about it from going to the USA for a few days now and again - cos you guys put it *everywhere* - than in 30+ years living in the UK.

The average British person would just about know a) we lost b) there was some tea-throwing in Boston c) we were sorta busy with Napoleon and stuff at the time too.  

"
Man can also never be cold. 
"Maybe we're more used to weather being completely random - in Scandinavia it's consistently cold, so you'd never really go out without dressing for it. Here you can leave the house in a t-shirt in the morning and get home in a blizzard that nobody saw coming, so perhaps we're used to making do. "
Â£800 survey to check probably the biggest purchase you make in your life isn't fucked? why wouldn't you? builders fuck up houses all the time
"Personally, I'd go black tie or a suit that is close to as smart. In my experience, black tie optional often means black tie. "

"Thanks, Lenny. The cheque is in the post."
"&gt; the largest ever British military operation overseas up to that point in time

""up to that point in time"" is the key phrase here.

In terms of the grand sweep of British history, losing the American colonies was a very minor event.

In terms of major military events, pretty much every war since American independence has been both larger and more important (specifically: Crimea, South Africa, two World Wars, as well as countless ""minor"" military engagements)."
"Depends on the pub - just because a pub is in the country doesn't mean it's a stereotypical 'country pub', that's for sure.

I travel a lot and I think most places are relatively welcoming. Pubs with a strong local population will always be a little bit wary of strangers - you need to be able to get over that a bit and then try and absorb the local culture a bit. To a degree it's just having a thick skin - I've drank in some seriously local local bars where I won't be returning for sure, but even there they tend to forget about you once you're half a pint in and not causing trouble.

The ones serving food tend to be a lot more welcoming of non regulars. Next to that is ones that promote things like Camra. Good Beer Guide is nearly always a good source, especially the ones with rewards.

Definitely had a few crap experiences over the years, though."
YES BUT 20C IS RIGHT HOT THOUGH
"Yes, obviously. "
Set himself up for that one. 
"Firstly, it's probably because they're American. 

Secondly, they should (and do) have the same rights as everyone else. How easy it is to practically ""achieve"" (for want of a better word) those rights is a different question. "
you're not from round these parts
"Because a car is a physical deprecating commodity also functioning as a money pit when it needs repairing.  Hence they get cheaper as they get older and less desirable.

Insurance is based on the damage a numpty driving a 1.5 ton death machine can do. You can maim as many people in a 1980s Â£200 Ford Granada as you can in a brand new Ferrari and injured people and property are the biggest costs, the value of your car is not that relevant.  (exaggerated example, but hopefully makes the point)"
You need to buy a ticket regardless of whether there is anybody checking it.
"Personally, I think it's bonkers.

here, everyone calls it Christmas, even if they d not 'celebrate Christmas.'

I've had Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, everyone, wish me 'Happy Christmas'"
This is why Islam is the fastest growing religion. Most people join out of social embarrassment
"The best option with Currys/ PC World for me has always been:  
- Choose a model that is also sold by John Lewis.  
- Enjoy their amazing customer service and knowledgeable staff.  
- Bask in the joy that is their price match policy (assuming it isn't cheaper there anyway).  
- Sleep sound with the comfort of their standard 2 year warranty.  
  
Honestly, I have no affiliation to them, I just really despise PC World and switched my purchases to JL years back, couldn't be happier."

Some places have compulsory holidays at certain times. "

I use a knife fairly often at work and also use one often while camping.  I have an appreciation of knives and own quite a few different ones. I also see absolutely no reason for someone for carry one every day unless their work requires it. I see absolutely no reason for someone to carry a knife to the shops or while walking about the streets. Our laws are pretty well suited I think
"Stop worrying about what people at work think. 

Find yourself a nice Muslim girl and get married."
"Legally he'll be fine. 

Morally though, he's driving while intoxicated and increasing the risk to himself and others."
"There's nothing ""politically correct"" about calling people out for sexually touching women (or men!) who don't want to be touched in that way. Even if it wasn't illegal, it's sheer common courtesy and humanity not to coerce someone into a sexual situation."
Just FYI it's half four in the morning.
"It's better to say 'are you an ethnic minority?'

Everyone has an ethnicity, so saying 'are you an ethnic' is like saying 'are you an male'. Doesn't really make sense, ha."
"Bourton-on-the-water.  And when you're done enjoying the picturesque  village, you can go and enjoy the picturesque model village,  and then the picturesque model village in the model village!"
"Actually there have been very recent developments around this.

**TL;DR: Yes, the Snooper's Charter is still in place, yes we're all currently being snooped upon, but the Government have lost at least one court case and are now consulting on amending the law**

You may recall that back in 2014 Tom Watson (now Deputy Leader of the Labour Party) and David Davis (now Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union) took the government to court a while back over the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA).

That case made its way through the court system, first with a win for Watson and Davis, then a win for the Government, then on a further appeal it was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Around this time Brexit happened, Davis was appointed to the cabinet and he dropped out of the case.

In the CJEU the UK case was merged with a Swedish one brought by Tele2, a telecoms company.

The CJEU ruled on the 21st December 2016 in the Tele2/Watson case that provisions in DRIPA were illegal under EU law and sent the cases back to the UK and Sweden so courts in those countries could conclude the cases.

Now since the court case was started and the CJEU judgment being handed down, DRIPA was replaced by the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) in November 2016, containing much the same stuff as DRIPA.

*This week* the Government [has admitted that the IPA is also illegal under EU law](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/30/investigatory_powers_act_illegal_under_eu_law/) and they have [launched a consultation](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/663668/November_2017_IPA_Consultation_-_consultation_document.pdf) on amending the Act."

This makes the meat very chewy though.
BECAUSE WE ARE STRONG BRITISH PEOPLE UNLIKE WEAK AMERICANS
"Yes, there's a rich tradition of folk music. Your country, bluegrass and folk music is largely built on that tradition and the songs and instruments British immigrants took with them to America.

As far as English folk music goes  -  in the early 1900s, as industrialisation disconnected people from their rural backgrounds and  there was a feeling that the traditions could be lost, there was a movement to collect and record traditional songs, largely by [Cecil Sharp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Sharp). In fact, he travelled to America to collect British music that had crossed the Atlantic.

The collection of songs he started and that others contributed is kept by the [English Folk Dance and Song Society](https://www.vwml.org/browse/browse-collections-full-english)

"No and no idea.

I mean, I'm sure *some* people drink it, but it isn't widespread. I don't know what eggnog actually is, but some people drink a snowball (Advocaat and lemonade) which is eggy. "
"I have seven issues with Wetherspoons

"Marks and Spencers do great luxury crackers, bit pricey but they ship free to the US on orders over Â£50  so maybe you could stock up for next year as well? "
How's that unfair? It's the definition of progressive tax.
This whole thing honestly sounds like something out of a TV show and it's too perfect.
"It's more like saying ""are you a gender"" "
"I was going to suggest something like this. Start saying you do this because of your parents/family and only go to prayers with them. Then if it comes up say you sometimes drink or even eat pork, just not around family. Eventually it will not be a big deal. "
