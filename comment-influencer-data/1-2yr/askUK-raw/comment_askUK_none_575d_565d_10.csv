"Just my thoughts on experiences with Americans in London, some will be useful, others less so: 

* Don't constantly compare things to the US in conversations. It is really mundane and often comes across rude
* Don't claim you are Irish/Scottish/Polish/Lithuanian etc to someone who is actually from there, no one sees you anything but American. Your 3/64ths Polish blood is not interesting
* Don't shout when talking will do
* Stand on the right on escalators
* Don't refer to things as quaint, people live in these houses and this is their culture, it seems condescending
* Say please, thank you and sorry more often than you would in the US. Also try to learn the difference between Sorry and *Sorry* we can be pretty passive aggressive people 
* Don't comment on politics you don't understand. Especially if you are a trump fan and start talking about no-go zones
* Black people are black - not English-African-Americans (true story, my friend was referred to this way by an American)
* Asian means south Asian here e.g. Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Indian, not east Asian like Chinese or Vietnamese
* Understand that vast majority of us love Americans (not necessarily the government, but the people), but we will take the piss out of accent or word usage (why do Americans get tap water from a faucet?!?), it is in a friendly way not intending offense
*  Don't talk too much about your expectations VS reality, many of your stereotypes in the US are outdated. For example we don't wear bowler hats, have bad teeth or do that Hugh Grant stammer
* Don't call Irish people British! there is too much history for that and people will get upset. Don't call Welsh, Scottish and NI people English, again people will get upset

Apart from that, have an awesome time and if on the off chance you need any advice on planning what to do, where to go etc, or you need some help when here, feel free to PM me"
Because they're cunts.
"For those of you confused by OP's secondary question, a ""coat"" is like a second T-shirt worn over the top of your main T-shirt, but with sleeves that come all the way down to your hands."
"Personally I am in two minds.  Unlike a fair few redditors, I extensively used the trains pre-privatisation.

British Rail in the 80's was dire.  Exactly the sort of attitude that made our nationalised industries such a disaster in the 60's-70's was everywhere.  No one cared about customers.  Delays were common and never explained.  Front line staff seemed to view turning up as a big achievement.

Since privatisation we've had a big investment in rolling stock on our lines and all the trains are new.  Before that, most our trains were still slam-door right through the 90's.  Customer service also now matters, even if delays aren't much better.

But...

As someone with an economics degree, there really is no good reason they should be privatised.  It's a natural monopoly in economic terms, and impossible to have competing railway lines.  Competition is the good part about capitalism, and without that there is a danger you just get the bad parts.

So yeah... if it could be nationalised and not turn into a job-for-life socialist paradise full of idle staff and a ""just do the minimum"" attitude again, that would be ideal.  Knowing the British mentality though, I have my doubts."
Not quite the correct English terminology and it’ll make you sound like a tourist! If you say “I’ve just been bummed by a bloke down the street” that should do the trick.
"&gt; Don't call Irish people British! there is too much history for that and people will get upset. Don't call Welsh, Scottish and NI people English, again people will get upset

Common mistake. I once asked two ladies ""are you two ladies from Scotland?"" And got back a very angry ""WALES"". 

Of course, I apologised: ""So sorry, are you two *whales* from Scotland?"""

"No. I quite like having a monarch. It's one of those nice little luxuries we can afford.

Also it's pretty useful to have a heavyweight political asset. A royal visit is ridiculously valuable for international relations, and even public event with some high ranking royals will provide a lot of goodwill from foreign dignitaries. "
"My local one is having a closing down sale, you can get two resistors for £10, and HDMI cables are only £50 each."
"When asking for things, like say in a coffee shop, say ""may/can I please have?"" instead of the more American ""can I get/Lemme get *(without saying please)*"" "

"When I rented my last flat, I forgot to pop next door and ask the guy living there if he was a drug dealer whose junkie customers would regularly mistakenly knock on my door looking to purchase drugs."
That sounds like such a tabloid euphemism for gangster 
"Should definitely offer one, but it’s cheeky as fuck for someone to help themselves, IMO, at least without indication that it’s OK

I mean, if someone is working in my kitchen for a week I’m going to tell them to help themselves rather than pop in every couple of hours to offer..."

Basically (according to this) they have to give you 2 days’ notice. Otherwise, if the company is closed, they have to pay you. 

If it’s coming from you (company is open but you can’t get in), they may be able to force you to take the day as leave."
"No. I’m very happy that our Head of State is not a politician. The Monarchy provides a strategic and long termist leadership that exists above the level of petty, trashy politics. Politicians will promise anything in order to get elected and then generally fail to deliver. It is ultimately a short-term popularity contest and there is no incentive to plan more than one parliamentary term ahead, resulting in crappy, transient and inconsistent governance."

I personally wouldn't support a move to be a republic. More democracy doesn't necessarily mean better government. It's the same reason I don't support an elected upper house in parliament.

"I got bummed three times in an hour last time I was in Chiswick. 

Did you enjoy being bummed or was it inconvenient?"
"Oh no this just reminded me of the most embarrassing thing ever. When I was pretty young, maybe 8, a friend and I decided to go to the local park, when we got there there was a group of teenagers there. Me and my friend were talking about how we wished we could hang around with them, they’re so cool and older etc so we started thinking of a plan to make them think we were cool too and I came up with the best idea ever! I told my friend we should go and get our mums to make us a picnic to eat at the park (we’re sounding really cool already, I know) and we could throw our rubbish on the ground when we’d finished each thing, because everyone knows the cool older kids love littering. My friend agreed that it was indeed a master plan so we went and got our picnic, came back and started to eat on the top of a slide/outdoor play structure thing and throwing the packaging from each bit of food onto the floor when we’d finished. About two minutes into this ridiculous debacle, one of the older lads turns to us and says, ‘you’re both proper litterbugs aren’t you? You should probably pick it up and put the stuff in the bin.’. We were absolutely mortified, not only had our master plan failed, we’d made ourselves look much less cool. We meekly made our way down the steps to pick up all the rubbish and put it in the bin.



This is one of the things my brain will randomly remind me of as I’m falling asleep and I end up jolting awake. On the bright side though, I never ever litter, that day I learned my lesson, cool kids don’t litter."
Yeah no shit. People pay the extra money so they don’t have to cook and clean up.
No. Their whole model is predicated on you paying for stuff you don't need - there is less than a snowball's chance of hell of you getting these split out.

"People say bum a fag in the UK often /u/sviwel

They're just cheeky fuckers trying to score a free cigarette.
It's just basic manners. If you invite someone into your home you offer them a drink. 
"Yeah, I bang on about it a bit but I've always considered our police amongst the best in the world. In 1984 we brought in the [Police and Criminal Evidence Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents) which explicitly lays out the rules on modern policing, which is still referred to as ""post-PACE"". Before 1984 it was all a bit Life On Mars, you could plant evidence and give your suspects a bit of a kicking when nobody was watching, but the idea of the PACE Act was to set out in clear black and white what was okay and what was not okay. 

Almost every single thing the police do now have policies and guides, and both the officer and the force have to be able to absolutely justify everything they do; they're actually held to higher standards than the public, as it should be. 

An example - in this country, a police officer does not have to arrest someone unless they personally feel it'd be a lawful arrest. The Commissioner himself can say ""constable, arrest this man as he's harassing me"", and if that constable on day one of their job does not believe that a crime has not been committed, they don't have to perform the arrest and nobody can make them. 

Obviously there are a handful of over-zealous ones on a power trip as you get anywhere, but the difference here is that they're looking to hand out patronising bollockings to people with a headlight out, not to shoot them thirty times for being drunk in public. 

I know they're getting a bad name at the moment, but that's due to having their funding slashed all over the place, so they simply don't have the manpower to investigate every crime, but I'd honestly challenge anyone to find a better police force anywhere in the world, and it pisses me off when people rag on them for things which aren't their fault. 

""Stupid useless police, someone egged my front door on halloween and they didn't even send round forensics to check for DNA or fingerprints, what is the world coming to""

No love. "
"American living here for 4 years now. One thing I've noticed is that although British people famously complain about everything British, they actually get a little touchy when Americans complain about anything British. You can still do it (and really should when trying to fit in with friends here) but be very wary of doing so with strangers or acquaintances. Their moaning does not give you license to moan. They do it with an undercurrent of pride, and from an American it can come off as condescending. 

The two exceptions are weather and trains. These are always acceptable (and often an easy way to strike up a conversation with anyone). Just be careful in your moaning not to compare it unfavorably to America, and generally do so in a near-term this week kind of way. 

Acceptable: ""Can you believe the weather we're having this week? At least it's washed all the bird poo off the platform.""

Unacceptable: ""I'm so tired of the rain. It's so dreary here compared to LA. Don't these trains ever show up?"" 

Also, Brexit. It's not as divisive as discussing Trump in the US, but people have strong feelings. As someone with no real skin in the game, it's interesting to ask people what they think. They're so tired/wary of talking to each other about it that having fresh ears gives them a chance to let it all out without worrying about it getting embarrassing. 

Try to get outside of London and the Southeast. I live in Devon now and I'm always stunned at how friendly and relaxed people are now that I've moved on from the anxiety and stress of the Southeast. 

Also, I just asked my wife (who is British) and she added, ""Talk less loudly. If you lower it way down whatever you say will come across less brash."" I'm not sure if she was talking to you or me. ;)"

"Consider the butterfly effect in chaos theory. A butterfly flapping its wings in South America can cause a massive storm in Europe.

As you go through life you will inevitably make small differences. If it's a smile to the person making you a coffee, or making an effort to care about your colleagues' weekend stories, you can make people happy by being a nice person to them. That's a superpower in my view.

If you're asking about making a difference in such a conspicuous way that Wikipedia write an article about you, that's much more difficult. Start with the little stuff and work upwards. "
"Oh geeeeeeeeeez.

The key words to keep repeating are ""Repeatedly,"" ""Reliably,"" and ""Safely."" If you cannot perform a task repeatedly, reliably and safely, then you can't perform it. That's what their guidelines say. Who are you to argue with their guidelines? Make sure you say the words.

Lastly, good luck again. Don't stress. It'll put you off."
Rabbits are not a native species. The UK was originally bunny free. No bunnies. None. 
"[The Allusionist did a podcast episode about it](https://www.theallusionist.org/allusionist/please). In summary, to Americans (I'm an American who's lived in the UK) using please makes it sound more like a command, while using a ""can I have/get"" or ""let me have/get"" structure frames the situation as if the person in the service position is actually in a position of authority. Even though no one in a service position would actually say no, the phrasing makes it seem like they are less obliged to say yes.

Of course, this is very tied up in differences between the two cultures' understandings of power imbalances. As a field of linguistic study it's really interesting, but in everyday interactions the American style comes off as very brusk in the UK, while the British style would probably get by just fine in the US but seem unnatural. "
Yeah we all like a good bumming first time round. But when the blokes just keep coming it makes you all red and raw. 
"Yes absolutely. We could argue for years about whether economically the country would benefit or not but none of that matters to me. The very existence of monarchy is wrong to me in principle.

It's the biggest hypocrisy of this nation, to talk about equal rights and equal opportunities, to say we're trying to increase social mobility and break down the class barriers, and all the while have the country headed by the greatest symbol of class division and inequality that has ever existed in this land.

It boggles my mind to be honest that British people love the idea of a monarchy so much. I suspect it's because the current monarch is popular. One day when she is succeeded by one that is not so popular, people may start to ask themselves if they don't want a say in who sits on the throne after all."

"People don't realise how often our country is at war. 

2016 was only the second year since 1945 (the other was 1968) in which no British soldiers died on active service anywhere in the world. And then before then, you have a century of British troops on the North-West Frontier in India which was never really at peace, and so I imagine skirmishes, raids and ambushes meant that there was never such a year throughout from the 1830s or so onwards to Indian Independence.

"It comes down to the unwritten social contract of equality

If you invite a guest into your home, you offer them a drink. It's basic manners here.

But a workman, coming to fix something and being paid by you is not a guest, but for all intents and purposes an employee. But most Brits don't like the idea of not being equal, it's actually rather rude, so we offer a drink to make them feel like a guest in the house and they are doing us a favour by fixing the thing.

It's a very British thing to do, but it makes sense once you dissect it.

"More time to do more projects rather than dedicating their entire year to one show.

EDIT: For example, between June 2006 and April 2007, Mitchell and Webb released That Mitchell and Webb look, went on tour for 3 months, and released Series 4 of Peep Show."
"We have a completely mad semi-privatisation system though. Train Operating Companies (TOCs) provide the train services, but they do not own the trains, which are owned by the Rolling Stock Owning Companies (ROSCOs) who lease them to the TOCs. The TOCs also do not own the tracks, which are owned by Network Rail. Network Rail also own the stations and leases the vast majority of them to the TOCs, except the largest ones, which it operates itself. Network Rail is a ""Quango"" (Quasi Autonomous Non-Govermental Organisation) which is run as if it is a private company however it's wholly owned by the government and profits are reinvested into the railway.

To make things more complicated than that there is a complex system of subsides, grants, charges, and payment sharing systems which govern how money is spent, and on top of *that*, the Department for Transport in the Government has the right to stick it's oar in to most decisions.

For example, if you buy a ticket on a route which multiple operators run trains over (for example Swanwick to Fratton in Portsmouth) then the fare you pay goes into a pot which is split equally between whoever runs trains that you could have got on - in this example the operators are South West Trains, Southern, and First Great Western. This amount is also split based on frequency of services - the Southern service in this example would need 2 trains (one being the Brighton to Southampton Central service which does not go down to Portsmouth, the other being the Brighton to Portsmouth Harbour service - changing at Havant) and these run once an hour. South West Trains have more frequent services running from Portsmouth via Swanwick direct so would be about 3 an hour in the right direction. First Great Western offer 1 train every 3 hours to Cardiff Central. Therefore South West Trains would get 60%, Southern would get 30% and First would get 10% (purely as an example, the maths doesn't work)

Freight Operating Companies have to pay for rail access but they generally own their own rolling stock for the most part, have access to the entire rail network and don't need to use stations so save some of the hassle. "
