Sorry for the confusion. It’s short for Lizard.
"Generally we just write a load of £1 cheques before we go out, these can then be used in the same way as $1 bills. "
"We use contactless payments now in the UK so strippers have card readers sewn into their knickers and two points in their bras, then you just tap your card when she’s in your face. I won't explain where it is when she's naked but put it this way - she'll leave you under **no** illusions.

Some strippers charge more than others so check that before you go tapping cause you won’t be getting your money back!"
"We love a song we can sing along to when hammered, everyone knows it so it's an easy choice to play to get everyone moving. See also wonderwall. "
"I steal a bunch of small envelopes from the stationary cupboard at work, place a single pound coin in each, and draw a quick sketch of our Liz on the front. It works well enough."
"This is actually a great question. Most strip clubs these days have currency exchange offices in them that just deal with small denomination notes from other countries. Obviously one US dollar bills are what most people go for but I'm a fan of using the 100 trillion dollar zimbabwe note. 
"
"I feel fine, thanks.

I'm 28."
Let that 72p rain down on her! 
"Just make sure not to place a cut across Her Majesty's face. Leave that intact, otherwise you will be found guilty of High Treason and will hang from the neck until dead."
"This country likes music you can sing when you're drunk. Also, you could try to stop going to such shit clubs and you won't hear it. Student club nights all play the same thing because it's the music your peers knew when they were kids, and nostalgia is the easiest buy tactic for a DJ."
Also it's not particularly tuneful so you can basically just shout it while you're drunk
Miranda Hart makes me want to claw my ears out
"You're asking the wrong question. It doesn't matter what someone does - what matters most is the environment they work in. If you're in a shit company with a shit manager, you're going to hate doing whatever task you're set. If you're in a better company and have a better manager, you'll have a better time. If you can be tolerant of annoyances and work with what you get, you'll have a better time still.

For what it's worth, I do enjoy my job. It's important to - if you're dedicating 2/3rds of your waking day to something you hate, you're squandering your life. "

"&gt; and the social pressure of asking someone to be your prom date 

I think the main difference is there is no pressure to get a date. If you are already in a relationship you go with them, if not you wouldn't really be required to ask someone to go with you. You'd just go as a group with your mates."

"Back when polyphonic ringtones were a thing, I got a ""free premium ringtone"" when I bought my phone. I figured out via a mistake that if I pressed ""back"" after choosing the ringtone I wanted then it downloaded but never registered as such. This meant I got free ringtones while I had that phone. I used to download lots for friends who would give me £1 for the ringtone after I sent it using Infra Red, those were the days"

"KEITH FUCKING LEMON. I don't get it is it a parody? Is it satire? Is he that stupid? Are the guests on his shows in on the joke or are they that stupid? Are people that like him that stupid? Is he a moron? Come on he has to be a moron? Even wanting to pretend to be that stupid must make you a moron, no? "
"I went to V festival in 2006, they were really pushing virgin mobile at the time and they had a little tent where they'd give you a free sim, each sim had £1 credit on it. These sims were in a massive bucket so I just grabbed a ton of them. There was also an offer for 'a free pint if you're on virgin mobile, just text this number and scan your code at the bar' type thing. Sat in my tent for an hour putting these virgin mobile sims in my phone, texting for the free pint and then forwarding that text to my normal number.

Sorted me and my mates out for flat, shit and warm beer all weekend. "

"We use 1st class stamps. The dancer licks them, and they stick them on the inside of the rope barriers. Each dancer has their own set which they roll up at the end of the night, to take to the post office the next morning."
People throw $1 bills at strippers?? That is so stingy! Bloody hell.
"I think this counts as exploiting a loophole. When I went for my first office job back in about 2002 I had an interview and an excel test, as it was for a data entry job. I did well in the interview and then sat down to do the excel test. It was a fiendish fucker of a test, and I later found out it was designed by someone going for the job who made it hard on purpose. Bear in mind this was for a £15k job, you had to do v-lookups, pivot tables and drop down filters. 

So I didnt know how the hell to do this stuff (and there was no internet access) so I thought I was fucked. Then I realised that there were lots of other people who had been interviewed that day. So I went to 'save as', and lo and behold it opened up the folder with all the other excel sheet attempts from the other candidates! I went through them all, which were all quite bad, and then found one that was perfect. I copied that, changed the colours and made it look different, then saved it as my own submission. 

Got the job, and I was complimented on how nice i had made the table look! 

Told them about how i exploited this loophole about 3 years later over drinks and they thought it was very funny and showed initiative."

They aren't the same set up. The dances on the small stage are free to watch and terrible. They get there money from the private dances you pay £30+ for a couple minutes in a room

Hush with your real answers! You can tell a few of the people in this thread have never set foot in a strip club. Might not even be old enough.
"I work in IT, it's pretty straight forward however I have just been interrupted by Andrew from Purchasing who has sent me an email and now has walked over to me after 2 minutes, he's now going to have to wait until I have finished typing this otherwise he might think I'm not busy.

Edit: Andrew wanted me to check his home laptop, he's going to bring it in tomorrow. Jokes on him, I'm off tomorrow."
"I AM THE LORD OF THE DANCE SAID HE (more shouted than sung)

"You're in danger just from making this post, pack some stuff and get to the embassy IMMEDIATELY.

"I'd buy them online now purely due to cost, but I worked in a convenience store for years and trust me - when I'm sat in a shitty shop at 10pm on a Sunday night earning £2.73 an hour and someone came in to buy condoms because they're about to get laid, I definitely never thought that they were the loser."

Strippers have chip and pin machines these days. They support contactless now.
I know it's an everyday occurrence in the States but it's considered very impolite here to purchase an assault rifle and go on a killing spree. Try to avoid that if you could.
"I'm going to go with the obvious: I knew Brits drank tea more than us Italians, but I couldn't imagine a constant going back and forth from the kitchenette to refill the mug every hour or so.

Also, birthday cards (and Tesco cakes) for every single birthday.

Finally, I don't think we have something similar to the British ""plans for the weekend?/how was your weekend?"". We have small talk but I'd say it's less bound to (what I perceive as being) rigid canons"
"At uni once, they refilled the vending machine with some posho crisps, but accidentally set the cost to 9p instead of 90p, so I bought the lot. The next day they'd just come and top it up again, this went on for about a week before they caught on. "

"Literally none. Don’t watch any American news. 

Pretty sure we get Fox News (though I seem to recall that being cancelled) and maybe MSNBC but I don’t think anybody watches them. 

From what I’ve seen of American news when working in the US the quality of reporting and impartiality of presentation is FAR better here. 

Maybe if “The Newsroom” was true it would be different. "

"You're doing it wrong! That’s not how you’re supposed to use storage heaters! They’re designed to be on at night when the electricity is cheaper, store heat in the bricks inside, then be off during the day when electricity is expensive, and the heat stored in the bricks is gradually released into the room.

Night storage heaters are crap at the best of times but if you have them on by day and off by night they're going to cost a fortune. Your bill is probably correct."

Lincolnshire - farms and the Lithuanian migrants who tend to them

Surrey - Tory central

Berkshire - toffs and toughs living in harmony (sort of)

Tyne and Wear - love of drinking, blind devotion to terrible football teams, and the occasional horse-punching"

"Which is what the embassy is for.

I repeat, you are 18 and, if you were born in Belfast and have a British Birth Certificate and your own UK passport, you are a British Citizen and are therefore offered the full protection of British law.

You are not a minor in Britain, you are an adult and *do not* have to be bound by rules your parents try to make you follow - especially rules which dictate your religion AND freedom of movement AND freedom of association.

If what you say is true then you are being held captive in Saudi because your Saudi father is trying to make you follow a Saudi-only law - in Britain most passport holders over age 16 are free to travel in/out of the country unaccompanied -  and are in fear for your life.

You *and your father*, by the way, may have been breaking Saudi law if you - as a UK passport holder - did not have both an entry and exit visa when he took you to the country https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/saudi-arabia/entry-requirements

"Working with a split team in the UK and Switzerland was fun. They absolutely couldn't understand sarcasm and would always adhere to procedure even when it was obviously stupid or caused problems, but were extremely professional (much more so than the Brits). Technically, their worst people were significantly better than our worst people, but our best people were significantly better than their best people (they had a much smaller variation in skill levels).

"Yes, although it's not so formalised, and there's not the expectation of bringing a date. They're usually for 16 year olds (post GCSE) and 18 year olds (post A level).
