After she died the song ‘Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead’ got to number 2 in the charts. I’ll leave it at that.
"Definitely not a slur, interchangeable with ""spanish person"" for me."
"I believe a Franky Boyle joke sums her up quite well:

*Did you hear, Margaret Thatcher wants a state funeral, that's going to cost £5 million? For that much money, you can buy everyone in Scotland a shovel and we'll hand her over to Satan personally.*"
"Yes.

Also if you're one of those people who insist that Yorkshires should only every be severed with roast beef, you need your hard drive looking at"
"This is England is a film, scripted and acted by professionals.

Of course they sound fluent - it's literally their job."
"Polarising is the only correct word, people either love her or hate her. This does tend to be divided by location and class though."
"My boyfriend doesn't enjoy anything unless it's on a computer screen so I'm spending Christmas Eve the same way I spend every other night, alone on front of the TV contemplating going to bed early because I'm so bored.

Sorry for the rant, but I needed a rant."
Don't take life advice from strangers on the internet. 
"There are only two occasions where Yorkshires are appropriate

1. Sunday Roasts
2. All other meals

So yes."
"If they did, we'd all know the calories in booze. Which would be a bad thing for our nation of binge drinkers."
It's as racist as 'Scotsman' or 'Dane' i.e. not at all.
"It's pretty meaningless.. They may as well ask for your star sign.


Okay maybe it's not THAT meaningless but studies have found that half the people who take it a second time get a completely different result. 

I don't think they can force you to take it anyway but you may as well just do it.."
"Massively polarised. The older Conservatives look up to her as a tough talker who made hard decisions like you describe. They like her economic vision of the country.

The left see her as a cruel and mean spirited woman who ripped away industry and support from workers, and literally took milk away from kids (milk snatcher Maggie is fairly common). Even if change was necessary, she forced it quickly with little thought for the people that were effected."
Because Maggie is the only one whose name rhymes with snatcher.
"Your Dutch language is just an updated dialect of old German.  

Our English language is a mixture of words, verbs, and ways of speaking taken from the old Celtic languages, Archaic German dialects, mediaeval French, and 10th-century Norse.   

As a result we have multiple words for most things, but also, the verb structures of any of those languages tend to be allowable and comprehensible to us..  

This gives us the chance to choose the word that best fits the rhythm of the sentence. The flowing poetic nature of English prose derives from the many choices possible in forming a sentence, it is an opportunity denied to those whose languages have a single source.  

*(I just mentally translated my last sentence into French &amp; German. it works almost as well in French, but in German, it's awkward ....  I then translated it into Dutch using Google Translate. God above.... how do you DEAL with that mess?)*"
It isn’t my place to say but... You shouldn’t be in that relationship if every night he’s ignoring you for games. I like games but I don’t play them at the expense of other people in my life. 
"Girlfriend from Spain is a Spaniard. It's not a slur.

I could call her a spanner I suppose if I wanted to annoy her"
"If you're that way inclined, you think she was amazing. Up there with Churchill as one of our greatest ever PMs. She revolutionised the country and turned us into the successful, neo-liberal capitalist state we are today. 

If you're not that way inclined she was terrible. Up there as one our worst ever PMs. She destroyed our country and turned us into the poor-hating neo-liberal, capitalist state we are today. 

There are lots of divisive things she did: 

* Selling off state-owned homes (either she allowed a generation to own their own property, or destroyed the social housing market) 
* She closed the mines (to save the British economy, or destroying towns in the North for generations. Similar to issues in the Rust Belt in the US) 
* She sent us to war in the Falklands (to protect British sovereignty, or a pointless war that resulted in the uneccessary loss of British lives)"
"Honestly he sounds like a cunt.

He also sounds cheap, so that makes me wonder if he’s paying tax, has a HMO licence (if he needs one) or has a BTL mortgage/consent to let.

I’d probably just leave and then see if you can report him over one of the above if you suspect him of not being above board for any of them. "
Space is cool as fuck
"&gt; I'm from the south

You may be technically correct but your opinion does not count"
"They might see a can of beer has the same calories as a can of coke and think ""why the fuck am I drinking coke?"""
"Perhaps not directly answering the question, but I did a degree that I thought would be really useful (""International Business"") which included modules in economics, accounting, marketing and mathematics.

Needless to say, it wasn't. "
Anyone who thinks she was great did not live anywhere near one of the old mining towns.
"Nares-bruh.

Now try Wymondham. "
"Most British people think that if you are 'dating' at all like this, it IS already exclusive."
"Keep a drink in your hand at social functions. Preferably a small lemonade which could be mistaken for a vodka and lemonade.

The reason is, if you're at a party or in a pub, it's common for other drinkers to see someone without a drink and be overly generous with the whole ""hey, let me get you one.""

If you have a drink in your hand, you can politely decline as you have a drink already. No drink in your hand? That drunk friendly chap will come back from the bar with one for you. "
Don't they set prices on a demand basis? Maybe you're just selling them the same stuff they already have millions of?
Please do report them. A 90 year old went through a red light and ploughed into a family member. She survived as the hit was at 30mph but still had head injuries and a shattered pelvis. It took 6 months for a recovery and still needs physio and god know what longterm damage may present later. 
"Yes.

Your wife is broken."
"he broke the law by going into your room without permission. 

he removed and moved items in that room, without permission. 

you have the right to live in your room, as it was agreed at start of tenancy. He cannot alter your furniture without good cause (and your consent).


'The Landlord's Responsibilities - The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985

The landlord is required to keep the property in good repair throughout the tenancy, so that it remains up to the standard it was at the start of the agreement''.
Have a word with CAB on next working day to draft a legally sound letter. In the meanwhile put it writing that you want the bed back as you agreed to rent the room and you note he accessed the room on (date) without your consent. 

Move out when you can - he's a shyster. 
"
"Long may she rot in hell.

She was personally responsible for me having to live on the streets when I was 17.

If I'd been 16 I could have been given a place in foster care. If I was 18 I could have received benefits to get my own place, but she cut off any benefits or social care for 17 year olds to save a bit of money.

My mum was actually a social worker and she did everything in her power to help me find somewhere or something, but no, Thatcher made sure it was impossible and the streets it was."
I think hate doesn't do a good job of describing the absolute loathing people have for it
"The thing is, that 50% *loved* her. The other 50% *hated* her.

The pubs in my town were offering drinks deals when she died, just to illustrate that.

Nobody is ambivalent about Maggie, she was (and still is) incredibly polarising. The UK doesn't tend to get very sentimental about politicians like in the US, you see people already talking about George Bush in positive ways with his painting and shit when he's guilty of war crimes - just compare how Americans look at him with how Brits look at Blair and you'll see the difference.

Maggie was either loved/hated at the time, depending on who you are or where you live, and people opinions of her have not changed since then. The same people still love her who always have, and the same people still hate her who always have."
That's because half the people are doing it are just doing the dossiest subject possible before daddy slides them into a job at his firm.
I don’t listen to Radio 1 but is it from [this](https://twitter.com/mattturner4l/status/938505244660649986) possibly?
"That sub is full of: 

1) Americans pretending to be Brits

2) Brits with social anxiety"
"Most organisations require you to phone in every day you are off sick, if self certified (which this still is, because you didn't get a ""fit note"" - new word for sick note).

Perhaps contact her, apologise you didn't phone in a cite the fact she said to you ""just let me know when you can come back"" and say you thought this meant you didn't need to phone in each day?"
"This is very generous of you! All the best to your partner and I hope he is out on time!!  
If you don't get any takers here, feel free to post this on /r/CasualUK! "
I liked his other joke about having the 21 gun salute aimed at the coffin just to make sure.
"We're not celebrating, we're mostly at home relaxing with family and friends. Whilst Christmas is a fun day, it's also a pretty stressful day for those who have to organise it and cook, and a day of full-on activity for others (including drinking). Boxing Day is a day to wind down and chill out.

Why do most Americans get the day after Thanksgiving off? There's nothing to celebrate."
"Maybe because we are generally quite reserved, taught strict manners and are therefore very good at hiding what we're actually feeling and thinking when we say stuff?"
"Because neither of them became Prime Minister, partially."

Not s slur, standard British English"
Not a thing in the UK? Where do they think Robert Burns was from?
"Currently on network rail the guard uses a key to unlock the doors when the driver has stopped the train. He then steps outside the train, looks for people making a mad dash for the train, makes a decision if he's going to wait for them or hop back on and close the doors and have a little chuckle to himself at that person missing the train.

Driver only trains will mean normal trains are like the tube where the driver opens the doors from the front and closes them after a set amount of time. Usually leading to some muppet getting stuck in the door because they think they can make it. Having seen many people getting stuck in the door I think the argument about safety is quite a good one. "
"To learn how to google, literally and jokingly!

Don't get fat. If you are, then lose weight now.

Remove drama creating people from your life.


Learn how to budget and save money, shop around for good prices."
"I mean, if you look at the shelves they usually have dozens of copies of the hangover etc. If they can't shift them at 50p then can you blame them?"
"Nah, it's all discontinued.  I collect notes though, so if you want to mail it all out to me I'll paypal you a few quid"
CAULIFLOWER IS TRADITIONAL!!!
"If this is a recent thing, then it's probably just too many brussel sprouts. "
"It usually varies between $5 and $5,000,000 depending on where you stay and what you eat. "
"Nah mate, I bought it for £10 so it's worth £10. Cex should give me £10 and then sell it themselves for £10. That's a perfectly efficient business model."
Why is being anti-union a good thing? Is there anything wrong with collective bargaining?
"It's worth remember HR is there to protect your company, not the employees."
Can I recommend you take better care of the most trusted forms of ID out there?
