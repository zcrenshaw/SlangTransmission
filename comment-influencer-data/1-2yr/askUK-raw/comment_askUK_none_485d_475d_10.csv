"Well, seriously, I think people fear a loss of the things the previous generation took for granted. Things like the NHS, being able to buy a home, whether there will be a pension in 30 to 40 years.

Obviously no one else has Brexit. And the uncertainty of what the hell is going to happen and how it will affect people is scary for a lot of people.

Check out /r/britishproblems for our day to day issues!"
"It's brilliant.

There's only jealousy.

"Their bank will accept it just fine,they're being idiots"
That really acrid bitter substance is mustard mate
"Hang on, so they are saying this note is effectively worthless to them yet they won't sell it to you for £20...

I think they are taking the piss. Had they ever mentioned not taking Scottish notes before? I think you need to push the issue about swapping it for an English £20, if they don't like the note - why won't they let you swap it? They want to take £20 off you *and* want to keep the note? Proper stitching you up there mate."
"It feels fake, not going to lie. Sometimes I need to remind myself that Americans are real people and not just this fiction that television and film have given us, and the accent sticks out so much in a crowd.

I love almost all accents of ESL speakers though, particularly Norwegian, French, and Italian native speakers. There’s an extra kind of lilt and melody to their use that native English speakers (bar perhaps NZ) just lack. The melody for Norwegian natives speaking English as a second language is hilarious, it looks like a saw blade: starts low, goes up through a sentence, drops right down, rises slowly again, then drops, and so on. I love it so much, especially the particular quirks of my friend Eirik, who has an even better delivery of British-style humour than any Brit has ever achieved thanks to his accent. It’s amazing, I love him, and hearing accents, very dearly."
"I’m going to try to answer this carefully as not to be a prick. 

When they arrive at a location and set up camp they are trespassing. Trespassing is not a criminal offence assuming they didn’t break in anyway, it is a civil matter between the land owner and the trespasser. The very short answer as to why the police can’t evict travellers is because it’s not their job to do so. 

Once the landlord gets a court order usually within a few days they are then told to leave, usually do so without a fight and the police support this to prevent a breech of the peace. 

There are often various related crimes such as littering, noise issues, vandalism etc there have to have real concrete evidence to chase up and even if the police wanted to it’s too much hassle for a £30 fine. 
They usually don’t break into the site they camp in by using a similar trick to squatters. If you break the lock on the gate and then set up camp the police will remove you. If you have someone go ahead, break the lock and then leave, when you arrive later to the unsecured site the polices hands are tied (or cuffed I guess)"
Offering a workman tea only to find you have no milk. And no tea. 
"Gardening leave is, as you've said, free holiday. It normally only comes along with jobs where you have a reasonable amount of responsibility or influence so there's certainly no stigma against it in my mind.

Just bear in mind if you do get it you have to remain available for work - don't start the new job early!"
"Where do you work? Some corner shop or a supermarket or what?

They definitely cannot deduct it from your pay, i'm sure /r/LegalAdviceUK would have some advice."
That's an illegal deduction from your wages. Speak to your union ASAP. Or CAB if you're not yet in one.
"For me it's basically the 'TV' accent. I think nothing of it until I hear it in real life, then it sounds like I'm in a TV show. When i talk to Americans I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity."
That someone will manage to smuggle in enough pineapples to cause another incident.
"Don't worry, you definitely won't be ID'd at your door by a delivery driver.

If in any doubt, perhaps answer the door in slippers."
"Reduce the imbalance between London and everywhere else.

Less focus on economic growth as the measure of success and more looking at quality of life.

A more principled foreign policy even at the expense of the economy."
I never have. 
"&gt;I'm traveling to the UK and want to experience the real English life.

90 minute commute, each way. 9 hour work day, stumble home to see your partner for about an hour before getting too tired to maintain and conversation and collapsing on the sofa. "
"We arent really supposed to talk about it, most of the information was suppressed.  Basically about 12 years ago there was a national 'incident'.  I remember being on duty at the time (I'm ex police).  It was a dark period in our history, what I can tell you is that as a result of the 'incident' it is no longer legal to possess pineapple in the UK."
"Don’t know if there are any Glaswegians in here, but the McDonald’s at four corners is like Mecca for neds, junkies &amp; goths. It is fucking horrible. "
You are legally required to do gardening. Mow the lawn. Weeding. Plant flowers. Tend to the veggie patch. Its the law from 1645 and the penalty  is transportation to Australia.
"Those roads *are* British roads though... they aren't some kind of obstacle course that they've built specifically for the driving test; they're the exact same roads you would have done your driving lessons on and will be driving on after passing.

I got my first driving licence in Paraguay and the driving test there involved a ten-minute drive around the town in a borrowed police car, which was fun; and I'm currently having to go through the process of getting a Spanish licence, which is an absolute pain in the arse. I did a UK theory test last year, and the Spanish one is way more complicated. "
"Combination of some\-else\-will\-do\-it\-itis through to never\-done\-it\-before\-syndrome.

I will admit to being guilty of the former, but I draw the line at dumping rubbish next to the bin."
Tbh when non-Americans have it it's alright because it's not so *loud*. The combination of the accent and the loudness most Americans speak with is what's annoying. Spoken at a reasonable level it's not so jarring.
"This guy's essentially hit the nail on the head with all these fears. They're particularly (but not solely) the fears of the younger generations (generally speaking people under the age of 40).

The added dimension is a perception that even in a democracy, younger voting blocs have insufficient influence to change much of this where the interests of older voters (who outnumber younger generations due to the post war population boom) don't align. The perception is that the older generation has benefited from the things that younger generation is afraid of not being able to access and is ""pulling up the rope ladder behind them"". 

Whether or not this is accurate is another thing but for many in the younger generations there's the fear that we'll lose the benefits above and a fear that there's little to be done to stop it."
"They are usually in shops near lots of workers. I might not carry a cup around all day, but if I fancy a 10 minute break I’ll grab the cup off my desk and walk down to the coffee shop."
"Not even remotely surprised, this business model died in the 90s.

Nobody wants to go to an overpriced ""we sell everything, but not quite what you want"" store, and then to be gassed by the irradiated essex birds on the way out. 

I'm not sure what the pivot is for these types of shops. It strikes me as we're heading back towards cottage industry (mum+dad) style shops. Take a look at the states, they have swaths of massive malls that are ghost towns - we're just behind the fall"
"&gt; can't quite tell if your kidding... 

We dont joke about it.  It was fucking chaos, i had to work seven 13 hour shifts back to back until things had calmed down.

We don't discuss the nature of the'incident' because not only is it an offence (Section 350 of the Official Secrets Act as amended 2006) but to describe its nature risks causing it to happen again."
"Bobby here. These answers are wrong so far. We do have powers under section 61 of the criminal justice and public order act to evict them as long as they meet the criteria: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/61

Shortly put, if 2 or more people with 6 or more vehicles move onto private land with an intention to stay there for a period of time, and during that time cause damage or threaten and intimidate people of that land, they can be served a notice of eviction to leave as soon as is practicable. 

However, sometimes it isn’t practicable for us to serve that unless we are in good position to deal with it. That, and possibly not all officers are aware of that piece of legislation. "
What the fuck bank do they use that won't accept a scottish note?
"No.

You're a fucking idiot."
"don't worry, its Yodel, so 99% chance your parcel never arrived anyway"
"The M1 was shut completely past Leeds for almost a week iirc. Helicopters going past my window all hours of the day. That's one of the reasons so many of us are proud of Prince William, what he did in that week."

"Colmans mustard in jars

&gt;Water, MUSTARD flour (21%), sugar, salt, WHEAT flour, turmeric, acid (citric acid).

The mustard paste is 1/5th flour, not half and half. It also has sugar to deal with that bitterness."
"Hearing the words ""Bus Replacement Service""."
"I wouldn't say there's much dislike towards Harry, not that I've really come across at least. Both him and Will are certainly more liked than Charles for instance. He had some issues growing up, like the Nazi uniform fancy dress stuff, but really seems to have straightened out, and is doing decent work on stuff like mental health. There's probably quite a lot of general apathy towards the monarchy as an institution, but I think most people are pretty positive towards Harry in general."
I fear that my country and the world at large is going to turn into a totalitarian nightmare dystopia. And I'll die before it's the cool cyberpunk kind.
"Some people inject heroin. The veins in their arms have deteriorated; the veins in their legs are hard to access, so that leaves their foot. They take one shoe off, inject, then have a snooze.

The UK government has imposed austerity for many years now, and that's having a severe impact on homeless people.

Local authorities have had funding cut. This means many services have also been cut. Local authorities are responsible for housing services, and drug and alcohol services. That hits particularly hard on the homeless population in the UK.

On top of that the NHS has had funding cut, and mental health trusts have been particularly hard hit. This means that things like Assertive Outreach teams are being cut or have much tighter restrictions."
"Generally students live in larger groups due to the cheaper costs of living and the problems with communal living follow. One problem with this is that all it takes is one imbecile to ruin the dynamic by not doing their part, like taking the rubbish out. This creates resentment and people will wait for them to clean up their own damn mess for once. This happened to me this year when my twenty some year old housemate couldn’t fathom that you need to do your washing up and not let it stew for a week, filling the sink and stopping other people doing theirs, making it pile up. Some people are a pain to live with for the little things like this. "
"I mean, I'm pretty sure every Swede I've ever met has spoken English with Swedish accent..."
"Yeah, she might be. Obviously it would be easier for her if you just worked whenever she wanted you to. Just keep saying no, she'll work out it is effort for no reward eventually."
"&gt; It normally only comes along with jobs where you have a reasonable amount of responsibility or influence...

Exactly. Only time I've ever heard of people getting gardening leave rather than fired or normal notice they're usually pretty high up, well respected, and it comes with comments like ""wow, they must really have access to some information they don't want going to a competitor."" "
"A culture of leaving work on time. There are US states that require salaried workers to be paid for overtime. So if, for example, you work more than your contracted 9am-5pm, you get paid per extra hour one-35th fraction of what your weekly salary would be. As a result, employers wishing to avoid paying extra to their staff, encourage their employees to leave work on time instead of expecting (explicitly or implicitly) that they work into the evening on a daily basis.

This would give people time in the evenings to cook their own meals with fresh ingredients, maybe go for a run or to the gym, or go to concerts, museums etc, or meet up with friends for a drink or whatever, or go to local political or community meetings, or just relax and de-stress, spending more time with their family or themselves. 

Basically people would be healthier, happier, wealthier, and more involved with their local communities. Local businesses and organisations would be better-attended in the evenings, and the community would have more of a buzz to it. This would also reduce crime and antisocial behaviour (when people know their neighbours and their neighbourhood, they're less likely to want to cause harm to them). 

It would also make people more productive at work, studies have shown.

The only people losing out would be the business-owners and their shareholders, who are basically stealing an extra hour of labour from employees every evening, and then stashing the profits offshore or just adding to their already-sufficient millions. Cry me a river."
"I've worked with several Americans over the years and most of them have been lovely people. But there's not been one who I havn't thought when hearing them speak at length ""please blow your fucking nose"".

Ditto American podcasts, i've had to stop listening to some because they sound so *nasal*"
"It's only sort of legal.

It stops people buying loads of land and doing nothing with it."

I don't have anything useful to add other than to suggest that you also post in r/LegalAdviceUK. Hope you find a way to help your brother!
[ACAS](http://www.acas.org.uk) will be quicker than citizen's advice. Phone them. They'll advise you on the legality and also take it up with your employer for you.
"Your boss clearly thinks that there's a stigma, and is doing this to ""punish"" you. But in reality, there is no stigma and he's an idiot. Enjoy your video games bro, you're getting paid to play them for the next month or so!"

"Sounds like they’re full of shit. I used to work on the south coast and there was no issue accepting Scottish notes.

"If you can drive, they’re not difficult? They’re not asking anything of a learner driver that they wouldn’t be doing regularly once holding a full licence. "
"Probably nothing specifically against him, in fact he's probably one of the more popular Royals. I think there's just plenty of republicans (no, not that kind)."

"Private detectives do this to look for id of people they are after, but they are usually more subtle than you describe.

"It's because the main demographic it caters too is the gammon faced 50+, who insist on using pounds and ounces, feet and inches and would love to pay in shillings and pence."
"There's no shame. People go on gardening leave for various reasons \- sounds like your manager has taken it personally.

If you're asked, saying you went to for a competitor is a perfectly legitimate reason to go on gardening leave as it's nothing to do with conduct, it's protecting the company against you taking information to the new company."
We can instantly tell you are at least Scandinavian though. Honestly when it comes to accent recognition the difference between natives and all other speakers of a language is huge.
"The weather actually turning out as forecast meaning we have to go through with a social event we agreed to out of politeness but had no intention of following through with.

Having to claim for ESA. You have an ATOS assessment every six months and they are harrowing and stressful. It is bad enough having them every two years for PIP where they try and wriggle out of giving you anything even if you are still as disabled as you were two years before.

I don't think there's really a stigma about young BMW drivers rather there's a stigma about BMW drivers in general being arseholes on the road.

"Hi, I'm a property manager. I know a lot about this stuff.

There are really only two brands of vac worth considering. First is the good old Henry, not right for your situation.

The best of the best though, is Miele. They'll have something for you, though I'd say DO NOT go bagless! It's a gimmick for lazy people, get a small vac with a bag a change it regularly! Way better"
"I totally agree with this perspective. I remember being a teenager like 10 years ago just starting to want to go hang out with friends in town, but there was pretty much nowhere to go.

Parks are generally for younger kids, we'd get complaints from parents and the police would ask us to move on because we're ""being intimidating"" Shopping centers would generally have security move teens on for loitering unless you're spending money. At least a place like maccies you can kill an hour or two without spending loads of money.

It's not really a ""chav"" thing it's just a teenagers not having anywhere to go thing."
"Legal tender doesn't apply to buying things in shops. They can choose what to accept. Heck, they could choose to not accept any cash and trade in Monopoly money if they really wanted. If you're not paying upfront and the person accrues a debt (e.g. eating food at a restaurant), then they HAVE to accept legal tender, but they can accept anything else too (e.g. credit card). 

Also I don't know of a bank that wouldn't accept it unless it was fake. I'm smelling bullshit here tbh. Maybe they want to spend it and not pay it in? If the clerk at the bank is being an ass, they should take it up with the the bank. You didn't do anything wrong, so not sure it can be a legal deduction from your wages. "
"I do this but instead of 10 minutes, its 5 days."
"Just after I left school I worked in a customer contact centre in the team that did the click to chat on the website. I only communicated with customers via text. We were also allowed to have headphones to listen to music, so I could go entire days without talking to anyone there. "
Loading and unloading is a grey area unless there are specific bays and most councils give a bit of leeway because how else is that sort of thing going to be done?
"Yes, East Midlands in an industrial type town here. There's literally nowhere else for them to go though if you think about it. We have one park but it's about 4 miles away and busses are obscenely expensive even for me, never mind for the type of people who have to go to the bank to withdraw money because they've not got enough to make use of a cash machine. You can go in a group and hang out and as long as a couple of people get a 99p burger or something you can stay for a while inside where it's reasonably clean. It's also a gathering spot for 17 year olds who've just got themselves todays version of a Nova. It's pretty dangerous going there after dark because they drive around the car park at 30mph with no regard for anyone else. "
"Higher income tax levels in Scotland now compared to England &amp; Wales. Anyway, I think nurses on the NHS are criminally underpaid considering the work they do. Anytime I’ve visited a hospital they’ve all been absolutely outstanding. A credit to the NHS &amp; Britain alike. "

"English with a Swedish/Dutch/Italian accent sounds quite cool and intelligent, but usually if I hear an American accent I get quite defensive because in my experience it either means that the noise level is about to double, or that for some reason I'll be asked deeply personal questions by a stranger."
"Not hot *to you*. Our average temperature is about 14-15 degC.  This is AskUK, so in all likelihood, you're asking about a UK working place right? To us, this is pretty warm at the moment, so this is a reasonable reason why they're not. 

At the end of the day, just wear whatever makes you comfortable, if you're comfortable in a jacket, wear one."
