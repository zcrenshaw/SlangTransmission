"It is fine.

The general rule is a few seconds of stroking then pop them in a wheely bin.

"The UK is far from perfect and there's a few other countries I'd rather live in, but the US isn't one of them.

That said, it's impossible to tell whether the same would be true for you and your wife! I'd recommend coming here to visit a few times to get a feel for the place. :)"
"I think you have a point about London's disproportionate share of infrastructure spending from central government, but the fact you used in your title is a bit misleading. It's correct, but for context if you look at the table in the article, London's population is greater than the next six conurbations combined - so it's not quite as skewed as the title makes it sound. "
My first driving instructor told me that all I needed to do was wear a short skirt and give the assessor a nice smile and they would pass me. I switched instructors after that. 
"D - December  
BR - brrr, it's cold.

"That’s a tautology. London is where the money is so London is where all the money should be. 

It generates more money because it has the infrastructure and services to support a city of its scale. If Sheffield had more investment, it would grow its economy, and therefore generate better returns on the next investment. 

By your logic every penny the government spends should be in London. "
"As I spoke to someone recently who didn't realise this - if your Sky/BT/mobile bill gets a price hike, [you're allowed to leave your contract immediately, penalty-free](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/media/media-releases/2013/protection-for-consumers-against-mid-contract-price-rises). 

Can be quite a good get-out for people tied into 18- or 24- month contracts they're no longer happy with. Not exactly a dirty business tactic as such, but it's not exactly something they like to remind you of when they inform you of the increase, funnily enough. "
"If the cat is looking for attention, then it's a perfectly normal thing to stop and give them a fuss."
"Yes, should be part of curriculum before people leave school...

How to keep people up to date though is harder unless you can instill in them that this is an important life skill."
"Plain cheese always looks depressing to me. Not sure why, just a thin bit of cheese with butter in a malted loaf...it’s sad :("
"Some more suggestions:

Peep Show, The IT Crowd, Red Dwarf, The Mighty Boosh, The League of Gentlemen, That Mitchell and Webb Look, Only Fools and Horses, Outnumbered. And of course Father Ted but that really counts as Irish.

Will add more if I think of them :)"
I don't care if its socially acceptable or not. If I see a cat I will try to attract its attention. If it comes to me then I'm there until the cat is done with me. 
"It's a weed alarm. It's kind of like a smoke detector, but specifically for detecting THC smoke. We had one in our uni halls, but never really realised what it was for. One day when we were hitting the bong, we had a knock on the door and it activated the alarm, got into deeeep shit that day..."
"You're still working unless your employer has contacted you to say they aren't opening tomorrow.

If snow etc affects your travel you are expected to plan ahead and set off earlier.

If you feel you can't make it, you must phone them and tell them in advance, but don't be surprised if they make you claim the day as your holiday or sick leave."
I think that’s rather exaggerated in the fact that it’s really not that bad. 
"My mother in law had a grating laugh years ago. Someone mentioned it to her and she didn't laugh out loud for years.  While her kids were growing up she avoided laughing.

"Security flaw? I mean, not having armour plate over the fragile glass windows is a security flaw - but how far do you go? In summary, no I don't think it is a securty flaw. I don't think that I am in need of that kind of security.

Cold air - get one of those brush things for the back of it - problem solved."
"In the 80's I had family in the rag trade, particularly London, at a time when Marks &amp; Spencer made a big deal about having their clothes made in Britain. Big advertising campaign, tons of signs in stores, etc. 

What they, M&amp;S, used to do was find small, under 50 machinsts, but well established rag-makers and offer them big contracts, really big for the size of the company like 50,000 pieces which was months of work and eagerly jumped on by a waning industry. They'd also put a tight-ish deadline on it so often extra workers or lots of overtime went to getting them done in time. Then at the last possible moment they'd instigate the cancelation clause in their contract, this drove the companies into liquidation which was when M&amp;S would step in and buy the company, which included the bulk of the contract order, to use as for own manufacturing - sometimes the whole kaboodle for less than the original contract price. 

Of course eventually no one would touch an M&amp;S contract, but by then they had a number of small factories all over the country.

"Never heard of it, wouldn't be surprised if there were a few dodgy assessors, but I'd expect you'd need to know them outside of your actual driving test, and hope you get assigned them on the day...

I'd say it's far more common to have someone else sit your test pretending to be you"
"I think you seriously need to read and digest that link I sent you. I mean, this is crazy. IT -&gt; Advertising -&gt; Video Production -&gt; Retail -&gt; Archaeology.

At some point you're going to have to stick with a direction, else you're going to be 30 with no marketable skills. I honestly can't believe you're contemplating spending 4 years studying for a degree in a field in you've never been in before, despite not liking basically anything else you've done.

I think you've probably got some serious misconceptions about how people ""feel"" in work - you shouldn't hate your job, for sure, but I think you have unrealistic expectations and probably a lack of direction. I don't work in Video Production or anything, but if that's what you wanted then I think those shit first jobs are par for the course in that industry.

No one here can say what's going to make you happy, but I think you need to have some form of target and actually stick to it and put up with the entry level side of whatever that is.

You really should have gone back to advertising after the studio gig didn't work out - can you do that now? There's nothing wrong with plotting a career move, but you can't go on just bouncing around crap jobs forever."
Still cheaper than the train
"We don't, you just have ridiculous fake-looking teeth that the rest of the world think are hilarious. "
"Even sadder than any of these supermarket suggestions is the punters in Subway who just have ham on white. Seriously, all this choice and you don't want anything else? God forbid you should get any nutrients with your sandwich!

While I'm ranting, can the cunts who peel the lettuce out of their burger and drop it in the street just fuck off!?

^(*I never realised how angry this stuff makes me until now!*)"
Who?
Yes definitely. I don’t trust people who don’t do that.
"It depends. I'd rather be poor in the UK, I'd rather be rich in the US. If I ever become a millionaire I'd move to the US (for one of my houses, at least). Probably California, for the weather and scenery, and the people. "
"As someone from The South who lived Up North for 5 years and came back, I’m much more appreciative of the weather down here. We have less rain and it’s generally a couple of degrees warmer all year round. However, it’s still the UK and it’s always going to be a bit grey and miserable in the winter.

The way I combat the winter blues is by having a couple of weeks away somewhere warm and sunny in January. It’s a bit of a top up and I come back feeling much better about seeing through the rest of the winter.

When my schoolmates came over they were always surprised to see my cat was the cat they all stroked on the way to school
Ive spent a bunch of time working in the US and for a little while i was trying to move out there but it fell through. I think on a personal level; things like the places and the people and the food are incredibly appealing to me. But on a grander scale the country has a lot of social and political issues that are really quite terrifying to a british fella like me.

"Many restaurants and hotels in the UK (and around) the world use the French way of organising things, called the *brigade de cuisine.* The person in charge of the kitchen is called the *dhef de cuisine,* their deputy is the *sous-chef de cuisine* and then the kitchen is divided up into ""stations"" that specialise in different areas of food preparation, each supervised by a *chef de partie* and so on. Saying ""oui, chef"" instead of ""yes, chief"" is just part of this French way of doing things. You could use English names for all the positions in the kitchen in you really wanted to but using French is the established way."
"Also, media reporting inspires copycats. A single high-profile case spawned a small trend. "
"Sainsbury's Christmas Turkey and Pigs under blankets, but only because I sometimes imagine somebody having it alone in lieu of a proper Christmas dinner with their family."
Peep Show only used that flat for the pilot and I believe the first two series. They then built a set which got wheeled out and rebuilt for each series. In terms of continuity between series I think the props people just take lots and lots of photos to refer back to. I’m sure one of the commentary soundtracks made mention of a row of lighters on a shelf in the kitchen that were always put back in exactly the same order for each series. 
"This is one of the dumbest things I have read on reddit. I'm from Switzerland but lived in the UK and now live in the USA. Both countries are comparable to me but If I had to say which one is more ""third world"" i would say the UK because the wages in the UK are more similar to the third world than the USA. 

I got paid more working at a shop in Switzerland than I did as an IT professional in the UK. And here in the USA I get paid over 3x more than I did in the UK and the COL is cheaper in the USA. 

I'm not saying this to bash the UK but you're way off base with your comment here and people upvoting it shows how little I think of the users on this subreddit. "
"So, both countries have pros and cons. 

The biggest pro of the UK, and one most Brits are blissfully unaware of and may scoff at, but every foreigner I've spoke to has wondered at, is the correctness with which people are treated. It's a weird thing that the one thing Brits should actually be proud of is the one thing we don't recognise in ourselves.

I have a Portuguese friend, who said on his first day in the UK he saw a man being arrested. And he was amazed to see the police officer comforting the man he was arresting, saying that it's going to be okay, not to get upset, etc, giving real emotional support. He says he has seen arrests in Portugal too, but with the suspect slammed onto the ground, a gun pressed hard into the back of their head while the officer screams at them. (of course police don't even carry guns in the UK) Police are more accountable in the UK, better trained towards compassion and integrity than almost any other country in the world.

I have a Greek friend who was amazed that on her first day of work, was warned in the induction that the UK is an incredibly racist country. They said this to an auditorium filled with Africans, muslims, Asians, Europeans, etc to her disbelief. The UK is one of the only countries in the world where making a disparaging remark about someone's race, gender, sexuality, etc is almost guaranteed to cause disgust and marginalisation of the bigot. In the workplace, it's almost guaranteed to get you fired on the spot.

She was also amazed that everyone gets treated with respect at work. When she stayed on to work an hour more on monday, her boss sent her home on friday an hour early. The manager doesn't degrade female staff, doesn't insult or bully others. 

Doubtless some Brits reading this will pipe up that they've seen racism, office bullying, etc, but they're rare and the law is rightly draconian in dealing with such instances. 

The UK also looks after the most vulnerable in society. Before someone screams about the conservative government and spending cuts, the UK is a country where everyone gets free healthcare, where the disabled are provided for at the taxpayer's expense. 

There's much more, but you get the point. Brits are so big on respect and fairness towards each other, they think they're bad at it because they only see when other Brits fall short.

The biggest con of the UK is the correctness with which people are treated. You can't find a place to park the car because there's permit requirements everywhere, and you *will* get a ticket if you ignore them because they seriously enforce it. Can't speed because there a fucking speed cameras everywhere. Forget to pay car tax? Enjoy your fine, because there are fucking ANPR cameras everywhere.

Drunk pricks will threaten and insult you in the street, because they know you haven't got a gun (this is also a pro, of course, gun crime is virtually non-existent). Punch them like they deserve, and the police will arrest you because there are fucking CCTV cameras everywhere, and the police follow procedures even though they can see the guy was a prick. Police advise that in such situations that you run away or curl up in a ball so it can be clearly seen on camera that you weren't the aggressor. Jeez.

Life is just heavily regulated in the UK, for better and for worse. There's fewer injustices as a result, but also less freedom."
Have you heard of... the wind?
"I don't know your financial situation, but it's expensive to live in London. Something to think about before you commit to moving."
Job agencies are not your friends.  Almost all interactions with you involve fishing for information.  They will ask you for names of companies you have applied to under the guise of not wanting to send duplicate CV's.  In reality they are looking for names of companies they can pitch competing candidates too.

It pays more tax than the other 9 combined.

"No offence, but why did you leave a ""professional"" role for non-skilled work? I hate to break it to you, but most people aren't really following something that could be considered their ""passion"" - I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing.

Your mistake isn't that you haven't found the right job, it's that you're not taking into account your career trajectory.
