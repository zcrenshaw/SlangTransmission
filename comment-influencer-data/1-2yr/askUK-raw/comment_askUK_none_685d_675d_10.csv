"Keep going in, your GP and 111 have advised you to. It might be worth asking your GP to write a letter you can take with you that explains why you need to go in. If the attitude continues after that I personally would make a written complaint."
"""I could care less"".

How did that even happen?"
"I say go ahead with the complaint right now. Having such discussions within earshot of a patient is, in itself, inappropriate conduct."
Be careful. A 6 quid may sometimes be an under the weather octopus.
"A TENNER for a tooth?? I think I got 50p, £1 tops. "
A tenner?! I'd smash my own fucking face in and cash in at those prices.
"I'd talk to one of the people who is being bitchy, and ask them what *they* think should be happening. Tell them that it's obvious to you that they don't want you there, and that you don't want to be difficult, but that you'll continue to follow the medical advice you're given. And that you'd welcome some kind of dialogue between the hospital and your GP if there's a difference of opinion.

It might a) embarrass them into not being so fucking unprofessional  
b) Ensure they see things from your perspective and make them aware that you're not just being neurotic
c) Prompt them to have a useful discussion with your GP about your care. Communications between hospitals and GPs is notoriously terrible, so the hospital may not even be aware of your GP's reasoning.  "
I thought Mary Berry comes and knocks your door down with a rolling pin and destroys whatever device had viewed her amuse bouche. 
"Honestly, I don't care anymore more.

I'm forty-one years old, and I used to teach English for a living.

I say, ""He was like ..."" when I'm paraphrasing someone or ""I guess..."" to indicate I have no certain knowledge. I know an enthusiastic 60 year old who thinks everything is ""awesome"", and I've yet to meet a Briton who calls a butt plug by its rightful name: a bum bung. I'm fine with that.

British English and American English are never going to be the same. Sometimes we copy one another, like when Americans call each other wankers, and sometimes we diverge, like when Londoners say ""innit"" all the time. It's all good."
An early train in the UK is just a train that's so late it's taken the next train's spot.
"&gt; What do they expect to gain?

A glorious go on the fun button. 

I used to commute by bus for a time... Pushing that button was the best part of the entire journey... If that displeased others, that pleased me even more."

"Yes, it's functionally a pyramid scheme. I think they call themselves Multi-Level Marketing. Or that's the new term. 

The levels just get narrower towards the top. What do you call that shape again?

Just remember that you're not your brother's keeper, and you can only intervene so far. He has to make his own choices. 

Are there any underlying issues? Does he have money problem? A normal job? Depression?"
"I’ve heard fellow Brits saying “on accident” a couple of times, which is one of my pet hates."

"For some reason I hate the usage of 'ass' etc instead of 'arse'.

'Asshole?' No- *arsehole*.

At rUK I write to anyone who uses 'ass' asking them to change it to 'arse.'

"No, you will not get into trouble. "
*Six quid* is to *six pounds* as *six bucks* is to *six dollars.*
"Next time you take  your washing home for mummy to wash, watch what she does. Simple as that."
Hold their hands and use your eyes.
"This was a voluntary initiative started by an individual and funded through business sponsorship.

Yes, the council gave permission, but had nothing to do with actually implementing it."
"Ninth of December, surely?"
"This is a scam. There is no such scheme. Guessing he was trying to sell you car wash cloths, common household goods for an extortinate amount? 

It's called knocking, usually a bloke will pile as many lads as he can in a van then drive all over. You get dropped off and then go around ""knocking"" profits are split between the driver (bloke who organises it, buys stock etc) and the lads. 

Basically just a collection of skidmarks trying to take your money, I know a few lads who do it and there all absolute scrotes. "
"Much like the shrimp on Blue Planet which live only inside sponges, some food outlets cannot survive outside a transportation environment.  

Delice de France, Upper Crust, Pumpkin Cafe and at least 1 chain of Pasty shop would be eaten alive by the dominant predator (*Greggsi Steakusbaykus*) if they venture out into the wild.  Instead they cluster in sheltered environments, where they can pick off weary travellers and angry commuters with £3 lattes and £5 baguettes."

"6 minute walk. 

Couldn't ask for better."
"Have you researched what’s already available in your area for the homeless? It might be just the ticket, but your generosity might be out to better use by supporting an existing project. Food isn’t always hard to get hold of on the streets. 

You could also ask some of the people you see on the street if they would find it helpful.

It’s a nice idea, but sometimes a nice idea isn’t unhelpful, it’s just not particularly needed or wanted. "
"*New film* coming December Nine!

Ninth. It's *ninth* damnit!"
"I voted leave. 

I am distinctly unimpressed by how it's been handled. 

Call me naive, or stupid, but I genuinely thought it wouldn't be this difficult. In fact I still don't think it's that difficult, I just think the government is making a massive hash out of it. 

Do I regret voting leave? Hard to say. I think I voted for the right reasons. I didn't want to get rid of immigrants, or bend my bananas, I was/am frustrated with the EU as an institution and our half in half out relationship with it. 

So if I had to go back, knowing what I know now? I'd vote remain. But I think we've gone too far down the rabbit hole now to back out. 

I don't know. The whole global political stuff going on now just makes me want to scream. To borrow from Andy Hamilton, I've run out of outrage. When Barnier comes back telling us Davis is a twat and we've talked in circles for months, I just sigh. "
"Well, glad it's worked out OK for you, not sure I could have handled another episode f this emotional roller coaster "
"&gt; I know the show is big over there but how big is it?

Last year, of the ten most-watched programme episodes on British TV, nine of those were episodes of The Great British Bake Off (the other episode in the top ten was Planet Earth II). It's about as big as TV gets here, with the exception of one-off sporting events, royal weddings and the like.

&gt; Were Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood well known before the show? How about Sue and other host lady?

Paul Hollywood was a celebrity baker who had appeared as a guest on various BBC programmes but he wasn't very well-known until GBBO. Mary Berry was known for writing cookbooks but wasn't a household name either. Mel and Sue were both quite well known from appearing on a vast number of BBC programmes.

&gt; Have any of the contestants gone on to fame and glory?

As the other commenter said, I think only Nadiya Hussain has gone on to do much.

&gt; Any major controversies? I read the ones on the Wikipedia page.

I think Wikipedia mentions all the big ones: product placement, alleged favouritism, ""bingate"", innuendo and moving to Channel 4. Oh, and Deborah used Howard's custard by mistake.

&gt; Is it common in a British household to bake as much as the show makes it look? How is everybody not fat? I mean besides Copeland. Right? That is where your fatties live? Copeland.

The people on the programme are, unsurprisingly, much more into baking than the general population. At the other end of the scale, some people will never bake and most people are probably in the middle somewhere, where they might bake only for special occasions or family traditions (my mum wouldn't bake all year but then would go mad and make several Christmas cakes)."
"A weekend is Saturday and Sunday, not just Saturday. You said Monday twice and he didn't correct you. Try to relax and enjoy your day off, which is Sunday, which is today.

It's common for new retail workers to start on a weekday so they can be trained while the shop is a bit quieter."
"Same. Everything I want is hundreds-of-pounds expensive and I wouldn't dream of asking for, and everything else I've impulse bought for myself during the year."
"I think it’s fine that they did that - assuming they intended it as a show of respect (and I can’t think of any other reason why a local council would do it)

I ALSO think it’s fine that YOU found it a bit tacky - I’m not certain whether I agree with you (he says, sitting here in a “Help for Heroes” hoodie with the poppy still on it) but I can certainly see why you did!"
"ITT: People deciding that any odd sentence constructions are ""Americanisms""."
"""I can see that you obviously don't think I should be here, but my GP has explicitly said I *should* be here. I'm not responsible for this difference of opinion - I'm just the patient and I'm just doing what I'm told, because I care about my health."""
Seems tacky to me too. I understand why the poppy is important but this sort of thing only devalues it.
Yes. No idea why I didn't just say that earlier 
"I think it can be political for some people. Some people may identify as English and not British because they reject the concept of a shared British identify and feel they don't have that much in common with the rest of the UK. 

Others might identify primarily as British over English for the opposite reason, they don't really see English as a specific identity, and feel just as close to those in Scotland and Wales as they do other people in England. 

But to be honest, most people don't put that much thought into it and just say whichever comes to their mind first, with no deeper meaning behind it."
"I agree.
But Jackass is till JackASS.
Saying Jackarse just makes you sound like an arse hole."
"Yeah, this is the one that winds me the fuck up. It doesn't even seem like an Americanism. It's just really bad English. Are we just reverting to a grunting nation of cavemen?"
I thought it was the character putting on a slight us accent to sound more “business”. 
"Bloody hell, they're going to the one place in the world that you think would be best prepared for lost, excited children! Literally millions of kids have survived Disney without tracking technology.

"I'm convinced there's something weird going on here, lol.  Why is everyone (even the other car drivers) in this group so desperate for OP to be the one doing the driving?

If it's such a good deal doing this for £100 a month, why aren't the other car drivers biting each others hands off to do it?  Very odd."
"&gt; I recently heard that toilets in USA don’t splash water back up at you when you do a poo

I've heard *very* different. I believe some of them use the term ""Poseidon's Kiss"".

The water level in some American toilets is so high it is not unheard of for guys to find their tackle touching the water when they sit down."

If only there was that much good TV on!
"Well, I read all of that.

I think you really need to stick to your therapists plan.  It's the only way you will get better.

In terms of your reflux I would start with your diet.  Try and avoid sugary foods, excessively fatty foods.  Maybe also limit wheat.  If you can't cook at home I sort of wonder what you have been eating, and maybe a lot of takeaways is the cause?

In terms of your general issues you really need a medical professional.  Is there any family member to help you until your regular GP is back?"
"Mwahahaha.

However, I believe jackass is related to the donkey type ass.

And one can in British English legit say 'ass' as in 'The law is an ass.'"
"1. Historical ties to Seaford? 11 Generations ago? 

2. You 100% will not find a farm in the south of England for £250k, probably nothing reasonable for £500k. Land is very expensive in the southern half of the UK. You might find somewhere in Wales or Scotland for those prices. 

3. I suspect you will have trouble moving to the UK without a visa supplied by an employer or a shit ton of cash. I think you need £2 million for automatic acceptance. "
"I had an in-depth discussion about this one once.

They reckon it means like, ""I could care less, but I can't even be bothered to do that""

I wasn't convinced.

Nowhere near as derisive as ""Cu'nt care less mate."""
"I can see how it is *maybe* misleading, but 99% of people could work out what it means."
"&gt;some personal satisfaction but to be honest even just a good wage and less stress would be wonderful.

If you find this low stress, well paid job that brings job satisfaction please let me know.

However I imagine a venn diagram for those three things would be incredibly bare "
"Part of a customer facing role is to not take things out on the customer. NHS staff are generally ""customer facing"" so being overworked isn't really an excuse for unprofessional behaviour. 

By all means, they can bitch about us after we leave :)

There should be a review system in most hospitals where you can send feedback on difficult members of staff to the management. If they continue being like this, I'd use taste process. "
"Maybe try and get him to agree not to put more than £X of his own money in.  Tell your family to stay clear.

If he's a student at least it means he's probably not got much money or savings that could potentially be wasted in it. Although you'd better watch out for him dipping into the student overdraft for it.
