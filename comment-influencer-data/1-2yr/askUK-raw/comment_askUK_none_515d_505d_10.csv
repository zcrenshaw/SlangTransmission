Nice try mum. 
Our politics has become as tribal and polarised as American.  We are even beginning to use words like liberal and conservative in their American context and even as pejoratives.  The tone of media reporting on politics I feel is quite American too
"&gt; Because people on ~~Tumblr (and~~ Reddit) always speak as though the USA is the only country  
  
this pisses me off oh so much. The number of international subs I subscribe too and the comments from people where they don't seem to realise that there's a world outside their country. The story can be about anything anywhere, and there's always some dick in the comments ""well I'm American and here blah blah blah"" no one gives a fuck dude, we're talking about dress code for wimbledon.

"
"I think so. I was having a discussion with some young lgbti people about their rights and the American Tumblr influences were clear. They were talking about American laws, and American court cases, and didn't seem to grasp that that was in another country and didn't apply here. Because people on Tumblr (and Reddit) always speak as though the USA is the only country, they genuinely thought those things affected them directly. "
"You should refer them to the Property Odours Act 1986, section 4C, which states: ""The one who smelt it dealt it
"""
Set fires. And battle the noble firefighters who try to thwart their nefarious activities.
"Just be careful if in Scotland that they understand what you want, else you might end up with John Paul II cos he's a deid Pole."
"Closest I came was when we got a call via the ambulance service that a lady had slipped and fallen whilst walking her dog somewhere in woods on Epsom Downs. Weather was crap so we couldn't call the helicopter in, so we had to walk. Found her car in a car park and started off. Not long after a dog ran out of a small wooded area, barked and ran back in. It did this a couple of times as we approached and then disappeared into the trees. As we entered we heard the lady calling for help and found her with her dog next to her."
Western Union is **always a scam**
"They were police. So what they actually said was ""Ello ello ello what's all this then?"""
"No, you're confusing him with King Edward."
"Can you recall the exact words you used in the conversation with the dog? Presumably it started with *""What's that boy? A lady has slipped and fallen whilst walking you somewhere in the woods on Epsom Downs?""*."
And/or an attempted distraction theft or casing of the property. She should mention it to the local neighborhood policing team.
Sounds like a scam

We had a big one last year. Two chairs fell over in Cardiff and Mrs Simmons spilled her tea in the Cotswolds."

The most likely cause would be travelling at 14mph.
"At best, they're trying to guilt people into payment, and are therefore scammers who should be reported

At worst, they're actively casing houses for future break ins, and are therefore criminals who should be reported.

I don't know how anyone could clean windows without trespasing all over someone's property, so I'd be fuming just at that, let alone the rest of the dodgy stuff they're doing.  Local police and/or neighbourhood watch if she has them."
"Same here. My doctor has stopped my repeat prescription so we can have a review. I can't get an appointment until three weeks after my prescription will run out. Fucking joke. 

Edit: I just got an appt today by lying about it being an emergency. Feel bad but I do have an issue that I've ignored a bit to talk about too -.-"
"How disparagingly we talk about *every* aspect of British life, and how that doesn't mean we actually hate it, or even dislike it, and how   passionately we'll defend that exact same thing if anyone else even *hints* that it's not a really, really nice and good thing."
Honestly once every 2-3 months. Maybe shake the crumbs off weekly.
"""We're just collecting donations for the volunteer fire brigade in this lovely village. This lovely, lovely, flamable village. Be a shame if anything... caught fire. Donation's just peace of mind. Gosh, wouldn't that shed go up quick."""
"Or when they're all like ""omg that's unconstitutional / illegal / against code (?)"" or whatever, not understanding that their silly laws don't apply here (and vice versa). "
It's true. Nobody in the UK legitimately uses Western Union.
"&gt; We will then drive from London to Edinburgh by renting a car so as to get a good feel of the English countryside.

umm, most of this route is very very boring motorways. You could try the non-motorway routes, but it'll be quite slow in comparison, it's not a short drive.

you'd be better taking the train up to edinburgh (iirc it's only a 5h train?) and hiring the car there, imo. With the cost of fuel it'll work out about the same. use www.nationalrail.co.uk for best train prices , but note that the cheapest tickets are at the least busy times.

use skyscanner/kayak to find the best car hire deals, and yes you need to prebook or it'll cost a fortune.


&gt; Maps tells me the road trip is going to be 10-12hours long. What is it going to be realistically?

Much longer - with traffic it could easily be 15hrs. I've had it take me 4-5hrs to even get out of London to the motorways when driving before now. See above.

&gt; My parents are both vegetarians. What are the vegetarian options like in the restaurants?

it will be fine - almost everywhere in the UK sells vegetarian options on the menu these days.Most places have a menu outside so you can check before going in too.

one thing to watch out for also - don't rely on having phone signal in the Scottish highlands. If you are using a phone to navigate, you need an app that can navigate offline. Otherwise you'll need paper maps, or a proper satnav that uses GPS.

"The island is Britain so if you were born in Scotland, England or Wales you are British (or have a claim to be) if you were born in the bit of the UK which is England you are English. So all English people are British but not all British people are English. "
"If it is friendly, there is nothing wrong with taking it to the vet, because if it has a microchip, its owner can be contacted, (after all, one possibility is that the cat is owned but has somehow gone a long way from home), and if it appears neglected, then the vet is in a good position to judge.

Another thing you can do is attach a note to its collar.

However, if you feed it good stuff, and indeed let it in, it may well either adopt you (if it is a stray) or rehome itself (if it is owned) and you will have a new cat.

"
Does Boris Johnson count?
"Because the court didn't ""order the death"" of the child, it upheld the position of the doctors at the hospital that further treatment was not only futile, but traumatic to the child, and as such should be withdrawn. 

In the UK, noone owns a person. Parents, or the state, act as guardians of children until they are old enough to make decisions for themselves. At all times the best interests of the child should be at the forefront. "
"If the incident was only 101 worthy, you could literally be waiting days, regardless of what the man on the phone said; police resources are stretched incredibly thin."
"Short answer: no. The fact that he's asking you to replace the carpets is all the evidence you need. Cat smell isn't permanent and he might have a leg to stand on if he suggested a deep(er) clean of the property.

Tell him if he tries to claim for new carpets you'll dispute it through the deposit scheme arbitration service.

"Brit 1: \*Describes a clusterfuck of epic proportions\*

Brit 2: Hmm. That's not ideal."
"The best example of this is the NHS. You'd be hard-pressed to find a Brit that hasn't at some point in their lives complained about the NHS, but as soon as anyone not from the UK does the same, those very same Brits will defend the NHS til the cows come home. 

It's because we love the NHS that we complain about it; we want it to be the best that it can be."
"Some people think that anything they haven't done or that they wouldn't do themselves is weird.

I think it's weird to judge what other people want to do with their own money.

I go to other countries on my own a lot, the main thing that feels more difficult is going to restaurants, as a solo diner you can only try 1 or 2 dishes whereas with 2 people or a big group you can try lots of things. You may end up eating at food courts or fast food a lot, which would really suck in the UK, but it's ok in Korea as there's a lot more choices.

On the other hand, I don't know if there's that much to do in Seoul for 10 days. I'd split it between Seoul and Jeju if you can afford the extra costs. Or even between Korea and Japan but that might up the price a lot."
"When I was a farm hand I tipped a tractor, nothing too bad just a big shock but the working dog that was with me raced to the house and apparently barked at my boss so he knew something was up.

Led him to my dumbass standing in a field looking at the tractor. Good dog though."
The only thing I dislike about the current laws is that it generates threads constantly from confused Americans.
"Wrong day to ask this question mate. On a sunny day like this, they’ll all be in a McDonald’s car park somewhere "
"Very much so. Plenty of things about their culture are fine but I don't want us to lose what little we have left of ours to their dominance.

Also ""nail varnish"" is coloured varnish for nails. There's no polishing involved and it irks the fuck out of me that things like that have taken root over here."

"First. Make sure they're bees and not wasps, secondly assess whether you have a whole hive present. It could be just a few stray bees. 


If your bees are honey bees then you can call the local beekeeping association and tell them you have a hive that needs removing. They'll send a bee collector around and see if they can remove the hive. 


They're usually happy to take a hive away as it's cheaper than buying a new colony from a breeder. However your bees might be too difficult to remove and they might suggest calling an exterminator. 


If they're wasps or another type of bee (bumble bees/ masonry bees) then call in an exterminator.


As for the rook... I can't help you there.

Edit: pictures of said bees would be great"
"Simply, yes. One example that gets me is the sudden introduction of ""Black Friday"". Next thing that'll get inherited will be Thanksgiving. "
"&gt;Did the majroity of citizens aprove of the decision made by the courts?

there was a vociferous back-lash by rabble-rousers, but yes, I think it was mostly approved of.


&gt; Was this a case of forced euthanasia? 

No, the child was terminally ill and nothing could save him. Prolonging his life artificially was also prolonging his suffering.

&gt;Are all similar cases handled in the same way?

Cases like this are very rare, but there have been a few high-profile cases where the parents have wanted to do something that the doctors involved considered was not in the best interests of the child, and in those cases, courts end up making the decision, because someone has to.

&gt;Is this a budgetary constraint, was this child too expensive to maintain care for?

No. The NHS spent huge amounts of money on the child and would have continued to do so, if there was any chance that he could have had a reasonable quality of life.


&gt;Was the child suspected to be in pain/suffering?

Yes. Very much so. That was the entire point.


&gt;Does private healthcare exist in the UK and if so are there limits on what is allowed?

Yes, there is private health-care. I don't know exactly how it's regulated, but you can't just do any sadistic experimental treatment you feel like.


&gt;Why were the parents not able to accept the offer from the Vatican (who offered private care)?


Taking the child abroad for no good reason - and the Italian hospital had nothing to offer to improve his condition - was decided to be too disruptive and painful for  him. He'd have been unlikely to have survived getting out of the hospital, let alone survive an air journey without painful fits and seizures.


&gt;What are the parent’s rights in this situation, were all rights (including drastic mesures, such as renouncing citizenship to escape a court order) exahusted?

The parents rights don't and shouldn't supercede the child's rights. The court decided what was in the best interest of the child"

"You can go to the pharmacy for an emergency supply of your prescription. It sucks but at least you’ll still be able to take your meds. 
I’ve had to use the emergency dispensary before as my prescription was going to run out and the doctor wouldn’t reissue it without seeing me...despite the fact that I couldn’t get an appointment AND stopping it abruptly was life endangering. "
"i 100% agree with you

too many kids nowadays believe that the stonewall riots were the start of the modern lgbt rights movement, when they happened twelve years after the wolfenden report and two years after being gay was decriminalised in the uk

"I'm living in the US at the moment, have been for a while, and every time I come back home to visit my family in the UK I'm shocked by how much more Americanized things have become.

"People were generally indifferent to him, and the royal family as a whole in my opinion, until he married Diana Spencer. The manner in which his marriage to her failed, and more importantly I think, the way in which it was portrayed by the media, then turned the public against Charles, and to a lesser, but not insignificant extent, the Queen. Charles, because of his stiff upper lip upbringing, never really understood why and/or was unable to rehabilitate his image, so comes across as snobbish and aloof as a result. He's actually not as bad as he seems but that's largely I think because William and Harry are more like the Spencers than they are the Windsors and have helped him with his image."

What makes you think this? As far as I understand it, the monarchies of Scotland and England ceased to exist on the First of May 1707, when the Acts of Union came into effect and the monarchy of Great Britain was created.

Edit: Not that she's Queen of the British Empire either, of course. She's ""Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories"" - no Scotland or England or British Empire mentioned in there."

"The insurer has a right to subrogation, i.e. to recoup their losses paid on your claim. This will also help your annual premiums (smaller claim = lower premium). This is similar to if a car is written off and the insurers pay out for it, they keep the car as scrap.  
  
Best bet is to call the insurers and ask them about it, I'm sure they'll either take the money back and cancel the claim, or take the returned items from you.  
  
Alternatively you could keep the cash AND the items, but that then enters the risky world of insurance fraud and theft by deception."
