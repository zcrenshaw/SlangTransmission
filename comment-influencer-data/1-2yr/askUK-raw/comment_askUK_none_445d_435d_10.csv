"That we have bad teeth, just because our teeth aren’t bleached pure white and are their natural colour does not mean they are dirty or any less clean "
The one that annoys me is that I've been seeing a lot of people recently who seem to think we're some sort of authoritarian dystopia where you can't even make an offensive joke without the muslamic SJW thought police arresting you for hate speech
"Tell him to get some headphones or you’ll start making formal noise complaints to the council and police. Health problems mental or physical do not give you a green light to behave in an absolutely obnoxious manner to other people. Using suicide threats to try to justify this behaviour is totally out of order and deserves to be reported to the appropriate authorities in its own right (if genuine for his own welfare, and if not genuine to stop this pathetic behaviour)."
I had no idea not liking garlic was a stereotype
The ‘teeaboo’ stereotype of us all being delicately mannered ladies/gentlemen living in either romanticised Victorian London or a quaint countryside estate.
That's just yanks. Europe knows. 
"That we have bland, boring, or flat out bad food.

We fucking don't you cunts."
"Also because NHS dental work only does what is required for oral health, not what is just to look ""good"" (because some Hollywood smiles are tragic)."
"&gt; Performing, studying and mastering music is my job and essential

So go use a studio..."
"Yes, and if it is too loud it's probably been illegally altered and thus not road legal

Good luck getting a copper though"
"This sounds very much like a mental health issue. Call the police, insist they send someone round as you feel he is a danger to himself and others and insist they involve social services.
"
Could be dogging.
"Report him to the council, ignore his suicide threat it is a tool of manipulation. Show the council the letter as well as they may want to take action against him for the suicide threat as an antisocial issue."
"I don't know if this is a stereotype per-se, but it used to piss me off a lot. I lived in Paraguay for years and there was this prevailing belief among Paraguayans that in the 1800s Paraguay's power rivaled the British Empire and we got so scared that we conspired to get Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina to go to war against them and are therefore the reason that Paraguay is so underdeveloped today. Like, the British Empire did a whole lot of unpleasant things, but *that* really wasn't one of them."
"Oh man I’d kill for some rain about now, my lawn is yellow, everything is dying and I’m too hot. Obviously I will complain the second it starts to rain."

"I've got depression. I've been suicidal. Music does help me escape and calm me down. That's why I use this nifty new technology called 'headphones'. I hate people who use 'disability' as a 'do what I want' card. That's what I call an 'asshole'. 

If I'm honest (and probably controversial), if he's using these excuses, he might not have it as bad as he claims. If he hits a down moment in public, he would know that he can't blast music in certain places or scenarios. He will have had to invest in headphones for those moments, and indeed, situations like this when others complain. "
"I think it goes along with the whole ‘Brits don’t like food with flavour’, ‘all the food is boiled, bland and weird’ ‘British food is disgusting’ etc etc.



Unless I didn’t realise we’re all vampires..."
Maybe because they can't get the safety certificates on an incomplete product that could end up filled with nails and cancer before the child gets it.
"Fun story. About 15 years ago I was working during a bank holiday when every other business on a large out of town industrial estate was closed - it was just me and the receptionist.

Not much happening during the morning. We locked up and she drove us both to Tesco to grab lunch, which we ate before getting back to work. Around 2pm she visits the toilet, only to return and ask ""did you let someone into the toilet?""

Now, the toilet is outside the main office space, through 2 sets of doors, and on this quiet day on an otherwise completely deserted industrial estate, it would have been quite obvious if someone had entered the toilet from outside, from where I was sitting.

""Nope!"" I answered, ""then who is in the toilet?"" .. (chills). ""Um, maybe it's just next door!""  We wait about 30 minutes before she tried the toilet door again. Still locked. I go in there full bluster and knock heavily on the door, calling ""hello? anyone in there?"" into the locked toilet. Silence. I stand by the door for a few minutes, still silence.

We return to the office a little concerned, it's just me and her, and we're increasingly convinced some heroin addict is in the toilet. We phoned the boss, who confirms nobody is expected to be around the office except for us that day.

The two of us looked at each other with that kind of look that searches for a conscious answer we're both trying hard to bury. And that's when we hear the hand dryer in the toilet go off.

I ran back out and knocked on the door repeatedly, still no answer. Just the hand dryer running, and then it stops. The receptionist phones the police who refuse to come out for such as ""silly"" situation. So we call the boss back -- everyone is agreed we must open the locked toilet door.

And so we open it.

There is nobody in the toilet. No window that could be entered or exited through. Every entrance to the building locked up except for when we were present in the office to notice someone entering.

Just roof tiles.

That was the scariest fucking day I've ever worked. No clue what it was, or why it left the bathroom door locked, or how it triggered the hand dryer, but the only place it could have gone was into the roof space, also the only place it could have come from.

I hope OP has a bird or rat infestation."
"God, all the fucking yanks who act as though if someone breaks into your home you've got to help them take the T.V. to their van. 

Any foreigners reading this: it's perfectly legal to use reasonable force to defend yourself in your own home. Even if that reasonable force is killing the intruder. 

What you're not allowed to do is defend yourself, then chase them down the street with a cricket bat and beat the shit out of them, or shoot them as they're fleeing your property. 

Well known gangster [Kenneth Noye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Noye#Brink's-Mat) came across a man in his garden in the middle of the night and killed him. Turns out it was a police officer and he was under surveillance. He got found not guilty *of killing a police officer* under the grounds of self defence.  
And yet people still think we can't protect ourselves. "
"[The Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2011/1881/contents/made) has your answer! It essentially is safety-related: the sale of incomplete bears or ‘skins’ does not have their quality control stamp, so they cannot sell it as a ‘toy’, and they are not a fabric retailer.

The provisions were made from a European Directive, and full UK government guidance to the provisions can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/toy-manufacturers-and-their-responsibilities). "
Call the RSPCA
I think I read somewhere that we're tied with Germany for best overall dental health in the world.
"*God* that one always pisses me off as well. Fucking Paraguayans, take some personal responsibility for *ONCE*."
"It's not as simple as that. We have to pay for that and to do that they have to raise taxes which we all get pissy about.

Fuck being a politician. Not saying they do things right, especially not Mrs May. But we demand more of the things we have to pay for but refuse to may more for it.

But more specifically. Does it need more in comparison to other cities? How much police per person does it have? Greater London is the biggest city and the MET is the biggest force. What about in comparison to crimes?

Saying it's the biggest city so it needs more is a terrible way to think about it. It's all about crime and budgets."
"This is a great one, and something that annoys me greatly. It’s always said by someone who has never stepped foot here. Part of me thinks they know it’s bullshit because when you point out that things like ‘no-go zones’ have been debunked they don’t back down, I think they just say it because the love ‘liberal tears’ or some shit."
"This says it all really.

They stop fucking asking after that.

Also, so long as it doesn't break the contents rules they shouldn't be asking."

Single glazed windows and mould..
"Apparently people are putting garlic on bread and calling it ‘garlic bread’

GARLIC BREAD? GARLIC? BREAD? 

It’s the future, I’ve tasted it. "
Next time use the self-service machines.  I got annoyed at telling them exactly what was in my parcel so I just go to the bigger one in town and use those. You just have to confirm there's nothing in there they don't permit. 
"That it rains all the time, mwahahahaha."
Call the police.

"&gt;you tend to call a pharmacist a chemist

Some people do, although it's less common now.

A chemist. 

Pretty impressive how we can use one word and mean two different things right?"
I honestly can't help but feel incredibly proud whenever I see that picture.
Being disabled doesn’t give him a free license to be an inconsiderate cunt. If he has mastering to do he can do it during sociable hours. After that he can listen to his music for therapeutic purposes as loud as he likes... through headphones.
"TBF, we have all of those things.  We just also have tasty, interesting and good food. "
"&gt;I keep hearing that the NFL is popular in the UK

"There was... [LoveFilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoveFilm), which got bought out by Amazon, then finally rebranded to Amazon Instant. Unfortunately I think Netflix and Amazon Instant are now too big to be challenged by a small start-up which won't have either the financial backing to get anywhere near decent licensing costs, nor the customers needed by the content providers and advertisers.

Having said that, a sideways step by another media streaming company into movies/tv market (looking at you Spotify) wouldn't overly surprise me, but again would need a massive amount of investment."
Isn't it usually far-right Americans who need to justify the way that they and their establishment are acting by completely making up stuff about minorities in Europe?
"Probably the idea the queen or any royalty for that matter has any real influence on policies or politics in general.

Although, tbf, this is usually an American misconception from what I've heard."

"No the council are the appropriate authorities,its a civil matter as the police usually wouldn't get involved. 
Also if he's a social tenant ie council or housing association try speaking to them as they're the landlord. The council can install noise monitoring equipment in your property to monitor the noise levels but first they'll ask you keep a diary of the noise when it happens how long for, they may have forms to complete or you'll just need to write it down. But it'll build a case first.

"Yeah, damn Paraguayans and their landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as Corazón de Sudamérica (""Heart of South America"").[8]Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) outside Afro-Eurasia, and is the smallest[9] landlocked country in the Americas."

"The history of the East India Company is fascinating, and not widely known about. To modern sensibilities, the fact that a single company accounted for half of global trade is inconceivable. Not only that, it effectively administered entire countries, and had its own army."

Nah he is a prick. Not all bosses are like that. Change job / company.

"The stereotype I've noticed in a few pieces of American media, that we have really bad, yellow, wonky teeth. Most people I know have decent dental hygiene."
Without being rude and having no idea of the tone is that really criticism or a reprimand?  They could be your boss trying to encourage you to improve how you're interacting with the customers.
"&gt; Unless I didn’t realise we’re all vampires...

"The stereotype that we can't speak anything in a foreign language. I was in Spain and went to a bar to order two beers (dos cervezas) and the barman just leaned over and tapped a sign that said ""English order in English."" Then they'll whinge that we just talk loudly and slowly..."
"I read a study that said we have a similar level of dental health as people from the US with people from the UK having on average one tooth more in adulthood.

It really is just a case of the NHS not offering more cosmetic stuff to straighten out or whiten teeth. We can obviously get that privately but people either don't want to pay for it or aren't bothered about it cause it isn't as culturally prized. "
"Maybe op does need to speak louder, talk with more confidence, and have more enthusiasm or energy.

It really is hard to tell, however it should be something that is said in private and not in front of other people.

I think that the fact this si done in front of others gives us the context we need to say the boss shouldn't be doing it.

If it were me, I would speak to the boss in private and explain that I would like to work on my confidence but their offering of advice in front of others feels belittling and isn't helping my confidence."
It's rude to call it soda
"Poo, poop is American"
"It is typically the shop itself that is referred to as the Chemist - or more properly the Chemist's.

The relevant people who work there are pharmacists.

At the point when the use of the term Chemist's for the shop came into use, the existence of professional chemists otherwise was not something that would have concerned or even been know to the vast majority of people."
"Given Indian curries are an adopted national dish, the whole not liking flavours is nonsense."
"Basically in the mid 1800s they had an dictator who had the bright idea of attacking Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay simultaneously. He did this because Spain never really split up its territory that well so when everyone became independent just about every country in South America claimed  bits of other countries as their own.

Needless to say  this did not end well for Paraguay. Although no one knows for sure how many Paraguayans died in the war, at the lowest end at least 7% of the population died and at the highest end no more than 69% of the population died. Most modern estimates go for around half the population.


The belief that we caused the war dates back to the 1960s when Paraguayan and Argentinian historians decided to blame us despite lacking any evidence whatsoever. They claim that we orchestrated the war by telling the Triple Alliance of Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay to attack Paraguay so that we could claim their cotton plantations because we had lost access to American cotton due to their civil war.

There are some slight problems with this theory. 

1. This war kicked off in late 1864, fewer than 6 months before the end of the US Civil War. So getting American cotton wouldn't have been that hard.

2. We had already replaced the supply of American cotton with cotton from Egypt and India, whom we held far greater control over than we ever could with Paraguay. 

3. Britain was actually going through a bit of a diplomatic crisis with Brazil at the time, as in we'd cut off diplomatic relations with them. Also before the war started our diplomat in Paraguay had asked their president to not make hostilities with the neighbouring countries.

Academically at least the claim that Britain caused the war is considered bullshit of the highest order."

"The USA is even worse than the UK in that regard. Places like Applebee’s, Olive Garden have mounds of stodge made from poor quality, highly processed ingredients. Even their McDonald’s is significantly worse than the UK version which has 100% chicken breast in their nuggets etc. "
I can't believe you're the only one saying this. The authorities need to be made aware of the situation as the guy is clearly a potential danger to himself and others.
