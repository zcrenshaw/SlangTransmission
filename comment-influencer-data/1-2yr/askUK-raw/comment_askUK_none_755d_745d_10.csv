"Yes, because it was my fault it got cold and it would be unfair to punish the tea for my mistake."
"I think it's because historically the weather wouldn't be great so you socialise indoors. We don't have grapes so can't make wine so it was beer as the only safe drink because the water would be contaminated as  fuck.

It's also a social lubricant, the cliché of the awkward aloof brit is over done but a pint does help. "
I'd vote Remain *even harder.*
"Report her for harassment and get a restraining order. 

Edit: I'll add that last year I had a very odd neighbour like this. I'm 21 and it was a term-time house for uni but when I was moving in (I was the first of my housemates to move in) she came round and had a go at me for not fixing the smoke detector that was beeping due to low battery (I hadn't even finished unloading my car at that point). 

She then had a go at my ex girlfriend for sitting on our adjoining wall, and decided to try and scare her by talking about a murder in the area. Also threatened us that she didn't like students and would report us to the police &amp; uni for excessive noise and stuff.

We had a chat with the university community outreach team (who already knew of her from previous students) and he got the PCSOs round to have a chat with her. She didn't say anything to us for about 8 months until the end of the year, when she was upset we were coming home at 3-4am and apparently slamming doors (we weren't, and the dates she specified were dates we weren't even there). But we were moving out the next week so just ignored it.

It may be worth asking for a PCSO to go round first and talk to her. As someone else lower down said - these types are usually very happy to threaten police action but absolutely terrified of it themselves. Having a PCSO come round may well scare her off for a while. "
Ben and Jerry's. It's probably for the best that I only get it on offer. My waistline is thankful.
"&gt;On the weekend she spoke directly to my son and threatened him with being taken away by the police! 

Report this - think of the other point of view. There's a neighbour who is deliberately and constantly watching your children and showing irrational behaviour including theft. What happens when they have a really bad day and decide to punish your kids for you - do you want them smacking your child or making up lies to get the social services to take your kids away? 

Get your own notebook and start writing this all down and dating it. This is not normal and could escalate - if you've tried nice then its time to get serious. A chat from a local police explaining that she cannot go around stealing peoples things, threatening children or deliberately locking them out. "
"I think Scottish nationalism and English nationalism aren't so different.

Scottish nationalism is about the desire for the Scottish people to govern Scotland.

English nationalism is about the desire for the English people to govern Scotland."
"Well I can tell you what NOT to do, don't try and bring anything that can be classed as a weapon into the UK in your standard checked in suitcase without any sort of declaration...speaking from experience, sadly. I have a permanent record with UK customs now. "

"He is currently under an arrest meaning he is bound by PACE code C, which is the legislation detailing what the police are allowed to do to detainees.

Under section 5.4, it says ""If the detainee agrees, they may at the custody officer’s discretion, receive visits from 
friends, family or others likely to take an interest in their welfare, or in whose welfare the 
detainee has an interest. See Note 5B""

But this only applies ""At the custody officer’s discretion and subject to the detainee’s consent, visits should be 
allowed when possible, subject to having sufficient personnel to supervise a visit and any 
possible hindrance to the investigation."" - Note 5B

All this means is there is no legal restrictions against it, but two conditions have to met: the detainee wants you there and the custody Sgt can allow it. However it may not be justified by the custody Sgt for certain reasons depending on the investigation and circumstances, it will be recorded why permission was denied but I'm not too sure whether you would be privy to that information.

I would recommend trying to get in touch with the force in question and ask to speak to the custody Sgt where the person is being detained and try and speak to them about it. However it might not be applicable in this situation.

Edit: Also with regards to confidentiality, the detainee has the right too have someone informed of his whereabouts (unless there is a specific reason to hold someone incommunicado) and they are entitled to a phone call when it is reasonable to do so. This is under all under Section 5 of Code C. But if you ring up the police requesting information they will not be able to give it to you due to data protection and confidentiality.

Unless,  section 5.5 comes into play where ""If a friend, relative or person with an interest in the detainee’s welfare enquires about their 
whereabouts, this information shall be given if the suspect agrees and Annex B does not 
apply. See Note 5D."" so the detainee would have to agree to agree to it and the custody Sgt would have to allow it, before you could find out more information.

He is under police detention which makes who he communicates with very difficult, meaning he would have to ask for you or phone you, to get the ball rolling to visit him. You won't be allowed to just rock up and demand to speak to him, that is not how it works."
People who want to avoid having noisy children ruin the movie. 
"The problem you have is that ""important news"" is subjective - some people are looking for news of a terrorist attack, some want to know whenever Kim Kardashian has had an abnormal dump. 

How about looking to see if there's a news site you like the stance of and see if they have an RSS feed?"

"Not sure that the full Union flag has those associations, but the England flag does a bit. That's mainly because of football hoolie arseholes wanting to fight people from other countries. There's also the difference between Scots and Welsh nationalism, and English nationalism, being that they want to govern themselves independently, but English nationalism is in large part xenophobic.

"You are most certainly not mad, especially if you are from the UK. It's a lovely country. It has its faults but so do many others including those in Europe. We still have many things going for us and I personally believe that Brexit won't be that bad once things are understood."

"You need a copy of The Curry Secret. It's a whole book about how to cook curry the way takeaways do, and has little to do with the recipes you encounter about ""proper"" Indian cooking. 

Otherwise, apparently the usual problem is not using enough oil and spices..."
"Story time I guess. It's not that interesting though. Does make me look like an idiot, but I was 18. 

I was on my post A-levels holiday with friends to Sunny Beach in Bulgaria. We came across a market stall that was selling ninja throwing stars pretty cheap. Myself and 3 others bought one, and packed them in our suitcases to come home. 

When we were waiting at the collection area, our suitcases never came round, until about 10 minutes after everyone else's. They waited for us to collect them, then collared us and asked us to follow them into a side room. They scanned the suitcases in front of us, revealing a big fucking shiny star shaped object in the middle of our suitcases. They opened them, took them out, and gave us the talk about how what we'd just done was illegal. 

They asked what use we had for our weapons, we said we just thought they looked cool, and weren't going to commit any acts of ninja terror with them, so they took our details, logged us into the computer, and said that we were being let off with an official warning. It's not a criminal record, and it won't show up at standard passport control. The only time it'll ever come back to haunt me is if I do something along the same lines again, and they see I'm a repeat offender - then I'll be criminally charged. 

They were quite alright about it really. They said the flights from Bulgaria have young people bringing shit back every week. They said a guy brought a taser back the week before, and he was arrested on the spot. So yeah, to bring it back to the thread topic, a sword would also likely result in arrest. "
Americans get touchy about minor swears anyway.  I thought it was hilarious that I couldn't swear on American Call of duty servers because kids might be playing but no one recognised the irony of letting kids play a game that revolves around killing.
"I absolutely agree. It's not even big events like the ones you mention, summer barbecue? Get mashed. Trip down the beach in the middle of the day? Get mashed. 

In fact a lot of people I know drink pretty much every single day. Maybe it's just because I grew up in a household that didn't really drink except at big occasions, but I'm with you OP, it seems everything revolves around it to the point where some people cannot have fun without it."

"You guys idolise guns and your constitution.  We like a little old lady who opens train stations and bridges.  I guess every country has its weird ideas.


More practically every country needs a head of state.  We are *really good* at doing monarchy.  If we had a ceremonial elected President we would still need a palace, security and a lot of the other expenses.  And the monarchy has practically no political power, not just less than it did.

"News channels are very popular in the UK. Fox doesn't fall into that bracket, however. It is a right-wing, opinion-based entertainment channel with a focus on a completely different country to our own. It is surprising that it was ever aired."

"&gt;But ever since I gave up drinking 18 months ago, i've realised just how much of UK life revolves around it.

Having spent some time in Europe, it's not *when* we drink, it's how much and how quickly.

French people drink watching sports, with a meal, with friends, and probably more than we now do at work (as in lunchtimes).  But they drink so much more slowlly.  They will often make 1-2 drinks last all night.  Beers come in 250ml sizes, and are made to last an hour.  We tend to be queuing up the next pint after 40 minutes. (40 minutes or a lot, lot less.  I've been to some pubs where the locals would get 8 pints in between finishing on the trades at 5pm, and leaving for dinner at home at 7pm).

That doesn't actually answer your question of why we drink  *excessively*, just to say we aren't odd for drinking *often*."
"In that case, I think you'll find a bigger divide between rural and urban areas - even in the same county.

"I am not from, but I am IN Yorkshire.

Yes, at one level it is a ripoff.

At another level, it is more like a 'cover charge' for sitting in the pub. So if you get a pint, you are charged roughly the same whether it's beer or soft.

At my kind-of local though, in the countryside, alcohol-free beer is free and unlimited for the designated driver. This does please my adopted Yorkshire heart.
