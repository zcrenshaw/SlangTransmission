I'd have stamped on their hand and taken the phone then tracked down the nearest staff member.
"The numbers are in eighths of an inch (so a ""number 4"" leaves your hair 1/2 an inch long). 


However, the best way to do it is to get it right once, take a photo of it, and just hand them the photo and say ""make it look like this"". "
Fcukd off.
Offering to suck him off probably won't help. 
"You have to call them by their proper names: taps.  It's the only way to win their respect and get them to serve you.


^nope."
"&gt; Will people hate us because we’re American?

Generally you will find some hate, but what you will soon realise is that it is okay because it is an equal opportunities hate. We hate people from other countries outside the UK, countries inside the UK, people from the north, the south, the next town over and the other side of the street. We are a highly tolerant nation, we have to be because we hate everybody including each other."
"Log everything that's  happened, tell them you're going to the police if they continue with this behaviour - and then follow through if they do (101).  This is bullying.  "
"If you've suddenly become less visible than you were during Freshers she's probably just trying to make sure you don't feel left out or homesick.

If she does it again just casually tell her there's nothing wrong but you need to get some work done/recharge/whatever and you'll probably be out later on if she wants to hang out then."
Yes
it's pronounced scone not scone
Not at all. I'm now a 100m swimming world record holder.
"Except that banks are very much alike shops. They're designed to serve people. Closing after 5pm when most people leave their work absolutely makes no sense.

Those people who work in these banks aren't hedge fund managers, investment advisor, etc etc. 

I get it if we're talking about bankers who work in an office at one of towers in City of London but this is completely different situation."
"Just tell them the police were informed you had a CCTV camera and came with a warrant for the data.

I mean, it shouldn't ever come to that, but I'd also speak to the police about it"
"They're just having a gander, mate "
"FCUK wasn't the brand, the brand was and is French Connection and still exists. FCUK was an advertising concept."
That it's illegal to have two bank accounts? Is your society one that involves wearing tin foil hats ;) 
"It's probably the other girl who is finding it hard to cope alone.

Given you say she's very nice, yes, speak directly to her and tell her you need your space sometimes."
"post this on /r/casualuk mate, will go down very well there."
"I just said the same thing to myself but if I really think about it I'd be so shocked that I'd probably laugh and then walk off, then regret not taking the phone "
"That is a Grey squirrel.

Most noticeable is the little tufts on their ears."

"This can't be serious. 

*sigh*

If it is, the reason is because your symptoms are probably caused by a virus, and antibiotics don't work against a virus. Taking antibiotics you don't need only causes antibiotic resistance in things we can cure with them, which could mean we suddenly find we all start dying from perfectly treatable illnesses again. 

So there you go. Rest up and take some cold and flu tablets."
"I'd go to the police.

Guessing from post history you are male, imagine this sort of thing less common for us guys, but no less wrong.

Whether or not they have CCTV monitoring the entrance of the toilets would be impossible to know.  Also, you don't know if someone had been waiting there for 40 minutes to indulge whatever sick bit of voyeurism they were planning.  With no description it may be very hard to find who it was."
"If you don't understand when rent may or may not be payable, owning a business may not be for you, at the moment. "
"They count, check, double check then get another to check and double check. Everything has to be verified multiple times"
"I asked my local Turkish barber for ""zero all over"" and he baffled me completely by offering me ""super zero"".

It was, indeed, super."
"It's never crossed my mind.

Guess I missed the memo about it being one of our cultural touchstones. "
I called police on my neighbour once. He was beating up his gf.  It could only have been me as no neighbour on the other side. I had the same worries. I told the police this and they said that the guy might know but wouldn't do anything as it would be obvious and witness intimidation would up the severity of any punishment.  I never had a problem from anyone after that. Talk to the police and see what they say. 
"Well yes, why on earth wouldn't it be? "
"Theme Hospital.

Stupid people don't think about consequences. When dealing with morons it's best not to rely on logic.

"EEA member states are allowed to implement a transition period before the workers from new member states have to be given the same rights as workers from other member states.

Portugal, Denmark, Ireland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania gave Croatian workers full rights in 2013; Norway did it in 2014; Spain, Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Iceland did it in 2015 and Austria, the Netherlands, the UK, Malta, Slovenia and Liechtenstein have extended the transition period until 2018. In return, Croatia won't grant full rights to EEA member states until those states grant reciprocal rights, so British citizens can't freely work in Croatia until next year."

"I once took a 111 call from a guy who kept birds of prey. He went to give one of his hawks a kiss and she took a chuck out of his lip with her beak.

I've also taken a call from a girl who was bitten by her mum's pet micropig and ended up having a long discussion with a colleague about whether that counts as a large animal."
It sounds like you are complaining that people in the bank work the same hours as you. 
"No it's absolutely reasonable to get the police involved given the circumstance (but use the non-emergency number). TBH you'll probably only need to threaten it once then they'll fuck off. Alternatively, you could speak to your local MP, or complain direct to the Job Centre in question alleging harassment. Hell, you could even get in touch with your local paper - they like stories like this!  

Either way tell your employer what you are doing - they'll probably appreciate that you're taking steps to stop this slightly aggravating situation at your place of work.  "
"It does depend on your pineapple allocation status though. For example, if you are under 21 and have an HMRC declaration for a pineapple within the last five years (so from 16, although I believe it is less than five years if you are under 21) then strictly one bank account. "
Never heard of it.
"UK airports pre 2001 were more or less like they are now, just with fewer actual restrictions at security. US airports were very different, with much less separation between air-side and land-side. You used to be able to walk up to the boarding gate before any security checks at LAX, whereas nowadays, they operate much like in the UK with a security point after check-in."
"&gt;do anything now?

Yes. Phone 0800405040 or text 61016 with the details (include the time and station). 

It's possible this has happened and been reported before and they may have some idea of who it is, or at the very least they can investigate.

"It's pretty much just a muted version of what Americans do - there's nowhere near the same enthusiasm for it. Here in Somerset it used to be much more traditional and the whole village would get together and roast a virgin to death inside a giant wicker man in order to appease the Old Gods and secure a bountiful harvest for the year to come, but that got banned a couple of years ago because it offends Muslims or something. Political correctness gone mad! "
"I don't come from a rich family, but every penny that has come our way is spent on the next generation. Because of this, I am not charged to live with my parents. The same will be done for my children if I have any and it is the same courtesy afforded to my mother and the rest of my family. We take the view that if you have to charge your sprog to live in the same house as you then you couldn't afford to have them in the first place, hence we are a very small family.


Also, by taking money from your children all you do is increasing the time for which they will have to stay with you, reducing their ability to collect together a deposit for their own place.   "
"Fairly common, or though I'd generally say s\*\*t-faced more commonly these days myself. So arguably getting antiquated. Rat-arsed if it's christmas day and you're with family, s\*\*t-faced any other time.

&gt; Can I Americanize and say ""rat-assed?""

Plis no."
"Ticket inspectors do exist, I had a massive argument with one once because I'd lost my ticket. Pointing out that getting on a bus is done single-file, that you immediately face the driver and that being a somewhat large man and not trained in ninjutsu, it's literally impossible for me to sneak on without buying a ticket didn't go down so well. "
"To everybody saying the numbers correspond to the length:

This guy is legit. You can tell because he uses 'DM' like all the old people and isolated media types who inhabit twitter do instead of PM like the rest of the universe. 
"This is because most US exams are based on questions you've already seen, so well prepared candidates score very highly. UK exams jazz things up a bit. We had a lot of American exchange students and they were amazed at ""having to understand all this stuff"" (direct quote)"
"1) you might have overstayed your stop

2) you might have been using a fraudulent weekly pass, that you knew you could get past a driver, but not a close look by an inspector

3) the driver might have taken your money and not given you a ticket - the driver would then have stolen that money."
"&gt; Her office would be in Richmond which looks to be relatively close to London. Is Richmond a good place to live or if we can afford it, would we be better off in London? If in London, which burough? Or is there an even better city/town nearby?

Richmond is a great place to live - but it's VERY expensive. She better be paid a lot. 

&gt; Where do you research homes? Zillow, craigslist, apartments.com?

rightmove, zoopla, etc.

&gt; What is the SOP for finding a job? I’m in the media production field (mostly video work). Do you use Monster.com, The Times website, cold calling?

register on related websites (cwjobs.co.uk for IT jobs etc), LinkedIn is very popular. Most companies use job agencies, most job agencies are terrible.

&gt; What American things won’t be available in the UK (food, appliances, TV shows/movies)?

it's not the 3rd world, but not everything is. Appliances are mostly the same. 

&gt; What are the big day-to-day lifestyle things that are different in the UK?

How do we know? we've only ever lived in the UK

&gt;  How do I get cable and internet? Do you have FiOs or Comcast?

These companies (and indeed, concepts), do not really exist.
There are some fibre internet providers, but not all cover all areas. There's a fair amount of free TV available to anyone via digital receivers, which are included in almost every TV made in the last ten years. 

&gt; Will my electronics work there (iphone, ipad, computer)?

Yeah, though you might need plug convertors for the different voltages. 

&gt; Will my US purchased iPhone be eligible to be transferred to a UK carrier?

should do. Depends on your US carrier really.

&gt; How often will I be expected to watch soccer?

between never and as much as you like.

oh moving with the dog is going to a complete pain. Lots of landlords and agencies don't allow for pets. Best thing you can do is try to speak to landlords directly and offer to put a larger deposit down for any damage etc. 

you might be best off finding a specific america expat subreddit/forum, since they can give you a better idea of what to expect. "

"Jane Leeves *is* English and Daphne in Frasier is one of the worst I've ever heard. To be fair she was born in Essex and has been in the US for 30 years so a Manchester accent would be a bit of a challenge but it's really, really bad.

I can't really think of anyone who nailed it, probably because I only notice when it's bad and don't generally know where actors come from anyway."
"It is nothing of the sort. The US, by contrast, grants it's police huge licence to confiscate assets on the road, shoot to kill, and use military force that the UK generally regards as the hallmark of a police state."
Bad bot
The only post which explains what the numbers mean!
"Give them no more information than you have so far. 

When they come in get all the information you can about THEM, WHICH work program, name of the provider, names of the people harassing you, name of their supervisor. 

Then you're going to want to report them to the DWP... who will ignore you, so you should also send a letter to your local MP explaining that you suspect they're trying to defraud the taxpayer, and if they're pulling this stunt with you they've probably done it before etc. 

If that doesn't generate anything, local press are ALWAYS dying for stories like this, it's the closest the staff at the Small Town Observer get to being journalists most of the time. 

If THAT doesn't work, Baroness Buscombe in the Lords seems to be... it's surprisingly hard to phrase this how I'd like without getting political, but, well, she'll probably take it seriously and seems to be *decent*. "
Important to note that France hate is by invitation only. The English are very possessive about it. Talk of Freedom Fries will be ridiculed. 
"Yeah this OP. The key when someone starts hating on you is to laugh along and then quickly deflect the hate onto a mutual target. 

Example -

""Fuck Americans, so loud and ignorant!

""hahah, yeah we are like that...but what about the French tho?""

Job done, then you can both enjoy hating on the French. 

(we are mostly friendly though I promise)"
Those teenagers that wore it have grown up and those adults keep quiet out of shame.

"I really hate to burst your bubble but the UK is nothing like Harry Potter. Accents are different across the country, if you're going to Newcastle you might want to acquaint yourself with the Geordie accent. And trains are pretty expensive. 

But other than that the UK is pretty nice. Only advice for coming here is don't be a dick, don't constantly talk about how things are better/different in America, know how to handle your liquor, get used to the crap weather. Have fun :D"
