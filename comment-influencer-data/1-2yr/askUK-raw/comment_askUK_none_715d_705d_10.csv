"My house is made of brick, not matchsticks so I'm not worried.  Also I'm in England."
"Mine are perfectly straight and icy white, the pair of them."
Bad teeth.
The Pre-EU one
I'd say go with dark fruits cider rather than WKD. I doubt he'd get mocked but to be on the safe side strongbow dark fruits is both a 'lads' drink and tastes fairly nice.
I've put ankle weights on the kids. 
Am I in Australia? No? All good.

It irritates me no end when people don't realise that the 'UK' and 'England' are not interchangeable. 
"Fuck off, mate. 

We call chips chips. We call crisps crisps. Biscuits are biscuits. 

It's called English, and we speak it."
"I'd personally just word it as ""personal circumstances"", and if they looked to dig more you could hint that it was medical. It doesn't really feel like it's any of their business really, you're not under any obligation to give them your life story, if you're just going for a job in a pub I doubt they need to know your entire history. "
"None. This is the UK, we don't get hurricanes.

Thank you for your touching concern, though."
"it's mostly mildew/mold. If houses are not properly insulated, then water can leak into the brickwork and corrode floorboards etc over time.  "
"It's probably a bit like things like Spaced and Black Books - big on reddit because of the subject matter and age.  The average person on the street would probably have vaguely heard of it (and would be far more likely to know Big Bang Theory or...Mrs Browns Boys).

The big breakout C4 comedy is undoubtedly still Father Ted."
Nope. But I wouldn't do that with a place I liked either. I don't think I've ever seen anyone do it. 
"Never even heard it, but being in the south east and relatively Viking free I guess I wouldn't."
"As a driver it really unnerves me when cyclists do that. I don't know your intentions - all I see is you barreling towards the junction at speed. I don't know if you're going to turn, cut right across me, stay in the cycle lane, or what. I don't want to hit a cyclist so it's kinda frightening when one flings themselves right in your path."
It's quite bizarre considering most Brits these days get free orthodontic care until they leave school whereas Yanks have to kill off their nan for her inheritance and remortgage their house to even speak to a dentist  
I'm sure they are very friendly but literally the worst people I've ever met at forming queues but they are the best at walking slowly in front of busy people
"That there is a thing which is ""The British accent""."
"1. Egg on toast or beans on toast are quick and easy to prepare, and yet still healthy tasty meals.  It's a quick breakfast, or a ""fuck it, cba"" type meal, not something we'd eat constantly.

2.  I think that's vloggers and TV, rather than anything to do with actual life.  I've never been to a costume party in my life, and it's not something that happens constantly.  Only time people dress up at all really is halloween, and that's only because of influence from your side of the pond - it's a relatively new import."
"I thought the same thing until I tried it, but I actually find it makes it more chilled.

You don't have to stand around queueing as long, you know you'll definitely get locker space (in my experience it tends to be 50:50 whether they start handing hold stickers out or not, but maybe I fly at busier times to you) so you don't have to stress about any electronics or fragile souvenirs getting bashed around, and it only costs a few quid."
"Oh God don't do that. Phone, email, in writing or in person. I cannot think of anything less professional than putting in a formal complaint via Facebook Messenger. "
"Weather- our weather is very decent, but it's random, that's why we moan about it/ use it as a safe topic of conversation."
"When out of range of F&amp;M or Harrods, I've found some of the food in M&amp;S to be quite agreeable."
"Things like sausages are for big blow-outs like Christmas dinner, when you have to include everything  that you can possibly thing of to go on the plate.

Normal Sunday is beef or lamb, roast potatoes, 2 or 3 other veg, (broccoli, carrots, peas, to be traditional, roast peppers aren't traditional but go well with it), yorkshire puddings, gravy."
"I get wound up by the romanticising of WWII and the ""Blitz spirit"", keep calm and carry on and the like. Tens of thousands of people died and millions lost their homes but sure, we were just so much friendlier and more stoic back then!"
Your deposit should be in a protected scheme which your landlady has no access to?
That would be an ecumenical matter. 
"A classic: Waited for a loud bit of a song to do a thunderous buttock wobbler of a fart, then realised I was on a bus with earphones in."
"- Food.  It's kind of OK.  It's got a lot in common with foods in other Northern European countries.

- Movies - We wish Americans would get over whatever 200 year+ hang-up you have about British people.  In historical films it's the worst - British/English good guys become American (or Irish or Australian) and bad guys in any movie are always Brits.

- (Specific to this sub). We have no particular opinion on the US revolution or X colonial event.  We weren't taught about it in school.

- (Specific to US films and TV) You can spend a lot of time in London without seeing Tower Bridge or Big Ben.

- It really doesn't rain all the time.  (Unless you are in the South West/West, then it sometimes does).  It also isn't cold here at all, compared to similar latitudes.

You’ll need to take it to the post office and tell them where you’re sending it. It’ll cost more than a normal stamp. 
"There should be a risk assessment. Where the risk is considered high, steps such as visiting with a colleague should be taken."
"Ask your brother what he wants to drink?
"
"Biscuits (as you call them) are ""those things Americans call biscuits that are kinda like scones""

Also, maybe you didn't mean it this way but calling us adorable makes you come off as a patronising twat. "
You should really stop at the give way line even though you’re joining a cycle lane (think of it like you are joining a road that a cycle lane happens to be on)..
"You want to ask a major brand for a better wage during an interview, and you're under 18?

You'll be laughed out the door."
"&gt; 80% of my course is girls 

It's ok to have female friends though. They are just people after all."
"It's lovely. My office in Nottingham overlooks this annoying white tent-like building which often produces a bit too much glare.Today, it's like somebody has put a gentle yellow filter over it.

7/10, would get dust blown into the atmosphere by a storm again."
"You are responsible for council tax whilst you have tenancy of the property. For any other time outside of that tenancy, the landlord is responsible. 

Get definitive confirmation of the dates, and make sure your contract clearly states the start date of your tenancy. Once done, you can let the landlord know that, unfortunately, this is his problem. 

Background: I am a landlord, and from the moment a tenancy ends through to the moment a new tenancy starts, all property costs (water, gas, electric, tax) are my problem."
Travelling to work on a packed bus. Got up to press the bell that was a bit in front of me and forgot I was sitting on one of those fold down seats that ping straight back up. So you can guess what happened next. Right in front of everyone. Practically ran off the bus in shame. This was 12 years ago and I still cringe about this memory more than anything else I've done in my life 
"Been in the news a lot recently, especially the perception the Police/CPS don't do very much.

It's a good way for losers to feel morally superior"
"no and no

this is the UK, it will just be a big wind.

plus we live in proper houses"
"No advice, just popping in to wish her the best of luck in this new phase of her life. Astonishing work to kick such an addiction after that number of years."
"Stocked up on beer, I live in Bristol and opposite a Tesco extra so I may have taken things a little too far."
"Detailed information on your plans for the next several hours are not required. This is a pleasantry, the function of which is to fill that awkward silence while your card payment goes through. All that is required of you is a short and light sentence about a socially acceptable activity which you may or may not actually be planning to do (much like your actual level of wellbeing does not necessarily correspond to your answer of 'good'). It is absolutely vital that your answer begins with the word 'just'. 'Pop' as an alternative to 'go' is also advised.

Examples include:

Just popping to the pub for a couple of drinks  
Just popping round a few shops  
Just popping to the cinema  
Just popping in that new club  
Just popping home to watch some telly  
Just popping to see my aunt

If the card payment still hasn't gone through, you should elaborate your plans starting with 'thought'.

For example:

Thought we'd check out that film  
Thought I'd have a look for a new coat  
Thought we'd see what it's like  
Thought we'd have a couple of G&amp;Ts  
Thought it'd remind her to keep me in the will

If it *still* hasn't gone through, make it clear you're on a deadline using the word 'before'.

For example:

Before bed  
Before winter  
Before the babysitter finishes  
Before my cousin poisons her against me

If the card payment ***still*** hasn't gone through your card has been declined and you should prepare to pay cash."
Biscuits. Hobnobs are the best. 
"I HEAR YOU'RE A RACIST NOW, FATHER? SHOULD WE ALL BE RACISTS NOW?"
That we want Brexit.
"I say, no it is not bad.

I think the UK is an incredibly tolerant and fair country, probably one of the least racist on the planet.

I also think it has gone an incredible distance in terms of anti-racism in 50-60 years (length of my life).

Of course there have been many racist incidents, some of which have rightly got a lot of publicity e.g. murder of Stephen Lawrence.

But one thing is that the authorities have, over the last decades, tried hard to attack racism.

Now, I always post how good things are for non-whites and how amazingly things have changed in my lifetime, and people tell me I (and the hundreds of other non-whites I have known and talked about) must have been lucky. But I honestly have never ever had a non-white or immigrant complain to me about British racism, other than about the attitudes of other non-whites.

I am ethnically Chinese; I have lived in every kind of environment, some posh and some very not posh, and known every kind of person.

I currently live in a Northern, working-class town which is 99% white British by ethnic monitoring. I can't speak too highly of the people and of their attitudes, not just to me, but to 

The people who get most racist attitudes directed towards them where I live, are travellers. This is partly because they leave a lot of litter.

"Wow they seriously don't have fries at KFC?

I thought deep fried chicken and fries was the most american thing there is. "
"This is extremely common around East London / Essex way, don't think it's a Northern thing at all. "
"Not much love here so far for that old British staple, cabbage.

That's fine, I'll have yours."
"Remember the good old days, with fish and chips and polio?"
"Depends on the injury.

Stroke, heart attack, major blood loss etc - you **should** get an ambulance fairly quickly (dependant on what other jobs are on at that moment in time).

A none-life threatening, although painful knee dislocation is way way down the list. "
"I bet they have a website and they would definitely have a wikipedia page.  Start there?

Or watch the Stonecutters episode of the Simpsons, it's basically that.

Well there goes anyone doubting if you’re actually autistic 
You’d have to be very self centred to think an entire culture was ableism 
That our NHS has death panels deciding who gets treatment and who died. The NHS isn't perfect but virtually nobody here would do away with it.
It's because in the UK we use a knife and fork at the same time. This means we don't have the US problem of having to chop all our food up and then eat it like a child.
"&gt; stopping water getting in/staying.

It's also about letting water get out, mold/mildew is made worse by having bad ventilation in bathrooms, hanging your washing out inside, steam from cooking etc.
"
They do a good independence referendum.
"I mean, i get what you're saying.  And its a known fact that people with aspergers find it hard or impossible to read emotions or subtle undertones but;

&gt;I'm not sure if this is ableism outright, but it does seem to be erasure of non-neurotypical perspectives, this unstated assumption that everyone will just ""get"" the subtext of what's being said.

No. Just no. 

British humour has been around far longer than aspergers or even autism has been a diagnosis. 

You're not being deliberately victimised and the assumption that ""Everyone"" will get the joke generally rings true. 

1.1% of the British population is believed to be autistic, of which an even smaller % will have aspergers.  You could get 100 random people in a room and on average there would be no one with aspergers"
"Outside humidity can be very high (100%), add in old victorian brick house that's inadequately heated, with 1980's double glazing, a cheap 'on-suite' shower built into the bedroom with large north facing wall that's perpetually in the shade, next to the kitchen, and you will have water running down those walls."
"Personally, and it may be a generational thing, I'd rate The IT Crowd above Black Books in popularity."
They aren't really a thing here so I don't think we have a name for them
Yep. I think the last time it was used was Christmas 2004 when there was the real possibility of a mince pie shortage.
