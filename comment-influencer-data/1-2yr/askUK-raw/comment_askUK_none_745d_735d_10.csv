"That aisle is called the ""Midl"" "
"&gt;""But I see people post 'slow clap' on reddit all the time as a mark of respect""

&gt;As a mark of respect

Mind. Blown.

Are you telling me, all those times I see ""slow clap"" they are *not* being sarcastic?"
"Boyo and blimey aren't swearing, bloody is extremely mild, bird is low level misogyny and just naff.

Saying any of them as an American is going to make people's eyes roll so fast they'll get whiplash. "
"Yes, because I'm not an animal."
"Middle classes have what is called a concerted cultivation style of raising children, where parents have direct input in what children do in their spare time - such as learning musical instruments, reading lists, playing sport, extra classes and tutoring if the child is doing poorly, etc. Children are addressed by their parents as if they were relative equals and discipline is based on compromise and discussion. Children are seen as more of a long term investment than something which simply happens to you in life. A good fraction of middle class families develop a long term financial fund starting from conception to help the child with the transition from late teen to adult life, and so parents provide for things such as car, university living costs, and maybe even the first mortgage.


Working classes draw a more solid line between adults and children. Parents adopt a more laissez-faire approach to their children's spare time and rely on their child to develop experience and taste and opinions through their own trials and failures. Children don't have as many or any extracurricular activities set by parents and in a way are more free to roam as they wish. Less pressure for higher education could be seen. A talent based mindset is adapted, i.e. you're either good at something or you're not. ""I'm bad at maths. James gets better grades, he's smarter than me."" Discipline leans more on that distinction between adults and children and so ""because I said so"", etc. is more commonly used - parents play a more dictating role in working class families. This could be linked to how much time working class adults often spend more at work, especially in case of single parents, than the professional 9-5 nuclear family middle class. There's less opportunity to bond between parent and child.     "
So they can fit more people in the main part. 
"Tempted to say that they are just posing. 

But having done it myself on occasion it means there are fewer distractions (at home you have TV, books, housework, other things to do, food for ""free"" etc)  and if the ambience is right the background noise can be a nice murmur that helps you focus. Weird I know, but it works for me on occasion. "
The consequence of calling someone 'Boyo' is revealing that you're probably Welsh. 
"Put on more clothes, not heating


Finding fake designer clothes/trainers in the market, I had many great fake nikes 


Beans and cheese for lunch as a 'treat' when it was really because it was cheap

Ice cream mans plays his song when he's out of ice cream- hence we didn't get any


Budgeting for that school trip which says max £5 spending money per child... need to save £5 so we don't look poor.


Hearing about cable/sky tv programs and pretending you saw them- ie Cartoon Network shows

Never going abroad for holidays but pretending that going Ilse of white is abroad 

Que to use the one bathroom for baths/toilet. Get out I need to pee! Go pee in the garden :)

Amazing trips to Bournemouth beach- some of my best times spent there!"
The first generation that's never used cheques but old enough to ask about them online. Thanks for making me feel old.
"Relax.

Pictures will come through to the hire car company, at which point they can contest if they don't match.

If they do match and they wish to proceed with charges then you get to contest the charges by providing evidence of you locations/movements on that day, showing it's a physical impossibility for you to have been speeding on the M25 in Kent at 2:11pm, and then presenting the same car for return in Grimsby at 3:30pm... 

It'll get dismissed, you'll get no fine and no points.

One cannot make that 4hr drive in 1hr 19mins, unless you were cruising at an average speed of 166mph.. In which case you probably deserve the fine..."
"On a plate with a knife and fork. 
I don't understand the non-swimming in gravy bit. Everything must be completely doused in gravy. 
What are you heathens doing!?!"
Orphanage next to a Catholic church?
"The assumption that you can just move to find work. As if everyone had the cash to do it (or someone to borrow it from) and would be earning enough (in a 9-5 job, natch) to survive without grandparents to help with childcare.

And there's this, apparently:

&gt;""I am working-class from the north. They went to private schools, they have nannies for their children. The other day a colleague turned to me. He had just worked out that after school fees, mortgage payments and everything, he was left with 'only the minimum wage to spend'. So I asked him: 'What do you think ordinary people on a minimum wage have left to live on, after they have paid all their bills?' He was really confused, and admitted that he had never actually realised that for ordinary people everything has to come out of the minimum wage, that it's not free money to spend on whatever you like.

"Yeah it's just random deals. I saw an arc welder in there once, along with some wetsuits. "
"What the fuck did you just fucking say, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in welding school, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret surf holidays in Newquay, and I have over 300 confirmed barrel rides. I am trained in wetsuit warfare and I’m the top welder in the entire UK armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another wave. I will ride you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of dudes across the UK and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, minnow. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my arc welder. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United Kingdom Marine Surf Club and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo."
They might be on a bus?
"Yeah, this. I just assumed everyone was as bitter and judgemental as me
"
"Ex-police.  The police response will depend on where you park and what the police are like in an area.  I had a small industrial estate on my patch and a guy started sleeping in his car there because it was quiet and secluded.  I only noticed because it never moved.

I knocked on the window one morning to check the occupant was ok and to check his details to make sure he wasnt wanted on warrant (fugitives sometimes do this).  He was ok and he wasn't wanted so I left him to it and just kept an eye out for him until he moved of his own accord.

He wasnt hurting anyone and the industrial estate was also used by truckers to sleep in their cabs, so moving him and not them would have been extremely hypocritical and cruel.

In terms of logistics, I had a friend who once lived in a van for a few months (through choice to save money) and all they did was sign up for a cheap off-peak gym membership and used their showers and toilets.  

Edit, my first gold! Thank You!"
"As far as I know, it's used throughout the UK."
"Pubs often have toilets upstairs or downstairs , wherever the offices or stores are. More room on the pub floor means more £££."
"After the Queen and PM, Ant and Dec are the joint most powerful people in the country."
Apparently they taste quite fowl.
"Most of our light bulbs are bayonet fittings, we don't screw them."
Is this supposed to be ironic or have you not seen the news?
I'm at work.
"&gt;Both of them seem to contain an aisle where they just sell any old shit

So what's your question?"
"I'd rather it was left to the professional to not endanger any court cases. Also, Reddit has shown that it's easy to witch hunt innocent people..."
Have an upvote for drawing the diagram.
"The key is to find somewhere you can park without being observed. Like waste ground where others are parking. 

It's certainly possible for a limited period of time. I have done it for up to 2 weeks at a time, but I did have a place to park where I was pretty sure I was unobserved.

If you really are going to do it, just put a duvet in the car. Under the duvet it's pretty warm, and actually, you are pretty well hidden.

I think the police might be unimpressed to find you doing this, so all the more you need to find a hidey-spot.

Other than not having the initial hump of deposit and stuff for rent, I dunno how much you save. When I was living rough, I spent a lot on takeaways, for example."
"Did you literally just ask if a coat keeps them warmer? Is a coat mate, what do you think it's for? "
Yes because I don't like the taste of washing up liquid. 
"Well, not unless they were referring to the arm that they use for buggery..."
What's wrong with hats? I usually see people wearing them at weddings.
"I like to imagine that both Lidl and Aldi's special deals departments are run by Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses. Buying up tons of crap because it was cheap, then figuring out how to palm it off on people later.

What did you think she was offering if not a dessert?
"I remember the day I decided I was now middle class was when I knew people who could countersign my passport application. 

I think that's a big thing - lots of ways of doing things were designed by people with means and status, and sometimes they don't quite clock that issues around class, race, financial means, disability or whatever create a barrier that they never meant to put up. 

There's quite a good book called The Blunders of our Governments that looks at failures in public policy, and that's a running theme throughout. Well intentioned, it just never occurred to them what the problems might be because they haven't lived it."
"I don't think you'd get in too much trouble, probably a warning. I've always thought killing a swan would be quite an easy crime to get away with.

However, the express, daily fail, and the sun would almost certainly name and shame and make you out to be the worst person in history for desecrating one of the queen's birds.

As for what they taste like, probably like goose, I'd imagine."
"Most Wetherspoons pubs weren't built as pubs but have been repurposed from other buildings. For example, The Swim Inn in Sheffield used to be a swimming pool and coincidentally does have toilets on the ground floor."
A betting shop and a Wetherspoons.
"As I understand it the red uniform is for spring/summer and the grey uniform is for autumn/winter, but I could well be talking out of my arse."
"There's 2 types I know of which seem to be the same no matter where you are. Brits are typically more sarcastic though. 

[There's the build up which can be used for a great moment.](https://youtu.be/rhnXWJmKbU4) 

[Then, there's the sarcastic.](https://youtu.be/BpFce1OWQGM) 

The former is the one used on Reddit a lot. "
I suppose there's being middle class and there is being clueless. 
"It is possible, but it is not fun!

There a few keys that can make it somewhat better.

1) Light: The hardest part for me is always the light.  Most everywhere you go there will be lights.  You need to get some type of curtains for your windows.  Or something to block out the lights.  I can't sleep with any mask on myself...

2) Sound: You need to try and find a quiet area.  In a city this is very hard.

3) Bed conditions.  Sleeping in a car seat is a no go.  You need to stretch out.  Experiment with putting your seats in all sorts of positions and see what you can do..maybe get air mattress in the back...but this is a major issue also.  One night in a car seat is doable; past that it starts to kill your back in that one position.

It is very doable, you will save a ton.  Get that gym membership!

Other tips: Alcohol wipes - for the times you wake up and have to pee; get out and pee ona  tree and then have wipes when there is no sink to wash up.

Look for a spot close to the gym. If you have curtains, you can sleep anywhere.

Workout at the gym before sleeping.  A workout and shower puts anyone to sleep!

Don't worry about police.  Live the life! Save the cash!

"Well you could have been polite about asking but even though you want to be a prick about it here's a few reasons people go for carpet:

- The UK is much colder than most of continental Europe which makes carpets a much more sensible choice for helping insulate.

- Carpet also works as a noise dampener, helpful for flats or terraced houses in particular.

- Carpet is softer than hard flooring which may be an important consideration for the elderly or children due to risk of falling or when crawling around.

- Carpet is typically more affordable

- Hardwood is easily scratched by shoes or furniture making repairs a consideration

Also with daily vacuuming and regular deep cleaning I fail to see how they are ""utterly disgusting"". 
Less clean than hardwood sure but there are multiple factors involved rather than just cleanliness when it comes to it.

Edit: I've seen carpet in hotels in France, Spain, Italy and the Czech Republic so your point about Europe thinking carpet is disgusting is actually nonsense. "
"Working out the cost of coffee versus the cost of a co-working space, it works out the same or cheaper. Most are freelancers or otherwise self-employed, or students - they don't have an office, and home may not be suitable, plus it's nicer to be out and about. "
Your parents. 
Don't ever say any of those words. Whenever I see or hear Americans trying to say things like 'bloody' or 'wanker' they get it all completely wrong and it's just embarrassing. 
"Don't ignore the letter like certain idiots are claiming. Contact them and tell them that you're needed to care for someone and you can't afford to wait for reimbursements to travel, they'll either defer you to a later date so you can plan in advance or they'll ask someone else."
"Thanks for giving me a good laugh at least OP.  Sorry, if I had any good advice on your situation, I would offer it.

"1. Comparing to the US is not really great because there are so many differences. Everyone knows the US has bloated salaries compared to almost any other country except maybe some places in Scandinavia.  

2. Comparing right now when exchange rates are terrible for the £ may give a distorted view. As would doing it 10 years ago when £1 was worth $2.10. "

Soap and scrub, then under the hot tap and you're done "
"Proposing in public with an audience is a bit of a crap thing to do. Especially if you don't already know for sure that she will say yes. It's manipulative even if you don't intend it to be.

So choose somewhere private. A museum or art gallery at a quiet time, or a cosy little restaurant on a weekday. Or take a trip out to Thorpe Park (roller coasters and stuff) or Windsor Great Park (lakes and stuff). Dunno, whatever you like to do together.

Just don't put her on the spot with an audience. It should be an intimate moment, not a public spectacle."

"Be aware that the sound thing is hugely common in the UK. To find somewhere that doesn't have this problem requires either a lot of luck or to pay substantially more. You may find you adjust it to it quickly. 


While it's always worth exploring your options, I'm not aware of any 'get out' clauses in contracts for what would generally be deemed a minor option. Hopefully someone with decent expertise can contribute though.

"&gt; Blackpool is not too safe (as a lot of UK to my surprise? At least what internet makes it to be huh)

Don't believe everything on the internet!

Blackpool's crime stats are sky-high because of the antics of drunken stag parties. OK, it's probably got a higher-than-average burglary rate etc., too, but that's not unusual for deprived places.

Also, Lytham St Annes (I presume that's where you're referring to?) is much more sedate, despite being nearby."
