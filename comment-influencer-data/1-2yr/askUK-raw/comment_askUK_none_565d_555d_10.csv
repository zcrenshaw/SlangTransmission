"Ok, I am going to write something really mind blowing to non-Brits.

British people walk as a recreational activity. Several miles at a time. They go on walking holidays. That's a holiday where the main activity is walking outdoors and looking at the countryside. 

They will walk to the shops to get some milk. They walk to school and to work."
"Game.

£50 for a new game you can get online for £40? Nah.

£20 for that pre owned game that's 5 years old when you can pick it up off eBay for £3-4? Nah."
"Its easier to do because our car parking spaces are smaller, and you have better manoeuvrability of the car with the front wheel drive. Position the arse in, then swing the front in. Going in front first only works if you have enough space to reverse to straighten out. Thats for bay parking, but its also safer to exit a car park space front first as you can see more "

Always makes me giggle when you hear Americans talk about 'hiking' like they've climbed Ben Nevis and they're super outdoorsy because of it. Mate you went for a mile walk in the woods bring it down a notch.

"I've had both types of containers from Chinese and Indians.

"There were playground discussions of how many missiles were pointed at your house,  a constant vague expectation of not seeing adulthood, and serious conversations about whether it was better to be as far away from a likely target as possible or to be right next to it. 

It was, to underestimate wildly, way, way, way worse than this. "
"Football hooligans are, but not football fans in general.

It's very common to like football here, most people have a team even if they don't actually watch games or follow it much (often town or city they come from)."
"I do. I like walking around London, there are interesting things to see.

Did the pavements look empty to you? I see a lot of people walking on them.

&gt;cabs are expensive but it didn't really strike me that you guys do so much walking.

That's an odd non-sequitar. But most people don't get around in cabs, they use the Tube or buses, or walk.

"
"Depends if there were threats of violence or encouraging others to commit acts of violence of crimes in general.

For example, you won't be arrested for saying you hate gay people. But you might if you tweet ""they should all be beaten  to death"".

We have freedom if expression but not if you're encouraging people to commit crime. I'm ok with that clause.

If hazard a guess the guy was encouraging gay bashing."
They must make a killing from train stations and airports though
I do exactly the same things that I do at any other time when I don't need to be at work.
"Lots of smart, rich and important people are football fans.

But if you can't get through an interview without it coming up, that probably doesn't say great things about you."
"It depends

For a journey less than a mile, it's quicker to walk in most cases. By the time you've got down to the tube and back up, you might as well have walked.

As a general rule when I go to London, if I can walk it in less than 20 mins, I'm walking. Exceptions when it's pissing it down with rain or I am out for an occasion."
"People don't want to fly to Manchester...

London is where the demand is."
"Hasn't affected my life at all.  And to the prick downvoting everyone who says it hasn't had an impact, grow the fuck up."
"No you're right. I could call you a cunt now because you're saying everybody gets offended by anything these days. I don't expect the police to be knocking on my door though. If you start being racist or inciting hatred towards a group or religion etc, you could get yourself into some trouble."
"That only tends to be the case when the answer is very easily googlable. (However YMMV)

If it's something serious then usually top notch replies ensue.

See for example the leaky toilet thread. All serious replies about property management and tenants rights.

What can I do in London? Go to the heavily guarded pineapple museum"
"The average learner takes 20 lessons before they pass their test (some fewer, some a lot more). At £25/lesson that's £500 total. So financially, no. More generally remember that driving is a skill to be learned, not a test to be passed. The last thing you want to do is rush yourself and end up on the road before you're ready. You'll be a danger not just to yourself but everyone around you.

Re #2 most cars are manual so that's what you should learn. "
Can you not just knock on their door and tell them you are doing your best to keep it down and you can hear their conversations too so you will all just have to deal with it?
AskUK gets the weirdest questions I've ever seen on Reddit
"&gt;Are you taught to do it like that in driving school? If so, why?

We don't have ""driving school"" as such, we have private instructors, but ""*Reverse park into a parking space either parallel to the kerb (on road), or oblique or right-angle (in a marked bay in an off-road car park)*"" is one of the required manoeuvres in a UK driving test and has been in one form or another for a long time so it's definitely taught.


As to why it's done... for the same reason that combine harvesters and forklifts steer  on their rear wheels, you can manoeuvre more tightly with the steering axle following the fixed axle and many UK  car parks are quite ""space efficient""."
"...and a propensity to vote to remove that sweet, sweet, economic input.

"You generally shouldn't be on the clutch that much when braking. brake down to speed, clutch on/gear change/clutch off.


Have you heard of engine braking? It's very important in helping you reduce speed and it should help you keep your brakes a bit longer as well."
"'So how did you find your studies at Cambridge?'

Personally if I was in a place notorious for pickpockets and the like and someone asked to use my phone I'd be very wary. 
"Waterstones are actually doing incredibly well. They were at deaths door a few years ago and brought in a new CEO who completely turned them around and now they’re absolutely nailing it and plan to open even more stores this year. 

https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/18/waterstones-annual-profits-jump-80-percent-books-sale

I absolutely love visiting Waterstones now. They all feel like they’re personally curated with excellent displays and a cosy atmosphere. Truth be told I rarely buy anything from there, aside from around Christmas, but I can easily spend an hour wandering about and looking around. "
Yeah it's a bit weird but each to their own
"The only people I know that would actively describe themselves as ""Christian"" are Americans and Canadians. They were all regarded with slight suspicion by my friend group upon first meeting, but they've all proven themselves to be lovely and very ordinary people, and respect that Brits don't consider religion to be a general topic of conversation. Religion plays very little part in the lives of most people I know. Religion is also considered a very private thing, so whilst the majority of my social circle doesn't attend church, it's entirely possible they're quietly devoted to Christ in the comfort of their own home (it seems unlikely though).  

As for what we do on our Sunday mornings? Recover from the hangover. "
"In the UK most guys are thought of to be football fans. From your doctors and bankers to your tradesmen. It's not a class thing. It's universal.

~~Rugby on the otherhand is generally not supported by the lowerclass. More heavy on the middle and upperclass. Maybe cricket? Not sure on cricket.~~ Rugby is complex and I don't get it. It's different country to country, region to region."
"HMV seems to be alive but only just. I doubt it can survive another administration.

Would also like to add Homebase. Their owners, Bunnings, seems to have second thoughts on converting the stores to their brand and as such, Homebase is just having an identity crisis while B&amp;Q are taking all the DIY business."

"&gt;Do you feel there should be a military response?

Fuck no, don't start a war.

I browse the r/politics sub because I've got interested in the bizarre political situation in the US and how it will play out, but I'm completely avoiding it now, having seen a slew of American posters urging the UK to declare war on Russia like  war-mongering idiot macho teens.

Magnitsky Act style economic sanctions, hit the oligarchs in their wallets. And maybe free up some houses in Bishops Avenue while they're at it."
Because of our superior grasp of the english language we can generally understand that if someone says “i’m gonna go mow the garden” they aren’t gonna take the mower to your rose bushes.

"There is nobody alive in this country who knows what it was like before we started accepting refugees.

Whether its Ugandan Asians in the 1970s, Jews fleeing the Nazis in the 1930s, Jews fleeing Tsarist pogroms in the 1890s, Irish fleeing the famine in the 1840s, Huguenots fleeing French persecution in the 1700s, or dozens of other groups of people seeking a country of safety and security, Britain has always been somewhere that refugees seek to come to."
"&gt;I hope not, that’s how I get all my tupperware.

Amen. I get ridiculously excited when I come across a takeaway that does the really good, sturdy ones too. Those are keepers."
"&gt; If your barman is below 40 and not Irish

It's more about who else is listening. I used to work in a pub in Cambridge (about 2009-10 ish) and there were some American students in one busy night, loudly saying ""hey, I'm gonna order Irish car bombs. Who wants an Irish car bomb? Hey, Steve, Irish car bomb?""

Before I could get to him to tell him to shut up, one of our semi-regular drinkers tapped him on the shoulder, waited until he turned round, and punched him straight in the face. Semi-regular guy's brother was killed in a pub bombing back in the 70s.

It's just not a wise thing to discuss or order really."
That'd be the giant wall of corn that separates it from the rest of the UK.
"&gt;it seems British people LOVE backing cars into parking spots. Are you taught to do it like that in driving school? If so, why?

Reversing into a parking space means you're driving forwards when you leave it, so can see much.

Reversing out of a driveway onto a road is quite common, but in some places is really dangerous because of the amount of traffic. The Highway Code suggests it isn't a good idea, although it isn't illegal 

&gt;Rule 201
&gt;
&gt;Do not reverse from a side road into a main road. When using a driveway, reverse in and drive out if you can.

I suppose we could also claim that we like to reverse into parking spaces because we're really good at it."
"I asked about this on /r/policeuk a while back. It was basically that if you harass someone online then that’s the same offence as harassing them in person. If you shout vile shit in a public forum online that’s not materially different from shouting vile shit in the street.

I’m surprised that Twitter would actually look to contact him rather than just make he report. I also suspect that a community support officer is more likely to tell him to knock that shit off rather than make an arrest."
I'm pretty sure this is a textbook example of Middle Class Problems. 
"You mean Rugby Union?

Rugby League is more ‘working class’."
"&gt; If your barman is below 40 and not Irish, they won’t blink at you ordering an “Irish carbomb”. 

No.  The biggest bar fight I have *ever* seen was caused c. 2012 by someone ordering an Irish carbomb in a Manchester pub."
"So, what you are saying is that in the southern US,  violation of the social contract would be met with violence. And yet you are appalled that in the UK, violation of the social contract is met with bad language?

In the first two examples, I think you've rather missed who the rude people are - hint, it was your party. 

In the third example, the 'reason' was that they were teenage boys with nothing better to do, and that behaviour is tolerated lest the objector get beaten up. "
"I agree OP. At the very least, we should invoke article 4 of NATO and kick out all Russian diplomats and diplomatic staff in the UK on top of withdrawing our own embassy. 

I'm a tad wary of article 5, since Russia is a nuclear power. Whatever we do though, we can't afford to be lenient. The whole point of Russia's foreign policy is to tried and be feared, and recognised as a great power. Half-measures and minor sanctions aren't going to achieve anything. Persuade everyone to boycott/move the World Cup too. "
Proper bacon.
The walking in the TV series is probably just so they can get lots of atmospheric London scenery to be honest. And a grim dude sitting in a taxi or standing on the tube is not nearly as iconic as a grim dude walking down a city street.

"&gt; Anything can be offensive to anybody nowadays

But only specific kinds of causing offence can be charged as a hate crime.

If you were to post a picture of your mum's cat on Facebook, and I was to reply that the cat looked really ugly and stupid, you might well be offended because I'd been a cunt online. But the police wouldn't arrest me for it."
"I don’t think you understand class in the UK. Earnings are an *indicator* of class, but there is no firm correlation (even then it is far from only the top 20% as you indicate). This seems to be at odds with the US where earners and class are more strongly correlated. 

I also don’t think the term middle class is a veiled insult at all in general terms. Of course there are some working class people who resent or dislike middle class people, and vice versa, but I don’t think it is commonplace. "
"Done it twice, kind of.

First time was to Australia on a Working Holiday visa. I'd highly recommend looking into this, it may be something that interests you. Basically it means you can live and work in Australia for a year. If you do 3ish months of rural work you get a 2nd year. There are similar programs in a tonne of other countries, plus we, for the moment, still have the EU to play with. 

I had an amazing time. Made some amazing friends who live all over the world. Earned a decent amount of money, even after taking into consideration living costs. Week nights me and my friends would cook dinner, have a few beers on the roof of our hostel with a view of the CBD, Opera House and Bridge, bliss. At the weekend we'd more often than not head to Coogee Beach, or take a picnic to the Botanical Gardens. Had some experiences that people are never sure if I'm having them on because of how weird they are. Would highly recommend.

After Australia I came back to the UK for a while, got a job, my life was boring as fuck compared to living in Oz. I went on holiday to Thailand for 3 weeks and found an island that felt like home.

Got back to the UK, handed in my notice at work and was back in Thailand 3 months later. Worked as a diving instructor for 4ish years. Made the best friends I imagine I'll ever have and met my gf there.  Living conditions are much much lower than what I was used to in the UK. However living in a wooden shed isn't an issue when I'm only in there to sleep. Most of my days were spent underwater or at my local bar on the beach. 

I'm in the UK currently, probably will be for at least a few months, so I've got a temp job whilst me and my gf figure out what we want to do. It's really weird coming back home, everything is just so over the top. My parents got a new 50 odd inch TV over Christmas and to my 'I've not seen anything but a CRT for 5 years' eyes it just looks ridiculous.

Or seeing people with say, the newest iPhone. Until mid last year I was still rocking a Galaxy S2 I now use a 3 year old phone and feel fancy. Choice in shops is still mind blowing to me. I'm used to being lucky to have 1 brand of a product. I'd forgotten that in the UK there is an entire aisle of shampoo and conditioner. Seeing the amount of that people that spend £3 in Starbucks, when to me, that's a meal and a beer, or 6 beers, or the same price as my rent for 2 days, is insanity. 

Because of the life I've chosen, I'll never be super well off. If I stayed in the UK now, I might be able to buy a house by the time I'm 40. If I'd never left I'd probably have been the owner of a hefty mortgage for the last 5 years. However, for me, I'd rather have had 10 years of more fun than should be allowed and living modestly for the rest of my life, than not having those memories. 

There are more positives than I can list. I turned from a kind of quiet shy person who is the life of the party, to quote a friend 'you are fascinating to watch around people'. I have more friends than I know what to do with. I can verbally understand and speak fluently enough 2 languages. I can get my point across in another 2. Nothing felt like a drag, even work. I think it's something to do with there not being any pressure about 'the future', it's all about the present. I have memories that will forever make me smile.

Down sides. I lost all my friends in the UK. Partly due to me being away for most of the last 10 years and having no time to keep in touch. Partly because after asking about living in X country, people get bored after 2 minutes and just don't care anymore. I am a completely different person at 30 compared to 22, my friends when I were 22 are mostly the same at 30. That sounds super pretentious but it's the only way I can describe it.

Another big downside is, depending on where you go and what you do, you're pretty much putting your life on pause for however long you're away. Say you are away for a year, that's 1 year less you have been paying into your pension. That's 1 year less that you haven't been saving money to buy a house. It gets worse the longer you are away. For someone like me, there's a very, very good chance I'll be dead by 60 so it doesn't really matter. For most people, it's something to consider.

I'm on my phone so this is probably quite disjointed, but if you have any specific questions, I'm happy to answer what I can, here or through PM."

"Sticky toffee pudding, it's delicious. Lots of the chips/crisps flavours here are different, things like roast chicken or prawn cocktail. Cheese and onion anything.

"Yep, definitely remember the ""instant vaporisation or slow death from radiation poisoning?"" conversations.

The fact they looked very like my grandparents didn't really help."
"70% of the people who identified as Asian in the 2011 census described themselves as Indian, Pakistani or Bangladeshi. Of the remainder, 10% described themselves as Chinese and the rest as ""Asian Other"". Since at least 70% of Asian people in the UK are from South Asia, it seems natural for *Asian* to mean *South Asian* here  by default."
"Could be a spider in it, no joke.

Ours kept going off in my house and my mother in law said it was probably a spider, I took the piss thinking it was an old wives tale - when they left I got on a chair and took off the faceplate of the alarm, fuckin' crispy spider dropped out. It had fried itself on the battery or something and was smoking every now and again setting off the alarm."
