You know that 1 nosy neighbour that is always up in your shit? 
It's slang for sex offender/pedophile so it's one of the worst insults to receive in  my opinion. 
"He ruined my school dinners.

Rest in peace, my turkey twizzlers."
"You can tip the council off anonymously.

Environmental Health."
Only for admin purposes. It'll be returned to you within 3-4 weeks.
"Amongst friends? Not a big deal

Said to a stranger in a public place? Reasonably serious. You aren’t just swearing at them, you are making an accusation. Shit sticks, and some things, even if said in ignorance, can have consequences.

"
"At least in the UK context is king. There aren't really words that cannot be used in jest. Similarly calling someone ""pal"" can be picking a fight under some circumstances."
"To me it feel that for about 10 months a year the UK is about 15C, grey and drizzly. I find that weather borderline depressing and quite boring. I like proper seasons. 

So when it’s hot and sunny in the summer I love it and my days off at home feel like being on holiday. The long light evenings are wonderful, and being able to eat outdoors and wear light clothes in complete comfort is great. 

Likewise, I enjoy a cold winter - clear, crisp, sunny winter’s days are great and a dusting of snow looks beautiful. Make a fire, wrap up, enjoy."
"I’ve been in the UK for 6 years, after moving from Spain (my home country). 

There’s a lot of things better in the UK, to be honest, such as:

1-Work: much more opportunities, better wages, ease to change career paths and better shift patterns (8 straight hours like 9-5, as opposed to 9-1 + 5-9 in many places in Spain), and your employer pays the real amount for NI.

2-Weather: I love the weather in the UK! Not as hot as where I’m from means I am able to sleep during most of the year (granted I’m a weird kind of Spaniard though).

3-Cost of living: groceries and other essentials are actually cheaper than in Spain for a lot of stuff (I’m lucky to live in the North-West of England).

4-Transport: as much as I despise local bus services, national transport (trains, coaches) is far better than most of Spain, where you need a car for almost everywhere you go. Trains are a bit too expensive in the UK, though.

On the other side, I don’t miss a lot from Spain (some specific food items, but the vast majority you can get them in several stores around here), but there are some things that I think are worse in the UK, mainly:

5-Housing: for what I pay in the UK I’d be able to rent a 3 room flat in the centre of any decent medium-sized town in Spain (small one room flat in the outskirts; at least not sharing anymore!).

6-NHS: I understand the cuts and growing pressure on the NHS, but its Spanish equivalent, whilst not superb, is slightly better (little things like not being able to book an appointment online for my GP is simply not in line with the 21st century...).

Overall, I am happy with my decision to have moved abroad and, Brexit aside, I would gladly stay in the UK for a long time."
"The tongue map is a classic example I was taught. 
As I kid it didn't make sense. "
No. Cigarette smoke is worse.
"The send a letter explaining their is a hosepipe ban due to water shortages. 

That is normally enough for around 10% drop in water usage as people are just more mindful. There is no need to enforce it really, it's a nudge measure. 

If someone grasses that you are breaching the ban you will get a snotty letter reminding you of the potential legal penalties. That's normally enough for those offenders to cut back. 

So they don't really need to actively monitor it to achieve what is needed, a reduction in usage and enough people understand what's going on an oblige. "
"I lived in England for a decade until earlier this year. I'm American. 

Better in the UK: 
- Health Care. I can't believe how many brits think the for profit system we use in America would be superior to the NHS. It's not. 
- Weirdly, the advertising standards board or whatever they are called. They are always doing awesome things like forbidding wrinkle cream ads from using too much photoshop or making it so junk food can't be advertised to children. 
- Food was subsidized better and therefore healthy food was cheaper than it is in America. 
- British boundaries. The initial response to any conflict is usually to DE escalate it, whereas in America we like to up the ante. If the guy next door is being a twat, you politely ignore him whilst tutting in the kitchen, or eventually you knock and have a polite word. In America we just call the cops or plot revenge. Obviously there are exceptions on all sides but this general default setting difference makes a massive impact on everyday life. 

America has better junk food. Not better FOOD - Britain's rep for bad food is very outdated and no longer true. But nobody does heart attack on a plate like the USA. "
"He's a food snob who pretends he isn't.

He reckons I can make a meal for 4 people in 15 minutes, which I can if that only includes the cooking, the prep takes very much longer and often the ingredients he uses are not available to me locally - not everybody lives in London or has access to a bit supermarket. 

He also often uses expensive cuts of meat and serves the meal on a board.

"
The missus says I'm not allowed to invite birds over for a drink...
That I won't have a calculator in my pocket when i'm older.
"I'm a teacher. He did an incredibly patronising TV series called Dream School where he tried to push the idea that unqualified celebrities would do a better job with disadvantaged kids than qualified teachers. This resulted in David Starkey calling a student fat.

Also he bashes fast food and school meals for being unhealthy yet his own recipes are often full of fat or sugar."
"You can go the park and chill out comfortably. You can go for a bike ride without freezing your tits off or getting wet. 

And its not just the heat, it's the sunshine. "
IT at school is an absolute joke where you learn how to use Microsoft Office.
"Oooo a biggie! 

That “computer studies” wasn’t a worthwhile GCSE (first year gcse’s came out). And “I.T. “ was aimed towards kids who couldn’t do “real science”

"
"It's ""privatise"" not ""deprivatise"" BTW. The question of selling state assets/ running ex-state companies privately under a slightly different business model is complicated and I think many would argue railways can be efficient and well-resourced either way.

1) If you travel as a visitor, you are least likely to have access to/ knowledge of discounts/ advance ticketing. So a resident will generally be able to travel cheaper than you.

When I have travelled as a tourist or for work in other European countries, it has also been v expensive, but I am aware that residents, even foreign residents, may e.g. have access to yearly railcards etc.

2) Yes, in general I would say our trains are expensive. My calculation here is that the petrol cost is almost always cheaper even for one person to drive in a car than buy a train ticket, even on advance purchase. Let alone two or more people. Obviously it costs money to buy and run a car, but that is not how people think- they put the journey cost and the running cost into different 'budgets.' Once you have the car, people think, you might as well use it.

3) Some countries. e.g. Italy, clearly have subsidised fares to facilitate the movement of workers. Here, one would say commuters into and out of London have to pay v high season ticket prices.

4) Yes, some rolling stock is old. In general, I would say that I know European countries - maybe Switzerland and Austria are top, that seem to have invested heavily in the railways. Ours suffer still from the legacy of many many years ago- that they evolved first in Europe and so the network was very higgledy-piggledy and not always especially logical."
If they have that shit a whistleblowing policy then this is the way to go.
"Outside of skulking around the reduced section in shops, you're going hungry.

How the fuck did you manage that? Don't you know anyone you could even borrow £10-20 off of?

£1 for 7 days is ""get yourself to a food bank"" budgets."
"It means paedophile so it would be pretty insulting to someone who wasn’t a paedophile. 

Although, if the person you are talking about *is* a paedophile, it’s not really a shocking/offensive word in itself - i.e. if you were talking about Gary Glitter with someone and referred to him as a nonce, they wouldn’t gasp in shock. It’s just slang. "
"&gt; You can go the park and chill out comfortably. 

No I can't. I cannot get comfortable in heat. 

&gt; You can go for a bike ride without freezing your tits off or getting wet. 

Again, no I can't. Im soaked with sweat in the first 10 minutes. The only time I cant go for a bike ride comfortably is in this damn heat. At least if its cold and/or wet I can layer up. There's only so many layers I can remove without getting arrested!"
"There was a story at the time of that hosepipe ban of someone who was spotted from one of these helicopters using  a hosepipe and suspiciously green lawn.  Letters were sent but the hosepipe was not put away.  Things escalated including threats to take him to court, to which the homeowner response was 'please do'. So legal action was started.

Just before the court case was due to start someone decided to find out why he was happy to be taken to court and paid a personal visit to the homeowner.  He lead them out to the garden where there was a small lake with a hosepipe leading from it to the nearest drain.  The householder explained that the lake was caused by a leak from a water pipe which he had reported repeatedly over many months. The hosepipe was his attempt to try to siphon off the lake. He reasoned that a court case would finally get the publicity to get the water company ass in gear to fix the leak.  


The court case was cancelled and a team dispatched to fix the leak."
"My GP has been pushing for people to use an app to get in touch with them and create appointments recently.

In order to use the app to make an appointment, you click the ""Make Appointment"" button which initiates a phone call to the GP."
"Firstly don't put lemon curd on scones.

Lemon curd is great on toast and in cakes. "
"They'll be selling it on, often cut with lower quality seeds to increase their profits."
"I watched one of his shows and he was showing how to make food cheaply all while using £100+ bit of meat, and it's no wonder people think he's a cunt. He needs to fuck off to Lidl and get a £4 chicken like the rest of us do and then show us hoe to prep a meal on a fucking plate not a tray or chopping board a fucking plate like a normal person"
"Honestly, no. We call our mate Dave 'Davina' when he's having a moment, but no one legally named it."
"Cigarette smoke is far, far worse. I don't like breathing in vapour either, but at least it's not (as far as we know) going to give me cancer. "
"Aside from the school dinners stuff:

Jamie Oliver is viewed with derision in the hospitality industry, his food is honestly not that good. Olive oil and lemon juice on everything, his presentation isn't great, and his restaurant chain is bang average - way overpriced. People who cook for a living don't rate him."
"Moved from the US nearly 18 years ago.

I grew up in Southern California and I miss how easy it was to grow everything. How you could just pick tangerines off next door's tree. How pumpkin seeds dropped in a dirt patch on Halloween would produce 8 pumpkins easily for next Halloween. How you'd end up with giant zucchini, pomegranates bigger than your hand, fresh and perfectly ripe avocados - and they'd all just be from someone you knew.

Here you can grow things but it just seems so much more difficult - everything just freezes at the wrong time or it's too wet or something else goes wrong.

That and Halloween. I really miss Halloween. 

But public transportation makes it so so easy to get everywhere. The NHS have kept me alive. I have a pretty nice job and an awesome husband and I wouldn't trade either.

I'd just like to have a watermelon the size of a medium dog and a large glass of iced tea while sitting in my dad's backyard from time to time. "
"If you like butter on a bacon sarnie then yes, however if you don't like butter on a bacon sarnie then no.

How the fuck do you get into a heated debate about this? And how the fuck does it affect you if someone else likes something different?"
"I think it should be ok in the bin - you may want to make sure the cat gets another one though (one for sorrow, two for joy)"
The food pyramid. Who  needs so much bread and potatoes?
"Pretty sure there's nothing to do in Swindon mate..
  
Take her to a nice roundabout or something? There's that big one made up of many other roundabouts."
"&gt; little things like not being able to book an appointment online for my GP is simply not in line with the 21st century

What? You mean the cutting-edge ""*everyone in the catchment area call simultaneously at 8am and hope for the best*"" method can be improved?"
"They want your details so they can link you on the system to other records they have about you using your NHS Number (England &amp;amp; Wales) or CHI Number (Scotland). 

That way they can make sure your treatment is relevant and not at risk of causing more harm (e.g allergies)

They’ll still treat you without ID, but if they suspect you’ve committed a crime or an abuse victim they may still contact police and/or social services. "
"O yeah logically Jamie's message was right, but that doesn't stop people hating him for taking the naughty food away"
"It also won’t hurt you - they can do more to help you if they know your history. Nobody will judge you and the records are confidential 

You can also tell them of your concerns when you arrive - many hospital systems have a flag they can check for “VIPs” where the name of the patient is hidden (for example) and it’s also sometimes possible for them to indicate that you do not consent for the information to be shared (e.g back to your GP). But that depends which system they have. 

If you feel you need help, of course I’d encourage you to get it in whatever way it takes for you to be able to go... but please try to let them help you as much as they can!"
"Set up a new email address and email McDonald's.
Your store is a franchise run by an independent manager and mcdonalds will not want bad press of a health violation so should send the area manager down to smack their wrists."
"Find another house.

There’s no way in hell the landlord will fix that before September and it’s not worth the risk.

If the landlord is flaunting rules like that then there’s no doubt others relating to electricity/gas that he’s not bothered with. Place could be a death trap.

Pissing off 3 students is better than waking up dead."
Aka if you have a Scottish accent
"It took me the longest time to figure out that ""bangs"" means ""fringe"" I mean seriously, wtf?"
That I can be anything I want to be. :/
Fowl indeed
"It's fairly difficult to investigate someone without asking people about what the person has been up to, people then talk to one another. "
"it's so nice to be able to go out without any jacket, and that the evening is so long and bright. I can get gardening or things done outside because it's still nice and warm in the evening.

ahhh it's so good"
"Example for point 4: Some countries have double decker trains, which is a brilliant idea for doubling capacity without having to run less trains.

However we don't, because most of the bridges were built before double decker trains were a thing, so to raise the bridges high enough to fit the double deckers would cost a lot of money and would have a questionable return on investment."
"Yeah - shit on all the little people buying lunch rather than let one of the biggest companies in the world pick up the slack for poor planning.

Admittedly if you're short on luck for getting a job and have just laid this gig then what the fuck else do you do."
He said other than Davina McCall...
I had no idea! I honestly thought it was fairly meaningless meaning 'idiot' or 'nitwit' or something similar. Not that I have ever said the word myself...
"Curry. It's really easy to make big filling healthy curries with a bunch of vegetables and even some chicken if you want. Just cook up some carrots, broccoli, potato, peppers, onion, garlic, cauliflower, spinach, lentils, squash or whatever else you want, and a tin or two of chopped tomatoes, add in some curry paste or curry powder and let it cook for 30 mins. Serve with some rice (brown rice to be healthier).

Spag bol, chilli, and cottage pie. Use turkey mince because it's usually cheaper, or Quorn mince if you can get some on offer. 

Sausage and mash. Potatoes are cheap and you'll always have butter and milk in the fridge. You can pick up cheap sausages as well. Serve with some steamed carrots, peas, and broccoli for healthiness. "
"No-one thinks the for profit system will be better. It's only politicians with an agenda that say that because of their backers and lobbyists. The vast majority of these politicians don't believe it either. Even really wealthy people and Daily Mail readers think the NHS is something worth keeping - it's a source of national pride. And there's nothing stopping you from paying for private health insurance either for faster treatment and easier access to world-renowned doctors, that's called BUPA. Which is incidentally also much cheaper than private health insurance in the USA."

"Getting help means youre in a better position to have your son with you.
Being in crisis isn't good for you or your son.

If you're feeling like you need support, please access it. Social service might get a call, but from their point of view you accessing support is better than you knowingly taking on your son while you're in crisis. "
Have you lost it already? Getting a replacement can take up to a year…
"This one still pisses me off to this day.

We were taught that the HIV virus was so small that it would get through ""pores"" in a condom meaning they were useless and shouldn't be used.

"They're both shitty, but cigarette smoke is way worse."
"It's a different sort of politeness. *In general,* Americans practice [positive politeness, while Brits practice negative politeness](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politeness_theory#Positive_and_negative_face). Basically Americans are about all being chummy, while in the UK, we consider if polite not to impose on people. Which results in both parties thinking the other is rude. 

There's a brilliant informational [guide book]( https://flashbak.com/1942-extracts-from-gi-handbook-instructions-for-american-servicemen-in-britain-14231/) produced for American servicemen during ww2 which explains this:

&gt;: The British are often more reserved in conduct than we. On a small crowded island where forty-five million people live, each man learns to guard his privacy carefully-and is equally careful not to invade another man’s privacy.

&gt;So if Britons sit in trains or busses without striking up conversation with you, it doesn’t mean they are being haughty and unfriendly. Probably they are paying more attention to you than you think. But they don’t speak to you because they don’t want to appear intrusive or rude"
"Make sure you pay extra for tracking. £12.25 can seem like a lot, but you would wish you paid it when they accidentally send your baby to Belfast. "
Seems a bit silly to me. It kinda reeks of nationalism.
"If it's bin day, fine.

If not, get to fuck."
"Both options of carrying on give you the opportunity to pull off a 2:1. 

Pull your positive vibes out and kick some year 3 ass"
"Honestly, 70p oats and cook in water with salt. No veg, no real nutrition, but it'll fill you once or twice a day.

The 30p you could spend on a cucumber or something for a bit of snacking."
"This is the way to go OP - give them a call, explain and they'll organise a ""routine"" visit. Also, delete this thread. ants in coffee machines is pretty specific."
"You give 85p change, say you've ran out of 2s and ask him to wait and then he says forget it and drives away. "
"I moved here from Canada 2 months ago.

I don't really miss much aside from my friends and family. I wish you guys had iced tea that wasn't Liptons though. More of a personal thing is that I wish more shops were open 24 hours like they were around my place in Canada.

I love the NHS though. It makes Canada's healthcare look like the USA's. I've been working on fixing my dumpster fire of a mouth (genetic issues, crowding, rotting, etc). All the work I needed done was quoted at about $10000 back in Canada since dental is privatized. I got most of what I needed done for like 65 pounds. It's great.

EDIT: Couple neat observations too:

* Lemonade is fizzy? What's with that.
* I can buy beer in a post office
* I can drink in public. I've been using this to my advantage.
* Vimto is the nectar of the gods
* I want to die in a carvery
* Pot Noodles put other instant noodles to shame
* Y'all need bigger crisps bags. Small bags won't deter me. I'll just eat 9 small bags of crisps if I have to."
"Because all our tasty school meals disappeared, along with the vending machines. He was the public face of it, and he pissed off an entire generation as a result.

Never really changed much though, as kids started to bring in unhealthy food from home and of course there was always a few students in every year who ran an unofficial tuck shop."
"I thought it was a gentle word for idiot. 
I’m now convinced I’ve used this in wholly inappropriate situations and will wake up at 3am in the heat addled nights trying to remember the times I have used it "
"An improvement I would make to this would be skip the cucumber. If this is a short term survival situation, a cucumber, whilst offering nutrition, does not offer much in the way of calories. 30p could buy you a value pack of biscuits or chocolate at most supermarkets (maybe less in the reduced sections). If this is going to be longer than a week then I agree with what other people are saying, you need to get yourself to a food-bank because the lack of nutrition will start to catch up with you. "
my ex wife had a mate called davina and she was a complete cunt.
"Yeah, the context is everything. If you referred to a *known* paedo as a nonce it would just be seen as inoffensive slang.

But if you threw that word at an innocent person as a generic insult...? That'd be even worse than calling them a cunt. As someone else has said, in those circumstances it's not just an insult; it's the worst accusation you could make."
You may get some for calling it 'soccer'.
That we lose half our body heat through our head if we don't wear a hat. 
It doesn’t have quite same impact and general utility as ‘cunt’ or ‘fuck’ but it has a very specific meaning and that puts a lot of weight behind it.
"You do know what to do, that's why your on here asking. You obviously care greatly about your son and you owe it to him to look after yourself.

Please remember that if you're in crisis it is likely affecting your decision making skills. Putting your wellbeing first is also putting your son first."
"I don't particularly like vapour, but smoke smells far worse.

The only bad thing about vaping is that some people think it's fine to do it inside where the smell can't dissipate as easily. At least the smokers have got used to going outside."
