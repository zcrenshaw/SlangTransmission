It’s because they are ‘for tea’.
"Yes, I have the schedule right here:

"I'd agree. He drove while drunk, risking the lives of others and hitting two cars. His own mother was in the car with him. And he's a person with the means to have someone on staff to drive him wherever he wants to go, there's no excuse for him driving at all. They should throw the book at him. 

Yes, he has addiction issues and he's a well liked celebrity, but people would not be sympathetic to any other drink driver in that situation, so they shouldn't be to Ant. "
"It's a message, get out of town or you're next. "
"Probably *Mr. Brightside*, by The Killers."
"Pretty much purely an American thing... although you barely even debate it.

As you probably know...we had one school shooting and soeted the problem immediately."

Bloody hell mate, it's only a new bin !

"It's really pissed me off, I'll start off saying I'm a scouser so can be accused of being biased but the treatment carragher got by the media was much worse. Him spitting at that family was disgusting and embarrassing and shouldn't be made light of but this morning ran a poll on whether he should be sacked, they didn't do the same for their mate Ant because 'he has a disease' fuck off he got behind the wheel while pissed and his mum let him. My mam would have kicked me in the bollocks "
A thirty minute exposure is probably what attracted the doggers in the first place.
"Killing someone is a big deal, no matter what the circumstances. The Police will use their powers of arrest to detain people and allow for forensic evidence gathering. It's critically important that the incident be investigated robustly - this may involve establishing any connection with the deceased previously, interrogating electronics/phones, forensic searches of people and their clothes etc etc.

For example, while it looks like a cut and dry burglary for now - if it turns out they knew each other and, say, some money was owed one way or another then that might change the direction of the investigation. "
"&gt; Marcos Alonso

&gt;On 2 May 2011, Alonso was arrested following his involvement in a car accident in Madrid. He was the driver of a car that collided with a wall, killing one of the passengers, a 19-year-old woman, having been driving at 112.8 km/h (70 mph) in wet conditions in a 50 km/h (30 mph) zone, with a blood alcohol level of 0.93 mg per millilitre of blood.[27][28] He faced 21 months in prison when sentenced in February 2016, but his punishment was changed to a €61,000 fine and a driving ban of three years and four months, which had already been spent.[

Jesus fucking christ if that isn't one of the most blatant examples of corruption I've ever seen. Didn't even get prison time. What the fuck is wrong with this world."
They finally filled in a deadly pothole on my way to work.
"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39881236

&gt; All licensed premises in England and Wales are required by law to provide ""free potable water"" to their customers upon request. In Scotland a similar law applies, but specifies ""tap water fit for drinking"".

&gt; This means pubs, bars, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, takeaway food and drink outlets, cinemas, theatres, and even village and community halls - so long as they are authorised to serve alcohol.

&gt; However, these premises can charge people for the use of a glass - or their service - when serving the ""free"" tap water.

"
"I'm not sure it's so much class, but a sort of expectation bias.  Ant and Dec have managed to embed themselves in the public consciousness as friendly, cheeky and generally harmless.  So when something like this happens, many are quick to write it off as an incident entirely out of character and portray Ant as a sympathetic figure who made a mistake and needs help.

Alternatively, Wayne Rooney's been a controversial figure in the media for years, such that the public perception (rightly or wrongly) is very much that he's not a particularly nice person.  So his drunk driving incident was very much in character for people's perception of him and therefore the tone was hostility, not sympathy.

Which is bollocks, of course, but the norm in the media is to paint people as either wholly good or bad with no shades between.  The media self-perpetuates and ultimately don't sell papers by being kind to Wayne or ruthless to Ant.  Because those stories don't fit in with the stories they've published about those people before, which become the public's expectations and perceptions - and that's not what people want to read."
"Jason Statham - in his native English accent, playing anEnglish character - pronounced twat ""twot"" in the film Spy."
"&gt; If so did you complain and did much come of it? Really takes the piss.

Mate it's a bin just tell the council and ask for a new one. Why do you want anything more lol "
"I think you'll have to learn to overcome it. If your disability affects your reaction to hazards, then you could be unsafe on the road, which is exactly what the hazard perception is trying to assess. I think bypassing it is unlikely to be allowed.

For what it's worth, I doubt clicking a bit too much would be a problem, it's only clicking *way* too often that gets picked up as it seems like you're trying to trick the system by constantly clicking."
"&gt;you guys really have knife control debates?  

There's no debate, the sale of kitchen knives is regulated here and knives that don't serve a practical purpose (the zombie killer ones) are flat out banned from sale.


It's all about context. You, in your dining room at a table, aren't going to be picked up for carrying a knife. But the kid, at 2am, in an alleyway, with the knife tucked into his waistband, isn't really looking for some street steak."

"Oasis famously struggled in the US, but they're not unknown. Better examples are probably Stereophonics or Kasabian. Not sure if Kaiser Chiefs or Arctic Monkeys ever did much there either."
"Blackpool... Arrived there one Sunday morning to visit the aquarium. First thing i encounter in the car park is a half naked man face down in (presumably) his own vomit, still clutching a can of Special Brew..

I vowed never to return.."
"He's a celebrity that's why mate... Marcos Alonso from Chelsea literally killed a woman drink driving and he's in the public eye every day, getting paid 100 grand a week to kick a ball around. Some people are more equal than others when it comes to the law and the press I'm afraid pal"
"My dad likes to talk about how he has what he calls ""old-fashioned values"" about the role of women in society and in the home.  He knows I disagree with his viewpoints, and has succeeded in goading me into arguments countless times.  What made the difference was me realising that actually I don't have to participate in these discussions - should he start on one of his pet subjects, I just check out of the conversation.  

If you deny your father an audience for his rants, he may realise that you aren't going to give him the satisfaction of your outrage.  It won't change his mind, but maybe he'll keep his horrible opinions to himself.  Sure, you're not going to 'save' him from them, but he is entitled to his own thoughts and view."
"War is not an option: we're still in NATO.  

I think all the noise is because Russia are concerned about the consequences, otherwise they'd just ignore us and carry on.  

I don't think it's tenser than the cold war. Whoever wrote that has a short memory."
"1) confirm that it is included within your rental agreement. (I used to rent the parking spaces separately with my flats)

2) if you absolutely have the spot agreed within your tenancy agreement, go and make friends with your neighbours and enquiry if this is their car and explain that you will be needing the space but they have some time to find an alternative.

3) if the answer to 2 is No, then resort to the worst possible British solution - a note on the windscreen."

"Spot on, if jimmy from the local pub did this, there would be outrage. "
The couple of Americans who asked about it will take it to heart I'm sure.
Bunch of posh lads from the Home Counties drinking each other’s piss and putting their cocks in each other’s pints. 
"Depends what it is.

Rape, murder etc. go the police. If you tell the police about your mate having some personal drugs in their house then you're a cunt."
"I don't get what people are surprised at. Someone died, the police investigated... Seems like exactly what should happen.

Easy click bait headlines too."
Cat stuck in tree. Head stuck in fence. Penis stuck in monster munch snack.
"We don't have them and don't want them. People who live on farms sometimes have shotguns and some posh people guns them for grouse shooting or clay pigeon shooting.

We trust our police force and don't on the whole fear for our lives in most  circumstances so don't feel we need then to stay safe. "

"[There's actually a Slate article that compares US and UK arrests:](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/rebekah_brooks_arrested_how_is_being_arrested_different_in_britain_.html)

&gt; Why do British police keep arresting people and then releasing them? Because it’s a lot easier to arrest someone in the United Kingdom, but being arrested there isn’t a big deal like it is in the United States. American police need probable cause to make an arrest, but in the United Kingdom, officers can arrest on suspicion. Probable cause is defined as the belief that a crime was probably committed, and that the suspect was probably responsible. Reasonable suspicion means that a right-minded individual would have grounds to suspect that a crime had been committed and that the suspect might be responsible. To have probable cause, greater evidence is required."
By the vast majority it's the same as everyone 
Not an issue at all
"Standard production rates of traditional rectangular/square bags with 3.3g of tea in them used to be 120 per minute, so I would surmise it was an efficiency reason that’s just become tradition.

Interestingly (ok maybe not) modern day machines producing shaped bags (circular, tetrahedronal, ‘bagged’bags etc) run at more than double that speed, despite more complex shapes etc. This is why catering size packs tend to be sold in multiples of 250.

Source: I drink a lot of tea and read it as a ‘fun fact’ on the back of a box one time."

"Slough, most depressing place I’ve ever been and the only place I’ve ever visited (UK or abroad) where I’ve felt genuinely unsafe just walking around. "
"From the outside, after sandy hook, it feels that the ""gun control debate"" in America is just theater. Everyone is playing their part and it just goes round and round.

"Actually, I'd say it would be quite reasonable for them to offer compensation (via reduction) for the services provided.  When you leave your car at a garage, you expect for them to take reasonable care of the vehicle, and provide a suitably professional service, not give you the headache and inconvenience of having to deal with a notice of intended prosecution.   Services like this should be provided with reasonable skill and care, and I would say 37 in a 30 whilst in your vehicle, and causing you a bureaucratic headache to boot, is not completing the job with reasonable skill or care.  If the garage names the specific person, it may simplify the process for OP too.

Under s172(4):

&gt;A person shall not be guilty of an offence by virtue of paragraph (a) of subsection (2) above if he shows that he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have ascertained who the driver of the vehicle was.

I think it would be reasonably diligent to ask the garage who drove the vehicle before sending off the form."

"&gt;British working class receives free education, free NHS,

Everyone in Britain gets a free education and use of the NHS, not just the working class.

Then you go on to say;

&gt;then they get benefits, be it JSA more often than the middle class

You seem to be confusing working people on low wages with people on Job Seekers Allowance in the same sentence.  

  

&gt;Though they will spend a high percentage of their income on heavy taxed tobacco/alcohol/lottery tickets  

Citation please. And, of course, poor people spend a higher percentage of what they earn on food, heat and water than everyone else because that's what being poor means. They spend 100% of their money every week because that's what we call poor. The phrase you used is almost nonsensical. If a wealthy person smokes a hundred fags a day and drinks five bottles of Napoleon brandy he'll still spend a low percentage of his income on tobacco and alcohol. What's your point?
&gt;I'm not so sure that British working class pays more into the system than their receive from it... 

You can only tax the poor so much because they are, by definition, poor. The tax take of the poor in Germany is bigger than the UK because the German poor are better off than the British poor. As a percentage of income, in the UK, [the poor pay more](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/lowest-earners-more-tax-richest-office-national-statistics-inequality-council-tax-vat-equality-trust-a7704331.html), though because the very rich are getting more and more rich it won't equate. It seems odd to blame the poor for that split though.

"Quite often it's the minutiae - not understanding regions or using terms like ""Police Department"". The latter happens particularly often in US programmes (there was a Nor'n Irish character in *The District* who was repeatedly referred to himself as being ex ""Belfast Police Department"" for example). 

One of the worst offenders for getting things just subtly wonky is probably *Elementary* and you have to wonder how  Jonny Lee Miller keeps a straight face sometimes "
"There’s no need to get worked up about the NIP. As registered keeper you have an obligation to provide information, but only so far as it would be practical for you to know. So for example you would be expected to know which family member was driving your car, but not which employee of an organisation you handed it over to and had no control over. 


Some guidance [here.](https://www.hampshire.police.uk/advice/vehicles-and-road-safety/nip/)  In short - name the garage, send it back, and the police will simply send another NIP to the owner of the garage obliging him to provide the information. 

Beware that you still have an obligation to respond, and any information you do give must be correct. That’s why I wouldn’t even go to the effort of canvassing the garage for the driver’s name - let them provide that information on their own NIP in case they get it wrong. "
Arrest doesn't equal being charged. He's been arrested because he killed someone. He might or might not be charged. 
"If your amygdala is overreactive causing heightened fight or flight response then it's unlikely the DVLA will allow you to skip the hazard perception test, they wouldn't want fight or flight response kicking in when you're doing 70 on the motorway.

"Automatic are not unheard of at all. They are less common than manual, but they certainly do exist, and if a reputable company is hiring one out then it will be used and well maintained (otherwise it’s costing them money - to buy, insure, MOT and store - unnecessarily).

If you don’t feel you’d be safe driving a manual, then 100% rent an automatic. (For what it’s worth, I owned an automatic for 2 years and had no problem switching back to manual. But I’d been driving a manual for 15 years before buying that automatic, so it was pretty much muscle-memory even with a 2 year gap.)"
"Not just a UK issue. As someone your Dad’s age living in the US, I see first hand how specific stations and papers have become straight up propaganda. It’s driving lots o families apart.

The only thing I can suggest is if you can get your dad outside, away from alcohol and the tv, and try and have a heart to heart. Be honest, set ground rules about what you will and won’t discuss if he wants to maintain a relationship with you. Tell him you love him as your dad, but he’s being disrespectful to you calling you soft and a snowflake and whatnot and you don’t need to take it.  You may not change his mind but perhaps you may get him to stop and think about what he’s really saying because i don’t think half these folks who parrot talking points really understand the issues beyond the very limited view of what they are being fed.

And as a mom - you’re a good kid. "
"Honestly, I would look to regulate general purchase of residential properties by anyone who does not intend it as their main residence much more strictly.

BTL is part of it, but holiday homes and investment properties that sit empty (looking at you Chinese and Russian consortiums) are just as much of a problem. 

We need to stop looking at houses as investments and start looking at them as homes again. There are far too many houses sat empty.

While I feel sorry for the rare good landlords out there, who genuinely are good human beings doing nothing wrong, the cost of housing in this country is atrocious and BTL is part of that problem. There are other ways to invest your money than property. "

"&gt;Do you Brits debate about gun control, or no, since it is already banned?  

In short, no. Guns are already (for the most part) illegal to own here, so debating gun control would be moo.

&gt;What do people say about the shooting there?  

It's used as proof that our society is falling apart and fearmongering about how crime is getting worse. Occasionally it's used to demonstrate how ""Americanised"" we're becoming (sorry).

&gt;Is the annoying gun control debate a uniquely American thing?

Very much so, sadly. The gun worship and how closely they're intertwined with the concept of ""freedom"" over there is a a fairly uniquely American mindset. 

Even when we had freer access to guns we, as a country, never really cared enough about them, that a single school shooting (our *only* school shooting) was enough to make us re-evaluate our relationship with them."
