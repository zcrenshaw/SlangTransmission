Well imagine a sauna but instead of wearing towels its old men fucking each other and instead of a swimming pool its old men fucking each other and instead of a sauna its a big room filled with old men fucking each other.
"If your conscience pricks you, give that amount of money to charity. It was a genuine error.

I think Tesco, who at one time took a THIRD of all money spent on grocery shopping in the UK, and take about a tenth of ALL shopping, can overlook the accidental theft of a few cans of cola."

"My dad was on it a few years back. His was the first night, and yes, all 5 nights are consecutive! He got £100 I think to get the food and drink for the evening. Camera crew turned up at 8am, we got kicked out the house, and they did the bit at the beginning where they explain who he is and all that. 
Then the prep starts. Huge lights in the kitchen, remove paintings that they don’t have permission to show, change the bedroom for the interviews, that kind of stuff. The other contestants then arrive and get going. Sometimes, he said, you could be waiting for an hour in the taxi while they got ready!
The producer would go around the table, telling people what to say and stuff. So don’t think everything that’s said is the persons own thoughts! And the crew took so long to sort the shots of the food out it went cold, and he lost marks for that.
Anyway, all wrapped up about 2am, then he had to go to the menu talk through thing for all the other evenings. Enjoyable, but hard work he said!"
"I've noticed it's quite common in the Winter.

"Ah, so, this is the famous American education system..."
"&gt; and was wondering what people who have graduated and didn't get on a grad scheme did after uni? 

Got a job. 

You need to get over the graduate thing. It equally doesn't preclude you from any jobs nor does it guarantee you any right to a good job. 

Most graduates do not go into a graduate job let alone a graduate scheme. "

"David Letterman, Jay Leno, Jimmy Fallon and Conan O'Brien are all terrible. Over scripted, over produced, cheesy and dreadfully unfunny.

Saturday Night Live is awful."
"It comes in a crate, you empty the crate and give it back. If you're a true brit you'll feel incredibly guilty at the time you're taking to unpack it even though the delivery guy probably doesn't care."
"When watching John Oliver, I get the impression of a guy who is very funny, but because he's fronting a big network show he's got a relentlessly focus-grouped script. And, being America, he's got to ham it up and make everything big and showy, whereas left to himself it'd probably be a bit more Mark Steel..."
"What tosh.

"Says someone seriously using the world ""yall"".  The difference is we don't go using cockney rhyming slang on international subreddits yet you come on a UK sub to criticise our vernacular and at the same time use a word like ""yall"".  The irony."

Best in mind a lot of street saunas are not quite what they appear..."
"Ask them to suggest a rent reduction, and use their answer to that as a guide."
"It's based around our capital cities, London and Edinburgh.  
London is the start of the A1-6 and Edinburgh the start of the A7-9. These divide the country into segments (pizza slices).  The roads in these segments start with the number on the first edge of it working clockwise.   
For example, the A1 goes roughly straight up from London so all roads starting to the east of it start with a 1. Until we get to Kent and cross the A2, then all roads starting there begin with a 2.   
Older, main roads have smaller numbers. Newer roads have larger numbers, there isn't really a pattern although sometimes a new road will have a number related to a main road it bypasses.

"I deal with this sort of report on a daily basis over the phone, in which people call the police to make a report about someone although the details are limited and they don't really want to get involved. 

Firstly, its still worth reporting to police. Will they take any action from the limited info given? Arguably not, as there's not much they can do with it. However it will be logged as an intelligence report against the person /suspect and may add to a bigger picture about them. Given that youve been told info about this female, it's likely that others know more detail, or the female is already known to police for similar incidents. It's not likely to end up with police knocking on the woman's door, however. Think of it more as adding pieces of the puzzle together - the more substantive info that comes to light, the more police can do.

As for reporting anonymously, I understand why you would want to do so. However it's important for police to have informant details as it adds a certain level of credibility to what's being said (a lot of anonymous reports are false and tend to be malicious in the hopes police go knocking on their door and arresting them for things they havent done). However on the flip side, I've taken anonymous reports that are completely true and have ended in many arrests, so there's that. 

It's important to note that if you were to make a report (and i recommend that you do) your identity will be kept safe and will never find its way out of the report or be told to the suspect. Once the initial intelligence report is sent off, it is received by a team who sanitize it, ensuring none of the informant details are immediately identifiable. Even officers dealing with the report further down the line  (if it gets to that) won't know who the information came from. 

I noticed that /u/artetolife said that police would laugh you out of the station if you were to report this. That appears to be a response from someone who has little understanding about how this sort of thing works, so ignore it. I'm not meaning to be inflammatory, but a lot of peoples ideas of what police will/wont, can/cant deal with is often incorrect.

Feel free to reply if you have further questions ( i cant imagine ive written in near enough detail. I apologise, its 6am haha)"

The miraculous evacuation of British troops who along with their Belgian and French allies had been bravely fighting the Nazis for the last 6 weeks, but had unfortunately been cut off. Ordinary people in often very ordinary boats went to save them despite bad odds and relative lack of firepower (you try fighting a war in a fishing boat).

"Couldn't actually get out of bed one morning. Paralysed by a combination of exhaustion, fear and depression. Called in sick to a very understanding head, and realised that I could never go back in again.

I didn't even make it into full time teaching, this was near the end of an 8 week placement during a PGCE year!

Managed to finish the year and scrape some kind of certification (tho not a PGCE), and found my vocation on the railway a few months later. Never been happier."

"I think a ""free house"" only means one that's not tied to a brewery. It can still be part of a chain. The term is a bit meaningless nowadays because of the dominance of pub chains.

"If you were in the city itself, the grocery stores would be smaller.

Local and Express, for example, are small-scale versions of the supermarkets in question and are designed as convenience stores.

If you go to larger supermarkets and of course to farm shops and farmers' markets, then much more produce is loose.

The shops you have visited are designed for people topping up their weekly shop, or for people who just want a bit e.g. buy the stuff for dinner on the way home from work.

You will also see that the location of these urban shops means small-scale deliveries are more practical for the shop- so vans bringing pallets more than lorries bringing sacks.

Personally, 99% of what I buy to cook is loose, but I am going in a car to places that are inconvenient or impossible to shop from on foot.

In order of quality, highest to lowest, our supermarkets are probably rated: Waitrose, Sainsbury, Tesco, Morrison, Asda, Aldi/Lidl.

M and S is not quite the same, it is a general retailer with a reasonably high quality food offering, not a supermarket."

It depends how specialist you want to go! It's also a smallish trek, and a night out in Liverpool is good so it might be worth bedding down for a night so you can visit The Cavern and stuff like that."

"The death of free time and casual unplanned trips, the end of days on the sofa reading a whole book in one go. The high probability of a significant amount of my remaining life being spent in a sleep-deprived environment of trains, telephones, terminals, taxis.

As a musician, well that much money only comes with equally tedious hard work but at least you can have a drink. That would mean a couple of months pro rehearsing till you're sick of your best stuff, a couple of months recording and mixing it - which is so so booooring, then six months doing PR and playing gigs. Some great some shit, most okay. Probably worth doing but exhausting.

"No. Half and half isn't a thing here. 

You will always get milk - usually semi-skimmed (2%) - for tea. If you're over at someone's house for a fancy dinner you might be offered double cream (closest equivalent in the US would be whipping cream) but only to go in coffee - no one would put it in tea. I wouldn't buy cream just for coffee, but if I was cooking a nice dinner there would almost certainly be cream in something I was making, or to go on the desert, so the leftovers would be served with the coffee. 

Half and half in tea would be utterly vile - I won't even have full fat milk in my tea. "
