"However popular they are, it's massively eclipsed by how unpopular they are. Most people hate them, if they've actually heard of them.

None of them have ever been successfully elected for anything. Not even local councils."
Is the place 300 miles away a possibility? Could you go stay there?
"Hindu or Hindon't, it's all the same to me."
sometimes they have rallys where like 4 people turn up and shit. 
"Appearances can be deceptive. Don't assume that everyone you see with nice houses and cars can afford them. People often mortgage themselves up to the hilt and put a lot on credit cards and remortgage their houses to pay for major expenses. It's called 'keeping up with the Joneses.' Not everyone by any means, but it's also not in the least uncommon."
"&gt; Is there anything against a royal from marrying a non-brit

Prince Philip is Greek. Prince Albert of Victoria &amp; Albert fame was German. So no.

&gt;How has the response been to her mixed race

Is she? First I've heard of it. I think the bigger issue is the fact that there won't be a bank holiday

&gt;Does everyone expect a baby? She's 36 though

Well the Royal Family are famously poor and without access to modern healthcare techniques. So at her age and with their limited resources they'll probably just have to buy one from a peasant."
"&gt;Under EU rules

fuck"
"Her behaviour is now a criminal offence - coercive control.

there are organisations that will help: https://www.refuge.org.uk/get-help-now/help-for-men/i-am-being-abused/

"They're a racist fringe group, they have very little genuine support.  They made themselves look popular on Facebookand twitter  a couple of years ago by posting out popularist memes with most of the underlying racism disguised - pro-the troops, anti-nonce's that kind of thing, so got a load of people reposting their stuff and joining their page without having a clue what they actually stood for."
"Fucking endemic. It's almost like the management don't realise that thinking is a major part of the job. 

There's a new, even more productivity destroying, trend recently though. Hot desking. Now when you're in the office you get to spend the first half an hour finding a spare desk and wiring up your equipment. "
"Get over yourself, wear whatever you like, no one gives a shit. "
"I particularly enjoy ""weapon""

As in, you're a fucking weapon. "
Don't spend all your time in cities. 
I think I'm not alone in only having heard of them because of the intense protests whenever they try to do pretty much anything. They're utter nobodies who only get any mainstream attention because people hate them.
"Dark jeans and smart shirt would generally fall under 'smart casual' so that would be fine. 

Sorry to hear the news as well."
40p is a lot when you're an absolute sesh gremlin.
"Sure, pm me your mobile and I'll WhatsApp you"
"How many breaks do they get? If they have the legally required breaks and they are allowed to drink water to keep hydrated, I'd guess there isn't much you can do.

That said, it does seem like access to tea should be a basic human right in this country (although I drink coffee myself)."
"[ This is Ofcom's page on net neutrality](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/advice/net-neutrality). As far as I know, this isn't planning on being changed any time soon."
And they still end up fighting each other.
"One word.  
One syllable.

CUNTS!  

Nothing else needs to be said. "
"Coins stay in circulation, as a child, I would see pennies with Victoria on them. I'm not that old! When there were still predecimal coins in circulation there were coins with the Queens father on them.

The king will not be crowed until around a year after the queen's death. The new money will be minted in celebration but I don't think the old money will be pulled out of circulation. We are going to have the queens head on coins for decades after her death. Notes will be replaced in time once the old ones ware out."
"Go to a Wetherspoons, drink 14 pints of beer then have a large doner kebab before vomiting round the back of a Spar"
"I don't understand why anyone would want live TV. You can use catchup services to watch pretty much anything that's broadcast, and do it at a time that's convenient for you."
"It depends what you do but I would suggest over £30,000 is a good salary."
"My mum is a bit of an obnoxious right-winger and she will regularly hold up Hindu people as an example of a “good” ethnic minority: they’re well-integrated, they work hard, they don’t cause a fuss, they’re well spoken, etcetera etcetera. She’ll also bring them up as a defence against any accusations of her being racist, “I *can’t* be a racist! I’ve got no problem whatsoever with Hindus!”

I think that kind of attitude is fairly common among those on the right, I seem to remember the EDL (a far-right hate group) claimed to have a “Hindu Division”, supposedly consisting of Hindu members a few years ago, though I doubt that any Hindu person would have received a particularly warm reception at one of their rallies. "
It's your own fault for reading the Sun.
"Thank you for the help everyone, the GP was accommodating and found some cancelled appointments for this afternoon. It's going to be a monumental struggle going outside but I'll make it"
This one just seems like it's trying a bit too hard for me
They are vanishingly small and they have no popularity.
Thank you for being a good person. 
It's actually quite difficult for Americans to get a work visa to the UK. 
"My friend just moved to America, and his salary went from maybe £70k to comfortably over $100k.  

But...he pays a lot of that out in health insurance, and his rent is far more expensive than even his old place in London, so swings and roundabouts.

If you can't afford to get on the housing ladder after a few years on that salary you are doing something wrong (assuming two incomes and no kids)."
I occasionally buy them although I've never paid more than £2 for them. The reason why I buy them is because I can stick them in the freezer and not worry about them going bad. Anything that I can stick in the freezer that doesn't affect it's taste/texture is great in my books.
"Afraid so. Sadly, there has been a concerted effort whenever a Tory government is in power to cut funding to state schools to make easy for privatisation of our education system."
"""Where are you from?""

""Cool.""

Then maybe a bit of banter, a few questions about where your home is. Foreign students, including Americans, are super common at universities all over the UK. You'll not be out of place or anything"
"Cobblers. There's been huge privatisation of the NHS already.

All public health services got taken out of the NHS - suicide prevention, self harm prevention, drug and alcohol services, contraception services, etc etc.

Organisations such as LivewellSW or First community Health and Care would have been unthinkable under Labour, let alone the much worse virgin or priory group offers."
I think most Hindus will be primarily identified as being Indians rather than by there religion. In the UK they're probably your doctor.
*I've just read your post history - I'd heavily suggest you go to hospital.*
"yeah its a huge possibilty, im not sure when but the offers there, she just needs to sort things out on her end to prepare for me to get there
i need to sort out my stuff here too like my benefits and chagne of addresses and shit. and obviously find a way to move my stuff there.
would it be possible to pm me your mobile and talk via whats app? i find it 10 times easier to sneak conversation through there. as she may well try to snoop on my pc. ive managed to keep my phone away from her for a ittle way. ( hence the throw away acc etc )"
"Some British women would use this term on men and women.

Some men use this term on men and women."
Why would it be on British telly? 
theres no bank holiday. i think that removed most peoples interest. 
"Uncertainty is surely better than the certainty you are facing?


The Police can attend with you to collect property if they believe it will get heated, then there's MensAid, MensAdviceLine and the National Centre for Domestic Violence whom can offer longer term support"
[This perfectly executed barrage of insults](https://youtu.be/P04SLlIITPI) 
"Not very. Most of their would be voters voted for UKIP in 2015. Nowadays, even UKIP is fading into irrelevance as a large share of their voter base comes back to Conservative or Labour. Neither UKIP nor the BNP have any seats in parliament."
"Are you fucking shitting me?

Huge swathes of the NHS are now run by private firms. It's the same with education. 

Here's the thing, the Tories knew that they could never get away with privatising the NHS and education in one fell swoop the way they did with everything else, so they've been doing it gradually, a piece a time so we wouldn't notice until it's too late."
"You'll be fine, avoid self service and tell the cashier it's swipe only. Whether some of the younger cashiers have ever processed a swipe card is another matter but shops can cope with it. That being said if it has a chip they won't (shouldn't) swipe for liability reasons. "
Something is way off if you're earnings that much in Manchester and think you're struggling. How much is bills and rent? I know many people on much less than you who live to excellent standards  living in Manchester with a thriving social life to boot. 
"Cunt. Simple, in no way elegant and good for offending 90% of the world. "
"I upvoted so someone more knowledgeable than me can help you but I have to ask, Why?"
"Ok so first of all it’s 5AM so you’re not going to get any more answers for a bit ;)

Second of all, ER (which stands for Elizabeth Regina, the name of the queen)  read abound sounds phonetically similar to someone from Birmingham saying “here you are” as in “help yourself” or “have some of that”, a cheeky invitation. I don’t think anyone’s doing an impression so I’m not sure what you’re referring to there"
"The US has much higher salaries than most of the rest of the world, especially for IT. Anything over 30k a year is a decent salary here, anything over 50k a top 5% kind of one."
Because the rane in Spane falls mainly on the plane.
"Basically, from this thread I can tell OP is from some position of privilege and has probably never worked a day in their life, which is fine, some people don’t have to do that. However, what you have to understand is that most parents either A)Are NOT going to spend money financing their kids education because they don’t want to or they can’t. B)What’s maybe a small amount of money to you, is a big amount to others. If you’re American studying in Britain that already shows me you’re way better off than most people financially. Just be understanding and not condescending to others. Because your post seems a bit cuntish tbf."
"""Doesn't she look tired."""
"""More distance between the egg and the beans. I may want to mix them but I want that to be my decision. Use the sausage as a breakwater."""
"You'll drink more. Possibly meet more people due to the accent. You'll have the piss taken out of you because of where you're from (this is normal, not because you're American.)

You'll do less work and be better educated afterwards.

I did four months studying in America and it was interesting but you're not missing much by going elsewhere"
"There are many conditions where sufferers have good days and bad days, but the fact they have bad days makes them so unreliable that they can't hold down a job."
"Unless you're posting from somewhere other than the UK, it sounds as if you're giving an answer to your own, rhetorical question."
"Nothing.  On principle.  

Even if it costs me more to buy it later.  Black Friday can fuck the fuck off."
"Similar thing with Sikhs. Parties like the BNP sometimes make a point of the fact that one of their candidates is a Sikh so they can't be racist.

Of course the reason that person probably joined the party is because they also hate Muslims."
Why on earth would they but one when they can just grab the nearest swan and stick a dress on it?
You set the dress code. Wear whatever you feel fine with. Half of those attending are probably worrying what to wear. It's your dad so dress how you feel is appropriate. Nobody's going to judge you.
"Tbf frank I hadn't realised she was mixed race, just thought she had an LA tan. Not a problem amongst the majority of society. 

He's quite a long way down the line to inherit now, anyway, most of the reactions have been ""good for them."""
"Long story short, it's hard for US citizens to come to the UK.

You basically need to:

* Be highly skilled
* Get a visa sponsorship from a company in the UK 
* Marry a Brit
* Claim citizenship through parents
* Get a student visa

"The Counting House, Glasgow and Hamilton Hall, next door to Liverpool St Station are two that spring to mind. Both pretty ornate buildings. Not sure if it's original decor in both, mind you.

Edit: Just had a look and they're both definitely orginal, not sure why I doubted it based on where they're both situated. The Counting House was once a bank and HH a ballroom for a hotel."
"If they're anything like my old GP, all the day's appointments fill up within about five minutes. There'll be a string of pensioners queueing outside the front door and a bunch of people with their fingers hovering over the call button at 7:59. If you call at 8:15 you're **waaaay** too late."
