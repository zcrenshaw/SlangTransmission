Mass shootings 
"Calling yourself Irish or Italian when your great, great grandmother left the old country in 1870"
"Dorm rooms and/or sharing a room with someone at “college”.  There’s no way an English person would share a room with anyone at uni. 

Also, fraternities. "
"Legalise, regulate, tax. 

Use the taxes for drug treatment programmes. 

Free up lots of police time and prison spaces."
Routine circumcision. It never ceases to amaze me how much American parenting time is spent discussing baby peen.
"Chat with a waitress in the US:

 Hey, where you from?

 I'm Lithuanian

Oh cool, I'm Italian

*hears from the accent that it is not even remotely true*

 Oh, so you speak Italian?

 No

Ever been to Italy?

Nope

Words fled me after that
"
Having to pay for healthcare.
"&gt; Mass shootings 

Ignoring them and blaming non-gun owners is the American thing

We used to have them, then we banned handguns and tightened up gun licenses"
[Forcing kids to sing the national anthem.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs)
"Go slow with it. Just start saying ""morning"" and give her a little smile. Then carry on with your day. 

Then another day say ""morning"" and ask how she is? 

Then another day do the above and talk about the train/commute that you both do, ask what she does for work. Let the conversation flow and then say goodbye when she/you get off. 

Then another day, do the same, ask how work is? Ask if she'd like to grab a coffee sometime. "
"Being overly patriotic. I like Britain and the flag but not on the same level as Americans.

Being overly loud in public"
"Yeah, dorms are for boarding schools not universities."
Arguing for *more guns* in the aftermath of a mass shooting.
Having 4 ad breaks in a half hour tv show
Being bankrupted by getting cancer.
"Drink 18 pints in Wetherspoons, eat a kebab and then shit in a bin behind Ladbrokes"
That requires a bit of patience but starting a normal conversation without telling her I fancy her in the first sentence is probably the most sensible thing to do.
"Fucking giraffes, with their long necks and their mandatory gratuities."
"UK universities treat students as inexperienced adults with fewer responsibilities than others. US universities seem, to us, to still treat students like children in many ways."
Tipping for a drink.
"By the pack, unfortunately..."
£5 says she's taking an earlier train by Monday.
Bad etiquette on your part to not make him a drink to be honest.
"It is antiquated and sexist. Some people still like the tradition of it. However, if the woman you wish to marry thinks it's antiquated and sexist you risk fucking the whole thing up by asking her father before you ask her.

You probably ought to know her well enough to know how she'd feel about it but if you don't, ask her first. Then ask her if she wants you to do the bullshit talking to her dad thing or not. Take it from there.

FWIW I'm pretty sure nobody actually asks the father first any more. They might go through the motions later on if that's her thing."
If she speaks English no problem at all.  But as a concerned friend you should be discouraging her from ending up in Preston.
"A shitty low paid one. 35

Kids, if you're reading this and think GCSE's are all you'll need... Don't. Get some A Levels or whatever they call them now and get an apprenticeship. Yeahyeah, art is your passion or somesuch bullshit but it's highly unlikely to pay the bills.

Become a plumber or something. People will always need a plumber."
"Generally speaking I just don't think we like skyscrapers very much, they're ostentatious and, frankly, quite vulgar."
Not owning an electric kettle. In my experience they're pretty uncommon in American kitchens but it's almost unconveivably odd not to have one in the UK. 
Truncating the word *maths*
Last 2 times I went to Indiana and Texas pretty much everyone was driving home from bars. One bar in Indiana I asked for a taxi number and they didn’t even know any taxi companies. Certainly I felt in those places it was more socially acceptable than the uk.
"Yes, £40-50k would be considered an above-average wage and you could certainly live comfortably, especially up north. "
I think it is more telling him you are going to do it nowadays rather than asking for permission. 
Why would you even join one in the UK? It's not like you need the older boys to buy you drinks because Nanny State doesn't think you should drink before 21. 
"Driving large SUVs and pickup trucks.   

Having someone walk off with your credit card to pay your bill. "
"Full moon, half moon, total eclipse. Obviously."
"Planning permission issues, particularly over things like protected views https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_view"
"If they got us doing that in secondary school we'd all probably have laughed and walked out of assembly thinking it was a piss take. 

"
The level of religion in daily life. At least in the midwest.
"“Yeah mate not bad, you?”

I think I could have just had my leg chopped off and this would still be my go to response."
"Paying to *receive* a phone call on a mobile/cell phone.

That doesn't happen in the UK!"
Driving 50 feet.
I believe the standard procedure is to send a creepy message to the Metro's Rush-hour Crush column.
You mean to tell me every college student who lives on campus in UK has their own room?
You're just not invited to the good parties. 
"The meat / veg etc will normally be cooked fresh to order (marinated in advance for those dishes like tikka etc), the spice mixes/sauces are normally pre-prepared in bulk either off site or in the restaurant depending on the place, and are just chucked in when cooking.  

As to why Tesco etc ones are far more inferior, I suspect it is partly that the meat is being preheated, and also likely that curry houses use a LOT more fat, salt and sugar than a supermarket could get away with."
You can't pull the wool over peoples eyes with this. We were all students. You can afford tea and coffee.
Presumably only the ones that visit the UK.
"Plate piling

In Florida I watched horrified as American after American loaded their plate for breakfast, first went the fruit, then the savoury on top, then syrup on top of that.

Like a normal person, I went up, got a plate of fruit and pancakes and sat down. Then, having finished that, I went back and got a plate of savoury. After that, I went back to grab a croissant.

It's like walking the 30 feet to the buffet more than once was an extreme hardship."
"&gt; doesn't own tea to offer.

Also bad etiquette."
"Your bathroom stall doors. Here, our cubicle doors go practically right down to the floor (often right the way down), and you can't peek over them either.

Edit: another one!

Not being able to pass a school bus when it's stopped, even if you're on the other side of the road. I actually think the US system is probably much safer than ours, but in the UK you can pass a stopped school bus just like you could pass a parked car."
"I know you've kind of touched on this in saying you pay for drinks after you're finished drinking them, but...

* Table service in pubs.

First time I walked into a 'pub' over the pond I couldn't believe my eyes and ears when someone came to me and asked what I wanted. I'll tell you what I wanted, a quiet swifty while I was waiting for the girlfriend, not some overly enthusiastic barman trying to flog me over hopped IPAs :("
"You fucking bet I did

All you can eat breakfast while I'm on holiday. Too fucking right!"
I always thought it was because London clay was not strong enough to support the required foundations (but is easy to tunnel through)
"TV adverts for branded medicines. We only really get them for branded treatments (cold &amp; flu and the like) but you seem to get loads for prescribed drugs. I particularly love all the disclaimers at the end  - ""asking for this drug may cause hair loss, flatulence, bankruptcy and/or death""."
It's where we keep the fire.
"Yeah, they're arse holes. Well into the realms intimidation, assault and theft  if they actually carried out any of the threats. Trespass is a civil offence anyway, so the police would just tell them to jog on if they called them. Report the tossers."
Take a book. You'll be bored as fuck.
"Exactly. Going straight in with I fancy you is very strong. And unless you follow rules 1 + 2 religiously and have some very good ""flirty eyes"" then I think it's too strong too soon. It will probably freak her out a bit. "
Most of the sauces are pretty much the same and are made from a 'base gravy. This is amended slightly for each curry. The curry secret by Kris Dhillon explains well.
"That is super annoying, my mum is Irish but I’d never refer to myself as Irish "
"I met a US girl in a pub in London. She said her dad was German. I thought that was cool and asked if she’d ever been, or if he taught her German growing up. She then looked at me as if she’d never said anything about him in the first place and I was being weirdly random. 

Confusing night. "
"Whenever the United Kingdom has a Queen as Head of State, she is entirely protected by male Queen's Guards. Whenever we have a *King* as Head of State, he is entirely protected by female King's Guards. It's a long standing quirk of the British Military. To answer your other question, there are currently 8 women in the military. One of those is the Queen, 3 are medics, 2 are helicopter pilots, 1 is a bugler, and the last one is responsible for laughing at whoever believes the bollocks I just typed."
"Sounds like you found a local field for local people.

Report them to the police, but be aware nothing will happen as no person or property was actually harmed.

You either found a) a couple of psychopaths b) a couple of guys who've suffered a lot of crime and are now acting like psychopaths.

"
"It's very antiquated and deserves to be thrown into the nearest oubliette. 

For comparison, I (male) proposed to my now-husband and the thought to ask his father never crossed my mind. If you wouldn't do it to another man, why a woman?
"
"They tried to launch a fraternity at Edinburgh University, it [didn't go well ](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/universityeducation/student-life/11244242/Investigation-launched-by-Edinburgh-University-into-fraternity-rape-threats.html)"
There are people here who need to over compensate but not nearly as many 
"I think you're missing the point, they were driving home from *bars*, where they had been consuming alcohol... which you shouldn't do..."
Viennetta
"""Wag1 piff ting"" is bound to work :)"
Just want to greet them not make them fall in love with me. 
"Fire doors are not fire exits, it doesn't mean they lead anywhere special. It means they're reinforced and fire proof; they should be kept shut so that if there's a fire, it'll help stop it spreading. 

A standard door into your office could be a fire door. "
I've never taken illegal drugs and the argument for legalising cannabis is just too strong. It is safer and less addictive then smoking and the financial benefits would be great.
"If saying ""hi"" gets you the 'what the fuck do you want' look, telling her you fancy her probably isn't going to go down well either. Ideally you'll need to have conversed a few times before confessing your love... "
"Please don't do this! Don't accuse someone of following you. This is too close to negging which is generally discouraged.

Source: all my female friends have told me that hate this and get this too often.

Edit: Don't not done"
We pay (a lot) less though.
"&gt;Getting takeaway from a restaurant that isn't an Asian restaurant

We have pizza places here and it's not like it's obscure to order from them, so I don't agree with this.
"
"As far as I’m aware, yes. Maybe a few people who go to uni in London (as the person above previously stated) but I’m certain the vast majority don’t share a room. No one at my uni or anyone I’ve ever met who went to uni shared a room "
"Not sure about ""made"", my school it was very much a bored mumble. Added benefit of it putting kids off religion for life!"
"When my brother started uni in Norwich he was sharing a room. Shared rooms do exist, but they're the cheap/last minute option. I think he ended up with it because his application for accommodation was late and it was all that was left."
"Have you tried talking to your local councillor?

You have a disability, and your Council are obliged to assist with that where possible. It could be stickers on the bins that you can identify them or the like, but they should be able to assist - and there are likely to be other people in your authority with the same issues. 

By getting the Council to do it, you're not having to single yourself out to your neighbours or the like. "
Don't forget that when you die your parents will be bankrupt too :) 'merica
"Fuck me there's some awful advice on here! Do any of you actually talk to people (yet alone to girls!) at all? 


Seeing you see each other regularly, just build it up gradually.


Day 1: ""Hello again"" 

Day 2: ""Back again. Terrible weather today! Took me ages..."" 

Day 3: ""You got far to go at the other end?.. “


Etc etc. You can then guage from her reaction whether to risk a longer conversation! 
"
The butler did it. 
Calling your bum a fanny
"There’s another weird thing. I had a complex pregnancy and birth, it only cost the NHS about £4K, and it cost me nothing over the National Insurance contributions I already made. "
