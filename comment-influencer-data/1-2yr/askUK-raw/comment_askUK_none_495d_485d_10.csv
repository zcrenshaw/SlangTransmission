"In my first week of uni someone on my course introduced themselves, and said that they'd gone to ""one of the top 20 schools in the UK.""

""I went to the bottom school in my town,"" I replied. ""Does that mean I've done well, or you've done shit?""

The look on their face was priceless. "
"The reason he's saying that is because you're young and he knows he can guilt trip you into staying. I was the same when I left my first job but you just gotta do it, be cheeky and ask for more money if he wants you to stay but at the end of the day he can't force you to."
"I drive on the right now.

Everyone else gets mad but I'm sure it will catch on if I keep doing it."

"Here is the *official* advice https://www.gov.uk/handing-in-your-notice

Specifically:

&gt; You must give at least a week’s notice if you’ve been in your job for more than a month.

As you've been there for under a month, you can resign without notice. But, it is probably polite to give a week.  As with any relationship, it is best to try and leave on good terms. You never know when you'll cross paths again.

As for the other points - if your manager doesn't want to be short staffed, they can pay more to keep you.

If the other staff are having to work harder, they can ask for more money or find new jobs.

None of that is your responsibility or your fault."
"It’s The Cross Tree Pub in Byfield.

Because that method wastes a lot of water.
"Having been on a speed awareness course a few years ago, I think the answer is that some drivers still don't understand how they work.

There was a girl in my group who asked incredulously, ""But how did it *know* how fast I was going *before* I got to the camera?"". I tried to explain - ""You remember from school how average speed = distance / time?"". Blank look. ""OK, if you travelled 60 miles in 1 hour, what was your average speed?"". Blank look.

She said she reckoned it was because the cameras can sense the temperature of your engine, so I gave up explaining."

"Put it this way, when football ""came home"" in 96 the whole country was in a party atmosphere for months.

That was ""just"" a Euro semi final, so I can't imagine a world cup final. 

The scenes would be undescribable. Trafalgar Square would be renamed after Gareth Southgate. Jamie Vardy would get a knighthood. And unfortunately for our Welsh and Scottish brothers, we would never shut up about it."
"If he was serious, he wouldn't have told you. Hes all mouth, real thugs just torch your car without trumpeting it first."

"The Met Office used to supply meteorological data for the BBC's forecasts until, iirc, 2 years ago - since then they've been getting info from MeteoGroup who will probably come to different conclusions than the Met.

Personally I've always felt The Met Office's predictions to be overall, accurate."
"If I'm washing up, and I find a half full cup of tea, or a plate covered in food, I can rinse it off without the soapy water ending up full of diluted tea and lumps of food.  

Having a small kitchen in a small house means we don't have room for once of those fancy double sinks."
The word 'liberal' (and the pejorative 'libtard') meaning socialist in lay political discourse.
"I went for an interview at Oxford and one of the other people being interviewed asked me which school I went to.

I was completely baffled by this question. I wasn’t from the same city as this guy... why would he care?"
He needs to walk into his local branch of TSB and loudly exclaim “Reports of my death are grossly exaggerated” 
"Why are you even contemplating letting your boss dictate what you do with your free time.

Sign up to the course and leave on time on those days. What happens after 5pm is not your problem, it's actually pretty hard to fire someone.. sure he might get pissy but it's your life here. 

This actually gets me pretty rilled up! He's probably saying no cause he knows you won't kick up a fuss"
"Don't feel bad, say that unfortunately you can't afford to turn down this job at Sainsbury's make sure you write an official letter of resignation. They may not pay you for the entire month. Don't worry about making them feel bad or if it's not fair, they will be able to find someone else. "
"High school ""prom night""

No such thing just a few short years ago.

"It occupies a similar position in British English as ""damn/damned"" (as an adjective) does in American English.

If you wouldn't say ""I can't open this damn jar of pickles"" in front of someone, that's a similar situation to a Brit not wanting to say ""I can't bloody well open the gherkins"".

So basically: not in front of young children, elderly relatives, or any stranger where you're trying to make a good impression."

"See, I faithfully used a washing up bowl for years and years without questioning it. Just because my mum had one and my nan had one and it was just what you did.

About three years ago I threw mine away because it had a crack in it, never got around to buying a new one, and... wow.

I have so much *space* in the sink now. I don't have to worry about cleaning the washing up bowl to stop it getting disgustingly mouldy anymore; the sink is stainless and never gets mouldy.

My name is knightsbridge\-, and I am a switcher."
"Not really, the vast majority of people like electricity and water, I'm also a big fan of mains sewerage."
"Yes the quality of the bbc forecasts dropped after the change.

The met office are much more reliable now.

The bbc not using the worlds leading meteorological agency for political dogma of giving to the lowest bidder seems intensely depressing to me.

No doubt it won’t be long until the famous Nathan rao of the daily express is given the job."
"Well, he can offer you £8.50 an hour... but even then you are under no obligation moral or legal to accept.

The pub's staff are not your concern. It's the manager's problem to deal with. Try to be as nice as possible about it, but this is one of those situations where it's perfectly acceptable to put yourself first."

"This needs to be upvoted more. I can’t believe the amount of people telling a 17 yr old to tell the pub management to piss off...

Do not burn bridges, be polite but firm, explain why you are leaving. You never know when you may meet this person again or in what context. You never want to be in a position whereby you’ve screwed yourself out of a potential job just because you were rude.

"It’s a stile. Quite a nice stylish one ( ho ho)

It’s a kind of gate that allows people through but stops livestock or bikes.

In this case I suspect it’s designed to stop motorbikes."

"Yep. 'Probationary period' has no legal significance in relation to unfair dismissal. It might affect your pay, hours, responsibility, notice period (both from you and your employer) and so on, but it cannot change the way the law works (unless, for example you are guaranteed a position for a certain length of time if you pass your probation).

You can still take a case of 'automatically unfair dismissal' to a Tribunal - such as if you are dismissed or discriminated against for having, or being associated with someone who has, a protected characteristic (disability, gender, age, pregnancy etc.), or for exercising your employment rights (minimum wage, working hours, union membership etc.)."

"I have met more than one person who thinks that the average speed cameras work on the average of the speeds at each camera, not between them. Therefore, in a 30mph zone, if you go through the first camera at 40mph, blast down the road at 80mph then slow down to 20mph through the second camera, your average is 30, so you’re golden.

"He is not particularly well known, but he does have a programme on BBC Radio 4 (the BBC’s talk radio focusing on news, current events, culture, drama and comedy) every few years. That gets a reasonably number of listeners, but I don’t think he is nearly as popular here as in the US. 

I think his work is very good (I often find American comics a bit irritating) because it is smart humour and because he understands British culture so can relate his topics to us. "
Very. I got mine off eBay and hardly anybody will accept it.

"Economy of scale.

They outright own all their pubs.

Massive edit: the reason they are the cheapest is because they want to be the cheapest - its their buisness model. There are several bigger pub chains in the UK (Enterprise Inns, Greene King, Punch, Admiral, Heinekins, Marstons), but being cheapest is not necessarily their goal. Some go for the family pub, some are bistro, some are fancy bar types, some country pubs - each has their flavours. Weatherspoons flavour is cheap.

To see economis in action, take a look at this (from 2015 ....)

The nations 17,000 independent pubs turned over an average of £140,000 per pub.

Each Weatherspoon pub turns over £1.8m (again an average)"

"I'd be against it.

Due to the difference in size and population, the US would essentially be absorbing the UK, and only being the UK on paper.

"Whilst I appreciate there are a lot of non-football fans I think that if England were to get to a World Cup final then yes, the whole country would pretty much shut down for the day. If they actually won it you can probably write the day after off too.

I think it would probably be the biggest event in a lifetime, bigger than royal weddings etc (maybe coronation of a new monarch excepted). Unfortunately it isn’t going to happen!"
"When they were current (I wouldn't go as far as to say popular) they were genuinely the irritating morons they appear to be; perhaps over the past decade they've become more self-aware, but the real question is... why on Earth would you care so long after their irrelevance?"

"I went to Newcastle and there were a bunch of kids in my halls from Rugby and Eton. They were decent enough lads but their weekly entertainment budget was more than my entire budget for a month!

I once went with them to visit some of their cousins in Durham (no shit, but they were plucking pheasants when we arrived). Asked them why they’d gone to Durham - “because we didn’t get into Oxford or Cambridge”

Asked my mates why they’d chosen Newcastle (expecting them to talk about the night life)

“Because we couldn’t get in to Durham” 😁

Thing is, these guys were set for life anyway, so they didn’t actually give a shit - they’d all been on gap years touring Africa and stuff before Uni, and now they were just there for the experience. 

Nice guys. Twats. "
