"No, I'm just not American. Nobody outside the US gives a fuck. "
"&gt; biggest sport event in the world 

But the FIFA World Cup, champions league, Olympics or the Cricket World Cup weren‚Äôt on this weekends and all of them are much bigger than the super bowl?"
"Yes obviously, you're in the UK so our laws apply to you. For the same reason you may want to not bring all your guns and stand firing them into the air in streets. "
"You also have pakistan, bangladesh australia new zealand, south africa and the west indies which does in fact give a fuck about cricket."
It's also over 1.5 billion people. OP should learn that no one gives a fuck about his shit sport
"It's perfectly legal as long as you post photos on reddit each time you use it.

You're an idiot
"It seems like an awful job, dealing with a bunch of grumpy folk, sitting in traffic a lot of the time, plenty of arseholes and crazy people. "
"It's coming from conservative nuts who have no idea what life is actually like in big cities in the UK. There aren't any ""no go zones"", and that Metro article is simply mocking those who claimed there are. 

There are nice areas and less nice areas like all cities, there are areas I'd rather not walk home alone late at night. But it has absolutely nothing to do with religion or Sharia law, that's just nutters trying to tap into people's fears. "
Sounds like it's time to initiate Operation To-me-to-Yew Tree.
"I literally couldn't tell you what sport it is without Google. It's either American football or baseball, but I'm not sure which. I'm leaning baseball. "
No. You are in public. Keep your dignity.
"British and American men are basically the same but British men are generally speaking more superior in nearly every way you can possibly
imagine. "
"No he's right, you are an idiot. Cricket is hugely popular in countries with massive populations. American football is popular in the US and...well nowhere else. "
Americans don't piss in tea. They piss in cans and call it beer 
"Cricket is, by most measures, the 2nd most popular sport in the world. American Football barely makes the top 10.

I don't know what you expected other than downvotes by coming to a UK sub and insulting everyone."
"Turns out, it's a lot cheaper and easier to write endless panel shows. With the added bonus of them being *about the same*, popularity wise."
I'm starting to understand how Trump got elected
"British men are far less likely to pick up an automatic weapon and on a whim slaughter their  family, colleagues, neighbours, or strangers."
"""I once killed a guy I worked for"""
"This might be the reason:

&gt;A survey of 6,000 members of Unite found that one in eight had been spat at in the past year, while 86 per cent suffered from verbal abuse and 2 per cent had been physically assaulted.

So, in short, because the general public are cunts."

"&gt;Something that is totally alien to Americans? I'm open to trying some crazy shit.

Go into literally any pub, order any beer and *don't tip.*"
"No, the bouncer refuses them entry...

‚ÄúNot without a Thai.‚Äù"
"Pros: the chuckle brothers
Cons: full of sex offenders"
It comes from news sites deliberately trying to stir this sort of fear in people with no actual evidence. Pay no attention to it. 
"If you do get sacked (which if they‚Äôre investigating, you may not) just take it as a lesson learned and move on. 

I think you know that by using your managers pin, keeping the receipt and not saying anything you messed up. There‚Äôs no point kicking yourself about it now, and at least in the future you‚Äôll never do anything similar. 

You can‚Äôt learn if you don‚Äôt fuck up once in a while. "
"No. We are more realistic about what people can achieve and realise that the poor to rich stories are exceptions to the rule. 

Your American dream is what prevents you from having a more socially progressive society."
I read my kindle or look for another job.

Hopefully you get banned. 
If you ignore all the arguments of course it sounds dumb.
There's a reason for the cab being shielded with plexiglass.
"&gt;east European manor

Heh.  There's a world of difference between ""manner"" and ""manor"".

And yes, it sounds weird.  It describes you as 'blunt' at best, and 'rude' at worst."
"Go to co-op, get a fucking load of special brew cans and the big bottles of white lightning, drink them in the park.

"Some Unis attract many wealthy students even if they‚Äôre not Oxbridge. Bristol, Durham, Exeter being notable examples "
"Formula One averages 400 million viewers worldwide per race

Super Bowl gets just over 100million viewers worldwide "
"Ultimately, it comes from millionaire shitcunts like Trump, Robert Mercer, Putin, Farage, Murdoch etc, who find a nice bit of ""them vs us"" fearmongering and society-dividing keeps everybody from noticing who the real mutual enemy is."
watching commercial ads for hours isn't boring?
"The point being that all of those countries (and the West Indies) play Test cricket, that's a potential audience of well over 1.5 billion people. 135 million people watched the 2011 final live in India alone even before Sri Lanka (the other finalist), Pakistan and Bangladesh are considered and at least as many will have listened to radio broadcasts.


By the way, just because something gets no coverage in the United States it doesn't mean it gets no international coverage, it's American insularity and ignorance of the world that causes that view. For example Aus, NZ, SA and the countries of the West Indies are all fairly successful at Olympic athletics (Usain Bolt is Jamaican after all) and a number of other Olympic sports that NBC doesn't bother to cover because there are no Americans competing - hockey, sailing, rowing etc."
"I'm white and I grew up in one of the ""no go zones"" the right wingers often moan about (not London) and I'm fine. Yes the Muslim population is high where I live. That just means the taxis are cheaper and Tesco sells huuuuuge sacks of rice and tubs of ghee. Plus at Eid the neighbours and my colleagues give us food üòÅ"
I only know it's going on because of reddit. The media pretty much ignores it completely.
So much for looking for that information if you're just going to treat it that way.
"Does it smell? If not, it‚Äôs fine to drink. "
It's just not that nice a flavour. Strawberry ribena is nasty compared to blackcurrant. You can get strawberry Fanta at burger King if it has a machine you pour your own drink from 
"Yes.

US laws do not apply here thankfully."
Your responses indicate you are a literal child. Perhaps come back when you grow some pubes eh? 
"I think driving in general should be a lot more restricted. We're a tiny country and there are too many cars and building/upgrading the infrastructure to cope with the capacity just isn't possible in towns and isn't good for the countryside.

I'd be quite happy for driving like this to receive a lifetime ban, and also for introducing a tougher driving test and compulsory checkrides every few years, a bit like what you have to do to keep a pilot's licence current. Don't get signed off? Can't use your licence until you've retrained. "
"From what I've seen they mostly originate from your side of the Atlantic via right-wing nut jobs.

No one actually based in the UK or Europe, regardless of politics, is going to come out with something like that precisely because it's so manifestly false.

I suppose you saw the new American ambassador to Holland [getting demolished](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/us-ambassador-netherlands-pete-hoekstra-islamist-extremism-a8125591.html) by Dutch TV on this point?"
"A lot of passengers are rude.  A lot of passengers are abusive.  It is repetitive.  It is bad for your health.  It is thankless (cheers driver! doesn't count).  These things grind you down.  

I also imagine there is an element that the sort of people who have natural charisma and cheer are probably not attracted to that sort of job."

"White British people are the largest demographic, they just don't have a higher presence than *all the other etnicities added together*. The biggest change to that in recent years has been the rise in white non-British residents - i.e. from Central and Eastern Europe.

Oh for fucks sake. I mean for fucks sake, how can you type something so stupid.

&gt; there are many areas that are enforced under Sharia Law

There are none. None at all. Everybody in the UK has to obey UK laws. Nobody can decide to set up their own legal system for any reason."
"If you include India _alone_, it's likely that cricket will have a bigger viewership than the superbowl. "
"Zero interest, I'm glad it gets no attention. "
"Genuine question. Other than people saying thank you and getting paid, what sort of thanks should bus drivers be getting? "
Surely lying on a CV is frowned upon? 
"I find it weird that people do this. Perhaps if it‚Äôs late and your popping across the road for a pint of milk it‚Äôs okay. 

But when I see someone in the daytime shopping in their jammies, I automatically assume that they haven‚Äôt bothered to wash if they can‚Äôt be bothered to put some proper fucking clothes on to go out in public. The ones I‚Äôve encountered often do have a certain pungent aroma about them too. It‚Äôs usually a heady mixture of cigs, body odour and chip fat. Occasionally there‚Äôs a waft of last night‚Äôs alcohol thrown in there as well. "
"And I don't give a shit about the superbowl or what you watch. Why do hundreds of millions of Indians watching cricket not make your claim false? 

Your entire argument is basically ""they're a country that doesn't matter, viewership figures should only be counted from ""relevant"" countries""

Fuck off. If you make a claim that x event is the most watched on Earth, you better have the figures to back it up (from _all_ countries on y'know, Earth.) or back down when you're so easily proven wrong. "
"They threw around a few adverts promoting it, but *our* Six Nations started up this weekend so can't imagine that has helped.        
Kick off time for the Superbowl was 11.30pm on a Sunday night so not a lot of people would be watching it live."

It's not so much getting stopped as wait till your insurer refuses to pay out because you've been in an accident that they say you could have avoided if you'd been able to see.
"The UK wouldn't change its entire laws just because you had arrived, you can drink here."
"Life is a rat race whether you work in the city or not, but if you are careful with your money then a few years on a high wage will make it easier to quit the rat race pace later in life.

I was always careful with money and paid my mortgage off within 5 years, but then wife and kids came among and meant that money is constantly tight, so I am stuck in a job I would rather not be in for some time to come.

Not really advice, just my experience.

"&gt; graduated

What? You're not even getting minimum wage!"
"I'd say that's too much. It's another way of saying 'Yeah he can be rude and abrupt, but we have to forgive him because he's forreign and he doesn't know how us Brits like to work together'

A) It's condescending to you. If they have an issue with your behaviour, then they talk to you privately, not share it with the world.

B) It is telling people that you're rude, so before they have even met you they may have already made a decision that they won't like you which will damage any potential working relationships. 

Ask your employer to change it. "
"As someone else has mentioned, go for a curry. While I'm sure you have Indian restaurants in the US, British Indian cuisine is kind of its own thing. And usually not very expensive as far as restaurants in the UK go."
"You're in a Russell Group university in the South of England?  Then, yes, you are likely to find a higher proportion of middle- and upper-middle class students there.  You'll find a different make-up in other universities, particularly post-92, and large city Russell Groups outside London (bit variable that one, e.g. Durham)."

Flat roof pubs.
"Mostly make sure you avoid the usual business buzzwords/clich√©s - team player, good communicator, hard worker, creative etc. Only use them if you can specify what you have done as a member of a successful team, where you have shown a creative spark etc. Provide facts, not statements backed up by nothing. Good luck"
"&gt; LMAO, no one gives a fuck about cricket outside of England and India. 

Yet it still has more viewers than the Superbowl. So if no one gives a fuck about Cricket, then even less people give a fuck about the Superbowl lmao."
"Think it through. You‚Äôre over 18 - You show your ID to the bartender in the UK. What does he do? An Austrian walks in afterwards and shows his ID. Then a Venezuelan, then a South Korean, then a Kenyan, then a Slovenian. Does the barman have a list of drinking ages for every country in the world behind the bar? Who issues him a fine if he‚Äôs caught serving alcohol to a 20 year old American, the UN?

The drinking laws would stay the same. ‚ÄúThe drinking laws‚Äù are the laws of the country you happen to be in, there is no ‚Äúchange‚Äù. "
"Ex-police.  What happened isnt a crime, but you should still contact the police anyway and let them know.  Just because they didn't do anything to you doesnt mean they haven't done anything.  The sort of thing you're describing should make a local officer at least a little curious about who they are and what they were doing.  They might even know who they are and will respond with something like:

""That's Gary, Barry and Larry.  They are local gamekeepers, I know them well.  I'll have a chat with them and let them know they scared the shit out of you and to pack it in""  OR

""Can you describe them?  We had a report later on in the day of 3 suspicious guys seen in the vicinity of a burglary"" etc etc

I covered the same small town for 13 years and I was ALWAYS curious to find out about strangers who were lurking around."

"You clearly do give a fuck which is why you keep replying.

You're the one who isn't intelligent. Grow up. "
"oh god i've been trying to write a comment for ages and I can't get the tone right. so fuck it here goes

this is a shit idea.  Unless you're *really* good looking, or can sing like an undiscovered Howlin' Wolf, you'll find that no-one will give a fuck about some american cunt bumming about doing his noodley blues when we have tens of thousands of the homegrown bastards ourselves milling about and making Brighton even shitter than you can imagine

Sorry if that's rough.  If you're willing to work in Starbucks though, you could probably make it work.  Don't bring a guitar."
"No he's correct, hopefully you get banned. Even if you thought it was a 70 zone why were you doing 81? "
"Well, obviously the correct answer is that neither of you were in the right, nothing in the Highway Code or any law says to do 75mph ""in order to overtake quickly""....but yeah, the biker was being a self-entitled arsehole."
