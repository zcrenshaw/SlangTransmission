"According to my English, middle-class husband: ""A detached house with a large garden and a big fucking wall."""
"To be on £28,000 a year in London in your thirties and think you're lucky. 

To have saved £30k by eating Tesco Value for five years and never going out. 

Put that £30k + BOMAD's £30K and Help To Buy's £30k on a shitty one bed flat in zone 6 where the only positive feature of this suburban sprawl you now call home is that Nandos is walking distance.

You travel using Uber, shop at Sports Direct and holiday with Ryan Air knowing they criminally abuse their staff, but fuck it, I can't afford anything else.

You have to park four streets away, there are so many cars in your area now. Car insurance has skyrocketed so you say a little prayer as you fold in your wing-mirrors.

Your train is late again. There's nothing you can do about it. Your season ticket has gone up and you wonder where the money goes.

Two pints with a mate on a Tuesday night. That'll be £11.30 please. You sheepishly give that tenner over you were holding in your hand and dig in your pockets for more change.

Maybe it'll be all worth it. Maybe it won't. Maybe I'll get associate senior manager next year, if I even know what that job title means. Maybe I'll get 'downsized'. I still have £270,000 left on my mortgage, I hope not. Sarah says it's too much to travel 17 stops on the Piccadilly to come and give me a blow job. Looks like some extremist has gone crazy in Westfields, 29 dead. I'll put the kettle on.

The British Dream.
"
"Can you update us when it's resolved, just because it's a hilariously stupid situation?

If the landlord still isn't being any help, try the police non-emergency number. Understanding that they might be conducting illegal evictions by accident might prompt some action..."
"I think we can all agree that a stew with a pastry hat is definitely not a pie, despite what many menus would have you believe."
"Throwing this one out there - benefits. There's about £13bn benefits goes unclaimed every year - often because people don't believe that they qualify. 

Free museums - we've loads of them. 
"
"Detached house someone within an hour of London.  At least 4 bed, 3 bathroom.  Having a room called a ""Den"", possibly with a pool table in.  Having a utility room and possibly also a ""boot room"".  Kitchen with an island unit and bifold sodding doors.  Sky TV with every conceivable add-on in every conceivable location.

Big garden, mostly lawn, couple of trees.  Optionally a row of fir trees blocking out the poorer neighbours.  Tomatoes and beans growing at one end that the gardener actually takes care of, football goal at the other.  Giant cunting trampoline in a corner.  Well attended BBQs/garden parties hosted in the summer, which last well into the small hours when Jeremy starts singing Tina Turner.

Spouses - if female, then someone called Mark or Paul.  Does triathlon to stay in shape.  Something in the City.  Fighting a battle for last 15 years with Regaine, Finestaride and 18 different shampoos to just keep a non-embarrassing amount of hair on his head.  If male, then someone called Charlotte or Helen.  Brunette, keeping her looks into her 40's.  Quietly and uncomplainingly starves herself to stay a slim size 10, but can muster up an impressive amount of cleavage for key social events.

2-3 kids.  All going to Uni.  One is ""arty"", the others are academic, whilst still being popular and sporty.  Associated clubs, classes and sports teams for kids cost enough to feed a small family and require a logistics schedule DHL would be impressed by.

Multiple cars on the drive.  One a big saloon for Dad to impress the guys in the office, even though he gets the train in.  4x4 for Mum to do the school run.

1-2 Dogs, 0-3 Cats.  Ignored and neglected goldfish or other small pets kept in tanks optional.

If suburban could be on a posh ""nice"" estate, although more likely to be an older house extended 14 times.  If rural will have Aga in kitchen doing its bit to raise global sea levels."
"Maybe one day, I might be able to buy a house."
"I think so, but it's because not one group of people can match 100% of your interests and expectations, pretty universally, rather than culturally. 

So if I go to the gym with a group of people, and they're cool to spot each other and have a chat with, that's fine - but they might not enjoy going to watch independent theatre or something, but I know other people who do. So in that hypothetical situation, I've just got two groups of friends. 

I think the other thing is that... groups of friends are just cliquey. It's not a bad thing, but if I've got 5 friends I went to high school with, we have a depressing number of years of in-jokes, references, memories, etc. that will come up in conversation. 

I'm always hyper aware of third-parties and generally try to explain any references they might not understand, or steer away from any in-jokes, because it can be really awkward to not be able to laugh along. A perfect example is inviting a personal friend to a work-night out, fuck that. I'll never go to somebody elses work night out.

"Manchester, bristol, Brighton."
"For much the same reason that the Eiffel Tower is famous - it is reasonably unique, easily recognisable, and easily accessible. The ‘dongs’ that it makes are broadcast multiple times a day on the radio, and the pattern is also very recognisable.

For what it’s worth, you might want to make it clear that Big Ben is actually the Bell,  not the clock/tower, although it is the whole package that is famous"
"£90 in lose change, we found the rich guy! "
"Arsehole, shitter, ring piece, bum hole, nipper, starfish come to mind, the most common around here would be ring piece, often shortened to just ring.

I had a blazing hot vindaloo last night and my ringpiece looks like the Japanese flag! If you want me to use It in a sentence"
"As someone who hates mayonnaise, for me every sandwich has too much :( it's a really struggle finding a prepackaged sandwich without it "
"I'm always surprised by the number of people that don't have railcards. If you don't travel by train then that's fine, but otherwise you can often save money on just one or two journeys, and there's a variety you could be eligible for, not just the 18-25 one. 

Also, meerkat movies. If you go to the cinema, you'll almost certainly save money on just one visit by getting the cheapest travel insurance. "
"More and more neighbours joined in trying to force it open and finally it gave enough for us to wedge a knife in, and slide it all the way around the edge. I was going to take a picture of the ruined door, but surprisingly you'd hardly even notice what had taken place."
He is 100% right.
Banging....?
Tea in the office and a cry wank once you get home? 
"Another option is go talk to your tutor, explain your concerns, and see if there are any other courses you could transfer on to.  Lots of students realise that the course they're on isn't right for them, so it's common for people to move around.  

If you're serious about Geography, go find the admissions tutor for Geography, and have a chat with them, and see if they can accommodate you.

I'm certain the university would rather accommodate you, than see you drop out entirely."
If you encounter that accent you must be in deep shit or Ireland.
Is this not a thing your employer should provide?
"Strong AND stable

Good job mods."
"I would tentatively argue that 'Shepherd's Pie' is a specific *dish*, whereas 'Pie' is a *type* of dish. 

I would say that Shepherd's Pie doesn't meet the definition adequately fit into the category of 'Pie', but can still be referred to as Shepherd's Pie as a standalone dish. Similar to Black Pudding. It certainly doesn't fit the definition of a 'pudding', but we still refer to it as 'Black Pudding'."
"You kinda played yourself lol. ""in the act""... you cheeky sausage "
"Try CasualUK also. This is the sort of thing that will get them going.

Personally, if I hear or say the word 'pie' I expect a pastry crust.

A potato topping does NOT make something a pie; dishes like shepherd's pie, fish pie and cottage pie are 'umbrella names' where both words must be said together in order to clarify what is being described."
"Don't call Ireland the British Islands, just a heads up."
"Not should, but must. In those temperatures gloves would be PPE."
Glass the cunts
Sounds like the London Dream really.
Get an MOT at a local council test centre. It costs less and they have no interest in finding faults which they make money on repairing. 
Turn indicators.
They won't care 
The dream is to leave the UK and live abroad.
"It's a [town near Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton,_Liverpool) in England.
 
Liverpool was a major trading port throughout the history of the British Empire, trading in all sorts of goods, many from the New World; tobacco, coffee, spices... Maybe there is some trade connection?

Unfortunately Liverpool [also traded in people](http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/ism/slavery/europe/liverpool.aspx). I really hope I'm wrong, but might that be significant to your family's history?"
"No need to hope a bank will take them because they will.

The notion that they become worthless is absured."
A lot are franchised and of course those at motorway services cost more too
"Slamming doors, banging on the ceiling (we're upstairs)... you dirty duck"
"back.. Always?
Seems weird to be in the front, unless it's a full car"
"I still see quite a few Britons travel abroad with their regular debit card which can cost them dearly. (As many banks still charge £1 per transaction.)

A currency card (like Revolut), or even a basic bank account in a Euro country for frequent travellers to mainland Europe, can help the budget last that little bit longer."
Nurses are qualified professionals. A receptionist is a receptionist.

"To add to this, the 16-19 bursary fund. It's a payment to students aged 16-19 who are in low-income households. It's paid directly into your bank account and you can spend it on anything. It's meant  to be spent on books and resources for school, but you don't have to.

I know a young carer who didn't have time for a job, but the bursary meant she was able to go out once in a while with some money."
"If you’re thinking you might want to study in the future, get yourself to Edinburgh or Glasgow. Both are amazing cities with excellent nightlife and culture. They are also much cheaper than living in London. Once you have lived in Scotland for 3 years (I think, double check this) then your Higher Education is free.
You also get free prescriptions, eye tests, pay less at the dentist etc than in England. Yes it rains a bit more, but you’re waterproof! "
"I never take my wife on a work night out.  She doesnt know anyone and I would have to spend my night making sure she was ok because she has no one else to talk to. 

Plus, all we talk about is work."
"&gt; I'm going to hide in my bathroom and get high.

Personally I find the Police are the appropriate resource to turn to when someone threatens you with violence, rather than consumption of illegal drugs.

That's just me, however."
"Ultra-pedant point: the bell's proper name is The Great Bell.

Ultra-ultra-pedant point: everyone calls it Big Ben so the first point is pretty much irrelevant."
"I have to give my home town of Liverpool a shout. 

We have three universities in the city so there is a large youth population. The nightlife is great, especially during the week and their is a large independent movement in recent years has seen a boom in unique shops, bars and restaurants.


House prices are also considerably lower than in the south. "
Vacation house? You've been outed. Wrong sub mate. We call it a holiday home.
"The current Scottish government provides a number of social security benefits that aren't available in England. For example free NHS prescriptions, additional payments to pensioners and the disabled over and above what Westminster provides, and free tuition at Scottish universities for Scottish students.

Of course these are all political decisions made by the current Holyrood administration so there's absolutely no guarantee they'll last beyond the next Scottish Parliament election, so basing a major life choice on factors such as these is very risky. But it's an example of how the two countries *can* differ, and personally I expect that difference to increase post-Brexit, not decrease."
"This is a 100% employer  supplied.  Unless you are freelance they have to provide clothing suitable for the task. If you need gloves. I guess a hat, coat and trousers. I would imagine some nice boots and socks to keep you warm. And those boots are super anti  slip.  

You are of course aware of company policy ?"
"In my experience it's pretty accurate. If anything the film shows you a slightly sanitised version. The frightening and incomprehensible language is, believe it or not, very real to what Irish traveller speech sounds like."
"Someone mentioned railcards, but the least well known is the Network Railcard. It's a railcard for everyone over the age of 16, but it's only valid in the South of the UK :)

https://www.network-railcard.co.uk/about-the-railcard/where-its-valid/"
"first class isn't touted as next day delivery, they aim for next day delivery, but only around 93% of letters / parcels arrive the next day.

depending on the start location and destination it could quite easily take 2 or more days for a multitude of reasons.

if you want next day delivery pay the extra for special delivery."
