Probably wouldn’t have a Spoons steak be your first mate
"[Here ya go bud](https://imgur.com/a/7hRqJZt), I was going to do a high res scan of my latest ticket, but thought it'd be easier for you to have a clean one mocked up in Photoshop to save you the trouble of editing out the printed text. If you need the PSDs feel free to PM me. I've done both old style and new style, take your pick. Good luck with the proposal!

Edit: [This](http://www.1001fonts.com/ticketing-font.html) font might help make it look it just that bit more authentic. 

Extra edit: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, kind stranger!"
Getting a steak from spoons is like getting a blowjob from your grandma. It is technically a steak but it's not what you want.
"Part time-ism.

Underemployment.

Historically low interest rates creating 'zombie companies' which would have probably gone under during normal interest rate regimes.

A lot of the companies which have gone under on the high street are those which did or couldn't adapt to trends or current market conditions.

Government is subsidising wages through welfare payments, meaning companies don't have to pay a higher, or true 'living wages' as outlined by the Living Wage Foundation, to employees. As such *in-work* poverty has been rising over the past decade.

 "
"I feel like High Street shops would do a lot better if they opened during hours when most people can use them. If you go to Spain or Portugal, shops open til 8pm, or til 10pm in big cities. In the UK if you work in an office then it's essentially impossible for you to visit a High Street shop Monday to Friday so you'll be far more inclined to wait a couple of days for an Amazon delivery rather than wait til the weekend to roam around a town centre. "
"I only ever sold one thing on gumtree. It was a £450 junker of a car and I just wanted rid, I hated it - I was prepared to accept £250 if pushed. One guy turned up with a friend and spent AGES asking me about every last detail then when I couldn't get the radio to work with HIS phone via bluetooth he threw a small fit and said ""this is the only reason why I'm buying it"". Then it started working. Then he pointed out all the myriad of bashes and scrapes.

After all this his mate pulled me aside rather passively aggressively and said ""right - lets talk money"" and wouldn't break eye contact. He then offered £440 and claimed he ""wouldn't pay a penny more"". I said ""£420 and you have a deal"". This bemused him and he left rather confused."
"Everytime you have a conversation with someone do it in the style of a police interview.

i.e. ""for the benefit of the tape Mr Jones is nodding"""
"Top Gear. Used to be so impressive and genuinely funny, then became scripted gay jokes and the same dated shit over and over again. Should've taken the chance to drop it altogether when Clarkson went nuts. "

"The U.K. has generally more income inequality than other European countries so such groups of people are more noticeable.

I think a lot is to do with rapid deindustrialisation in the 70’s and 80’s where many communities lost their traditional main source of income and this has filtered through the generations.

I think other European countries did not go through such a rapid change in the economy. "
"The British version of the American term ""British English"", is just 'English' here."

Nope. Actually googled him a few minutes ago because people seemed to be getting all worked up.

"You're now legally obliged to provide us with an update, whatever happens.

Bonus points for a video, cos why not."
Tell him anecdote about how your mate with another company got fired for recording people's conversations.
"I worked at subway when I was 16. To add lots of extra meat or cheese made the cost of a sandwich skyrocket. Had a really high bloke come in at around 2am who asked for every type of meat and cheese we did. 

I can’t remember the exact numbers but I told him that it would cost a lot more. He asked if there was ‘anything I could do’ while sliding £30 across the counter towards me. I made his sandwich and then he asked “how much do I owe?” I said “It’s on me mate” and he looked so chuffed and said I was the best subway maker ever. 

After he left, I put the sandwich and all the extras through the till, used the £30 to pay, and then kept the change of around £15 to myself. 

The Franchisee wasn’t seen off any money for stock, the high dude got what he wanted thinking he suave by bribing me (and thinking it was free), and I pocketed 3 hours wage in about 6 minutes. "
Anything or anyone found in Spoon's shouldn't be your first tbh.
"I'm not sure about the Internet, but if you get down to the coast I hear she sells sea shells by the sea shore. "
Career development. If you're in your early 20s and just starting out London is the best place to be if you want to quickly climb the ladder tbh. 
Only if you're Jonathan Woss.

"wow some right sour pusses in this thread. There's so much world to see outside of the UK, go and see it! Holidays don't necessarily mean going to the Costa Del Little England and getting out of your mind!  
  
It's a mixture for us. Sometimes if we have a bit of money come in we'll throw it on a holiday. In the past we've used regular savings, or chucked it on a credit card and paid it off, or both."
"British English = English

American English = Simplified English"
Riding on the road takes more awareness than riding on the pavement. Some brains aren't sufficiently evolved enough to handle a task of that magnitude.
"Room 101 when it became a panel format

"Selling cars is a fucking nightmare. Had a similar experience selling a 'spares or repairs' car after some engine issues.

Bloke turned up and was incredulous that it didn't have full service history. Well, no mate - it's a 500 quid fucked car on eBay whose advert doesn't mention service history at all.

Utter prick, but he did take it."
"If they were government funded we'd be down to four rowing boats, one for each corner of the UK, privately owned by G4S at a cost of £12 million pounds each on a PFI deal."
*woahtacism
"I cant explain further than that steak tastes like steak.

A big thing about enjoying steak though is the texture as well. Well done makes it tougher whereas medium keeps it moist.

There are also many different cuts available, ranging from stewing steak to t-bone, robert and tomahawk.

For your steak devirgining, I would firstly not order one at Wetherspoons.

Probably, your best bet is to buy two medaillon steaks from tesco (currently £3,10 for two), season with salt and pepper and cook one a bit longer than the second one. Sear on both sides as that is a big part of the flavour.

Identify which you like better. Well done or a bit pink in the middle.

Then go to a steakhouse and order one to your personal preference. Preferably with a dining partner who enjoys the opposite so you can swap a piece. 

It is all down to personal preference, if you like well done: you like well done. Don't be afraid to order well done because you 'aren't supposed to''

Edit: I obviously wouldn't eat robert as he's a cool guy. Ribeye."
Have you experienced public transport outside London?
"The closest Americans get to chav is ""white trash"" or ""trailer trash"" but it's not a very good equivalency. "
"You just instinctively know. Yesterday husband and I were watching Peru - Denmark. Peru missed a great shot and husband cries out with dismay. 

‘Are you supporting Peru then?’ I say. 
‘...I guess I am,’ he replies in surprise having just discovered that fact. "
Weird thing to get worked up about isn't it?  I liken it to me being upset that someone from Arkansas doesn't know who Delia Smith is.
"Yes they are probably trying to nick it. 

Obviously there are situations where someone genuinely needs to borrow the phone. Unlucky to the ones who look like thugs. "
"Yep - We need to get rid of this old fashioned Monday-Friday and occasionally Saturday crap. 

We need 7 days a week shopping, there' seriously no reason not to and it will create more jobs, which will please lots."
"Yep, she's still a constituency MP, her constituents presumably see less of her than most but if she decided to get involved in your planning application issues I suspect shit gets done.

This is probably more of an impact to the speaker, they have to be impartial so if you elected them as a Conservative for example then you don't end up with a Conservative MP.  When it comes to re\-election Labour and Liberal then don't contest the seat."
"So she managed to hit a completely stationary object? Regardless of if the skip SHOULD have been there with permits etc. generally not being in full control of a vehicle at all times is a big no no and hitting a stationary object is on the driver not the person who owns the object(such as hitting a parked car).

The only way it could really be found against you if it could have been easily missed(not lit, with reflectors and on a blind corner). If it's still there try to take some pictures of the location, even if it's not it may be worth taking a few."
I think it was always scripted - it just became more obvious towards the end as the scripts became too similar and they became characatures (spelling?) of themselves. Same with the Grand Tour.

For the same reason people post on Facebook asking what time Tesco is open till. Some people are idiots. 
"This is such a great example of ignoring the point of somebody's question, opting instead to point out how it's offensive. Anyone with eyes knows exactly what OP is talking about, a subgroup of people who are extremely antisocial, aggressive, selfish and irresponsible. If you deny that you know the demographic OP is talking about, you are honestly deluding yourself.

It appears this subgroup is rather specific to the UK as well, as I never noticed it in the Netherlands where I'm originally from. There is no noticeable subgroup in the working class in the Netherlands that is antisocial to this degree. What is it about the UK that fosters this antisocial demographic? "
This is above and beyond. Thank you so much!
Deleting my comment because I’m sick of the abuse I’m getting sent in my PMs. Screw me for having a positive experience and being passionate about it.
"That's kinda what I love about English slang, you absolutely have to experience it to understand it. There's no way an American can truly grasp what a chav is unless they've lived in England. 

Kind of like how if I talk about the fake tanned BTEC Hair and Beauty girls in highschool, we all know what I'm on about, Americans won't have a clue, and they just wont get it when we explain..."
Doctor Who... *Please don't hate me*
This feels like a mumsnet question. 
"Almost all my friends in their 30's have coupled up through friends of friends or meeting people through whatever their hobbies are (whether that's drinking, gigs, meetups). A smaller % used tinder etc. The younger you go, the more social media you'd have to use it seems. 

&gt; Now days girls seems to only go out to be seen and make it a sport to reject guys to boost their ego.

Rather patronising,  generalising and sweeping attitude you've got there. Maybe start working on that and you'll be more succesful."

"This happened to a friend of mine, he was wearing a watch though so he just told them the time by looking at it. The guy looked at him weirdly and went ""...nah, the *phone* time"". So he said he didn't have a phone."
"Yes. ""liquids"" include  pastes

Perhaps have a word with your/his manager or HR. Don't accuse him of anything. Stick to the facts and mention that he keeps asking you questions about confidential information which is making you feel uncomfortable.
"I knew the name and that he was a chef. I didn't know where he was from, what he looked like, or what shows he'd starred in (if any)."
"Ex-police.

Some drug use should be legal, in PRIVATE.  I pretty much don't give a fuck about what you do at home.  But if your behaviour affects other people then you should be dealt with.

Cannabis, regardless of what you think fucking stinks.  I cant stand the smell of it.  So if you use cannabis at home, then fair enough.  But if you're one of those dickheads that smokes it blatantly in public, then I hate you, like any other person who pollutes the air I breathe."

"Slap a big strip of [non-drying anti climb paint](https://www.screwfix.com/p/blackfriar-anti-climb-paint-black-1ltr/5810p) across the top of the fence (about £12 in diy shops).  Their clothes will be covered in it.  Only do it on your side.  If anyone complains it was a ""security measure""."
"This, also throwing in;

""let the record state""

""for clarity""

""if I were to go on record""

Just to hint back to him you know what he's up to. 

Also and more importantly; document everything,  take notes; save emails and maybe even record him back etc... 

""let the records state"" is your friend, if you have the records. "
"&gt; There was no effort to retrain people when this happened, too

I know there was some for when the coal mines shut down, because I ended up on a training scheme they were handing out like sweeties at the job centre, back when they were actual job centres. It was handed out locally and purely because of the coal mine shutting down, or so I was told, although it wasn't limited to ex-miners. It was a lot better than just being on straight benefits and I jumped at it. "
"I couldn't care less about the celebrity ones, but a bloke I know got one of the lesser ones (it's not just knighthoods, there's a whole system) for all the work he's done for homeless people.

I thought that was a nice touch."
"About 10 years ago, I was on a bus in Manchester and I overheard some lovely gents discussion how they would ask someone for the time and when they got their phone out, they'd nick it."
If it just went back to being a normal head scratcher crime show I'd be happy. Jonathan Creek is closer to Sherlock Holmes than Sherlock is.

The fact there's alcohol suggests they aren't particularly devout so I wouldn't worry too much about offending them.
"England &gt; whoever is the underdog in that match &gt; whoever is playing Wales.

"No. It's always been football. Soccer was more widely used in a casual context (eg: TV shows, games, magazines), but it's never really been called soccer in normal conversation.

It is only fairly recent that soccer has become stigmatised, before it was a normal, if uncommon, thing to say. It was never ""soccer across the entire English speaking world""."
I suspect this sub gets a lot of questions from people with phone anxiety or something because 70% of new submissions could be resolved with a phone call.
"""Mr Jones? Top boss. Pleasure to work with. Wish all bosses were like him.""

""Ms Smith? Top boss. Pleasure to work with. Wish all bosses were like her.""

And so on."
I have to admit that I'd never heard of him until his death was announced.
"As in, you're looking for pretty places to travel to, or you're looking for farmer's fields with no security on the gates where you can rock up and leave nappies in a hedge?"
"Once accidentally bribed some Indian police to let me walk out of a drugs bust, didn’t realise till it was all over. 

They’d blocked all the exits of a tourist hotel and were searching all the rooms. I was leaving (and lighting a cigarette) when one cop stopped me. I thought he was asking for a fag so I offered him one. He took half the pack and told me to go. 

I was well down the street miffed about him taking so many before I realised he was doing me a massive favour. At the time (early 90s) it was possible to get a few years in prison for quite small amounts of hash. I didn’t have any hash but that hasn’t stopped some cops busting people before. "
"Honestly apart from mentioning it to YOUR boss/HR just so you are covering your backside (and like most things in the job world, do it over email so there is a date and paper trail) by saying all the stuff you did here minus the ""passed him for promotions"" stuff.

Just ""I think X is asking me really odd questions about confidential stuff or other employees and I'm worried he may be recording me""

And just make sure every conversation with him.is above board and entirely polite from your end. Kill him with kindness."
