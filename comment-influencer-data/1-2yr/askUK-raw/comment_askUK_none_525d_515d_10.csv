My town was plundered by Danish raiders in 1001. We're still recovering. This is too soon to ask such a sensitive question you sick fuck.
"Oh yes. And the rosy cheeks they have and tousled hair, like a toddler who just woke up. I used to live in a place surrounded by toffs in odd coloured clothing: bright trousers and checked Thomas Pink shirts and sometimes draped jumpers around the shoulder. They went to the pub to watch rugby union and shouted ""heavy!"" at the tv. Their ways are mysterious and I only assume it starts at the schools they attend. Also, they tend not to mix and are a fashion echo chamber. They just remind me of Prince George from Blackadder meets those made in Chelsea bell ends. And Portillo of course."
"The current restrictions should be entirely removed imo. They're ineffective. Introduce proper legislation guaranteeing a weekend day off work if you like, but the current legislation is too narrow and too ineffective. You get employees shelf stacking and warehouse working anyway on a Sunday, they just can't sell anything (unless you use your phone to buy it online...). Really dumb. "

"You've done it, haven't you! You've won it!!!? Congratzzzz! This is the same thread i'd make if I'd just won £121m!! You're asking for tips, ain't ya!

Listen up, Uncle Scrooge. Don't tell anyone except maybe a few close family members who know how to keep a secret. Be a bit creative with how you're suddenly getting the money. First lie can be you inherited 10k from uncle Bill. 2nd lie can be how you won 15k at the casino with some of the inheritance. Then you start a little 'online business' that explains why you don't work a normal job and you can pretend the business is doing better and better over time. I think I could do it, but then I successfully lied about my age by about a decade for a good 6 months!"
The English laws ('24 hour' Tesco shutting at 4 on a Sunday for example?) are shite. Scotland (where it's actually open 24/7) is better. Fuck the SNP for blocking similar changes in England.
"I work at a university and while I'm sure the rules vary, the advice we were told to give is: *submit something*. The process is so much easier if you submit mitigating circumstances *before* you actually sit the exams. The process is there for a reason, so be honest (speaking to the right people in confidence where necessary) and  they will be understanding, I hope.

Sounds like a really tough time – stay strong, do your best, and get help when you need it. Best of luck.

"They're seen as adventurers and warriors I guess - kids really like them cos they get to run around dressed in cool costumes play fighting and smashing things. Definitely not a negative word - sure they invaded, but so did the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, so did the Romans, so did the Normans. They're just part of history, and as ancestors for a lot of people.

"Er..... they're people? I don't have any different thoughts about brown British people versus white British people.

"In my experience the smart M25 worked wonders. It reduced the time spent stationary by a large amount. Instead the traffic flow is much smoother as people seem to usually obey the temporary limits. Before it would be very stop/start traffic with really high speeds and sudden braking.

Sometimes it feels like the limits are pointlessly low (but maybe there is a reason that is not obvious).

One follow up question is have people ever got a ticket for speeding through a temp limit on the m25? Lots of people seem to ignore the temp limits including me sometimes with no issue."
"Large areas of terraced housing were created in the newly industrialized areas resulting from the Industrial Revolution.  The change from cottage industries to large mills and other factories and mines created a need for mass accomodation for workers within walking distance of the workplace.

Cost and space dictated what was then considered minimal design houses, two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen. Outhouse in the yard for toilet and space to hang washing.  No cars, of course so you don't need wide roads, just space enough for the coal cart, dustcart and the like.

It wasn't limited to the north alone and is, or was, fairly common just outside town centres of many towns.  A lot of that sort of housing existed in the East End of London in the dockland area but was flattened by bombing in WW2.  Much more has been replaced in many towns by urban renewal programs and to make space for wider roads and other transport and businesses. "

"other people are saying stop but that's no good - means you have to go from a stop to pulling out into 70mph traffic

slip roads are long enough that you have time to match the speed of the traffic (put your foot down a bit before you get to the bit where you move over, so you're up to speed anready)

"Go back a few decades and add a rule that says only owner-occupiers can buy British property. Stop Russians, Chinese and Middle Easterners rich investors buying property with [laundered] money.

I'm aware there more important things though."

"Oh yeah, it was all crap with no nutrition. I can still picture the ""burgers"" which were just a brown slab of questionable material. 

It's one of the things that annoys me now about things like sugar tax and people going off on one at the amount of fat in X or Y or whatever - I'm mid 30s and by far, most of our meals as kids were fish fingers, shit chips, beans and peas. And yet fat kids were almost unheard of. 

I'm not saying there's not a problem now, clearly there is. But the issue is of mindset, quantity and lack of exercise. It has nothing to do with the amount of sugar in juice, and so why the hell should I now have to pay extra for my food as an adult?

Does irritate me. "
Don't think anyone in the UK gives a fuck to be honest
"&gt; 'm mid 30s and by far, most of our meals as kids were fish fingers, shit chips, beans and peas. And yet fat kids were almost unheard of. 

Because however shit the food was, it had less sugar (and salt) in it than the equivalent shit food has now.  And, in any case, the rise in obesity seems to coincide with the *reduction* in school meals (which had to reach certain nutritional standards until the 1980s) and the increase in % of kids having packed lunches, which are systematically worse nutritionally, and have been [since the '90s](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/75598/2/S0007114510001601a.pdf)"

"The Beeching axe! It's pretty obvious that you keep train lines available when the population is going to grow (so in other words always) and don't build over them, again, in case they become useful in the future. Sure, close them while they're making no money, but build over them? Really? 

Train usage would (eventually)be higher, so it would be cheaper to get a train. Less people would own cars, so less traffic on the roads. Just the obvious things really, one of the stupidest ideas ever to close them.

Also in Oxfordshire and other posh places notice there are loads of barely used railway lines. This is because wealthy and/or influential people over there lobbied to keep their local lines open. Pure scum.

Edit. Forgot it saves the environment too!

Edit 2. In the USA a law exists to prevent closed down railway lines being built over.

Edit 3. The minister responsible - Ernest Marples - had a financial interest in motorways.

"I never once ate a burger in primary school. 

As a bright eyed 4 year old I'd only ever had burgers in buns before and didn't recognise them outside of their natural habitat. So seeing them in a tray on the counter I had no idea what they are and asked the boy next to me. He sarcastically told me they were dog poo. I did not detect the sarcasm.

Logically I knew that they weren't dog poo, that the school wouldn't serve us dog poo and people wouldn't eat it. ""But"" said this little voice at the back of my mind ""what if there's some fancy way they process and refine dog poo to make it safe and most people don't care?"", so I didn't eat it out of caution because while I trusted if it *was* dog poo it would be safe I still didn't like the idea and the thought of it made me nauseous.

I moved schools after infants, at my new school I was surprised to see they also served dog poo patties, like maybe this was a normal thing. After a few weeks I got up the courage to ask the dinner lady what they were. She gave me a disdainful look and informed me they were beef burgers with an implied ""what the fuck, are you some kind of idiot?"". Confidence shattered by her derisive response, I declined to eat them and continued to dwell on the possibility she was lying, or maybe dog poo was only a minor ingredient along with beef so she didn't feel it worth mentioning because eating processed dog poo was normal to these people.

When I went to high school they had signs up with the food on offer telling you not only what they were, but also the ingredients. Only then did I feel confident enough to eat them, however prior conditioning meant I didn't enjoy them much."
"You need to stay put, she cannot literally throw you out. Use that time to work out your next move, shelter has been mentioned several times - contact them. Your local council will also house you as a vulnerable person.

"Out here in the provinces (see: any major city that isn't London), things like ""simple bus ticket structures"" aren't a thing. 

Instead, the price you pay can be influenced by many factors including how many stops you pass, whether you pass into the city centre, what time of day you travel, what colour the bus is painted, what the driver had for breakfast that morning and the alignment of the moons of Jupiter. 

You Londoner's don't know how good you've got it. "

"IHOP... in the UK, we have Crepe Affaire which sells, you guessed it, crepes and other pancake types. But it’s way over priced and isn’t in every town. I loved the convenience, price, and variety at ihop. Personally I’m a breakfast guy. I love cereals, fruits, toast, bagels, muffins, bacon, eggs, sausage, pancakes, waffles... all that stuff, but the attempts at waffles or American pancakes in this country are just pretty lame, and usually prepackaged rather than made fresh. 

IHOP would probably do very well in the U.K."

"The Norman invasion was defended.

The Anglo-Saxon system of society and government was far more egalitarian, equitable and fair. We had elected kings for goodness sake and embryonic pre-Parliament councils. One can only dream where their trajectory would take an island nation with a unified polity (as was the case around 1000 AD).

It can't be understated the tyranny of the Normans. The Harrying of the North (something most have never even heard of), the feudal system, and so on. An extractive economic model that put the entire country one-level above slavery to a tiny foreign ruling class.

Britain was a success in spite of the Normans, not because of them."
"They're just nipples, we all have them. Go for it. I don't feel like the UK would make such a big deal about it, it's just on you and how you'd feel about it.

I honestly feel it's the obsessive *hiding* of women's nipples as if they were somehow 'naughty' or something that makes them more sexualized by certain people, it's like a forbidden fruit kind of thing.

EDIT: It's been fascinating to see the mix of upvotes and downvotes this has got, though. I guess some people feel that women's nipples *are* inherently troublesome in some way. Who knew?"

"I've never ever paid much attention to these competitions but once Walkers crisps did a spell and win contest. Packets got your letters, spell a destination to win.

Naturally you'd get ""bermu*a"" and getting the final letter was hard... *however* you could trade in unused letters *and* they were giving away a ludicrous number of holidays (30,000) or something. There was also a lower tier of holiday destinations but you had the chance to opt for a voucher with pretty decent value. 

I got obsessed with this contest, I had hundreds of letters, people were giving me their lunch rubbish it was great. I was close to dozens of destinations and on the last day I would log in and swap out letters until I got one, then trade for a voucher.

Well I got suspicious, I checked they value of the vouchers and I checked Walkers turnover and the sheer cost of these guaranteed holidays was astronomical. Seriously, even with massive quantity discounts and minimal claimage.

Well the final night came and the site went down. Nobody could log in. There was uproar on twitter and their customer service promised they'd bring up the site soon.

Naturally I missed it and lost out. I even forgot to write to them to get a list of winners. Of course the ASA fined them and whatever but there was no way they *ever* planned on giving away 30,000 holidays. It was an absolute farce. Still boycott them to this day because it's just so dirty.

"One of the main differences is why black people came to the countries in the first place.

In the US, obviously, most black Americans' ancestors arrived unwillingly, as slaves.
In the UK, although there had been very small black communities here for centuries, the majority of black Britons trace their families' arrival in this country back to the late 1940s and 1950s. This is when Britain, desperate for labour to help rebuild after the Second World War, invited people from Britain's Caribbean islands to come to live and work in the UK to run public services, in particular the newly-formed NHS. And so many tens of thousands of people arrived over a period of 5-10 years, forming the nucleus of today's black populations in the UK.

These people are known as the Windrush generation, based on the name of the first ship bringing them here. And although it would be lying to say they never faced racism or discrimination, it has never been anything like as widespread or systematic as in the US, especially the pre-civil-rights Southern states.

(Of course the reason there were black people in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other British islands in the first place was historically due to slavery, but the levels of indirection involved mean that the valid burning anger that some black Americans have felt hasn't been much in existence in the UK)."
"Exactly. Legislate to protect workers rights. Legislate to guarantee them a certain amount of time off from work without jeopardizing their jobs. But don't dictate the bloody hours or days that the whole bloody country needs to abide by.  

Same goes for religious holidays and the like. Legislate in such a way that enables those of a certain faith to take the day off if they want to celebrate something. Don't frikkin prevent me from going to the shop though! Don't prevent those who want to work from working just because it's a special day for you!

Are there actually any really solid opposing points of view? Seems to me the only people in favour of maintaining/reversing the status quo are religious folk."

Though saying that, I'm currently sat here in black leggings and a blue blokes sweatshirt as I like the simplicity of mens jumpers...swings and roundabouts. "
I think go back to just before the American Revolution and give in to the colonists' demands while they were quite moderate. It was *very* close run for the British government anyway and the whole Revolution wouldn't have happened. What is now the USA would have been another Canada and let's face it: the world would have been a much better place.

"Don't play with illegal firearms if you don't want to get shot by a Police Officer?

I *refuse* to accept a Police officer should be forced to put themselves in mortal danger over some scrote with a firearm. I sincerely couldn't give a fuck what the circumstances precisely were around the shooting - he had a gun and was a known gangster. Live by the sword etc.

I honestly can't describe how little I care that he's no longer a living person.

Beyond that, separately, I do think it raised some questions (again) about how the Met and their firearms teams conduct themselves. Frankly, I don't believe that they're the most professional bunch and I do agree more work should be done to address that. They appear to be incredibly bad at handling the case after the fact - and it seems the scene was all over the place. I recall some bizarre controversy over moving the car which wasn't authorised and then was said to authorised. I can forgive a lot during a dynamic situation, but once the threat is over it's imperative that professionalism remains and the investigation begins with the upmost transparency.

"Yes- this question is asked a lot, but it's not quite the same deal as Vietnam for you.

1) We can't cover all of our history at school. It's just too long. I was 15 before I did ANY history that was more recent than 1700. We would do 100-200 years or so per year. 

Our history is very very long compared to yours- it certainly   starts in 'normal lessons' by 750AD, even if people like the Romans are not mentioned, since much of the time between them and Alfred the Great is poorly recorded. So that makes it well over 1000 years to cover.

2) The American Revolution is really important to you as the foundation of your nation, but in the context of the 18th Century, it was not an especially important part of what was going on for us. So even someone doing that period in our history might not spend very much time on it. Indeed, we might spend more time on what was going on in Britain more than even in Europe.

There's loads of stuff that the British did abroad, e.g. India that just gets a passing mention. Indian people AskUk all the time what we think of the 'Empire' and the answer is most people have no idea.

The comparison with Vietnam is not so much that we lost the American Colonies as that America was far away and not very relevant in the 18th century- no-one imagined it would become the great country it did, just as Vietnam is far away from the USA."
