Counselling/Psychiatric treatment for Paedophiles.
Report it. The police may be able to add it to other incidents.
"She shouldn’t have done that, you’re right. "
"""Hando's"""
"Steak Club on Tuesday, Chicken Club on Wednesday, Curry Club on Thursday and fish and chips on a Friday. The other days I just pick what I fancy off the menu. "
"It's entirely unacceptable, and sadly quite common.

Your GP surgery should have a complaint procedure, if you feel interested/confident/happy to do so.

"
Ditching FPTP for a proportional system.
I just buy a Coke Zero and top it up with some sugar cubes from the pot in the office. Checkmate government!
Hate crime. Please report.
"Using a shower is not breaking a noise curfew and a shower should not be loud enough to disturb a neighbour and that should be fixed. 

Continue showering when you need to - asking someone not to at 6.30am is simply unreasonable. I need a shower in the morning - I'm not awake without it and often that's around 6.30am for me so I can get to work at 8am. 

Get the Landlord to fix the shower or suggest neighbour invest in ear plugs."
Totally agree. There’s a bald headed man in a transit van eating a steak slice who is calling us pedos right now for agreeing with this.
"That's OK, it's your decision, but I would personally see this relatively seriously.  It's sensitive information regarding mental health that is being shouted out without good cause for your confidentiality.  Training is clearly needed."
Starting point would be C.A.B.
"Partial plate is enough to file a report, particularly if you know the make/model of car and/or there was CCTV near the scene."
"How some immigrants have chosen not to consider integration with the overall culture and laws of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the European Union, or accept their precedence over those of their country of origin.

Occasionally it is debated in public, however usually in an ineffective manner, for fear of causing offence to any party."
It’s totally wrong. Time to find another job.
"Please don't wear a helmet cam. Use a body cam or one attached to your bike instead. You weaken the structural integrity of the helmet during a fall, creating a point where all the pressure is concentrated, and thus, you are more likely to sustain a head injury. "
Euthanasia
1995?
"It is talked about all the time, ad nauseam. Causing offence or not. The debate generally is ineffective however as it tends to go little further than ""they should integrate"" with no actual idea of how, realistic assistance in doing so, questioning why they might not, and actually accepting that it is still people's right to be ""separate"" if they so wish. I don't integrate with the local student population that are ""outsiders"" in my area, and they don't with me. We tend to have fundamentally different interests. No big deal. 

The legal side is another matter - the law is the law. "
It tastes like cream.
"I disagree, people said this about the 5p carrier bag charge, and for a while after the launch people did ""just pay the extra"", but now it totally different, the number of 5p bags sold, seen and dumpped has dropped significantly. I imagine this will be the same."
"My experiences aren't very good. Got friends who's trailers have been stolen by them, got friends who's tools have been stolen by them, for a friend who had to testify in court after he was beaten unconscious after confronting them for sexually assaulting a bar maid, a local company went out of business when they forced their way into their yard at a weekend and left it in such a mess that they couldn't afford to clean up and fix the damage, a few local old people got thousands scammed from them, a local farm was severely damaged after they tried to steal equipment for a barn and failed, a local park for shut down for a summer after they destroyed it and left human waste lying everywhere, a local scout group got £5k worth of equipment stolen the night before they were meant to be going on a 2 week camp and it all got cancelled at the parents expense. I don't think I have one good thing to say about the travellers that come and stay here. "
"He is being sexual. He does realise how weird it is because he is asking a younger female employee and not another man. You are not being weird thinking it is creepy or demeaning, IT IS. I have been in your position surrounded by older men, not trusting my own judgement. But your feelings are correct. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS. One thing about getting older is less fear about standing my ground. Calling you a ""bitch"" is just a way to undermine you. It sounds like a toxic workplace. You might want to go elsewhere."
"Sadly it's a good idea in principle. In practice however people will just pay the extra.

Something has to be done for the good of public health in the UK. People have shown they won't make the choice. Also let's not forget many can't because of poverty.

Meaningful enforced legislation seems to be the only lying option. But then you walk into personal freedoms which is a beehive. "
"People posting in this sub without doing any of their own research, either because they didn't have a clue how to or because they were too lazy. Problem with your mobile provider? Questions regarding your complicated tax affairs? Don't call Orange or HMRC, ask strangers on Reddit instead. It truly baffles me."
It’s the pineapple safe.
"Over the past 5 or so years, I've noticed a distinct change in the speech of young children and teenagers. The young kids seem to develop an American twang to their speech before their regional accents fully take hold and the teenagers all seem to speak with that stupid West Coast inflection where everything they say sounds like a question.  
  
It's fucking horrible."
"GP receptionists are the worst. I swear they go through training on how to be a cunt as part of the job to save the NHS money.

Hope you improve with the meds! "
"Why stick to one instrument? A one man band has to practice somewhere, and I imagine it's an infuriating racket until it's all in sync."
"53 and wearing skinny jeans, so take that you young whipper snappers."
Contact Shelter. They can give you the best advice
"When I was at school, the adults used to complain about us sounding Australian (including the question-sounding thing). They blamed Neighbours and Home &amp; Away. 

I don’t remember anyone ever getting called a “flamin’ galah” though. "
"&gt; for which we're building on a lot of our green spaces. 

No we really aren't. 10.6% of the UK is urban (which includes villages/roads). 50% of that 10% is parks/allotments and other green spaces. 

That leaves 5% of the UK is built on. That's the total of buildings, airports, golf courses, reservoirs, canals, roads, houses, gardens. "
"The UK has very tame wildlife - cats are not at threat from predators here. Cars are probably more of a worry.

In the USA you've got all sorts of stuff. This is probably the key reason for why we treat our cats differently."
"Whatever you choose, make sure to play the EastEnders closing theme when they've finished."
‘A cheeky wank’....  I didn’t realise Nando’s had branched out into the adult entertainment industry.
"Islam. 
It's hard to debate and talk about Islam and Muslims without the threat of committing a hate crime or the threat of violence and death.  
You can talk about the shortcoming of any religion, but with Islam, there will be a price to pay.  The longer our politicians stick their head in the sand, the worse it will get for British people."
"Yep, same with the ginger population inside "
"Yes. You're costing them money and time.

don't be a cunt."
They've gone *a bit mental* in the last couple of years.
Try getting a politician to admit Israel commits crimes against Palestinians. 
"Last time I saw them, they'd gone the way of /r/MensRights and started blaming all the world's problems on feminists.

That said, there's a splinter organisation called New Father's 4 Justice. Don't know if they've gone for ""reasonable"" or ""mental"" tho."
F4J aren't mental. They are an organisation who give really good advice and give support. They do stunts to make sure that fathers know that it's there
They make skinny jeans for bigger legs too. Skinny only means they are tight to your leg not they are all drainpipe thin lol. I wear skinny jeans and I also have calves and thighs that aren't just straight down 
Drugs policy
"Because its unique selling point is that it's a race for women only, to attract women and focus on their causes.

I kind of know where he's coming from, but it's not like there's a shortage of 5k's to run and I suspect if it lost that USP, then Race For Life would just become another standard 5k for running clubs etc."
"They make you fill out some forms then you'll watch a fucking ~~awesome~~ awful health and safety DVD starring some bloke that will probably look like he's on day release from a low security prison where he's serving 4 years for possession of softcore child pornography.  
They'll probably show you around, give you a basic idea of how the place runs then ask you to clean something to make you feel useful before sending you home early with a poorly fitting, somewhat greasy, chicken scented uniform.

Edit: Congratulations on your first step into the world of employment! You haven't done it properly if you've never worked for a fast food company."
"Are you worried about them finding out?  
Take it from somebody with years of experience ruining his parent's house - They'll know, no matter how perfect the repair is. They'll just *know*.  
Best to fess up, and offer to pay for the repair. Give them the option to choose the glass themselves or let you choose the closest match. Honesty is always the best policy in these situations."
Also no rabies here.
Why has he been made homeless? Excuse the intrusion but if it's not financial reasons (and please forgive the obviousness of my answer if it is) can he not simply stay in a B&amp;B while looking for a flat to rent?
shithole is quite british tbh 
"Tesco deliver mine, though I know that's not what you meant."
Splitters. Stick with the Provisional F4J or Continuity F4J.
"I would add overpopulation. In 1988 there were 56 million people in Britain. Today there are 66 million. Our economic model is tied to population growth, yet we have a housing shortage, for which we're building on a lot of our green spaces. Building tiny poor quality houses and further stretching our overstretched infrastructure.

I don't think it's a problem you can put down solely to immigration. How can we encourage people to have fewer children without becoming authoritarian? How can we change our economic model to cope with not growing the population.

I'm not sure that many people even think it's an issue.

"
"Corbyn does, and look - he's been branded an antiSemite.

How utterly absurd."
What expectation of privacy do you have outside in public anyway? 
I don't really want to get someone into trouble but I'm considering mentioning it to my GP without naming the actual person.
"I take it from your post that you are Canadian...

There seems to be a general misconception with people from the north American continent that in the UK tea is sacrosanct and it is some kind of ritual process. It really isn't, it is just the most common and standard drink and the majority of people drink the most basic and unsophisticated variety (cheap mass produced non fresh tea in chemically dyed tea bags) and don't pay much attention to it other than drinking it when thirsty, cold, bored or some combination of the above.

I mean, my impression of the US is that people drink cola or other sodas all the time... I don't expect id be looking for advice when to drink it, what to have with it, what type of cup should I use, should I get bottled or canned etc. etc.

You aren't going to make a faux pas with tea. Maybe if you did something quite odd like drinking it out of a bowl with a spoon you would get a few funny looks and sarcastic comments but it isn't like you are breaking protocol on a royal visit or something. Tbh, Obama did that and the queen moved her lips maybe 3/16 of an inch towards a ""lol, wtf are you doing, knobhead?!"" face and that was about that."

"Who is keeping cold callers in business? Do people actually get calls from cold callers asking about their recent accident and think ""you know what, now you mention it, I was in an accident last week, here are my details"". "
not for a proportional system there wasn't
Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope. 
Don't ask for fashion advice on reddit...
My cousin was in HMP Barlinnie and he said guys in there would dye their hair with Irn-Bru to try and get into the ginger gang for protection.
"most cats here go out

housecats are only really common in flats and big cities"
"Purely on a moral basis you're taking a prank way too far. This isn't a prank, you're just being knobs. Teachers are humans too."
"If the companies do what Coke have done and say ""we're not changing our recipe"" I think it's a good idea.

The bad side of this is what Ribena have done, change the recipe adding sweeteners and (for my tastes) ruined the flavour."
Nobody learns anything if nobody provides feedback.
I would contact the police and maybe HR
"I would contact the police **AND** HR. As you said, given the hazardous nature of your work he is endangering yourself and others both in the workplace and outside of it. HR need to keep him safe, as well as your colleagues, and the police have a duty of care to the public.

It seems like you already know that's the right thing to do, you're just scared about potential repercussions and how you will be viewed. Does your company have an anonymous whistleblowing process?"
Just let them know and offer a couple of character references maybe someone like a tutor from university and a well standing family friend
"Don't work there anymore but doubt it's changed since Ieft. The reason it's so inconsistent is because of how competent each store is in actually cleaning/maintaining their machines. If it's too bitter its likely they haven't cleaned out the big drums that hold the beans, so they have coffee oil in them and it makes the beans bitter. If its too cold they've spent too long getting your order ready or they've given you a spare. If it's too hot it's likely it was underfilled and they've topped it up with hot water, and too watery because they've ran out of milk. "
"Why the elderly go into the bank at lunchtime on a weekday. 

Surely they must realise that there are people in a genuine rush, and they have the entire fucking day to do their banking..."
"I work in the Park Service of a city council, they are the bane of our lives during the summer months.

I have nothing good to say about them. "

"A lot of these are actually ""we do debate this, but my point of view doesn't come across very well as it is often spouted by idiots or is shot down within seconds as what I want is a simplistic or unworkable solution"". Or both. "
"They are salt silos. If you think about how salt is stored. It is logical to create buildings that mimic the shape of a large stockpile of salt. Therefore the buildings are conical in shape. There are numerous silos on the M1 and many are attached to service stations for ease of access.

How I know? I used to work at one such service station and asked."
I believe it is worth reporting. Also wear a helmet cam. You can catch it all next time. 
Dry rolls are shit
Contact the parking company and Starbucks directly to dispute the charges. Point out you were in Starbucks the whole time and that they [activly encourage customers](https://www.cnet.com/news/starbucks-stay-as-long-as-you-want/) to stay as long as they want.
"What the fuck are you people doing to make yourselves smell so bad after 1 day without showering?

"
"About the only question you've asked which someone can actually answer is that yes, if you have a good behaviour record in prison you'll be offered release under licence (""parole"") after half the sentence is served. That means he'll be out of prison, but is still legaly serving his sentence, so if he were to break the law in *any* way during that time he'd go straight back inside, no trial, no judge and jury, no opportunity to talk your way out of it -- just straight back in.

As for everything else you've asked about prison life itself, that's impossible to answer, because it depends so much on which prison he ends up in. The big old Victorian-built jails tend to be the worst for facilities; they've all been modernised to some degree but at the end of the day there's a limit to what you can do to buildings that are coming up for their 200th birthdays.

Staying clear of drugs is critical, but hard. When you're locked up in a close environment with very little to do they become a very attractive way to pass the time and mentally ""escape"" for a while. How to avoid them? Nothing other than willpower and learning to say ""no"" over and over again.

His best bet is to keep his nose clean while inside, be a model prisoner, and aim to get transferred to a cat C prison which will be a lot more relaxed and have a lot more opportunity for personal space and privacy. This won't happen if he's been sent down for a violent offence, though.

-----

*Edit*:  one last thing: British prisoner culture is not very like US prisoner culture. The tribalism and gangs you see on American prison shows aren't really a thing over here. As long as you can keep your head down, stay away from the obvious troublemakers, and do your time quietly, it's survivable. Not by any means a walk in the park, but survivable.

(source for all of the above: one of my best mates for 20 years was a screw at a big London prison)"
"This, at any mention of them a frothing crowd appears, completely stifles out any meaningful debate."
"I think it’s unreasonable to complain about shower noise at 6.30am! I had a neighbor complain if I flushed the toilet during in the night in one place I lived in!   

I guess speak to your landlord so they are at least made aware but I wouldn’t expect them to do anything.  "
did u glass the little cunt? 
Trouble is the child maintenance payments put all the milkmen out of business.
I'm not sure what kind of fuckwits you choose to surround yourself with but no the majority of people don't jizz over American culture.
"The only person I know who keeps their cat indoors does so because they live in a dodgy area and the cat is a pedigree.

My own cat was an outdoor one until she hit old age. Now she prefers to stand at the front door sniffing the air for about 30 seconds before going back for another nap."
I can't believe you've insulted the fearsome badger like this.
"Lol, turn the tables on them. ""Obviously the current strategy for dealing with paedophiles isn't working - you surely read the stories of children being abused? Unless of course you *want* that to keep going on and the reason you're resisting is that you're secretly pro child abuse. Are you a paedophile?!"""
"Try **Families Need Fathers**.

I used them myself, and in fact volunteered for them for a while.

The main thing they did to help me, apart from moral support, was to put me in touch with a McKenzie Friend. Your friend should look up McKenzie Friends if he needs help but can't afford a solicitor and isn't entitled to legal aid."
"This is unacceptable and many professional staff do not do this, but it does happen from time to time. 

I usually speak to the person directly and ask them to respect my confidentiality. They sometimes get defensive but they don't do it again."
Why do people use humidifiers? We live in a pretty damp country.
Plugs used to be sold separate to the cable so you had to wire it yourself. Wiring a plug is still a useful skill really
"Unfortunately, the parents aren't helping the situation. Whilst I feel sorry for them that their son is in this hopeless state, they're provoking people to protest. For all they're claiming it's been peaceful, there's live feeds on Facebook of them last night entering the hospital, etc. There's a video from tonight where the dad says he's not encouraging people to go to the hospital... And his next few sentences are about how people should turn out to support Alfie. 

There's very ill children in there who don't deserve this. There's a woman with a megaphone, music, there was apparently fireworks at one point last night. There's more than one sick child in there and they're being incredibly selfish, but the mob on Alfie's army get agressive if anyone suggests that.

The parents age is showing unfortunately. They're living the whole ordeal out on social media. I suspect when they're a bit older and have some time to reflect on this, they'll wish they spent more time with their boy and less time on Facebook. And hopefully come to realise the staff at alder hay aren't evil, they helped Alfie as much as they could but not all children can be saved. Vilifying the staff, naming them, etc does not help anyone. "
