"&gt; You are taught your side of the story 

We are not taught it in school. It is a completely insignificant episode in our thousand-year history. I dare say few British people knew the Falklands even existed before the invasion, and the majority of people born since don't know they're there either (except when the Argentine government fucks up, gets desperate, and makes an international-scale scene about them to distract their electorate from their mistakes).

&gt; do you know our side?

A desperate right-wing Junta feels power slipping from their grasp. They dig up an age-old complaint about some tiny islands that Argentina had never owned in order to drum up some nationalist support. They believe the islands insignificant enough that Britain won't bother to reply. Oops.

&gt; What are the biggest differences you could see between our soldiers and yours

Britain has one of the world's three blue-water navies, a wholly-commando Royal Marines, a top-rate air force and *the* original special forces unit. Militaries around the world look to Britain as their model for best practice, and it is widely held as one of the most formidable professional fighting forces on the planet. Argentina had second-hand ships with third-rate conscript seamen, pilots and soldiers. The outcome was inevitable. The Argentines had no hope in hell of holding the islands. All they had in their favour was the South Atlantic Winter. But if the British fleet could reach the islands quickly enough, they were all minced meat.

&gt; Do you agree with the actions taken by both sides?

The sinking of the Belgrano was controversial at the time, and continues to be, but it was entirely justified under the rules of engagement, international law, and the commander of the Belgrano in later years admitted that he was a fair target, sailing as he was in order to attack the British fleet from behind (using US SIGINT satellites, the Royal Navy knew this at the time). None of the other incidents in the war are particularly controversial, though the war did expose major vulnerabilities in the Royal Navy (the CIWS on ships was 20 years out of date, and the ship normally stationed to guard the islands had been sent home) and the RAF (poor readiness and lack of planes with range to bomb Buenos Aires). Those issues have of course been rectified. There is also something to be said on humanitarian grounds, where British forces recognised that the Argentines were poorly-trained conscripts and so the Royal Marines generally used the minimal force necessary to capture rather than kill their enemy.

As for the actions of the Argentines, there is something to be said that maybe they could have assumed Britain wouldn't care if the islands were invaded. Since the 1960s the UK and Argentina were in talks about the fate of the islands. What the Junta failed to realise was that Britain was only humouring Argentina in order to make the UN shut up about it. The Argentine negotiators failed to pick up on British sarcasm. Britain was never going to abandon the residents of the islands.

Ultimately the fault lies entirely with a desperate Junta who were - frankly - insane. Or incompetent. Or desperate. It was complete folly with no hope of success other than ""Britain might not care"". They didn't know much about Britain, evidently. Idiots.

&gt; Do you have 'hollyday' to remember the war like we do?

Holiday. And no. Again it is a very minor incident (though noted as the biggest naval engagement since 1945). It is covered on 11th November as is every military engagement since 1914.

&gt; How did the media cover the whole conflict if it did at all?

Britain has a very robust media, particularly the tabloid press. The Sun ran the legendary GOTCHA! headline when Belgrano was destroyed - not without criticism from the rest of the media and large parts of the public. TV and Radio news must be accurate and duly impartial by law, so took a measured response. At the time, there weren't satellite uplinks so their reports took a day or two to reach Britain. Brian Hanorahan became a senior BBC correspondent, and is best known for this quote filed when he was embedded on HMS Hermes:

&gt;I'm not allowed to say how many planes joined the raid, but I counted them all out and I counted them all back."
"As someone from Birmingham I've learnt the following;

Anyone that will judge you from your accent alone is a daft twat that doesn't deserve your time."
"I know of a fat man who got turned down for a job because he was too fat to do the job properly. He moaned it was discrimination, it wasn't. He was just too fat to do the job"
"I used to work at one of the largest national foodbanks. The most common cause was people 'in between' benefits - they'd suffer some sort of personal crisis that would leave them unable to support themself, but the turnaround time on getting them welfare is quite slow. So they'd be referred to us to tide them over with food parcels. This does require them to be referred by an official body, so I wouldn't be terribly surprised if there was also people that were unable to get support. The most common causes we had were things like domestic violence, mental health and other disability."
"Those are pads, not tampons. But they would be useful to have in the house I think. 

I'd suggest you buy a variety pack of pads (with wings) and a variety pack of tampons (with applicator). Variety pack means different sizes to cope with different flow - each woman is different, and it changes through to course of the period too. She'll work out her own preferences soon enough. Which might end up being something other - you can get reusable things. But I'd wait for her to ask than assume she is ready for that kind of thing. 

Schools still have nurses, right? She could ask to speak to them if she is comfortable. 

Another thing: lined bins with lids in every bathroom if you haven't done this already.

"no, it's not a democracy, you can't be forced to give up a shared amenity just because some other flat owners say they want to, that's not how it works, your mothers access will be in her deeds, whether it be freehold or leasehold, her rights of access will be in there and only she can change that.

your mothers lease / deeds will give her the right to use of the shared amenities, whether others give up this right to use the garden either for free or a price is neither here nor there, your mother will still retain access to use the full garden.

Tell the neighbor to jog on, or offer to give up your access for a ridiculous sum."

Last time I moved back was two years ago due to ailing parents.  I am still in London (dear god do I miss expat life) because 1) I'm still helping the parents to the best of my ability 2) now have a fiancee.

From Germany, I got a quote for £3.5k for a removal company to move my shit from Bonn to a storage place in London.  This is absolutely goddamn ridiculously expensive; I instead got a quote for £800 for a long wheel base van from Hertz and got a South African mate to help out.  That.  Was.  A.  Mistake.

The plan was simple.  Finish work on Fri Sept 11th.  Leaving drinks after work.  Sat: hangover recovery.  Sun, Mon and Tues: Pack stuff up, repaint the flat, throw out everything else, leave.  Wed; hire the van at 7am, drive 10 min back to flat, myself and South African mate would pack it up in two hours, then drive to the tunnel, get the shuttle through, drive to Stratford, unpack late afternoon, leave the van there, hostel in zone 1, beers, sleep.  Thurs: Play tourist.  
Fri: Drive back to Germany (way cheaper than dehiring in London), dehire, beers whilst watching the first rugby game of the world cup, hotel for the weekend, fly to London on the Sunday.

Simples.

Nope.

Fri I finished work, got pissed.

Sat I did nothing as planned, nursed a hangover.

Sun, am still feeling fairly iffy.  The phone goes at 11am.  Mr South Africa is in a flood of tears, cannot talk.  It takes several minutes to establish he's just found out his Dad has committed suicide back down in South Africa.  Oh crap.  Really bad situation is exacerbated because the UK immigration bods have his passport to decide whether to give him a visa for our trip in four days.  He obviously has no interest anymore in going to London... but can't fly to South Africa.  Sunday is spent in the pub.  Write off.

Monday myself and a third friend spend all day hoofing it to Dusseldorf and back.  We negotiate our way around derailed trains causing timetable meltdowns, a momma bouncer bear who at first refuses to consider the idea of allowing us in without an appointment and trying to find a photocopier to photocopy the damn resident card.  Long story short, by 1pm we end up eventually with a South African who's very relieved to get his passport.  We hoof it back to Bonn to get him an insta-replacement large suitcase, some emergency replacement meds, to get him packed and booked onto the 10pm Lufthansa heading that night for South Africa.  By 10pm I am shattered.

Tues is a 20 hour day to pack up my shit and repaint the place.  I do it badly; I end up getting a 950 euro bill later for it to be done properly.

Wed I hire the van.  If 2 people take two hours to load a flat into a van, no surprise that it takes 1 person four hours.  I hustle to the tunnel as fast as possible because you only get a two hour delay allowance before you repay.  The rain is torrential, you cannot see the white lines on the motorway.  Doing 70mph is massively asking for trouble.  Despite it being fully loaded, my van is aquaplaning like fuck.  I push on regardless.  I get there 2.5 hours late.  I have to pay another 140 euros; I then face a 1.5 hour delay due to signalling, the rain floats over during this time, I then have to drive through the crap again into London.  I get there 8 hours late.  I park up.  The fastest way to my hostel in St Pancras is to walk to Stratford International and take the high speed train.  I do so.  I get through the barriers and South Eastern trains announces the next train is delayed for 27 minutes.  They apologise for the delay.  The apology is lost on me.  I eventually stomp into my hostel and find my dorm 8.5 hours late.  A 50 year old Canadian proceeds to tell my his whole life story.  I fall asleep before he's finished telling me about his uni days.

Thursday: Due to no Mr South Africa I spend all day unloading in brilliant sunshine.  A beer is had on my own back at the hostel.  There is no sign of Mr Canada otherwise I'd have bought him an apologetic beer.

Friday: I head back.  The van breaks down 10 metres from the French customs post inside Dover port.  Instant traffic jam.  It's torrentially raining again by the way.  It takes two French police officers to push it out of the way, then two taxis, half a dozen phone calls and much confusion plus 3 hours before we eventually log a breakdown call with the Germans who send Mr Iveco maintenance guy.  He says he'll take a look and is sure it'll be an easy fix and be back in 20 minutes.  It sounded massively fucked; I tell him I doubt it's an easy fix.  He's back in 20 minutes; it isn't an easy fix, it's a write off; the differential has shattered and fused the front axle solid.  He says I'm lucky I did it at walking pace in a queue and not at 70 on the M20.  

I bark at Mr Hertz on the desk in the Dover branch (who is seriously lacking in brain cells) to get me the hell back to Germany ASAP.  He tries to call Calais to help him out.  He can't.  He's not allowed to call internationally.  His lack of brain cells (seriously, this guy is proper thick) is enough to make me think it's sensible to ban him from international calls.  His manager can make such calls, does so and a car is arranged.  I hoof it back to the port, I've just missed the latest ferry.  90 minutes later I finally depart.  90 minutes after that I finally get to France.  Madame Hertz is incredibly unhelpful.  I no have reservation for Mr A. Fwoggie, just Mr Fwoggie.  ""YES!  THAT'S ME!  PLEASE GIVE ME THE KEYS NOW SO I CAN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!""  She finally looks up.  She considers my body language and ""I'm having a really really bad day"" glare, nopes out of the situation and hands over the key without asking for any ID or paperwork.  The car is a Skoda Octavia S.  It's their version of a BMW M3.  It's bastard fast.  Better, it has Swiss plates.

So here's the situation.  You've got a Brit, with a German licence registered to an address that he doesn't live at anymore, driving a Swiss plated car provided by the French who are bailing out the Brits who are bailing out the Germans.  The chances of getting a speeding ticket on the E40 from the Belgian speed cameras are between slim and fat.  Once past Brussels and with the entire Belgian nation clearly uninterested in heading to Germany (leaving me with a creepily deserted motorway) I ram my foot down.  I push it down even harder once I hit the derestricted German autobahns at Aachen, hitting 220kmh+.

I get back 7-8 hours later than planned, managing to catch the 2nd half of the England Fiji game.  4 pints are had in 40 minutes before I stagger back to my hotel and fall asleep for 14 hours straight.

As for the job, I applied remotely and had my interviews over Skype.

"It's not a thing I lived through so it might be different for older generations, but the war is only ever really brought up here when your government starts kicking off about it, or mentioned in context on Remembrance Sunday. We don't have a day to commemorate the war or anything, and actually we don't even study it in school, but the men who were killed and injured there are included in the general remembrance on the 11th of November alongside the dead from WW1, WW2, Korea, etc.

From what I've learned, the main difference between the UK and Argentine forces was that the Argentine army was mostly made up of conscripted kids sent off with very little training on the assumption that Britain wouldn't really bother fighting for the islands, while the British forces were much more highly trained professional soldiers. The British forces also had, generally speaking, far superior equipment, especially in aircraft, although the expedition force did have its own litany of logistical shortcomings.

I think in a general sense, the war seems to have been utterly needless. Britain has the best claim to the islands, the longest history of colonisation there and something like 99% of the population is British. Britain was also a leading NATO ally and there was no way it could allow itself to be seen as weak and just let its territory be taken. Argentina were never going to win the war and should never have started it, but once they did, the British response was fully justified."

"Neither is correct. The proper name is a matter of political opinion. The legal name on documents is Londonderry, however people in the nationalist community prefer Derry and would ideally like it changed.

Your manager sounds like he's trying to take advantage of your perceived inexperience due to your age. Don't listen to him about prioritising work over studying - he doesn't have your best interests at heart. 
"I'm a teacher and I'd say it's a hard thing to judge from the outside. 

I see a lot of parents who are thoughtless and prioritise things like booze, fags and expensive luxury items over their kids' clothes and food. Some of these parents are just shits. Some of them have never lived in a world where kids are a focus- if everyone you've ever known (your own family, your friends families, your neighbours) have always put booze and fags above school shoes, chances are you'll do the same. 

However, I do see a lot of families who also genuinely struggle to make ends meet. Rarely are the kids literally starving, but the parents might be skipping meals or dinners might be smaller than growing bodies need. 

It's expensive being poor. Our shopping economy is built on deals and multibuy offers more than other countries I've lived. So if you can't afford to buy the ""buy one get one half price"" or ""2 for £x"" you're automatically paying more for everything. It's pennies a time but it adds up. 

We also have a very predatory credit system, in my opinion. Poor people are also more likely to take out payday loans in desperation, only be able to pay the minimum on credit cards or buy household necessities/repairs on outrageous credit plans. "

"Hi Rodrigo, good idea to ask here! Be aware that people may get a bit excited and appear quite condescending to Argentina as a whole so don't take it personally.

Taking each of your questions:

- we are not taught about it at school but there is the odd documentary on tv. From our side the issue was that the dictator of Argentina invaded British land and Thatcher decided to take it back officially to protect the islanders rights. It was also to not appear weak, help win elections, and to reverse the global perception that uk was declining power.

- according to documentaries, argentine soldiers were conscripts and poorly trained. UK sent in highly trained troops and special forces. However Argentine Air Force was good and utilised missiles effectively that UK underestimated. Thanks to this, the expedition only ""just"" succeeded.

- wasn't alive then but my dad says his first thought was that thatcher was doing it for her own ends (he hated Thatcher because she killed lots of industry here)

- I agree with British action because we cannot let other countries invade bits of British territory. If there is a valid dispute then it should be resolved diplomatically through UN etc. If we had allowed Argentina to stay, then it would set a bad precedent around the world for countries, and dictators in particular, to deal with territorial disputes by forceful invasion.

- there is no holiday, we don't have many holidays to commemorate things!

- I'm not a Kelper (edit: Falklander, TIL that was a derogatory term!)

- didn't fight obviously but I heard that many ex-servicemen had a horrific time there and feel that they do not get adequate medical help here to deal with traumas.

- based on documentaries the media covered it fairly extensively since the bbc were on the aircraft carrier. Although much news was censored initially.

I am genuinely interested in your answers to your own questions because we never get to hear the Argentine side so please reply if you can! :)"
"&gt;It's expensive being poor

I've struggled to get wealthy friends to understand this. As well as the other examples you mention, you're probably on a pre-payment meter (for gas / electricity) if you're poor or even if you're just in a poor area. They have a daily standing charge, a higher cost per unit of energy than other meters, and if you can't pay when it runs down then you have *no gas or electricity* with the meter continuing to charge you more even after it's cut you off. 

One good way I eventually found was a Terry Pratchett quote:

*""The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.*

*Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.*

*But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.*

*This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.""*

Despite the street being full of people there will magically be no witnesses when your car gets bricked, the paintwork gets keyed, dog feces are smeared on your door or when the teenagers dump their empty bottles and cans all over your garden.

My advice would be to move, because the alternative approach of engaging with the authorities will only result in your lives being made a living hell until you're ultimately forced out anyway.

The surgeon had received a call and came in outside of his normal shifts. Next day she was moved back to Barnsley where we visited.

And this was right after Christmas.
