"You sound like the biggest pushover ever. It's only a matter of time before he asks for a go on your missus (and you'll curse quietly under your breath before driving him home).

It's pretty obvious what you need to do; grow a pair and tell him you won't give him a lift. If you want reasons, you've listed five really good ones above."
The British way of dealing with this is to sit in your lounge room with the lights off and ignore any knocking. 
"It isn't that buying beer for home consumption isn't a thing here, it isn't even that having beers in the fridge is uncommon.

What the point that clip is trying to make is that we don't always have beers in the fridge, but American media seems to suggest the average American does.

You see it all the time in films or on TV drama, one character will pop around to another character's house for some reason or another.

They will chat as they walk to the kitchen and sit around a table (or on the sofa near the fridge if its a small flat for some reason).

Once there, the character who is visiting the house will sit down without saying anything and the other character will go to the fridge and pluck a bottle or can of beer out of their arse and pop it down next to character 1.

They will both open them without mentioning the fact character two has some how read the mind of character 1 (though who doesn't want a beer at any opportunity, to be fair) and continue their conversation. 


I don't for a matter believe this is an actual thing that happens in America (is it?!), but once you notice it in TV and film you realise how common a scene it seems to be. 

In the UK you tend to only have tinnies (aka cans of beer) in the fridge if you are intending to consume them imminently. i.e. not many people (I'm sure some still do and i'll get a million and one replies saying so) get beers in unless they've got a 'thing' or event coming up, even if that event is as mundane as the weekly watch football routine. 

We don't tend to have constant stocks of beer in the fridge in the same way we have constant stocks of milk, for example.

I will also say, you are bound to get loads of replies about how 'beer' isn't supposed to be fridge cold and 'beer' is more of a thing in Britain especially historically. Lager is what goes in the fridge. This is true, but I don't personally think that is the theme that scene was trying to put across, nor do I think it is the question you meant to ask.

Cheers, going to crack a lager from me fridge later on in your honour. "

"He made you late.
He didn't pay you.
He used illegal drugs in your car.
He is using you as a free taxi.

Explain you can't give him a lift because of all or any of the above.

Also - some insurers won't cover you for lift sharing - not many but that could be another excuse."
"Telling the gym and making a formal complaint are probably a bit different. 

Make it clear that it's a formal complaint and if they don't do anything about it you'll move gyms. 

Perhaps ask other people you see regularly how they feel about it and if they would consider complaining too."

"There's not enough room at the police station, either for cells or other facilities, and it would also be a security headache.

We are altogether a smaller and more crowded country than you; the police station itself can be very crowded in terms of how much has to fit in the space. That also means 'a long way' in UK terms may not be that far in US terms.

BTW we do not say 'jail' for cells in police stations and 'prison' for correctional facilities.

We tend to say prison more often than jail, but either will usually be OK.

We just say 'holding cell' or 'police cell.'

"I think the mistake you are making is looking back to people who don't exist any more.

I am about your age, and pretty much all my friends are from school or teenage years.  No one texts each other all the time.  I see people every week or 3.  A small group of my friends still meet 2-3 times a week, but that's mostly because they are single, no kids, and for some no job.  They still have the time for lots of socialising.

If you were still in touch with your older friends it would be the same.  Talk is all about babies, mortgages, house renovations, because that's what people are up to.

I think the only way to keep the feel of your 20's alive is to not have kids AND find a social group of people without kids.  This isn't easy, and it's arguably not really growing as a person."
"Just your typical invasive species stuff really.

In my old job it also meant getting developments done in a red squirrel area was harder because we couldn't disturb them without a lot of precautions

"""+"" is simply a shorthand for ""whatever numbers you need to dial in your country to start an international call"".

""44"" is the UK's international dialling code prefix

Beyond that, it starts getting complicated.

Numbers beginning 07 (or +44 7) are non-geographical numbers. Mostly mobile phones, but occasionally pagers.

Numbers beginning 03 or 08 are freephone or low-rate numbers.

Numbers beginning 09 are premium rate numbers.

Numbers beginning 01 or 02 are normal landlines.

The standard formatting depends on the sort of number:

* For 01 numbers, 01XX or 01XXX for the area code, followed by 5 or 6 digits
* For 02 numbers, 02X 1234 5678
* For others, it's usually 0NXX 123 4567 but there's not really any definitive form.

"It's a great British tradition.

First you turn all the lights in your house off.

Then you sit in your front room watching a horror film to get in the mood.

If the doorbell goes, you ignore it and turn the TV down a bit.

After a few goes of this, you'll hear the familiar sound of an egg splattering on your front window.

At this point you're allowed to run outside and shove a 13-year old through a hedge."

"Generally we like American TV and films, like some of your music and like your trashy food.  Oreos can fuck right off though.

American TV is pretty much everywhere and films are of course overwhelmingly American.

We sort of gawp at your politics in horror.  Pre-Trump I do think we mainly got showed the worst of Fox News so we could laugh at the dumb Yanks.  It's not so funny now.

Generally feelings towards Americans differ.  People on the left particularly tend to dislike America, and so do older people (generalising wildly).  You don't have to say too much wrong on this sub as an American to be drowning in downvotes (you may soon discover this).  Still, we generally love to go on holiday to your country, and consume a lot of your culture, so I don't think we *really* mean it."

"Whatever the T&amp;Cs say, there is still a reasonable expectation that the package is delivered to the destination. Even if it isn't insured, they do have a duty of care not to lose the bloody thing.

Give them an ultimatum, that they return your property or refund the value; including a time limit (be reasonable here at least a week). If they still refuse to accept responsibility, and it's not ludicrously expensive, you can start a small claims action. You can do this online. Google for money claim online.

Chances are, they'll cave at this point. If not you might have to turn up at court and say that they lost it. From what you say though, it looks like they're unlikely to win. "

"I'm British and my best friend at uni is from Singapore.

I know that it's across the Strait of Johor from Malaysia. I know that it has a population of about 5 million or so. I know that its land area is smaller than that of Norfolk. I know that Stamford Raffles was a person involved in some way. I know that Singapore became independent in 1965. I know the flag is red and white and has a crescent and stars. I know that it's really hot and humid all year.

I know that Joseph Schooling was the first Olympic gold and that local McDonalds' gave out free food when that happened. I know that Singapore noodles aren't actually a thing and that my friend gets very annoyed if anyone brings them up. I know that chilli crab is a thing - my friend gave me a recipe for it but I've never tried it. She also made kueh lapis once - you could really taste the egg. I also know that the Singapore Sling was invented in the Raffles Hotel, which is really expensive. I know that durians exist and there's a building shaped like one.

I know that merlions are a thing and that it's the Lion City. I know that National Day is sometime in the summer (maybe August?) and there's possibly some sort of law against stopping to watch fireworks. I know all the words to [One Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtZmmtyKS7E) (much to my friend's disappointment). I also know that Mentos had their [National Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jxU89x78ac) campaign and have heard of the SDU. Another population campaign in the 70s was the ""Two is Enough"" campaign before they wanted to grow their population.

I know that public transport in Singapore is really good and very cheap compared to in the UK, as are most things. I know that the housing situation is something like the government owns most/all flats. I know that there are a lot of hoops to jump through to own a car. I know that the driving test is more difficult than the UK and is on some sort of artificial track instead of on real roads.

I know that importing chewing gum is illegal. They're also one of the healthiest nations in the world I think? Drinking seems to be more taboo, though I'm not sure whether that's the culture as a whole or just another story about my friend's ""crazy aunt"". I know a little bit about NS.

I did learn a little bit of Singlish last year. I only really remember ""see lah"".

Before meeting my friend, I didn't know much at all though. I knew that it was a small, humid island somewhere near Malaysia with a high population density and I'd heard of ""Two is Enough"" from GCSE Geography. I'd heard of durians and possibly of NS as well.

According to my friend, a lot of people assume it's part of China and that she's Chinese. She's been told that her English is very good."
"Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want."
"Yes. Oh, for fuck's sake yes.

We have the freedom to believe what we want, and express any opinion we wish. However, we have rights not to do this in such a way that might cause harm or offence to any reasonable person. Vitally, people have the right to disagree with you.

That means you can hold views that most right-thinking people would find objectionable, but expressing them on social media won’t go down well (it’s a private website, they can delete anything they want). Likewise, if you shout them in the street, you’ll probably get done for breach of the peace if there’s some police around."
