"&gt; I should mention that whomever I decide, I’ll pretty much get married to.

You shouldn't be thinking about marriage if you can't even decide on who you want to be in a relationship with. Also, you've only known your crush for a month."
"I met him while he was already in. The way it works in my country is a bit odd.. they must go to university for it. This is how I got into the whole military thing myself in the first place, but he was in like his 3rd semester of the career when we met. Without giving too much info away he's been in the whole military thing his entire life. His parents are a bit uneducated and they have put a lot of funky stuff into his head he believes is true, like women having to do everything a man says because he's a man and that's how it is. Thank you for your service BTW, I know it's not easy for women in the military"
"No, you should not forgive someone for knowingly poisoning your child! Your daughter could have died at the hands of your MiL and I’m horrified your husband isn’t on your side. No, she doesn’t get to see your children again unsupervised probably ever. Definitely you need a break from her after this traumatic experience. "
"""No"" is a complete answer by itself. "
Throwing your daughter under the bus to save face isn’t a pretty character trait.
"Nope out of there. 

This guy is super creepy. 

If you don’t feel comfortable confronting him just ghost him and avoid him. If you want to be firm with him, tell him bluntly you’re not interesting. Preferably have that conversation in a public place and/or with a friend present. 

If this guy continues to escalate go to campus security and/or the actual police with all documentation you have about his behavior. "
"""he told her she was about as opposite a narcissist as you can get.""

Were you in the room when the therapist said this, or is this what your mom *claims* that her therapist told her? Because if you didn't hear this with your own two ears, what could possibly make you think it's true? 
"
"So because some friends told you and you've had a few bad experiences literally billions of women are just untrustworthy cheaters because ""that's how women are now""? Your sample size is too small and biased. There are plenty of women out there who don't cheat, and by plenty I mean most. "
"I have been and still am in therapy. I took a break from relationships for a year to introspect and unpack on the series of decisions that I made with the married man.

Tbh, I did think that I was being paranoid with my current, but seeing that picture was a jolt. I clearly still have more work to do with myself. Being single for life seems like a good idea right now. "
"Your parents aren't going to change so probably the best thing you can do is to move out.   In the meantime, don't have him over and just grey rock your parents.  "
You broke up with her. She did nothing wrong and has no reason to apologize to you for anything. 
I'm definitely seeing why she doesn't buy you gifts that often.
"Notice how you're over-drinking, abusing her, and snooping through her private texts?  

You're doing much more damage to the relationship than she ever did by sleeping with someone while she was single.  

You are wrong.  
Stop treating her badly because of insecurity. "
"You need to relax. You post here ""guns blazing"" and have already brought out the torch and pitchfork to confront your wife when she got home which is a completely destructive, negative and poisonous thing to do to your partner. Especially since you have no idea if she knew it was counterfeit or not. It is completely reasonable to price shop around online to try and find the same watch for a better deal, perhaps she truly didn't know it was counterfeit.

Either way I am very concerned you are this hateful and angry attitude towards your wife about this. Its a *watch.* Calm down and speak to her constructively rather than ripping her a new one when she gets home, you're supposed to love this woman. I understand your frustration with the reaction you're getting by commenters but there is a reason for it- the language in your post being the big one."
"Oh that’s painful to read. I mean, I’m a huge fan of volunteering and giving back but I realize it’s a lower priority than my job and other stuff. Where does she even have time for her boyfriend between school, her job and volunteering?

No wonder her relationship has stagnated and he’s pulling away from her. He sounds like 5th of her priority list and she’s expecting to be #2 at least. 

I mean god. If student loan would mean the difference between finishing school in 1.5 years going at it full time and volunteering on the side vs. juggling 4 years of part time school, full time work, part time volunteering, I would definitely go the student loans path hands down. 
"
"Your dad is a borderline pervert and there is no way he mistook her for a ""29"" year old. The difference in knowledge and education is mammoth. She IS a golddigger. You are in a terrible situation and your father is so driven by sex that he doesn't give a whit about your distress. This will not change until she squeezes him for all she can get and then dumps him. If I were you I would high-tale it out of there as fast I could. Until then, minimize your interaction with them and keep your mouth shut when you do have to be around them. If you don't react to them, you don't give her any ammo."
"These ... aren’t white lies. White lies are “yes I like your haircut” when you don’t. White lies are lies meant to protect other people’s feelings. His lies are about protecting his own feelings. 

I don’t know that there’s a fix for this. "
"I doubt her husband thought either his spouse or his sister to be capable of something like this, so he deferred to the person he's known all of his life.  Not to mention his family apparently fell for his sister's lies as well, and that might have helped validate it for him with nothing else to go on.  What an evil, dangerous person."
I second this. Sounds like she's making you into the bad guy for her own infidelity. OPs previous post shows the trainwreck building up steam. 
"I was married to a man whose preferred body type was super slender, small breasts, tiny waist, tiny hips..  he also found Asian women exceptionally attractive.  
I am clearly white... At the time, I wore a size 6, but I was still curvy.... Large DD natural breasts, and some junk in my trunk 
Whike he never expressly said he DIDN'T  like my body, I always felt insecure about it and over time it affected our sex life dramatically.  20+ years later, I am no longer anywhere near a size 6, more like squeezing into a 10...still have my curves, though my breasts are no longer the perky DD they once were -gravity has had an affect.... Yet I am with a man who thinks I am incredibly sexy... My sex life is 100x better. 

My value as a person is not defined by my body or my sex life, and my overall self-worth isn't either... However, imo it feels MUCH better to be romantically involved with someone who loves my body as it is.   

Not sure if my experience helps at all but so thought I would at least put it out there "
"If you lied about your sexual history to him, then yes you should be honest with him now. When you tell him, make it clear to him why you avoided telling him in the first place. You're just gonna have to bite the bullet and tell him. ""Hey James, I lied to you about my sexual past for X, Y, and Z reasons..."""
"
&gt;As soon as we both get off work, literally every single day for the last year and a half, we eat dinner together and then stay together (usually with no one else there, sometimes with friends) until 11 or later. 

It's really, REALLY not the same thing. 


&gt;We've been together a whole lot and still hate separating at night and sometimes end up staying up till 2 in the morning to be together. I just think that we're being unfairly stereotyped as strangers when we've been so close and are really inseparable.

You aren't strangers but very easy to see why you're inseparable . You haven't had to deal with any of the tough stuff in a relationship yet. You're dating. It's fun. You're not arguing at three am about who has to get up with the baby. You aren't splitting bills and making a budget and doing dishes or scrubbing toilets together.  You're dating. That's the fun part. 

"
"I mean, it's been three months and you already have reasons to not trust this guy. You can talk to him about it, but red flags are red flags for a reason and this guy seems shady as hell."
"From my (admittedly outsider) perspective, it seems like her response is rooted in this whole narrative she had built up about you not loving her much as she loves you. All those fears and doubts, and then she found (again, from her view) concrete evidence that you were able to be that close to somebody else, just not her. Feeling like the person you love and care for so deeply doesn't feel the same can be utterly devastating.

It sounds like you're both doing good to try to move past this, I'm trying to suggest a possible explanation for her incredibly strong and uncharacteristic reaction. "
"Pros: It sounds like she has someone who is interested in her and she is taking it slow which is great

Cons: She seriously needs to lose weight. If what you stated it correct he BMI is 36.9. a normal wight for someone who is female and 5' 9'' is 125.3-169.3 and she is 250. If she wants to have more OPTIONS in the dating field she needs to take way better care of herself. It doesn't matter how body positive your social circle is or how driven your friends personality is. No decent human being is going to be attracted to someone who doesn't take care of/respect themselves. Be a good friend and tell her to put the cheeseburger down."
"&gt; There's a lot of people projecting their own proposal preferences in this thread. 

This whole sub in a nutshell."
"I guess I agree that it's too soon to call it quits exactly, but even if he gets back to her I think OP should indeed call it quits unless he has a damn good explanation, and not one that's just, ""oh, it was hard"", or, ""oh, I didn't know what to say"". Unless he's unconscious or in the hospital or something, ""only"" three days is unacceptable in a relationship that's gotten to the point where you're considering marriage -- especially since he's deliberately hiding his location from OP (what with the ""sworn to secrecy"" bit).  "
"Small woman here who also loves IF and OMAD! I eat like you, I deadlift 240 lbs, I can do 10 pull-ups, run 10 miles easily, and backpack 20+ miles in a day. It’s not a health issue. 

You could try and persuade him through online literature and resources. But clearly, as this thread shows, having evidence and resources isn’t likely going to change his mind if it hasn’t already. 

I’d suggest that you ask him to respect your choices for a few weeks. Say, for four weeks you want no comments on your diet habits. In that period of time, if he notices what he perceives to be unhealthy behavior or outcomes (eg you seem tired, you binge, you complain, you feel lightheaded) then he can write them down and talk to you about it at the end of the month. Think of it as a trial period where he gets to see firsthand how functional you are with your diet choices. "
"Ooooooh girl. He blew up over your cam modeling so he could justify *his* shitty, cheating behavior. He doesn’t really care, he just likes to play the victim."
Say whaaat?! Pls give me more info on this 
"I don't think he's angry with you. It's not your fault, but this would have been a really uncomfortable situation for him - he was meeting family members he didn't know before, and never expected that one of his students would be there to witness this emotional moment. His personal and professional worlds collided. 

He is probably still trying to figure out how to deal with it. The school may have rules against teachers teaching students when there's a family connection, or socialising with students outside of class. But if he discusses this situation with the administration he would be outing you without permission, so it's quite delicate.

Talk to either Ryan's parents or your own parents about how to proceed - the adults should be the ones to navigate this for you."
"You have a choice to make - you can't have your cake and eat it too. It seems like a really good idea before you make this choice is to seek out a sex positive therapist* and get their advice  with things like: should you see a doctor? Could you work through your sex issues with your boyfriend? Or would it be better to break up if the problem is you're sexually compatible? 

Keep in mind casual sex is really romanticised in our culture. Don't forget about the bad parts of it: bad sex, the possibility of STDs, being ghosted, feeling lonely, etc. 

But you're not wrong to want a fulfilling relationship with a fulfilling sex life. One of the biggest reasons for divorce is probably sexual compatibility (along with chores/emotional labor and money). "
"You could try the CBT practices. Cognitive Behavior Therapy .


A lot of people use it for intrusive thoughts or obsessive thoughts, or anger management of a bad temper. 

At the moment of you wanting to spew out your plans for someone else you have to stop; physically and mentally. Shut your mouth, break eye contact look away, count down from twenty in your head. And say something else"
"a sugar baby is just an inefficient sex worker in denial. it's prostitution with extra steps. you make way less money for way more work. not putting anyone down for doing it, you do you, you make money however you want to and all the rest of that. but it's about time we all see it for what it is because too many young girls who don't know better get sucked into thinking being a sugar baby isn't being a sex worker. 

a LOT of young girls go into it thinking they're just gonna cop lots of money and not have to put out, eventually get pressured to have sex and other things that they haven't properly thought over and decided where their boundaries lie, therefor crossing their boundaries before they even know what they are and doing serious psychological harm. yes, there ARE women who do this successfully. but notice that i say ""young girls"", not women. 

young girls look at sex workers, strippers, and sugar babies on instagram posting photos of holidays and louis vouiton bags and think ""wow, i want that!"", little do they know that those photos are just advertisement to other potential customers and not just showing off. but these young impressionable girls can't see through that and WANT to show off and that's all. these girls end up with nothing to show for themselves except a cupboard full of clothes and a drug addiction they can't afford unless they keep going. no deposit for an apartment, no funds for a start up business, no paid off uni degree. these are all things that you're MEANT to go into sex work for. first for survival if you have to, and then to work towards making a better life for yourself through properly managing finances. 

sorry for the long post, but it really upsets me that this is a trend i see. sex work is only for women who are mature and very smart. i'm glad it's becoming something that is more socially acceptable over time, but we need to make it clear to young women that this is not a job you aim to have. this is a job women go into when they have to, and when they're smart and strong enough to cope with it. "
"And another thing OP, you don't HAVE to tell then why you're leaving of you know they'll be assholes. "
Why are you staying in an unhappy sexless marriage? Move on. You two sound sexually incompatible and you sound checked out of your marriage. You can be good parents together without living together.
"Buddy, I don't know what to tell you because, to any outside viewer, it DOES sound like you loved your ex more, were attracted to her more, and generally had a far more intimate relationship with her. If I am thinking this after reading this post, then are you really surprised that your girlfriend is devastated? "
You can't control other people. You can only be supportive of your sister. Some things have to be figured out by themselves.
"Also OP, you do seem to have discussed a lot of things already, but it still sounds slightly like you are not seeing the key issue about libido incompatibility.

Libido incompatibility isn't the occasional- I don't want sex now, lets do it tomorrow instead. Incompatibility can be such that, once a week, you have sex and one of you is fully sated for a full week/month and does not have any urges in between at all. While the other has daily urges.

now THAT is libido incompatibility. Don't want to scare you, hopefully both of you will be in a happy balance and not at either extremes, but it is possible."
"She seems like a handful. It's good that your coworkers see that she's got a bad reputation and they told you to keep her at arms length. I think it shows that they know she's nuts and you're not, so I wouldn't worry too much, especially if you're focused on your work. Personally, I'd ignore her texts and Snapchat/whatever as much as possible, just don't respond. If she asks why you're ignoring her, tell her you're busy or you deleted the app. And don't pick up if she calls, especially outside of work hours. Chances are she's going to get fired soon anyway, and she'll be out of your hair then. Hang in there and respond to her in person as little as possible. "
"Maybe not but there are a few we unusual things. A 32 year old dating a 20 year old. A 35 year old living with his 23 year old girlfriend’s parents (why does he not have his own place). And 23 is really young to get engaged, which the older party should be aware of so I’m concerned he even proposed to someone so young."
"Well there you go, you have your answer.  
Now you tell her, and let the cards fall where they will.  
Remember you can only control yourself, not other people.  
And she has shown that she feels no need to control herself in regards to her relationship."

"My heart genuinely breaks for Joy.

You're right that her weight is probably a big issue. But perhaps the biggest issue right now is helping her out of her abusive situation.

It's tough to lose weight at the best of times - even worse when you're in an emotionally toxic environment. She DEFINITELY knows she needs to lose weight - she probably just doesn't love herself enough to do it. 

You're a good friend to be concerned. "
"I'm so sorry OP.  What a shitty situation.  I left my ex fiance 2 months before our wedding because he had become abusive.  It is so difficult to walk away from the life you had built together in reality, and the one you hoped to build in the future.  I had to grieve the life I thought we would have and needed counseling...but I came to realize that the life I thought we were building did not exist.  It didn't exist, because the man I thought he was did not exist.

I encourage you to ask the people who love you, for help. Don't be afraid to call someone up when you're having a hard day and ask to hang out, or for them to come over, etc.  Be vocal with what you need to those who you know will be there for you.  Let yourself feel the pain and anger and betrayal and mourning.  Feel it, acknowledge it, let it wash through you, and then take one step forward.  You CAN do this, and you will be successful!  Hugs."
"Jesus, can you imagine being *married* to someone like that?  

Maybe you have a little tiff over a car's oil you thought he changed and he thought you changed and now you've been driving without an oil change for three years and each person is frustrated with the other so he solves everything by disappearing without a word for four, five, six days, sulks, refusing to answer his phone....

"Website was down due to Christmas traffic.
Website checkout was buggy.
Watch wasn't in stock temporarily due to lots of Christmas gifts.
Shipping would have been late.
Other retailer had nicer gift wrapping.
She wanted to buy from a store rather than a website because she was worried the package would be damaged during transport.
She wanted to buy from a store rather than a website so she could check the watch beforehand.
She wanted to buy from a store rather than a website so you could exhange it if you changed your mind.
She wanted to buy from a store rather than a website because she worried someone would steal the package.

I can imagine half a dozen reasons she would have picked another retailer. It's weird you're jumping to the worst conclusion when asking her would be so much simpler.

Besides what does it matter? Now that you know it's counterfeit, you can just buy a new real one to replace it and you can return the counterfeit one."
"It is the context of the matter. If she does this shit all the time and expects him to drop everything then yes, i agree with you. But i am willing to bet that op would have mentioned that if she did. Instead it was a simple gesture where op could have easily gone back to the apartment. If i surprised my wife like that id be pissed if she kept trying to coax me to her friends house. I dont want to hang out with her friends, and i also woukdnt want to be put on speaker phone. 

I think op just had his head stuck in the sand. "

"Tbh, explain to your children that this explosion wasn't about them. This woman is sick, mentally, and clearly can't control herself. She's angry or jealous or whatever and taking it out on others.

"I have a lot of anxiety. It manifests in strange ways sometimes. For example, I sometimes build something up in my head, like a holiday event, vacation or piece of furniture, and then the reality lets me down so severely that I become incredibly negative about it. I'll have deep regret and entertain ridiculous, expensive 'solutions' for a while even though I recognize I'm being silly. This happens even when I make 100% of the decisions. It's because I nitpick the details and put too much emotional stock in it. I second guess myself. I worry that I made the wrong choice. I don't like it as much when I see it. I get sick of it. The thing I imagined doesn't translate to the reality. I have trouble letting it go. Whatever it is, it's a personality of flaw of mine I don't like and work to combat.

Your wife's refusal to move into the house, her willingness to lose an insane amount of money - this reads like me when I am Maximum Freakout Disappointed. It's an irrational impulse, one that shouldn't have to be indulged by you. But you can't just *tell* someone to be rational and expect that to work. That embitters people. They'll double down because they're hurt and offended at the characterization.

In this situation, here's what I think might work on me.

&gt; I understand you're disappointed in the house. We picked out every piece, but it's difficult to know how the pieces will look *together*. Is that what you're feeling right now, that all the choices we made don't look good together? That makes sense to me, but I also think it's possible that you'll get used to the look when you're living in it. It's a blank slate right now and it's hard to imagine what it'll look like furnished. I just want you to be *open* to the possibility that you could change your mind. I know I can't force you to like it, but I'd like to go into the situation open minded.

&gt; The problem as I see it is that we can't afford to sell this house without it taking a serious toll on our finances. Let me ask you, do you hate the house so much that you would be okay with forgoing x-amount? That's what I estimate we'll lose. It could set us back for a while. I'm worried about that because I enjoy our current lifestyle. If you are nervous about that loss, then I propose we give the house a chance for y-amount of time just to see if we adjust. You may end up loving it, I may end up hating it, but I think it's the fairest compromise.

Acknowledging feelings goes a long way.

But I want to throw out the possibility that others have said: it's not about the house. That's could be. Maybe she's in love with the current neighborhood and she doesn't want to leave it. Maybe you're having some marital problems. I don't know. You'll have to adapt your approach and ask questions. But this does seem to me like an anxiety spiral that's reaching insane heights of stubbornness in her and that's something that has to be delicately broached. "
"&gt; She knows how I feel about him and knows I don’t support the relationship, so I feel as if there’s nothing more I can say. 

Sounds like she has made her decision. If you do not want to support her and decline the maid of honor title (which is totally your choice and understandable) you need to be prepared for the friendship to be over. Most likely she will still marry him and nothing you say will change it and the decline might strain your relationship and the husband will definitely be saying a few things in her ear if you do that as she will be upset. So prepare for that incase it goes that direction. And if that is worth it to you then good luck!  If you do stay friends, I would suggest backing out of their relationship a bit, tell her its too much to hear about all the drama and relationship problems and you need to separate that from your friendship. My mom did that to her best friend, surprisingly worked but I cant guarantee! "
"She sent her friend a picture of her in bed with another guy, a picture so concerning *her friend brought it to you*, and you think you falsely accused her of cheating?

Oh, honey. I appreciate how much trust you have in her, but it's misplaced.

Look, at *best* she's going out of her way to fuck with you and 'make your jealous'. That's the best case scenario! The realistic one is that even if his penis didn't literally enter her vagina, she's treating this vacation as a vacation from her relationship.

She turned it around explosively on you to make you feel bad. She wants you to think you're the bad guy. She reacted so extremely to throw you off and put you on the defensive.

And man, it's been four months. Four! At this stage in your relationship everything should be rainbows and gumdrops. You should both be on your best behaviour. So either she doesn't care very much, *or this is the best version of her you will ever see*.

Cut your losses. This drama is out of control. She can ride vacation dick 24/7 for all you care; she's not worth the grief. Find a new partner who won't cheat on you the second they leave your zip code."
"That was brilliant of you. My mom refused to stop so I had a decoy journal and the other one hidden away. I'd have loved to have access to a password protected document to write things down back then, so that's a good viable option for OP."
I’d be happy to donate to other charities I just really liked this one :( I would make hats for specific people staying at the shelter becuse I knew them by name. It made the task really special for me. It’s just a bummer.

"Cats are like a living example of diminishing returns.  The harder you want it, the less you get it.  "
"This is what works. I was with someone for years and helped pay his mortgage thinking we were getting married. Nope. Dumped my ass and I got nothing.

Now I live with my boyfriend in his home. He pays his mortgage, insurance, property taxes, etc. I pay all of the utilities and most of the food. All utilities except for power are in my name, power is in both. But I pay all of the utilities, I don't give him any money. My share is also less, not significantly but it is less.

Don't charge your girlfriend rent. Have her pay the bills, giving her some responsibility. Charging her rent is not the way to make it work. It's your house, your mortgage. You shouldn't charge your girlfriend rent for sharing a room with you. 

Is she paying rent indirectly? Maybe. But she's not paying it to YOU and that makes a huge difference."
She knows he’s alive though. He keeps reading her messages with read receipts on and declining her calls.
"I agree. He's made his decision and refuses to talk, so I would start showing him I was making the decision to leave. "
"Definitely second the suggestion to watch Jackson Galaxy videos. The guy is quite a character but he's great at putting into words how to behave around cats to make them relaxed. I'm one of those people who always ended up with my friends' shy cats in my lap by the end of the evening and I was never able to explain to people how I acted to attract cats, I just did it. But JG is a great communicator."

"Her wanting to brush off your father's behavior and comments is saddening to hear.  That effectively enables your father to continue to do such things.  Even if he is just projecting his own self-image issues on to you, you are his child and he should realize how poorly his actions reflect on himself.  You can try talking to him about it and hopefully, it will cause the lightbulb in his head to turn on."
"Tbh it's pretty likely that she's just using that as an excuse to let you down easy. She knows you exist and that you're interested in her now-- if and when she wants to date you, she'll let you know. This isn't, like, a sales type situation where persistence pays off."
"&gt; I would wear it as a badge of honour

I think that depends on how much it's killing you inside, but

Totally agreed. That's not the right approach for him at all if he is feeling trapped or soul-crushed (or both) by his work."
"To be clear, raising four children under 10 is work."
"Only he can answer why, and the only way I can think of to handle this is to a) stop enabling him, and b) flat out ask him ""why are you asking me to help with chores which you never needed help with before?

"This is the epitome of why you have ""heard it all"" in regards to marrying so young. You put no forethought into this past not seeing him every day. I'm betting you two never sat down with pen and paper to see if you could afford this life style change. Outside of that, you need to be a functioning adult outside of your husband. You need to understand and be able to deal with the bills, as well as budgeting. ""Two halves of a whole"" mindset is setting yourself up for failure, and your marriage and life will be much more successful if both of you are involved in adulting."

oh yes, FOR SOME REASON. You're her EX, you have no right to ask her for anything. jesus mate. Stop being a creepy stalker before she calls the cops on you."
OP's wife has been out of the workforce for over a decade. She won't be able to go to the job store so easily.
Don't stay in a marriage with someone who doesn't trust you and you can't trust. The grief isn't worth it.
"My husband does this too!!  I called him on it once (“why do you always call me to stop what I’m doing to help you then while I stand there waiting for you to tell me what you need you’re usually in the middle of it anyway but say “wait just a minute” when I’m going back to what I was in the middle of doing?”) and he said half the time he just wants my company. It is so damn frustrating. I wish I had an easy answer for you. 

I usually say “when I’m done doing X I’ll come help” and don’t stop what I’m doing. "
Your neighbour would not mind at all.

"It's like the classic reddit relationship post. 

""My husband pronounces words really weirdly and it frustrates me. He also says incredibly misogynistic things, made me move away from my support network, won't let me get a job, fights with me over getting a job, disregards my needs and wants (ie, invited over his brother without running it by me), and is quite possibly trying to gaslight me and make me feel crazy, but all that's fine, it's the mispronouncings that are really bothering me.""

"Financial control is one of the key signals for an abusive relationship.

"I'm always amazed when I read about people on reddit who seem to have literally stepped out of a Dickens or Bronte novel.

I'm sorry, but your girlfriend is a horrible person. She is one of those women who considers herself to have an exclusive claim on 100% of your time, attention, and resources, and anything you give to someone else is a threat to her. If you were unfortunate enough to obtain guardianship of a child that isn't hers, she would become the wicked stepmother of legend.

This is what she's like. You decide what you want to do about that, but what you did for your ex was a decent, humane thing and you should absolutely not back down - not just because it was a decent, humane thing but because if you back down on this, you're telling your girlfriend exactly what it takes to get her way in the future whenever you act against her wishes."

Not... really? I can't relate to your girlfriend *at all* and I often have moments of low empathy that I'm not proud of. But even I can see that your girlfriend is being *beyond* cold-hearted and jealous here. For Christ's sake she's accusing you of putting a dead woman above her for choosing to help out the dead woman's orphaned child! That's not ""being detached from people she doesn't know or care about"", that's being downright insane.

I would advice you to stick to your guns. Don't take the donation back. Let your girlfriend escort herself out with this ultimatum, because someone who acts like this in a situation like this is not someone you'd want to spend the rest of your life with. Hell, someone who makes you cut contact with your ex who's also your close childhood friend isn't someone you want to spend the rest of your life with. Even back then I would have started to doubt the relationship if I were you."
"Had you taken her back, you would have strengthened the idea that she can come and go as she pleases and that she's free to do this shit to you any time she wants to.

"If you get an IUD, no matter what your doctor says *do not cease alternate birth control until your follow-up appointments!!!!!*

You need to seriously sit down with your wife and tell her that she can't throw a fit every time other people do something she doesn't like. My advice would be to have this discussion with your wife, go to NYE with your family, and invite your wife to join you if she feels like she can be polite.

The biggest red flag for me in this situation is that your wife is throwing a fit over something she simply doesn't agree with. It's not illegal for a 30 year old to date a 20 year old and it doesn't seem to be an unhealthy relationship. This age difference relationship is affecting your wife negatively for some reason that she needs to address within herself. "

I've seen comments on this subreddit about how people mean respect in two different ways. One is respecting them as equals and the other is respecting them as an authority.

"Same. My husband has made comments to the effect of how, if I were gone, he wouldn't want anyone else. I've got some health issues and while I don't think it's likely I'll pass first/early, it's definitely possible (I mean, I guess that's true for anyone). If it happened while we're young, I would not want him to spend the rest of his life alone. He's wonderful and he deserves to have someone in his life (he's the most loving partner, it would be such a waste not to share that). I can't bear the thought of him being alone forever. That would break my heart. I've teasingly told him, ""So you want me to feel like shit in the afterlife?"" But it's kind of true. I feel like my husband is the kind of person who needs a partner. I think he'd be very lonely on his own. I would hate that."
He clearly came here convinced on his viewpoint and just wants to get validation on it. 
"That's my plan. We bought the dog together, but fortunately he is legally mine (registered in my name), so he has no say there. It breaks my heart a little to keep them separated though, because my dog loves him so much. He sits and waits for him to come home from work every day. It's not going to be easy, but I know in my heart I won't be able to get over all of this if he comes home every now and again."
"If you get back together and continue down the path you were on before he blew it all up, will you be happy standing there on your wedding day opposite him? Can you trust that he won’t simply leave again next time his head is turned or that he’ll stay faithful if he has the opportunity to cheat? I don’t think you can unring that bell sadly. Maybe he’ll appreciate you more or maybe he’ll just be more confident he can risk chasing another chance that comes his way knowing if it comes to nothing you’ll be there waiting for him once again."
"Of course he's going to be closer to the people that raise him. If you want to be part of your kid's life, then you have to take part in raising him as well. He isn't automatically going to want a relationship with a stranger who people say is his ""dad"". "

It couldn't have been since I've never done anything like that but that's the whole crazy scenario on how it got brought up! "
Same deal with the flashbacks when I got older. That and panic attacks and anger. People don't realize how much abuse will affect children because it often takes years for it to fully affect them. 
"Yes, this. I will hole myself away from society if this is ever considered normal.

I'd want my wife to be proud to tell people that she's marrying me instead of being proud to show off how much money I spent on something pretty for her. I proposed using the same ring my dad had given my mom when he proposed. If it was required that I give her an upgrade years later, I would've just taken that ring back and told her to hit the bricks."
I don't think his issue is that you'd find someone else but it's the fact that you said you'd do it so quickly. Quickly moving on usually means you didn't have much of a connection or weren't that invested in the relationship in the first place even if he did cheat.
"My dad passed away after my parents had been married 30+ years. 

My mother had been his life. His world revolves around her and loving her was pretty much what his whole life was about. 

She’d been with him since she was 19 - he was her one true love and couldn’t imagine life without him. 

My mom ended up meeting a guy in her bereavement group that she started dating. Eventually he sold his house and moved in with her. 

They just celebrated their 10 year anniversary together. 

Both of them feel like their first spouse was each of their soulmate &amp; true love, but they also love each other and enjoy each other’s companionship. They’re best friends and they travel together and get to continue experiencing life in ways neither would have done if they’d stayed alone after their spouse died. 

Personally, I think my dad wouldn’t have liked my mom’s boyfriend. And when he was dying, it made him sad to think about her having a life with someone else. But he also loved her so much, that it hurt him to think of her being unhappy and alone. 

When I think back to her confiding in me that she would only eat her meals at home standing at the kitchen counter, because she couldn’t bare to sit at the table without my dad there, vs. seeing pictures of her traveling the world with her boyfriend, it makes me appreciate that life gives us an infinite capacity to love, even if it’s not as bright (or has a different glow) with different people. 
"
"I’m so sorry ):

I was in a similar situation. When he wouldn’t instigate sex or made comments about my weight or body, I felt so ugly.

 I ended up losing 20 lbs and actually getting plastic surgery because I felt horrible about myself. Guess what that did? It did increase his sex drive. It did make sex more incredible. But you know what didn’t change? His criticism towards me. His ‘attraction’ towards me. He would tell me he loved me, would have repeated sex with me, but would continue to stated he was not attracted to me. In other words, I was never going to be good enough. We lived together 3 years. I moved out 6 months ago and he still contacts me. 

There are certain people in this world that can never be pleased. 

Sooo... I suggest trying couples therapy in an attempt to try and salvage the relationship. If his attraction towards you doesn’t improve or he declines sex - I suggest separating. Although painful, you need to love yourself more. I would never wish the emotional trauma I went through on anyone.

"It's fair enough asking your parents not to smoke around your children, and not to reek of smoke around your children. But asking them to give up smoking if they want to see your children, i.e. using your children as bargaining chips to emotionally blackmail your parents to give up something you're not involved in, is insane. 

It's 100% your responsibility to care for your theoretical/future children's health but you don't have the authority to make decisions like that for your parents. You might want to work on this ""You will do what I say or we will not have a relationship"" attitude before you actually do have kids."

"She's crying, sending dramatic texts and drinking. It's not like she's breaking his property or slandering him to his boss. She's devastated and coping poorly - girl just had her heart broken.

I'm completely floored how little empathy 90% of the comments here have. Her real self esteem problem is, IMO, that she is staying with him at all at this point - but I suspect a big part of the hot-and-cold from her is that she is wrestling internally with whether to leave him. She's felt she loves him more and that he's closed off before and now she's learned not only did he lie to her, he lied about a woman he was able to achieve ALL of this with, that he can't and won't and doesn't want to with her."
"&gt;What's your plan for if you have mismatched libidos? Have you two discussed this?

&gt;We just believe in compromising and making an effort to get in the mood if our spouse wants sex at a time one of us doesn't

oh dear. You really don't get it. This is not like attending a movie or going for dinner when only one of you wants it. Sex - proper good loving sex - doesnt work that way, it requires both to be on board.



And a mismatched libido is not just ""now and then"", it's ALWAYS. Day after spirit-crushing day. "
"Seriously, thank you for saying it. 

From this update, it's pretty obvious OP's girlfriend has found some damning evidence that OP was in fact more attracted to his ex than he is to her. It's a shame that his ex used to detail everything so graphically. But him being all over his ex's large breasts and barely giving his girlfriend's smaller breasts any attention is a pretty hard thing to get over. Saying he's grown up and that's why he's no longer affectionate, for example, I find that hard to believe. He may no longer have time, but if he finds it so hard to express his love and affection to his girlfriend, it may just be that he's just not as emotionally invested in her as he was with his ex girlfriend.

I think even OP is in denial here, sadly. This entire post is him making excuses and being blind to it. 

I would also wonder why OP is OK with accepting a lifetime of not reaching an orgasm when he knows for a fact that he was able to with his ex. 

He also needs to come to terms with whether or not he really loves his girlfriend or if he's just settling. It's a pretty huge thing to ask a girl to accept less attention, affection and love (especially after she's expressed many times she requires it) and then to ask her to have sex with a man who may never have an orgasm with her?

So yeah. 110% couples counseling.

Is no one safe from outlandish and completely unwarranted opinions? Once she finishes alienating everyone, bear and far, watch out because you’ll be in for a ride."
"Your boyfriend and anyone worthwhile are very likely going to think that you are an amazingly strong person for defending yourself against an attack at such a young age. You have absolutely NOTHING to be embarrassed about. I know it's probably difficult to believe that and that's not what you were asking about, but I think it's ok to tell your boyfriend that you have a scar from a traumatic childhood incident that you don't feel ready to show him or talk about yet. If he can't respect that, he's not the person you deserve to be with. And do please talk to a professional about this - you need someone who can help you see that the trauma you survived isn't cause for shame. The only person who will look bad is the person who attacked a child. "
Give him back the old ipod maybe if you think that'll get him to shut up. He can sell it for like $10 haha
"Nah, that's not even close to $700 in damages. Slash some tires, too"
"I came from money and most of my best friends growing up came from poverty. If I didn’t pay for movies or dinners, I wouldn’t be able to have either unless I went by myself. The money was worth the company, memories, and friendship.

Yes, I absolutely got taken advantage of by some people in friendship and in dating, but I also had grateful people, people who paid me back (one friend came into inheritance), people who repaid me in other ways, and in my thirties I haven’t stopped sharing the wealth.

What else are you going to do with it, sit on it like a dragon? Not everyone worth knowing has money. In fact sometimes it seems the more material wealth one has the less they have to offer as they sit on that as the only thing they need to have."
"Bahahahaha. How old was he when you adopted him? If he was a kitten, you’ve replaced his mother figure. If he was older, he may have been neglected and is lapping up all of the attention you are willing to give him. He obviously loves the companionship, have you ever had another cat over to see his reaction to that?

My husband always tells me I turn male cats into huge mama’s boys. Although at the moment we have a mother and daughter foster pair, and the mother is super cuddly with me, but that could be because she’s reacting to my pregnancy hormones. "
"What?? Because Mark's wife deserves to know she's married to a lying, cheating, sack of crap! That's why!

OP, what you did was wrong, yes. The affair resulted in your beautiful daughter, and now you have a happy life, and you genuinely seem remorseful for the part you played in this whole thing; but you *did know* he was married and you continued to see him - I think in order to wipe the slate clean you should tell the wife"
"Im curious if this girl was ever a dancer/stripper ... 

I've known one or twenty 😂, and they had this mentality. 

"
"That’s exactly what everyone is saying. You can’t force her sexually, as you said it seems like it’s going nowhere."
"Honestly, this relationship is not ready for marriage. You're not wrong about Julie but you are both so young and you should not be taking such a huge step while he is prioritizing someone who is obviously into him above you or while you  both can't communicate better.

I don't have much advice to give about Julie, others already have but even if he does end his friendship with Julie I would suggest taking it slower. You're both still growing and changing and young couples VERY often grow apart not together. "
"And yet...

&gt;My husband and I would roll our eyes at his ridiculously self important, entitled and high horse fuckery. 

"
"Low market value? Ew, who even thinks like that in terms of people or relationships? 

Edit: not aiming this at acidicjew but at the people who started spouting about market value in response to the OP. What are you people all about??"
I never would but I know a few people who genuinely don’t care. That doesn’t make this situation less awkward though 
"That's why Im thinking of giving them a call, if this thing is going to blow, I prefer to do it now, before mom starts thinking she might see the kids again. "
If it is a nonprofit there has to be a board of directors. If it is operated by a faith organization there has to be a rabbi or pastor of some sort in charge.
Maybe she thought she got you one as well? Did she acknowledge it at all when they opened the gifts and you didn’t?
"&gt;I don't like to go out with him publicly to avoid wierd reactions so we usually just meet up in private. 

To me this is the biggest red flag. If you're uncomfortable being seen with your partner in public (not including issues like it being genuinely dangerous), then that should tell you something."

"Even for musicians that aren't just taking off, income is not super reliable. I have a friend who's in a pretty famous band and tours a LOT. There are years where he has almost 0 income because he's recording and not touring, and tours is how musicians make the majority of their money. His fiancée still works full time (at a job she loves), which helps them a lot during times when he doesn't have an income. 

OP, what's your boyfriend's plan for years when he doesn't go on tour and have the income from that? And if you don't work, what exactly are you supposed to do when he's gone?"
"To be honest, you could us the ex-boyfriend angle to bring up the police without making it sound like you suspect anyone.

Call a family meeting and explain, ""It was here and now it's gone. If one of you took it, or was messing with it and accidentally broke it or something, I need to know **now.** Otherwise, tomorrow I'm filing a police report and assuming someone stole it. I know Ex might want to get back at me, so I'm afraid that he snuck in and took it.""

The idea that an innocent person could be accused and have to endure a police investigation might be enough to shake something loose. You could still include the bit about ""if it's back in it's case by tomorrow, we'll let it go."""
I’m really confused by the comments accusing me of just wanting to start drama... my family is my first priority so I don’t wanna drag them into this. I’m not trying to stir things up for my own entertainment but I also somewhat think I have a moral obligation to tell her — especially if there’s a chance she may find out later through my daughter. It’s just hard because I know I’m projecting here; I may wanna be told but I really don’t know who his wife is and how she may react.
I agree with this! Sometimes being the messenger doesn't work out in your favour 
"Yeah she wanted a private visit and now she's embarrassed and feeling awkward. OP, you probably should have gotten the message when she said she was going home instead of walking five minutes. She's acting a bit silly but I get why. Just be extra nice to her and it will blow over (and next time read between the lines)!"
"Yeah. Like half the people that come on here essentially say ""Help! I don't *actually* like my SO but I'm not self aware enough to realize it or don't think I can find anyone better without significant effort."""
"This sentiment is what helped me walk away from two friendships in 2016 &amp; 17 that had become unhealthy, despite these people once being two of my closest friends (essentially family). One of them got mad after I walked away when they were behaving like OPs sister and using me as a verbal diary, saying ""you're going to throw away a ten year friendship just like that? It's so easy for you?"" And I said yes. Because in reality it had taken me eight months."
"Cannot stress this enough. This exact thing happened to a couple I knew. Less than a year later, they're divorcing, and she's getting the house while he has to pay for it. It's a mess..."
"You have EVERY right to be pissed.  I'm sure there's going to be a fair share of people out there that are of the camp ""love her for who she is"" but she is a liar.  That's a HUGE secret to keep from someone.  Now, I'm sure navigating life post-op isn't an easy task.  However, I believe if you're getting yourself involved with a person that you owe it to him or her to tell your origin.

I don't know how a person works past this.  If you can't work past it, that's more than fine."

"I really do hope he’s projecting some kind of financial or personal anxiety, even if it’s in a cruel way. But STEM circlejerk is real, and some people in some STEM fields really do get off on claiming that theirs is the only important profession. The former situation would require that you have a conversation and find him a better coping mechanism. The latter? You need a smarter husband."
"Just a small point a lot of replies (not just you!) seem to have missed, but it says clearly in the OP that she contributes equally to the household finances. She just says that his job *could* cover all of their expenses if it had to, not that it *does*.  And she's already making over $500/month from her Etsy shop side gig on top of her regular job."
I feel like you’re ignoring the assault part. And should probably get therapy for your extreme jealousy issues. 
Your future wife is going to end up on justnomil. She’s probably already there. 
"Your sisters are being silly. I married young and was widowed in my early 30s, and am about to marry again at 43. I did a significantly better job this time at picking, as I think is usually the case when you know who you are and what you want from life and have developed mature relationship skills."
"That's hilarious. Ma'am, this is the wedding police, put down that dress and come with us. "
"Shes not working for a charity though, shes working for a church. And if they're paying employees who don't even attend the church, then my guess is its a pretty big one. Sounds like he's feeling alienated by how comfortable she is there. "
Don't start relationships on a lie. Women are most interested in you being truthful than they are about how experienced you are.
It's probably equally frustrating to her that you don't seem to try to understand why she would want to be free with her body in such a way and instead focus on your desire to control her.
"Maybe she didn't think there was any issue in mentioning it, after all, there should be no reason why ex girlfriends can't be mentioned *in passing conversation*..."
"OP, your boyfriend clearly won't be taking the initiative to clean. Why should he, if he knows you'll just pick up after him if he doesn't?

Your boyfriend might support you emotionally. He may even love you. But love and support, while critically important, don't keep a household running. 

So you need to decide for yourself: are you okay with a relationship where you are doing 100% of the housework and working long hours? I really suggest an ultimatum- he does 100% of the housework (he's not employed, remember?) Or you two break up. 

There are two articles I want you to Google (no links on this sub). **The Politics of Housework**  and  **She Divorced Me Because I Left Dishes By the Sink.**  I think these will really open your eyes to the situation."
"&gt;I'd get another job but its sort of a touchy subject with Aaron and I don't want to fight about getting a job and then fight about why I want to.

Come to Reddit with your proof. We are a supportive bunch. 
"It is a huge problem that you’ve been railroaded into not even DISCUSSING getting a job for yourself. Both the manipulation of your feelings around that and the actual prevention part are very clear cut abusive behavior. Textbook, in fact."

"Not only trust your intuition, actually listen to it! You kept asking bc deep down you knew. You cant commit to him bc deep down you know he cant be trusted.

"So what are you expecting out of the advice you get here? We can’t tell you how to change your girlfriend. People have to want to change, and even then it is very hard. Either her personality is a deal breaker or it’s not. We don’t have some magic answer that will make her not a horrible person."

"&gt; Because I live my own life. ... He can cook his own dinner, eat it, clean up the dishes, watch some TV, and go to bed. If he wants to eat with me, call and see if I'll be home. 

This sounds more like roommates coming and going than a marriage. "
"So I counted, because I’m bored.  There was ONE comment that flat out agreed with you.  Three that sort of did, but only on the condition that he was ok with it (which he says he is, but I’ve been on the wrong end of a FWB situation where one wanted more.... he’s only ok with it because he thinks you will change your mind).  Let’s give those ones half a point in agreement, to be fair.  

So 2 &amp; 1/2 comments agree with you.  One is neutral, where she says that she was in a similar situation and it said the relationship 8s now platonic because it would never work.  I ignored one full thread because it was calling you a pedophile and not on topic.

That leaves 18 comments disagreeing with you.  And again, only one agreeing with you, really.  If you thought this was the right thing to do, you wouldn’t have to hide it.  So stop being selfish and thinking only about yourself and end this.  "
You move forward by telling her that you're resentful of her shit. That's the one and true way to do it. There's no way around it.
"Even though it was a mistake and wasn't his fault I think parenting classes would still be a good gesture. It will show that he's willing to take initiative to be an even better parent then he was before. I'm pretty sure every parent can benefit from those classes, not just the ""bad"" parents.

I agree that this would need to be done in conjunction with counseling. "
Human birth control pills?!?!  WTF?  That's insane!  I would freak out and break up!  She could have seriously made your dog ill!
I have told my wife.  I've told her all about the signals.  My wife doesn't recognise them as interest.  My wife's friend has brainwashed my wife into thinking that she is not attracted to me at all.
"Agree, I would recommend working it out slowly. Experiencing and discovering together what the other side likes and dislikes. Taking their time. And probably don't have regular sex for the next days. Instead try to get used to being naked together, maybe masturbating together, touching and feeling each other.

Not just getting rid of their clothes, getting done with the business and dressing up again."
"Wow, sounds amazing. Marry him. "
Yeah both are pretty  in the wrong here. They are not gonna make it to the wedding at this rate and that might be for the best.
"&gt;Or perhaps a more intricate nut and cheese based dish.

Yeah, maybe they could get a nut and cheese recipe book, or go to a nut and cheese restaurant together?"
Actually in Islam you're meant to respect the law of the land you live in. Therefore multiple wives are not allowed if the country you live in forbids it. My mosque will not marry anyone unless they've been legally married to stop any men having multiple wives

"Oh honey, it's alright. I know in college things like that can seem upsetting but your crush seemed very gentle in letting you down which implies the incident didn't ruin your friendship. If you're very uncomfortable you can speak with her in private and stress you don't want to jeopardize your friendship and admit you misunderstood her comment. If she really is your best friend, I'm sure she'll be understanding.

(Also you're 16- you've got half a century left and love is very much changing. I wouldn't be surprised if this is just puppy love and being rejected at 16 isn't the end of the world.)"
"Exactly this. Invite the guy, don't worry about making any changes.

Even normal sounding people, when around loud music, can step away/outside to have a conversation."
She actually met this man in person. She will start a physical relationship if she hasn’t already. Do you have a way to contact him? 
"Thank you, this comment means a lot. I'm feeling a little regretful but I'm pretty sure I made the right choice as well. "

"&gt;  I told him that I want to be 100 percent honest with who I am 

You're YOU! That's all anyone needs to know about you. It’s part of your history and the fact that he chose to use it as a weapon against you says a lot more about his lack of quality than it does about you and the person you’ve become.

Call a counselor now, block the jerk, and get back on your progress. You'll be fine, you don't need anyone's approval to be yourself."
"&gt;Phoebe just laughed and said, “That’s what you get when you hang out with us! More than what you bargained for!”

This is the point when you say ""I'm so sick of it I'm done with your disrespect.  I don't care that you enjoy it.  I've repeatedly told you I don't.  Fuck off.""  You can leave out the ending bit, but really, why bother? These people suck."

Being bisexual isn’t the end of the world. Cheating was your bad though.
"Relationships need to have clearly defined boundaries of what you are and are not ok with- these boundaries need to be vocalized, as your partner has no way of knowing where you draw the line. However, it sounds like you yourself are unsure of where those boundaries lie- touching is a part of dancing. It is pretty standard to put a hand on a lower back, even for something totally vanilla like ballroom dancing. If you aren't ok with that kind of touching, you aren't ok with her dancing with other guys. Maybe there is a deeper issue here?"
"&gt;This is the same thing that happened during dads surgery: I'm on the front lines, alone, again. Maybe take a minute to think this is the second grandparent I've buried in the past couple of years. I can't do this, I can't be strong and do what is required of me if you are causing shit. I can't. I know you're stressed with work, this is a difficult time. I'm trying not to cry because I'm missing a mandatory co-op event that if I don't get special permission my entire degree plan is fucked

So you've let your sister down before and now you're ignoring her resentment about that and any current pain and suffering she has, and you're acting like you're the only family member who has any life stress to deal with and your story is the most important one here?

Sorry, you are drama, your sister is drama, your dad is drama. Seems to run in the family. You all seem equally to blame.

Funerals and loss suck. No one enjoys funerals. They mean doing a lot of stuff that is terrible and hard. You think your stress makes you special and you can opt out of all the difficulty and leave your sister and your dad holding the bag. I can't agree. You want to sulk around at your mom's rather than be with your other family, helping greet people, arranging for food, making things go easier for your dad and his siblings? No way. Stop being selfish. You need to sack up."
"&gt; ""making it into such a big deal""

He's still young, so I'll let this slide for now... but this quote right here, is being dismissive of your feelings. No wonder you're still upset - he's apologized verbally, but you're not feeling that emotionally. You're making it into a big deal because *for you* it is a big deal. It's called having feelings - he needs to analyze this situation with *your* feelings in mind, not his own. He can't truly know how sorry he is if he doesn't empathize with just how much his actions have hurt you. To me, it sounds like he hasn't made that realization yet completely."

"This is not healthy. It’s not getting better, you’ve just accepted it as normal. You’re absolutely being taken advantage of. This is abusive and sad. Marriage does not fix relationships. Marriage is something that people in happy loving relationships do. 

Please leave. You deserve better. "
"It's pretty obvious, you've already touched on this, that your MIL has some type of mental illness.  Of course she needs help, but at this point I think it's more important for you, as a couple, to get marriage counseling and for your husband to attend individual counseling.  He grew up with her behavior as his normal and needs to realize that he can't expect you, and soon your children, to tolerate her behavior.

And herein lies the deal breaker;  she will start treating your children the same way.  Trying to make them feel guilty about seeing your side of the family and adding stress to their lives.  This is a hill to die on.

I would have a talk with your husband about going to counseling, you taking a break from his mother and setting boundaries for continuing a relationship with her.  

As another commenter said, I think you would find /r/justnomil helpful for advice and to read some of the experiences of the members there.  People like your MIL can have mental health crises that have a lasting effect on their families if they don't receive help and clear boundaries."
This. This. This. Save her the time she's wasting on this relationship with such a gross guy. 
That's the one that popped into my mind too. The one who carried poisonous cookies in her purse for a whole year just waiting for a moment alone to slip it to her granddaughter. OP font let this be your daughter again.
"If she can't keep fluids down and is showing signs of dehydration, she probably needs to go to the ER so they can monitor. Vomiting usually doesn't kill people, but I imagine dehydration caused by a week-long vomiting session could.

Also, don't want to be that person, but... Are you sure she's not pregnant?"
Is she incredibly overweight? How do you not notice this?
"I think you should make it a goal to move away from your mom. She doesn't seem like a healthy person to have in your life and you shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. She doesn't seem to respect you at all, even though you're her caregiver."
"Do you think you can't report a crime to the police if there's any possible alternative explanation for how it happened?
"
"As everyone else has said there is more to this than canned beans. The communication between the two of you isn't working, and yes that is partially on her, but in the meantime there is a lot that you can do...you can't control what she does. 

&gt;I said I'd get the green beans tomorrow, and she insisted she needed then right away to work on the casserole.

You saw your wife was extremely upset, why not just go and get them? Or offer to take the casserole off her hands? One thing that makes relationships miserable is when if one person is angry, or upset, or stressed the other automatically mirrors that emotion. It leads to a lack of support and closes down communication. 

&gt;I know I could have gone right away, but I was at work all day, and she has the holidays off, so how is it fair that I have to go back out in the cold?

Given you took days off to salvage the situation and still had to make do with premade stuff it sounds like she had a hell of a lot of work on her hands. Never get into a competition about who works more or who has more stress. Someone is going to end up feeling belittled. If you feel like responsibilities are unevenly distributed then work out a draft plan of who will do what, when. Then talk it over and agree.

&gt;Basically she was going to punish my sick mother over an argument with me.

I like to think I'm a pretty calm person but this level of guilt tripping / emotional blackmail would cause me to shut down. We're talking about food for *your* mom here, she didn't hide her medication. 

&gt;I know that kind of upset my mom, especially when some of the relatives made comments.

People criticizing free food can take a hike. Not your wife's fault.

&gt;And then, the next day we go to her family's Christmas and she brought homemade cookies and sentimental presents and things, and it felt like a jab at my family.

You chose your family's gifts. I don't understand how you can blame her if they looked inferior to her family's gifts. 

Like I said, I'm not saying her behavior was perfect but there is a LOT for you to work on. And forget the idea that she ruined Christmas. You had an argument to which you both contributed, and if you feel like Christmas was ruined then it was well within your power to prevent. Take the opportunity to learn from it.

And cheese is great aged!
"Yes, if I joke about my own deficiencies, it's an opportunity for you to be more relaxed around me or do the same for yourself, not an opportunity for you to jump on my back by doing the same."
"He's a school teacher who loves his job, and you want to leave him because he doesn't make enough money doing his very important, critical to society job.

That's extremely shallow, but he's probably better off if you did break up."
"Your Dad: ""I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to come with you, and that's the way it is.""

You: ""I'm sorry, Dad, but that doesn't work for me.  Have a happy New Year, I'll talk to you when we get back!""

If you seem like you're asking or giving room for him to demand you ask for permission, that's what's going to happen.  Don't treat this as something that's even remotely up for debate, and if he tries to make a debate out of it, you change the subject, leave, or suddenly remember that you've got something on the stove and disengage.

If you give him any opening to take control, he will do so.

Or, if you think this approach might work:

""You spent eighteen years raising me into a self-confident, responsible young woman who can take care of and make informed choices for herself, her relationships, and her future.  That's exactly what I'm doing. I'm not asking or looking for your permission, and this isn't up for discussion.""

If he tries to engage, it's just ""This isn't up for discussion."" and nothing else."
"I would feel so cheated! And sounds like he mislead this whole trip. I can only imagine how frustrated you are, but I honestly don’t think it will get better.  When he visits and stays with you are you happy? What is the ‘weirdness’ his parents gave with you? "
I have never been “negatively surprised” by cum...you seem to have weird ideas of what happens when people to *can* cum have sex. 
He doesn't respect you at all and only plays nice so long as things go his way. That's not nearly perfect. 
"^^this. Definitely this. 

But keep in mind he is going to get MAD. Trust me. My fiancée did a very similar thing to me as well. It pissed me off to no end. If we are in love, why should it matter what I look like? But it does. And after I calmed down I figured that out and I’ve been doing my best to get there. It’s been slow going but I am getting there. 

So just a heads up on that. "
"""I have already budgeted for my skincare routine both in terms of how I choose to spend my time and my money. Given the numerous benefits, it's also an investment into myself. What exactly is bothering you? If you have a separate issue and this is what you're nitpicking instead, we should discuss the root issue. Also would you like to try my routine?"" Maybe he literally has no idea that it's just face wash and a mask followed by cream. He might enjoy it. "
"I have no idea about the divorce. They have always told me that they loved each other but didn't work well as a couple. 

He asks for pictures a lot. He constantly asks me if my mom will have any more after this. He has asked me how long it took for my mom to conceive (as if I would know or would ask her). He also wants constant updates on how she's doing. Not things like she has a doctors appointment but stuff like did she have morning sickness today, did she feel the baby kick today, is she using stretch mark creams, if she has developed a pregnancy waddle yet, etc. He wants to know every single part of her day and every thing she feels. 

Maybe that stuff is normal, but it seems weird to me. 

Yes. My mom has a boyfriend.

Thanks. I will try telling him something like that. "
"Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and I'm gonna be downvoted to oblivion but I'm okay with that because you need to hear this:

/u/Quark19 OP, I don't believe it's a good thing that you are being passive. Let me explain why:

&gt; When we went out the first time I told her I was too scared to hold her hand or kiss her and she told me she knew already.

From reading this I suspect you may have low self-efficacy (self-efficacy is a core part of self-esteem). Essentially, I suspect you have low self-confidence in yourself to do the things you want/need to do, say the things you want/need to say, etc..

&gt; I’m shy and soft spoken, so ***she sometimes tells the waiter what I want at restaurants and asks where something is in a store for me.***

It's perfectly 100% fine to be shy and soft spoken however I believe if it's gotten to a point where you need someone's assistance to tell the waiter what you want or ask a clerk in a store for help, it becomes a problem that will snowball.

&gt; Is something wrong with me? I really like our relationship the way it is, but I can't tell if I shouldn't be acting like this because I'm a guy.

This has absolutely nothing to do with being a guy or masculinity, that I can guarantee you. I strongly believe, from those two points above alone, that you have low self-efficacy and that you should be proactive in increasing it for future situations where your girlfriend (or anyone else for that matter) is not around to assist you."
"By this point you’ve probably realized that you have a lot to learn about strollers and car seats.  

Graco is a budget brand.  Their “premium” one (did u get the graco 4ever convertible?  Or a click connect seat?) still feels cheap.  Regardless, it is just as safe as any other car seat that meets safety standards.  

I personally have a graco 4ever convertible car seat, as well as a peg perego car seat + stroller combo.  We currently use the peg perego car seat because it easily connects to the stroller.  However, sooner or later my baby will outgrow the infant car seat.  When that happens, i’ll swap to the graco one.  

I would keep both."
"I'm currently in this boat with my 33 y/o husband. We've had a dead bedroom for over three years and it all started with his hygiene issues and has extrapolated due to other issues. I have tried time and time again to speak about his hygiene issues, but any time I try, he goes into a panic attack (he suffers from anxiety) and self-loathes. It's a nightmare. And nothing ever changes.

You are not his mother. You cannot teach a 27 y/o grown man to improve his hygiene, and it is not your job to do so. The situation will not improve unless he wants it to.

If I could recommend one thing, it would be to leave now. This will only become a bigger issue, and trust me, the last thing you want or need is a dead bedroom. You don't deserve that."
"Mutual masturbation is what I was intending to suggest. It’s a thing people do. She had no complaints because she thought there wasn’t anything you could do about it, and now she thinks otherwise. Also: does she even know you can cum alone? 

I find it interesting that you say her orgasm is your favorite part of sex. How would you feel if the tables were turned? Imagine dating a girl who said that she was incapable of cumming by any means. Imagine that you decided to accept that one of the most satisfying parts of sex was forever off the table. And then a year later, you discovered that your girlfriend WAS capable of cumming, just not with you. Imagine that she even had an ex-boyfriend who fetishized her cum. Wouldn’t it sting? 

I’m not trying to defend her behavior, only help you try to understand it. She is definitely overreacting. My impression based on how you describe her is that she stifles her feelings until they explode. "
"&gt; Maybe she just wants a good whinge.

But its been a month tho..."
If you want to be treated as an ATM for the rest of your life then go ahead.
"My inner conspiracy theorist is all ""This is a set-up between the husband and the brother so husband can finally get rid of OP since she didn't take the hints in the past"" which in a sick way kinda makes sense."
If you haven't tasted cum and you have only cum with one girl don't act like a cum expert. You are clearly inexperienced in that regard- no offense. Women like witnessing the male orgasm and they like cum. 
"This is a sign of things to come.  He has threatened you and said nasty things to you over a hair color.  Please, just break up with him and don't even see him this weekend.  This is not how you deserve to be treated. "
"&gt; every night she wants me to come home from work, spend time with her watching some shit tv and then go sleep and repeat. Every weekend she wants to do some stuff or see her family

Oh, poor you. She spends all of her time taking care of this baby and you get mad because she wants you to COME HOME after work and then go with her to see her family on weekends! Good lord, what did you think fatherhood and having a family would be like? 

Look, eventually there will be time for the gym and all of that old hobby stuff - not nearly as much, but everyone once in awhile. But the reality is that when a new baby comes, there really ISN'T time for that kind of stuff, not really. You are going to have to decide if you are mature enough to put yourself on the back burner for awhile and focus on your kid and your wife and getting through these tough first few months or if you honestly can't and be upfront about it so that your wife isn't dealing with a young child and a checked out husband who pretends he wants to be there and involved and then who flakes out and never comes home. That will just damage your relationship even further and make both of you miserable in the long run."
"I just keep feeling like if I just explain it one more time she'll realize that I really didn't mean anything, but then sometimes I think I just make things worse by continuing to talk about it. However, if she didn't make the passive-aggressive comments then probably I would have dropped the issue by now. "
"Well be sure you make yourself mentally prepared for the texts in 2-3 weeks when it's not all sex parties and getting laid. 

He will come back for some no strings attached fun when he realises that having a 10+ year relationship is actually a hell of a lot more attractive a prospect than having to go in to the dating pool again."
"This is absolutely perfect. If OP still doesn't understand the fact that he couldn't work out gifts or cooking himself should illustrate how little he has done to help his poor wife. If he *still* doesn't get it. There's a great article called ""you should have asked"" and another ""my wife divorced me because I left my dishes by the sink"". 

OP you muppet. "
"Seriously. Every post of hers until this point has given an impression of him as unmotivated and lazy. The type of guy who just puts his time for minimum wage (a term she actually used) and doesn't care to work for something better.

But this guy has chosen to dedicate his time to the education of children. Not a lazy man, but one who has sacrificed potential income to do something arguably more important. Seems like OP is neglecting to mention some things to make this decision easier on herself."
"You treated the woman from work like a side piece.  You're concentrating on how to get her back there.

Let's put this another way.  You treated her like trash for six months, and are asking how to make her not be upset.  Maybe you should ask different questions?"
You don’t have to have a name at the hospital. You can name him a week later if you want to wait and see what “feels” like his name. I’ve heard of many people who figure out the name after the birth. 
"But also another stressor that can knock you off it.

 So stay bloody strong."
"The girl was awful to you, dont get me wrong, and I think you got to end things with her and stay single until you find a girl who loves and values you. You are coming off as egotistical in this post and your comments those so perhaps think of that as something you could work on. Saying you have no flaws other than being trusting? Its unhealthy to see yourself as a perfect human being just as its unhealthy to see yourself as a worthlwss human being. Be proud of who you are and what youce accomplished, you've earned it. But stay humble. These girls you encounter that are unfaithful and are after your money rather than your heart could be a byproduct of how you present yourself. Girls like this are attracted to guys like you. A lot of girls that I know (myself included) are attracted to guys who are humble and selfless without needing to broadcast it to every one. Her cheating on you is 100% not your fault. But maybe consider your own ego and potential shortcomings as well when you consider dating someome new."
"This isn’t about preferences. If she had said “OP, I am so happy you proposed but I’m more into simple bands/rose gold/sapphires/whatever. Could we return this and choose a ring together?” this would be a whole different conversation. What his girlfriend did was tell him that he doesn’t love her or value her enough, she’s in this relationship a reasonable amount for the money, and that she has absurd expectations about money/marriage/him. An engagement ring is a symbol of love. A symbol of starting a life together. Some couples don’t even do engagement rings. She should be thankful she got one. Her boyfriend worked and sacrificed to give her something to show his love and how much he wants to spend his life with her. She doesn’t seem to be appreciative of that. "
"don't call your friend again until you've been stable for a good while (like 6 months. seriously). perhaps when you're feeling better you can seek to rebuild your friendship with this person but until you are well you must leave them all alone and focus on your health. 

when you start therapy tell them about this event, it will help them treat you. and for you - remind yourself what this even has cost you if you feel yourself slipping (or you're told you are). it might help you stick to your treatment regime."
This is the correct answer. You blew it when you said no to hanging out on new years. 
"I don't get the gray hate, either!  I like colors, but gray is one of my favorites - it's calming, and it matches with everything."
"If you don't live at home, how often do you really interact with your grandma?


yes, her behavior sucks, but clearly, your mom, and uncle would rather nothing changes. 


All you can do is create and respect your own boundaries.  Please consider going to therapy to work out your own issues and ensure you don't emulate your mom's behavior as you get older"

"&gt;Not only was she not enough of an adult to talk to you about her issue with you directly and had her mom do it for her instead

To be honest, it seems like she's not even adult enough to get married if she's going to react like that to her cousin wearing a pretty dress to her wedding. 

I'm seriously wondering if her new husband is worried for his future with her after seeing her lose her mind for such a petty reason."
Bridesmaids dresses are pretty much the only option for formal wear if you don't live in a huge city as well.
"He believed her because it was his own sister. Unless she had a history of lying or manipulation, it makes sense that he believed her. "
"&gt; I was the one that pursued him, bet that changes your tune?

No... not really. I had crushes on my teachers all the time when I was in high school, doesn't mean any of em tried to date me. It remains as creepy as before you wrote the bullet points. "
"Eh, people usually aren't so flawlessly sociopathic that they can trick their loved ones into thinking they are completely trustworthy and normal and then do something totally over the top like this.  His sister did a crazy thing- she's probably shown evidence of unreliability in the past."
It almost reads like she's the one who wrote the post. It's really hard to believe someone out there can willingly put all the blame and ascribe all negative qualities on themselves and none on the other person.
"Ok, well given you understand the problem - what’s worked in the past when you wanted to change a behaviour? What helped you to stop doing something you didn’t want to do?

(NB: I am on purpose not giving you advice here - you already know how to change your behaviour. I’m just helping you remember.)

Often when people are struggling with difficult behaviour, slowing down and taking deep breaths can really help you be conscious of your choices. "
"I have a friend who has a ring worth upwards of 15k (she won't admit how much it's worth, could easily be more), and she hates it. Never wears it, too much of a liability. Her husband's family is loaded though, and it would have been ""unseemly"" to give her anything less in their culture. OP's GF is crazy. "
"&gt; Since she's allergic, she can't participate in the cleaning.

Lol no, that's not how it works. Ask her what would happen if she lived alone. She can't just demand other people to accommodate her. This is her issue and it's her responsibility. She can either do the dusting herself, pay a cleaning company to do it, or move out."
"Some men genuinely believe that women are childlike creatures to be manipulated without guilt. I don't go around saying that's ""man thoughts 101"" lol. "
"You’ll have more birthdays, hopefully many more, and a spelling bee? Seriously, you’re being petty. You can’t be mad at him for not coming to your “important events” and say you don’t want to go to his because you’re not close. He’s your brother, this is a life changing event that won’t be replicated. I’d wonder wtf I did wrong if you were my daughter. "
"""We're not going to use that at first though, she comes from a family of 7 siblings and she really wants to be a mom and have babies while she's still young.""

Frankly, I think this is a bigger concern than waiting until marriage to have sex. By jumping right in to the baby business, you're not giving yourselves time to work out any concerns and incompatibilities that are causing problems between you. I'm the father of two myself, I love my kids to death, but once you have kids then your relationship will be the kids, any issues you had before the babies are not going to be resolved after them. "
"Yeah, the communication here is a big thing. He says ""it's fine"" but he acts like a baby until there's a change made. He doesn't seem to know how to use his words yet.

He's still young so this could change, but not without a lot of work. Personally, I wouldn't be down to deal with that sort of reaction from a grown adult."
"From what you’ve written, your FIL may have changed his mind about pharmaceuticals. He may see how much they help you, and realize that they can be a really good thing. I think, like you said, the only issue would be if your FIL was disrespectful and your husband didn’t stick up for you, which doesn’t sound like what happened. 

It sucks that you feel out of control, but I don’t think this is as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be. Your husband needs to be able to have a support network, and for them to be able to support him, they have to know what’s going on. Maybe he could look into getting a therapist to talk to? So he could have additional support without the repercussions of his family knowing sensitive information about you. "
"I think this is the answer. I call my parents once every two or three weeks, but I've known plenty of normal adults who speak to their parents more often. I recently dated someone who saw his family weekly and they would talk daily in the family group chat, which consisted of his parents, his siblings, and the siblings SOs. It's just different. I was always a little jealous of his super close family, actually. "
That's awesome! I'm glad you got away from the addict &amp; found someone who treats you good. I want to do that too. Maybe my little heart can try with someone again sometime. 
"That's great advice! I volunteer for a crisis hotline, which I love doing for my community, but it can be very draining at times. The simple thought of men is exhausting. I am not going to even think about another man for a long time."
"I lived with similar issues and I blindly kept thinking that talking would fix it...  it doesn't. If this person is willing/able to lie like this to get sympathy and sex from a stranger... there isn't much you can talk through. 

I am so sorry you are going through this. I have been the one reading outrageous statements like this and they are kicks to your gut... but the worse pain is down the road if you give him another chance and he does it again (or something similar) the realization that not ending it at the first instance was extremely disrespectful to yourself (I tried talking through my ex doing remarkably similar things way too many times)... I know that is an if statement ..""if he does it again"", but can you really ever trust him again? In hindsight, I was lying to myself when I said I could get past the first instance...

Best of luck!"
"How old is your child? Is he having trouble adjusting to being a parent? Is he getting enough sleep? Is his work being especially stressful? Did y'all just juggle holidays and family with a new baby?

I'm not in ANY way trying to excuse or justify what he did. He was absolutely out of line. But if it's as out of character as you say, then there might be more factors to consider. 

I think some couple's counseling might be in order. I get a sense that it really might be a one-off incident that can be prevented in the future if addressed immediately. I really hope so, anyway. 

Your feelings are totally understandable. He scared the hell out of you! So if you aren't comfortable trying to repair this, I think that's okay, too. "
"That’s true, but it ultimately does not change what she’s doing, which is disrespecting OP’s reasonable boundary. "
"If he discovered something new, why wait until it's new Year's Eve, down on one knee in front of friends, and mouth open before deciding to break off and run? Unless he planned to humiliate her in front of close friends, which is another level of shitty, the only reasonable explanation is last minute cold feet followed by avoiding the issue like a child because he isn't man enough too break up with her officially."
I've seen someone who worked in a pawn shop for a living be fooled by a counterfeit Chanel bag.
"Look, if he is turning you down for sex and electing to masturbate instead like immediately afterwards, you are never going to have a fulfilling sex life with this person. He's so broken that he doesn't see how weird and upsetting that is for you and if he does, he simply doesn't care. You deserve better."
"Was New Year's Eve a rare drinking night for you? Alcohol can mess with sleep patterns.

I know this situation seems bizarre and like it may never happen again, but your description made me feel a little scared for you- taking punching blows to the head isn't exactly safe. I think you should want this looked into as well."
"Fact is unless you found someone 40+ down to late 30s people are gonna talk. That he happens to be younger than your son means people are gonna talk MORE. Plus you  two used to work together. Work gossip is always the juiciest. 

Heres how I look at it, the people who really know you don't care so neither should you. Your coworkers can go stuff it. "
"That makes a lot of sense and actually gives me a bit of relief. It wasn’t about her; it was about her attention giving him validation and he didn’t want to risk losing that extra validation for a wild card (me). He idealizes her because she got all the lead roles in school and all his friends wanted her... that kind of long standing devotion/social brainwashing isn’t gunna be easy to shake.

When I pretend that he’s 23 or 24, it makes more sense. He isn’t emotionally mature and I was judging all of his actions as if he were. That’s my problem. If he was mature, strong, and confident, he would have no problem drawing boundaries with a friend to support a new relationship. He doesn’t really respect himself when it comes to her, so I couldn’t truly respect him either. "
"I suspect this goes deeper than just the gifts, based on what you've shared. Do I understand correctly that if you had wanted to study something more ""legitimate"" than art, your parents would have offered to assist with financing your education? 

I hate to say it, but it sounds like with the exception of your dad, they just don't respect you at all. They see this as just another consequence of the behavior of yours that they perceive as ""selfish."" You decided to pursue a ""useless"" career which isn't known for it's earning potential, and as a result your parents left you hanging financially, which means that your earnings from work all go towards your survival and paying for school. I'm sure in the twisted minds of your siblings and mom, if you had just gone for a more ""reasonable"" education, they could have payed for it and you could have used your earnings to buy everyone big, expensive gifts. 

I'd also wager that just simply because you and your siblings grew up well off that they're spoiled and don't know how to handle cheap gifts and don't understand the notion that a gift can be meaningful without being pricey.

They've made it clear they want nothing to do with you, so I'd take their hint. Stay in contact with your Dad, who sounds lovely. Next year they can't whine when they don't get anything from you at all. Why would you ever do anything again for people who've made it clear they only care about you as long as your making it worth their while financially?"

"I'm sorry, but this is a huge red flag for me. Not only is it weirdly favoritist, but potentially sexist, and definitely feels more so when seeing his reaction to your warranted concern that he's using your body to get what he wants, which is kind of a childish want btw. He needs to find a girl that's just as sexually biased as he is, and you can find someone who is capable of loving children of both genders and respects your risking your life to give birth."

You should see about getting the ring re-set into something you'd like...maybe having the jeweler remove the stone(s) - and possibly cut it into the shape you like - and place it in a setting you would actually wear.
"&gt; I'd be questioning whether he was having an affair or if he was doing drugs

Yeah, I hate to say that this is immediately where my mind jumped to - what was so different about these circumstances that prevented him bringing the kid along when he has done before? The only 'defence' against it is that he stupidly, STUPIDLY assumed that the baby was grown up enough to be left alone for half an hour which reeks of dangerous incompetence.

"I totally get where you are coming from but other commenters have highlighted pretty key points. Although it does sound like they are going far above and beyond with their PDA even for a liberal group.

I think the real problem is that on some level, you feel you've lost your friend. Have you guys spent any time together just the two of you since they began their relationship? I think this is what you need to work on - getting your friendship back. Ask her to meet just the two of you, that you miss hanging out and would like to have the odd ""friend date"" for old times sake. Say that you feel you've not had a proper conversation in ages. I would avoid attacking / speaking negatively about the girlfriend as that could backfire massively. Make it about you and Josie.

There's also a chance that pheobe feels threatened by you so maybe trying to build a relationship back up with her separately again too - after all, you did strike up a friendship with her first."
"&gt;Other than this, our relationship has been wonderful.

"What the fuck!

Like, I know people do shit like this, I've had a similar experience with an ex just up and moving out one day after 5 years because he was too cowardly to just tell me he'd been cheating and had gotten the side chick pregnant. Instead, he literally made the people helping him move out basically break up with me for him while he refused to make eye contact the whole time. He also tried to take pets (and game consoles, etc) that weren't his, like he honestly thought I would just roll over and let him take pets that I'd had well before I'd even met him and rob me on top of leaving me high and dry with our lease, draining our joint account, and not even having the nerve to look me in the eye once.

But still, it's just so fucking mindblowing to me that people DO this shit. I hear so many similar stories on this sub, and every single time I'm just stunned at the utter cruelty and cowardice that's necessary to do this to your partner.

Like, I felt kind of bad for taking a couple days to tell the guy I spent NYE with that I was really put off by something he did that night and wasn't really interested in seeing him again, and we've only been seeing each other for like 4 weeks! So I just can't imagine being so up my own butt that I could just dip out on someone I shared a lease, pets, etc... a whole life with, just because I didn't want to experience the discomfort of breaking up and instead decided to force the person I'd supposedly loved to take on all that discomfort and MORE because of my callousness.

Ugh, sorry. This post and this thread are making me so angry for everyone who has experienced something similar :/"
"You need marital counselling because you are going to extreme lengths to make this something your wife has maliciously done. Get your shit together and talk calmly to your wife. She probably has zero idea this watch is a fake. 

You should also think about what your ridiculous reaction to a mistake on her part (that she doesn’t even know about, no less!!) says about you as a person. You seem like you have a lot of resentment built up toward your wife so maybe there’s some underlying issue in your relationship. That’s literally the only rationalization I have for how much you are blowing this out of proportion.

I hope she can return the watch and get something nice for herself instead. Jesus"
"Don't forget to take time for YOU, too, OP.

I'm not a parent so I can't imagine how traumatic it would be to witness a video in which my children are being abused and other able-bodied adults are doing nothing to protect them while they cry in terror. Help your kids, but help you, too. You can't light yourself on fire to keep them warm.

Imagine if that was you, and your own child was ecstatic to know that you wouldn't be living there anymore.

Go to him and apologize, sincerely. I don't blame him for being quiet, you really hurt his feelings."
"What about this situation says “subtle” to you?

“Hospital” “Ectopic pregnancy” “surgery” “blood transfusion” shouldn’t need to be translated into “this is a fucking emergency.” OP’s boyfriend is, presumably, an adult who can read words and understand their implications. This isn’t a game of “I really want a new cashmere scarf for my birthday and he got me a toaster because my hints were too subtle.” This is something that could have killed her, left her very weak, and may still lead to unforeseen complications. Some things do not need to be spelled out. "

So, how do you decide what fridge to get? Does she get to advocate for a nicer fridge in her favorite color, even though you are paying 100% of the costs?

"It's very troubling that she, like you said, is literally refusing to even try. He gave a very valid suggestion -- move in with their stuff, and then she could give it a few months. Heck, I didn't feel ""at home"" in the house my boyfriend and I bought until about a year and a half in. It almost felt as though we were just housesitting, and was really surreal to me that it was *ours.* She may be feeling similar, but she's acting very childish and, at the very least, disrespectful."

"Even if she doesn’t have feelings for you, you basically implied that she’s not attractive or desirable. It was unintentional but that’s probably what she heard- that she’s not girlfriend material, and in her heart she probably fears that no one will ever want to be with her.

"Your girlfriend is an adult, and she made the decision to take the mushrooms. Her parents are trying to pass the blame onto you but you are not at fault for her choice, especially considering that she has more experience with them than you.
I agree with another poster who mentioned waiting until you see her at work and just letting things cool down to see what happens next."
"Oh LORD ALMIGHTY!

Your problems with your father have nothing to do with Jesus and everything to do with manipulation and control.  Your father is used to justifying his crappy behavior and insults by claiming he has a HOT TICKET to the LORD AND SAVIOR.  Because, really, the thing about you being UNGRATEFUL?  That's just insulting you for absolutely no reason.  I bet he cherry picks bible quotes every time he says something cruel, doesn't he?  

Who thinks it's okay to ""pick"" their grandchild's daycare center?  Nobody!  That's so far beyond the pale.  I'm spitting out my tea here.  Your dad is not ""kind and giving"", sorry.  If he was giving, he'd have put that deposit down on a daycare that was a good fit for you and your child.  

Okay, but I have advice for you, I really do.  Others are helping you with setting boundaries.  These might work with your mother.  But they are probably just going to enrage your father and he's likely to bring down the WRATH OF HEAVEN on your immortal souls.  Don't cave.  And don't justify anything.  Just walk out and laugh about it later.  It's not going to end well here, so start preparing yourself.  And stop blaming yourself for his bad behavior.  


The other thing I can recommend is that you visit a website called Luke 17:3 ministries.  Hang on - it's got a very ""Christian"" feel to it, and the site is a bit of a mess But it's a site FOR Christians who have been abused BY Christians.  There's some good stuff on that site about people that manipulate Christianity to control their kids.  "
"Which is after you stopped using condoms, correct?"
"Thanks! I responded and she seems pretty cool. She said she was just interested in a relationship if I was. I did say I didn't really know what happened and she said she doesn't either, that she has tried a lot to reach of to my dad and he always has ignored her, so I'm not sure what that means in regards to if what he told me is true. "
"Sounds like you're not over your ex. Sounds like your GF can tell that. She probably won't ""calm down"", because you still love your ex... and that's a big deal for a lot of people. Rightfully so. If you're not over her, break up with your GF, because it's not fair to be with someone you can only offer bits and pieces of yourself to."
"Hey OP, I know this situation is a little intimidating but I think you need to respond, and possibly meet up if that's what she's suggesting (if you're close enough geographically to do so). If you don't, you'll always wonder, and if you can get over this initial discomfort it'll be better to possibly get some answers about who this person is, and have a better understanding of your family as a whole. Family structures and histories are really important where our sense of ourselves and our identities are concerned -- also what makes these kinds of revelations somewhat threatening -- but approach this as an opportunity to come to a better, more complete understanding of yourself and I think you'll be just fine."

"&gt; then a second message saying that she ‘didn’t want to see [my name], only you’.

I'd doubt it. It sounds extremely shady. I'm not convinced it's cheating, but they're clearly hiding something from her. If I were OP I'd come over uninvited one time or just sit both of them down and have a chat. There's no way this can continue and clearly something's up with them."
"Yes, definitely talk to them. god, I'm so sorry you're dealing with this shit.  :("
"&gt;  This is why I struggle so much to understand the no sex before marriage thing (outside of a strict religious context). 

Does anyone who's not strictly religious do the no sex before marriage thing?  That's pretty much a religion thing, and they just gloss over the whole issue of sexual compatibility."
Noooooooo I would not tell someone who you work with that has power over you something so personal unless you were extremely close and knew her views on abortion. I would say “medical procedure.” 
"So you've been working hard and steadily at your side business for a long period of time, but it's not steadily enerating any income?  I think you need to consider that whatever it is, it just isn't a solid basis for financial independence -- and that you can't expect your husband to indefinitely be responsible for keeping you both financially afloat."
"Unfortunately, you cannot sub out people on a cruise last minute, the person getting on the ship has to be the same person whose name is on the ticket."
"Hey, you don’t have to trivialize your experiences by saying they’re not a big deal. You’re freaked out, and they are kind of a big deal.

I don’t know if this makes it better or worse, but you’re not alone. So many girls your age and younger are going through the same thing, because some men believe that they are entitled to girl’s and women’s time/bodies. 

It’s really scary! I still get scared when this happens to me, and I’m 22, almost 23. Some people are going to tell you to be firm, to say no loudly, to shut this down, and I agree with them, but only in situations where you feel safe enough to do so. When you don’t feel safe enough, my preferred method is grey rocking: make yourself as uninteresting as possible, respond only with one or two word answers, and wait for them to tire themselves out. 

It sucks. It’s so shitty that people do this to young girls, and it shouldn’t happen at all. But it does, and if you can, you learn ways to cope."
Not your fault at all! I have a severe peanut allergy as well and I can smell those suckers from super far away. She should have noticed right away what was wrong and not eaten it/hit herself up with an epipen. I’d be pissed at her being mad at me if I was you. This is 100% her fault. Really irresponsible of her. 
"OP, you know what the answer is. 

Step back for a second, and see that your gf wants to take money from a baby. An orphaned baby.

Break. Up. Now."
"&gt;My question is, is my boyfriend a complete f#cking maniac or is my boyfriend a complete f#cking maniac? 

I love seeing people who are self aware post here. this was hilarious. While I wouldnt break up over this as an isolated incident that you could work through, it's not possible to salvage this if its a pattern of behavior for him. if it's not, try and start a calm discussion about it...his reaction to that might answer this for you."
"Get a part-time job to cover your incidental spending at school. 

I worked 1-3 part-time jobs and still managed to get my bachelor's summa cum laude. My poor friends all had jobs... and at the end, when we graduated, it was easier for us to get good full-time jobs than our classmates who didn't work, because we had lots of work experience and job references. 

I'm sure if you look around your campus, you'll realize that many of your classmates have jobs. "

I plan to teach or work in university admin while I write on the side. "
"In the nicest way possible, you need to butt the fuck out. Do not speak to someone you don't know. You are acting in your own self interest and that's why you need to take a step back. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. This is her life, her child, her ex. 

Offer support in the way a friend would. Be there for her if she needs/wants it. Do not even approach the subject of raising her children. If she was interested in you, she would have given you some sort of sign within the 8 years you have known her. 

She's going through an incredibly hard time and she doesn't need you coming in and messing things up even more because you want to date her. "
But you didn't help her up when she fell?
"STOP. GENERALIZING. WOMEN.

It won't do you any favors in your love life."
"I wouldn't go as a third wheel to a date, but I absolutely would go out with my sister and her boyfriend, with whom I would also hopefully be friends, if they were going out to something fun and didn't mind some company. Not all times that a couple does something together are specifically dates, many couples include friends in their outings. Of course, if there was any hesitance on the part of either at including me, I would not go. "
"The reason he doesn't want to be exclusive is that he doesn't see you as a legitimate partner outside of sex, and knows you're young enough that you probably haven't experienced this before to realize where it's headed (until now, anyway).

Don't date somebody hoping to be the one who changes them. Date somebody who is fucking awesome and just be awesome together."
"He’s still in love with this girl. As you note in the comments, they only broke up because of distance. He’s not that into you so he puts in no effort, and he figures he’ll just stay with you because he couldn’t get what he really wanted. Leave now! You deserve better."
"I think it’s like ‘like for a TBH’ and then the person will post on your wall something ‘honest’ they think about you. In this case, you like their status and then they either tell you something honest, rate you /10 or say whether they would date you or not. But OP thought he could tell the girl which one he thought of her (fair game tbh, I was confused by this as well)"
"OP, I'm 22 and I'm going to say right now you should be very careful of this age gap right now. The difference in mentality between 18 and 22 has been very large for me and the friends I've observed in this time period.

Having said that, he doesn't sound terribly considerate of your feelings. Is this normal? Does he ever yell at you? Does he ever get controlling? Is he receptive when you bring up emotional issues (and do you bring them up forthrightly and without manipulation)?"
Oh come on. This is the real world and that other woman is a grown ass adult. Not a child. He can get rid of her. 
"&gt; People are not mature as I would have liked.

Including you, it would seem, given that you've stated that if the situations were reversed you'd like your girlfriend less. 

Get yourself into therapy - your self-esteem issues are the real root of the problem here, not the wig itself - and tell your girlfriend. As you have stated she is going to find out anyway, and if she finds out by accident rather than you telling her then she is going to feel deceived by your lack of trust. "
"For some reason that reminds me of the restaurant scene from ""The Room""

""I can't tell you about the new client,  that's confidential....***How's your sex life...*** """
"Thank you. Really. I'm going to try to make the most of it and have some fun. I don't really want to do the whole casual sleeping around and dating thing, because to be honest I didn't think I would ever have to. But maybe it would be good for me to try after taking some time to heal. At the very least I'm going to be good to myself and do more of what makes me happy."
"&gt;His parents are a bit uneducated and they have put a lot of funky stuff into his head he believes is true, like women having to do everything a man says because he's a man and that's how it is.

If he actually believes that then you definitely shouldn’t progress in this relationship any further. "
"What you’re axtually saying is “Yes, he’s been clear, but I want something else and don’t really care about his boundaries if they get in the way of my vision of our future.” That’s not okay OP. You need to break up. You want different things and you know it. You’re trying to manipulate him into something he doesn’t want, even if it doesn’t feel wrong to you it absolutely is."
there is something seriously wrong with your sister. Someone needs to break that to her. 
"I honestly think that being so gentle and reassuring is probably not helpful at this point (but was obviously the right thing at first). People get very weird about hair but this is absurd.

I would tell her that you are done talking about her hair. She is a grown adult who made a decision she regrets. She can deal or not but you are done talking about it. If she brings it up you change the subject. If she cries you leave the room. This would snap most people out of it and if it doesn’t her I don’t blame you for thinking maybe this relationship isn’t going anywhere."
He has a 6 month old and he already wants another baby? Tell him to relax and enjoy the one he has 
Yup sounds like you're clear to me. Enjoy the concert. Your dad will get over it.

"I think you should have a 1 week holiday away from the kids and let hubby take care of all of them at home.

Then see how enthusiastic he is to have another one.

As far as contraception goes - make an appointment with your doctor for both of you to discuss your options.  
A qualified person will be both shutting down your husband's misconceptions (no pun intended) and providing you with accurate information and costs for any options you have.
"
"Research Mirena too! The copper IUD often causes long, heavy, painful periods because it works by creating inflammation in the uterus. Mirena is progesterone only, it's low dose, and the hormones are more localized so there's minimal systemic impact on mood. Plus Mirena typically makes periods lighter (or nonexistent!). Research supports a full 7 years of efficacy. I used to work at a family planning clinic and I placed IUDs every day; my patients preferred Mirena by a large margin! I have a Mirena and love it; most of the gals in my office ended up getting Mirena and they all loved it too! Everybody's different in what works best for them, but it's definitely worth looking into! :)"
Yeah. This edges uncomfortably close to reproductive coercion.
"I'm like your boyfriend. I recently got engaged, and my fiancé asked if I could actually make some reference to the fact that he exists on Facebook for once (in a nice way, of course). It hadn't really occurred to me, but looking back at what I tend to post, you would think I live in an empty world. The only times other people appear is when someone else tags me in a picture of their own. There's not really a reason why- I'm not embarrassed of my fiancé, or trying to hide his existence of anything like that. I'm just not very people-focused, and it doesn't occur to me to really get into the ""social"" part of social media. "
"&gt; She's justifiably upset as well

Ehh... I have a tough time seeing this as 'justified'.   Maybe 'understandable' in the way a person who deliberately puts their hand on a red-hot stove burner is *understandably* in a lot of pain.  They could not be *justifiably* upset that they were not magically protected from this pain by sheer force of ~~stupidity~~ will.
"
"I think to claim the kid is traumatized by his parents is pretty extreme basednoff what little we know. Spanking is outdated and doesn’t work as well as other methods, but by itself it doesn’t create this behavior. Again I’m speaking of light spankings, not beatings. I think it’s more likely this was due to poor punishment techniques (soankigs which don’t really affect the kid, when they should have been utilizing time outs or taking away things he does care about), and the parents being pushovers, such as the arcade example. "
"Dude, seriously, have a sit down with your dad. He needs to hear from you how  bad your mom treated your sister from childhood and how it's affected both of you. I can promise that your mom has been feeding him a whole different story."
"Exactly this. If OP was male and complaining that his gf wouldn't go down on him unless he shaved everyone would tell him to shave and that they should pressure the gf to do something they aren't comfortable with. 


Geez, guys have boundaries that need to be respected too. If he doesn't want to, he doesn't have to. If it means that much to her to get oral she should wax  (or shave if that would be a better compromise) or find a bf that's cool with it."
"You should leave this marriage. Your wife deserves to be with someone who wants to be with her and that person isn't you. If you guys haven't figured out your issues even after 7 years of therapy, you never will IMO. Don't do anything about Kelly until you figure out your marriage."
"How low are we talking here? How would you be any worse off than if you were single? Any amount thats added by his salary.. lets say you make 60k right now, yeah? You live on that, yourself. Are you comfortable living on that? You could survive being single and live comfortably? Thats good.

Now this guy, maybe he makes 40k a year. How is dating him going to make you any less financially secure? Hes living in his means, your living in yours. Thats 100k a year together l, but now you split rent, water, electricity, oil, cable, internet. You paying less now, together. Adding his income or dating him wouldnt make you poor.

It sounds like you just want to date a guy that makes more. Unless this guy is working minumum wage, i dont see why it couldnt work. He could cook, clean, do all that stuff. Rides for kids, stay at home dad them, this can work on many levels. It would be one thing if he was jobless or at mcdonalds.

It sounds like you are extremely concerned about the money, even if both of you are viable. Maybe you dont drive a Mercedes and maybe you buy a ranch instead of a mansion. This guy sounds great, maybe hes happy and loves his work
 Maybe the next guy makes 100k but hes miserable. Doesnt do any household chores, yoy have to pay thousands on daycare, maids, ect.

Just some food for thought. Money isnt everything"
"Unfortunately, abuse is not recommended in cases of abuse, because it gives the abuser more ammunition to use against the victim.  OP needs to go to counseling along and talk to a lawyer.  He needs to leave after documenting her abuse, and file for custody of their child."
"Right, but you’re never going to convince him to give you your independence. The more power you give him over you, and the more info you feed him, the more control he will try to exert over you. I know it’s hard just to ignore him and live your life, but you’ve got to do it eventually, and it’s the only way he’ll start seeing you as an adult. Oh and if you must tell him things, I’d tell him after the fact and not before."
"Wait, what? Do you d we even *READ* the same thing? Did you even read the first post? Because you missed *a lot*. She absolutely did the right thing. He was a man child who used manipulation to try to get her to give up something that was important to her. She absolutely did the right thing. He accused her a cheating, repeatedly, despite her transparency and willingness to bend over backwards to placate him. The one thing she was unwilling to do was stop dancing. That's totally reasonable.

And as far as stupid reasons go, I one dumped my fiancee because he refused to move a free refrigerator for me into my apartment. I was broke, fridge broke and someone was kind enough to give me a fridge, but we had to move it. He told me he didn't want to scratch his *bed liner* in his truck. Seriously? I'm against a wall, need help, and you are worried about your *bed liner*? That was a stupid *reason* but it was obvious to me that he didn't care, and only viewed it as a situation where he could control me. "
"Sometimes people will sabotage their relationship by making demands they don’t think their SO can meet, and if they do, they just come up with new demands. That’s what I think was going on here. OP was never going to satisfy him. If she quit dance there would have been something else."
"Your aunt never got to have a relationship with anyone, she never got the chance to be respected -- because she's dead, and your grandfather is apparently the one that killed her. 


&gt; give him the necessary respect as he is older


Uhhh, honestly I don't know what ethnicity you are a part of, but I cannot think of a single Asian culture where ""respect your elders""stretches to people who murdered their own children? "
"You're an asshole to your girlfriend, and you need to break up. "
"Sorry I missed this comment.

So, by refusing to acknowledge your point of view she gets her way automatically? OMG, please reconsider the marriage. I can totally see her pulling this for other major decisions... Children, house, jobs... By not talking about it, nothing changes.

I am so sorry but she is too immature to get married. Communication is key to all relationships. By refusing to talk, she is putting a poison pill in the middle of you two that will only spread with time."
A preference and a requirement are different. My ex told me he preferred when I shaved but he obviously wasn't going to refrain from pleasuring me if I hasn't gotten a chance to due to being busy. 
"They don't mean the act of waxing is ""porn fantasy world"", they mean expecting your partner to be barbie doll perfect is.  It's so childish to freak out over some body hair. "
"&gt;Downside. Child support.

You make it sound as if this is a punitive fee he has to pay in order to escape his tedious relationship. No matter if he stays or goes, money goes from his hands to the baby. That’s what happens when you have a child. The money isn’t for his gf, it’s for food, clothing, shelter, and education for the kid."
Or could have been conditional based on funding or having to work with a professor as his TA or research assistant. 
Dump her ass. Someone who loves you won't treat you life this.
That's especially awful of her since he had adopted HER child from a prior relationship.
"But he won't know he's garbage unless she tells him.
Then he can stew about it forever.

My husband thankfully knows that I have 8 or 9 different shades of coral colored eye shadows for my own picky benefit because neither he nor any other man on earth gives that much of a shit about slight variations in shades."
"lather, rinse, repeat.

You're very right and this is some next level heavy shit I need to think on. 
How old were you guys when you met?
"Lmao. This is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever read. It sounds like you have some personal issues that therapy could seriously help. OP, don’t listen to this guy.

"Putting the ring aside, have the two of you talked about joining finances? $10000 when you’re 28 or 30 might  be money you want for a house or won’t have because of kids or school loans.

"She didn't reject you, you rejected her and she moved on. She asked you out on NYE and you said NO. "
It sounds like you just want to start a fight about this. You're ascribing maliciousness to where ignorance is far more likely.
"I dealt with major family drama from not inviting one specific relative to my wedding last year, and I’m still grateful I went with my instincts and didn’t give in to family pressure to invite her.  Remember that this day belongs to you and your fiancée only and no one else.  I’d suggest going ahead with the wedding and not inviting them. The fallout from not including them sounds like a better option than inviting them and being even more stressed out on your big day as a result.  If you can’t handle that thought you could also consider eloping and having a small party for select family and friends after, which will be easier to limit the guest list for.  But don’t let everyone else dictate who will be at your wedding, there are only two people who should get final say in that."
"Nothing in the post says anything like that. You're literally making up scenarios just to be argumentive, it's not helpful. "
I feel like you so far are the only reasonable response in this thread.
I really want to see this.
"You seem to be applying all of your expectations of how *you* would go about buying a watch to your wife, but here's the problem, your wife is not you.  

Buying gifts that are of involved hobbies like watches can be really daunting for people who are not already immersed in that culture - there are so many options, and there is often a specific nomenclature that takes time to learn.  If your wife likes make-up, imagine yourself trying to buy a specific make-up item for her, and how easy it would be to make a mistake like this.

You mention all the hype and build up to Christmas.  Be careful to not let your imagined scenarios and expectations for how things would turn out rule your reaction to what actually happened.  It's rare that our expectations or imagined scenarios for events actually square with reality. 

Think about it like this: your wife put in the effort to pay attention to you, and go out of her way to get you something that you specifically wanted. It can be easy to focus on the negatives and miss the forest for the trees. Think about the intentions behind her action  before you confront her about the watch."
I was thinking this too. $700 pom poms!
"I don't know why you're getting downvoted... MANY women (myself included!) felt this way while in a bad relationship. Don't let these other idiots make you feel bad about yourself. Listen to me. I've been in this before.

So first thing is to go back to work, if you can. Try really hard to do this one, because it allows you to have some financial freedom. Get at least a portion of your check put into your own bank account separate from him (all of it, if you can get away with it- if you can't, then as much as you think you can get away with). 

Second, regrow your support network. This is actually really hard, because you might feel like you don't deserve one (totally not true! but I get the feeling... just try to fight it!) and your husband might resist. But do it anyways.

Once you have money and support, you WILL have all the tools to leave. IT IS OKAY TO THINK OF YOURSELF. IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO BE HAPPY. You will NOT screw your child over by doing this. YOU WILL BE OKAY. It's scary as hell, but you can do it &lt;3"
I'd like to see some video footage of that dinner date lol
"Honestly, this sounds like too much work for a 10 month relationship. How's he going to deal with it if you ever got seriously ill or incapacitated for a period for time. Or heck, if you have kids and don't have hours to spare each day living up to his standards. "
"&gt;She cheated.

&gt;She lied.

&gt;She doesn't work toward a career.

Any of these would have been deal breakers for me given the context. OP is young and unmarried. It would be a waste to throw away his potential by tying himself down with this shitshow."
"""some feminists actually have this mindset"" =\= feminism 101. 


In 2017, if you're attacking feminism, you likely have little understanding of what it is (a simple google search can fix that). Equality never hurts anyone, yet those who have always had it get so offended when others ask for it. "

"Because your PARENTS *want you to go* and will be *hurt and upset and embarrassed* if you don't! If you hate and resent your brother that much and feel so slighted over the spelling bee, think of it as going to his wedding for the sake of your parents, not for his sake. Your parents have clearly told you how important it is to them that you go to this wedding. And they did go to your spelling bee and they threw you that birthday party! Ugh."
"OK perhaps it was a bad analogy.

What I was trying to say was: you wouldn't EVEN buy something so trivial as a car without testing it was compatible with your needs and desires and comfort. 

Even something so unimportant, so material, so disposable, so easy to get rid of in case of a bad choice as a car is, EVEN THEN you'd want to see if it suited you before committing to it.

Sure, you did the research falling in love etc, but that is just not the same. The problem here is  that because you havent tried sex or living with someone, you literally cant grasp the importance of what I am saying. It's like trying to describe colours to a blind man."
My guess is that he’s worn her down. 
"How about do her the biggest favor ever and vanish from her life forever?

Fuck."
"This is what I was thinking. Op says that he can be judgmental, yet she hasn't got any hint of him knowing. So maybe yes, he can be a piece of work, but he could also be aware enough to stay out of this."
"Boy is this right on. I hope the OP's mother is considering therapy, It helped me immensely. And you are right, there are so many older woman who have given their lives to these scumbags, had their children...and then they get dumped for golddiggers. The men are clueless as to the damage they have done to their families. The OP has no responsibility o to deny her heart and force herself to accept her fathers decision and actions. Stay by your mother's side, love her and show her the empathy she needs to get over this devastation. Let the golddigger deal with him, and when it comes time to change his diapers, she can get her hands dirty."
"I think this post has a lot of good points. It sounds like your mom really wants to see you, but your step-dad is putting his foot down. I know you said you've had a rough relationship with him, but it is clear you love him. This is a really sad time for all involved. And, because you are a piece of your mom, he might be taking some of his frustration out on you.

What you can do to make both you and your mom's situation better is ask her for a mother-daughter day. You'll set to see her, give her a break from fighting, and have something for both of you to look forward to. Maybe she can come explore your college town, or you two could meet up half way and go for a hike or to a museum then lunch, for example. Just be together, have fun, and keep it light hearted for like 6 hours. "
"Yeah. It's so weird to me. I'm on Team ""Oh, God, Not a Public Proposal"" personally, but the guy in question either clearly likes them or lied to her about it. I don't understand why people are trying to make it her fault for expressing a preference he claimed to be happy with. "

"I agree with this. He's *really* over reacting. He should google about second hand marijuana smoke. The goverment has stated it takes a metric shit ton of ""marijuana cigarettes"" in an enclosed space with no ventilation or windows. But really, this kid will lose all trust in both parents if he ""rips apart the room raid style"" 

All OP needs to do is explain the pros and cons of smoking, and if you don't mind him smoking, ask him to do it elsewhere, or get him a more discreet (vape pen?) and responsible way. (Homework and chores done) Or ghetto it and get the kid a toilet paper tube, a bunch of fabric softener sheets, and some rubber bands - he'll figure it out."
"Sounds like OP has a problem of being passive aggressive in a ""joking way"" and her boyfriend has a problem with just dropping hints instead of breaking up with someone."
"Dude fuck all that. She’s a grown up and she knew you. If I told you you had to sleep on a persons couch you rejected or be charged with a DUI and deal with all the legal shit that comes from that, you’d choose the couch every single time. Stop making excuses for her because you like her.   She could have called for an Uber or taxi or asked you to do it. She could have called a friend or taken a bus. If she was cognizant enough to feel awkward about your confession then she was cognizant enough to make those choices. 

You need to grow a backbone. Have respect for yourself. Cut her off and move on.  You were being decent by not bothering her with your feelings until she asked you several times.  Well, don’t ask questions you don’t want an answer to. She should have cut you off when she rejected you if she really cared about your feelings. The fact that she flirts with you shows a huge lack of respect; which isn’t surprising to me because you don’t even respect yourself. 


If you kicked her out of your place you’d still have 0% responsibility here unless you were force feeding her alcohol. "
I have always lived in a house where we leave the doors unlocked till we goto sleep. Still do but if someone wanted me to lock the doors I would.
"My mom is young, but she has this type of attitude because her mom had this attitude.  I think for my mom it's subconscious, in that she probably wouldn't *say* that it's for these reasons.  But she definitely picked it up because her mother and aunts (who were immigrants) believed that jewelry was an investment-type of gift.  If the couple stays together, it's an asset that they share.  If something goes wrong (divorce, or having to flee a war and immigrate), it's an asset that you can carry with you, that is unlikely to lose value.  So for my mom, she's lost the reasoning behind it, but retained the ~feeling that jewelry is a really important and meaningful gift. "
"Are you seeing a therapist for yourself? The reason I ask is because when I was struggling with issues with my husband, and my husband was not interested in seeing a therapist, I went to a therapist on my own. I dealt with my own issues. And in therapy, I found ways to deal with my own husband. I could not change my husband, I can only change myself. So I changed myself, and I change the ways in which I related to my husband, and I changed the amount of things I would do for my husband, and I changed the amount of emotional labor I was willing to take on for him. Once I started taking care of myself more, and pleasing myself more, and allowing my husband to fend for himself in more ways, our relationship drastically improve. Yes, there was a lot of resistance at first. I had to stop doing so much for him, quite honestly. But I also stopped seething with resentment all the time, and my husband also learned about consequences. Now things are so much better, because I went to therapy, and I took care of my own needs first. I think that's what needs to happen here."
"You and your husband commissioned an artwork and agreed on a price. It is extremely not cool of your husband to refuse to pay because he didn’t like it. And his mother loved it, so it obviously accomplished what you wanted it to.
What an awful thing to do to someone, especially someone you know personally. Pay him the amount you agreed on. "
"Nope.  He’s rude, disrespectful and deeply ignorant.  And proud of those characteristics.

There's a lot space for that in policing. Computers are used as a vector in most crimes.

"You will need her FASFA information three more years. It might be a good idea to run your situation past your college’s FASFA office.

"&gt; I don’t really understand any of the conversation you guys had

Glad i wasn't the only one."
"Idk what you want her to apologize for. Sounds like she just plain didn't vibe you. Be the adult here and just let it go. You're carrying all this hate in you because you probably felt disrespected that she didn't reciprocate your eagerness for this friendship. I get feeling offended then, but it's time to let it go. 

Re: attending the wedding. If the invite didn't come with a plus one option and you weren't explicitly invited, don't go. That's just courtesy to the couple since theyre probably trying to keep catering budget under control. "
My fiancé &amp; I are both financially responsible but him even more so than I. I had to convince him to update his gaming computer (which cost him $2k) because the last time he did so was five years ago.
"As others have said, this woman didn't owe you her friendship.

Also, in my experience, ""the silent treatment"" is usually something people give to people already in their lives (friends, family members, significant others, not casual acquaintances) when they are upset with said person. Not responding is not giving you the silent treatment. It's also not ghosting. Ghosting is typically when someone makes plans, or even specifically says something about hanging out, then stops responding. Again, it occurs once a relationship has been established.

I know this is suggested too often on here, but have you considered therapy? I'm a really sensitive person, and your reaction to this seems strong, even to me. "
Wait....hold on so she never gave you any indication she wanted you as friend you still tried to contact her over and over though it was clearly unwanted and then am angry and claim she is at fault?
"Just one thing - you didn't *make* this woman do anything to you. Plenty of people in her position refrain from stalking, vandalism, and assault. I'm glad you learned your lesson about getting involved with married men, but don't assume she has no responsibility for her actions or that you forced her into anything. Keep an eye out for her, just in case, okay?

Edit: I do feel bad for her, I can't imagine not being able to divorce someone who did what he did."
"There are several things he could be worried about if they weren't trustworthy, for instance taking pictures of her as she does it.

I think OP is trying to say he's not worried about anything that they may do to her, he's worried about why she's doing it."
"Yes, and OP needs to keep it that way."
"you deserve someone who will be honest with you. everyone is worth that!!  

there are so many people out there in the world. i'm sure you can find a good one. i've been single a long time. i can't say it's all roses, certainly there are ups and downs. but being on your own is still better than worrying about whether someone who you care about is lying to you and/or cheating on you. "
"OP, a discussion is fine, but a lot of people are taking this comment to mean you should do an *actual* proposal. 

Don’t do that unless you know for a fact your boyfriend would be down for that, because most guys don’t really want to be proposed to that way. r/relationships tends to give an inaccurate portrayal that all dudes are down with that. They aren’t. "
"Call your regular doctor, tell them you’d like to see a gynocologist, and ask if they can make a referral for you. Or, you can find out from your insurance company what gynocologist take your insurance in your area.

"
You hit the nail on the head. OPs post really demonstrates just how much women are shamed for wanting to get married. 
I really love reading this because you came to your senses and did the right thing. Until I got to the end. Can you for your own well being not have casual contact with a murderer? Just take the clean break and move on.
"From the way you've written it, it sounds like you see hope in the girlfriend, and its your son that's the real problem. You've let it go this far - kicking them out was the right thing. The only problem is that it sounds like all of this should've happened a few years ago. I'm still in awe at the nonchalance with which you describe the way your son physically assaults his girlfriend. If I hit my girlfriend in front of my dad, he would pummel the shit out of me. If my son hit his girlfriend in front of me, I would pummel the shit out of him. I don't know you and what your moral compass is, and I doubt it falls in line with mine, but do you really think this is okay? In *your* home?"
"It's inappropriate to imply that she should do let him keep doing something she's not comfortable with or else he'll ""seek out others to participate.""  Also, it doesn't make her not open minded to not be comfortable with this or to not want to do it anymore."
"Yup. My picky cat fell in love with my roomate. Cats are, well, cats. I have to admit I was jealous,  seeing him sitting there covered in his dog and my cat but hey, they were happy. Roomate wasn't as he doesn't like cats but he tolerated her for my sake. The cat didnt like the dog so the fact she put aside her hate for the dog to sit on roomate showed her love for him. Roomate got the worse end of the deal whenever he ate, cat was a brazen food thief.

You can bribe a dog but I don't know of anyone who has successfully bribed a cat permanently. I ended up being the cats favorite to being relegated to staff. This was after being her favorite for over a decade. Oh well. That's cats."

"I'm so sorry you're going through this OP. It is heartbreaking. I think when he decided to do it, he realized he couldn't go through and is wanting to end things. I think he is trying to break up with you. I would go ahead and start the mourning process of the relationship. I would box up his things and start moving on. I'm so so sorry he did this to you and now won't even talk to you. "

"So if the problem is that $1600 is more than what he wants to or can afford to spend on a ring then he can just say that. Otherwise there's literally no good reason he can't just get what his girlfriend wants. She's not being materialistic or unreasonable in any way. She's even offered him the compromise that if he can find a different ring with the same very simple style features that she wants (solitare, low profile setting, plain band) then she will be happy with that. How is that not enough of a say. Also he can have a say in everything else to do with the engagement, proposal and the wedding. She's the one that will be wearing the ring every single day - why should it not be in a style than matches her taste and her practical needs (do you know how annoying a high profile claw setting can be in terms of  getting stuck in and scratching on everything? No, of course you don't, you're a guy!)"
Your uncle is a cop.  Cant you talk to him off the record and have your Uncle randomly stop by to visit you when the guy is smoking?

I would go. You are paying your respects to him. You held him in high regard and it is a good thing to show that. Hopefully you and Jill and The Douche can all be civil during the the proceedings.

Alex, I understand you maybe feel we aren't respecting your stuff and I am out of line for yelling at you. I'm sorry, but if you're going to be particular about how you want your stuff moved - you're going to have to pack it.

It's honestly just a freaking nutty thing to do and I can't believe her sister went along with it. If she was 14 I'd understand but good lord.

You can't force people to get along and if it's better for your sister to stay away, you need to respect that.

You might think that what's she's doing is shitty, but it's her choice and I think trying to get her back into the family might cause more arguments than it's worth."

"hi OP, forgive me for trying to get to the heart of the matter in one fell swoop but the emotion you didn't express here but that I'm picking up on is anger. a LOT of anger. so, what are you angry at your husband about?

and here's a much less consequential observation from what you've shared, but there is *absolutely* a way for your husband to earn a decent income in a relatively low-stress job. presenting this as high-paying = high-stress is a false-choice, and one that's significantly limiting you both. if your husband is at breakdown level of burned out get him the expert help he really needs and then back on the road to financial wellbeing.

&gt; She is also very convinced that I still harbour secret feelings for me ex, and she's choosing to see this act as ""proof"" of that fact which is so frustrating to me because I feel like nothing I do will be good enough.

Your ex is dead. Your gf is jealous of a dead woman.

Mate, I'm your age and I spent eight years with one woman. I still love Erin. I will always love Erin. I wouldn't leave my current girlfriend for her, I wouldn't cheat on my current girlfriend with her, but if she seriously needed help there is nothing that would stop me helping her. If she was in hospital I would be by her bedside. If she was in prison, I would visit. If she had a child and then died, I would do anything I could to help that child because it would be the last part of Erin left in the world.

Your girlfriend is a bad human being. You should not give in to her demands, and more; you should leave her. Don't be with an evil-hearted person like that."

"You should google ""she divorced because I left dishes by the sink"". It isn't just about dishes, it's about the fact that he puts 1000% of the emotional labor on you and doesn't fucking give a shit. He gives you false promises and never changes. Of course that breeds resentment. How could it not? You need to have a ""come to Jesus talk"" with him about this and possibly marriage counseling. If he promises to do better but doesn't, I don't know what to tell you other than you should talk to a divorce attorney. He's being selfish, lazy and massively disrespectful to you. You married him with the expectation that he'd be a partner, not a unremorseful slob and burden that you constantly have to clean up after. This is absolutely a hill to die on."
"That still wouldn't entitle them to insist on going on a trip with her boyfriend which she and her bf have paid for. Even if she lives at home or her parents give her money every now and again, shes:

Point 1 = she's not owned by anyone. Especially her creepy dad.

Don't understand this logic. If you go out somewhere with your friends/so, that has precisely nothing to do with your parents, even if they give you money it does not entitle them to ownership of that situation. That's some proper narcissism right there. "
"In my head, I see you standing up during dinner and slamming your hands on the table. You look her right in the eye [with your siblings all around you] and say, ""I had cancer. I almost died.

I am PROUD of my short hair, I am proud it means I am cancer free and if you cannot be proud of me for living, what will make you proud. I am no longer going to be wearing wigs and I do not want to hear another word out of your mouth about my hair. It is my body, my choice, and you are damaging my self-esteem and our relationship.

The next time you mention my hair, I will not speak to you for a week. If it continues, then I am going to make it longer. Would you rather have a healthy, happy daughter or a corpse in a wig? Because I would think, if you loved me, you would want me to bald and living instead of pretty and dead."" "
"Your mom is utterly unreasonable. She expects to be the primary person in your life.

She's offended that you met his parents before she met him? Wtf. Someone meets the other's parents first, and it wasn't her. So. Fucking. What.

She could have met him after that but now no longer wants to because actually meeting him isn't important to her. You putting her first is, and you failed to do that so she's decided to hate him instead.

This is ridiculously immature, but may be hard for you to see clearly as you're used to this kind of nonsense being normal.

It isn't.

She's likely somewhat narcissistic. She's the one who matters. Her feelings are the ones that are important. That she's hurting you and your relationship with her over something trivial is inconsequential.

"I proposed to my wife of 12 years when I was 19 and did it with a $120 ring. We're both over 30 and she refuses an upgrade. I'm not trying to brag. I'm just trying to show what normal, non-materialistic people act like. It's symbolic. She sounds unbelievably vain."
That's some fucking bullshit. You should be ashamed of yourself for thinking that way.
"I see this constantly and I just don't get it. He had what almost all of us want: that one person who sticks by our side through thick and thin, who we love and are loved by, and who we want to spend the rest of our lives with. And he wants to trade it for what? Hookups? A series of failed relationships and the corresponding heartbreaks and worries about getting older and not having found someone yet? I just can't understand this mindset. 

As for what you can expect, you can expect him to disappear for a while and then come back saying he made a mistake and that he wants to have his old life with you and wants everything to be the way it was again. Only it won't be, because it can't be. Because he walked away from a sure thing, broke your heart for a reason you know is stupid, and now you won't be able to trust him again because what if a few more years down the road he gets the same itch and puts you through the same pain all over again? 

If he makes up his mind to leave, make it clear he can never come back, and make sure you hold yourself to that as well because if he comes back, there'll probably be no small amount of temptation to take him back and try to make everything the way it used to be. "

"Landlord here. The brother doing that isnt so much illegal, but for sure it's against the lease. By having someone else live there is making them a legal tenant, even though hey don't pay rent.

Go to the landlord asap. If the tenant stays to long he is a legal tenant a d that is his living space. "

to b) start reflecting his questions back on him.  You've got to get him starting to look for the answers to his own questions.  What's 81 times 71?  I don't know.  You tell me.  It's 1,377?  What's that divided by seven?

c)  He can't ask questions if he's reading.  Have him read a book aloud to you for a while.  

And d) you've got to teach him to be a little self entertaining.  Get him a hobby and chores.

"Thank you for the update!

I'm sorry your optimism wasn't rewarded this season.

 It's a shame that your family is reacting to your change to the status quo with such hostility. It's like when people say ""Don't make a scene"" about whatever awful thing a member always says... but they're already making a scene! You're just finally reacting!

I think you've done lots right here and hopefully you're sisters and parents reflect on this with some time.  That said, I honestly can see where your dad coming down made it worse. 

I think this has a lot to do with you: being the youngest, and having diabetes, and a different job on top of your parents spoiled you a little. Unfortunately none of those things are not your fault and you can't change them. 

If one of your sisters shows genuine remorse and change you may have to take the bullet of not playing into those aspects. Like,  crying about your cat miscommunication downstairs is actually fine but plays into the 'special little princess' thing they're reacting to. 

I **would not bother** making concessions unless the relationships show value and they grow up. 

**tl;dr** your sisters blame your adult lifestyle for childhood problems which you cannot fix, and now they're all a little mad at you since the have to deal with the problem rather than rug sweep.  I'm sorry :( 

If they show contrition and change you could consider trying not to set them off but crying to your dad but that's seriously up to and kind of rug sweeping too. "

Instead of selling her goddamn pain meds (you KNOW that's what hes doing), he could drive her to the goddamn doctor. And maybe Walgreens to pick up her prescriptions. That aren't expired. Or, ya know, have actually been prescribed to her by a doctor. These opiate dealers are the worst ya know? Oh! But not your boyfriend. Because he apologized, to you. After he PROPOSED! Yup, you're totally not a drug dealer if you can convince your girlfriend it's an old lady you're hellping out. One who knows that what you're doing is illegal, that she texts and begs him for ""code word: orange juice."" Seriously. Yep. Totally believable. 

But anyways. ""No more silly lies like that!"" Really? That's all it takes, you think? There'd be a lot less people in jail if judges stopped sentencing people for crimes (like drug dealing) and instead told them, as though they didn't know already, that proposing to your girlfriend as a means of distraction totally works to get her off your back about the drug dealing and rampant lying, and as long as you pretty pretty please promise, you can skip punishment and go back to whatever you were doing, just be nice this time, okay? Like on the playground?

I'm sure you can tell I'm frustrated. But from what you wrote here op, you look like a goddamn fool. I just wanna shake you by the shoulders and yell ""GIRL WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'!"" and hopefully get you thinking about this hard enough to know that just because you're as honest and caring as you are, (which is obvious from your writing,) doesn't mean he is. You have to judge other people by their actions... And head a drug dealer. "
For real... I wish more people would mention the fact that plenty of people go to public schools and excel. 
"I would usually welcome someone to the sisterhood/brotherhood of JustNoMil immediately but paranoia and irrational rage is also an early warning sign for Alzheimer's. If your FIL is also stunned by her behaviour, she needs to be assessed by a doctor."
"&gt;And it's not boredom causing this - he goes to a very, very special school for prodigy children that I work so hard to pay for. 

That's fantastic.  I think the next step is to talk to the school and see what they suggest.  Maybe get him involved in some sort of extra curricular activities with other kids.  It does sound like he has a  lot of intellectual energy that he needs to burn off.  

When he asks you a question you don't know the answer to or do know, but are too busy to explain it, do what parents used to do: tell him to look it up himself either online or in a book.  You can probably get an old set of encyclopedias for a song.  I know they're old fashioned, but he might really enjoy them.  Or take him to the library and have him check out some books on subjects he's interested in.  Then once his question is answered, have him explain the answer to you.  

I think taking him to a psychologist is a good idea.  It does sound like he has some classic signs of OCD.  Another particular thing to discuss with a professional is how to balance his intellect with his emotional maturity, especially if he's going to go to college at a young age.  

I'm also going to say, you sound like a great mom.  Don't push yourself to be perfect.  Just continue to do the best you can.  "
"He definitely seems to care who I hang out with, but never tells me he'd rather I not hang out with anyone in particular or anything like that. He asks whatever questions he has, and I answer- Doesn't bother me at all that he asks.

He has a history of getting defensive whenever I bring up friends of his- especially ones that he is very close with. We've been in situations where if I even brought up the name of the friend, it would end in an argument. 

He didn't really have a healthy family dynamic growing up, and so I've always thought he's looked at his close friends like his family- and that's why he gets defensive. But he's never flat out said his friends were none of my business.

In my opinion, if you want to have a life where you have no one to answer to- why are you married?"
"Soooo.... My hair is at my butt.. So quite long. It's always been long, I've never really had a hair cut, just trims.

As absolutely stupid as it sounds, I connect my hair to my identity. I know I shouldn't, but I just don't think I would feel like me if I had short hair. I have always wanted to try, but I am pretty sure I would have a reaction similar to your gf. The closest experience I have to this is when I asked for a trim and they cut to my belly button height. I was PISSED for MONTHS, and complained about it to my husband all the time. My whole family knew I was pissed about it, as did most of my friends because I complained about it. Logically, I know it is just hair, and part of why I probably wasn't as upset as your gf is because I knew it would only take about a year to year and a half to grow back. But to get it as short as your gf's would probably have me being upset like her (although I can't see myself crying for months on end, but everyone reacts differently). My point is, your hair is part of your gf's identity, and that is likely why she is struggling so much. It's not healthy to associate your identity so much with a physical aspect, but we all do it... Unfortunately she is not coping well with a change to her physical identity. As stupid as it sounds, you almost have to treat like she lost a limb, because that is how she is reacting (I am not saying losing a limb is equal to cutting your hair, but she is reacting so strongly that it might be easier to figure out how to reach her by thinking of it like that) 

As for what you can do for her, part of me believes she just needs a wake up call. Yes, it sucks that her hair is super short... But it will take about 2 years for it to grow back and then it will be back the way she wants it. If she doesn't get out of this gloom though she is going to lose relationships that she will never be able to grow back. You need to sit her down and tell her that while you know she is upset, she had to accept this her temporary reality and not let it control her life."
" I don’t think it’s shallow or fickle at all, I think you’re impressive as hell for having such a good head on your shoulders at 25. 

Way too often we’re willing to stay in/try to force relationships that aren’t going anywhere because a single aspect is good, or we think it is, and later we’re kicking ourselves for wasting time on it. 

He’s not someone you can see yourself with long term, it’s no more or less complicated than that. You don’t owe anyone an explanation of why you do or don’t see a future with someone. 

That said, if he’s a good man who’s career field earns a lower salary than yours, that’s one thing. He’s some slacker that works part time at a minimum wage job at his age, that’s another. You’re the only one that can decide what you’re okay with. "

"Just to piggy back, but there are also several Christian authors that talk about the beauty of sex and the intimacy and goodness that comes from a healthy sexual relationship in a marriage. She might be more open to that sort of route, John Piper has a few things she could look at. A lot of his stuff is free too. Tim and Beverley layhaye also have a book, but I count vouch for that content.

"How do your parents feel about it?  If you have to hide it from them, then there is something wrong with the relationship.  If your parents get to know him and his GF as nice neighbors, then it may be OK.  Trust your parents' instincts on this one and the moment you get an icky, uncomfortable vibe from him, start distancing yourself."
She dumped him for shitting on her hobbies and not trusting her at all when she made every effort to make him comfortable short of giving up the things she loves. 
"Next time you have a prowler, call the police.

Someone is sneaking around your home, banging on doors and windows. This is a popular tactic used by home-invaders to intimidate residents, check if someone is home, or gain an understanding of a resident's schedule for more sinister actions.

*This is dangerous.* Your Brother-in-law is making it so, if an actual home invader decided to attempt to plunder your house, you'd have an extreme under-reaction and possibly end up hurt or worse.

Call the police."
"""Getting her for cheap""? So... she thinks that you're buying her with this ring. I don't want to be rude, but that $1300 you already spent is way more than I'd pay for anyone who thinks of herself as being for sale.

More seriously, you guys are so young, and she obviously has some messed-up ideas about engagement and money. Have you talked about what marriage means... really means... to each of you? Do you feel like you know what she values in life and that it matches up with what you value in life? Love is so important but it's not everything. I would like to say don't get married until she grows out of this nonsense about the ring, but at *least*, please, don't get married until you've had some serious talks about what money and marriage mean to each of you and done some real soul-searching about how this happened."

"You two might just have completely different ideas on how to shop for gifts. To me, even if I'm perfectly happy to dish out a bunch of money, I'll still look around at least a bit to see if there are deals out for the item. That way I have more money set aside already if I find something else down the line that I think the person would like. Paying extra for no reason is totally illogical in my mind. Now, yes, apparently for watches you DO have to spend the extra, but I had no idea until this thread that scamming is so rampant with watches. It never would've occurred to me that there could be a difference if I got what looked exactly the same except on sale. TIL"
And she picks up on that and it makes her feel like all you want from her is sex.
"That’s not compromising though. It’s just trying to change the nursery to what you want. 

A compromise would be she paints the walls gray and then you paint a colorful piece of artwork. Or you paint a dresser or chair a colorful color.

"Just saw the update that he's drunk and working his way back.  Good update.  Thought I would share the story that immediately came to mind anyway.  People, if your otherwise trustworthy SOs disappear it's cause for concern.

I'm in Vegas with one of my best friends and his then girlfriend who later became his wife then ex-wife.  She's very jealous.  We tell her **exactly** where we're going and what we're doing.  To wit, taking a 4-wheel drive vehicle that I was marginally familiar with out offroad at Red Rock.  Very long story short, I crash it and we're stuck overnight.  Luckily no injuries.  

Since we weren't planning on getting out of the car, we were dressed in shirts and jeans - no coats.  Temperature overnight dropped to 10 degrees.  We spent all night getting in and out of the truck digging it out since we could only be out about 5 minutes at a time.

Finally dig out the truck and get it going.  Get back at like 8 in the morning.  Girlfriend is pissed.  So am I.  I ask her since she knew exactly where we were why the fuck didn't she call the rangers/police or whatever.  Basically, Oh I figured you were out cheating on me.

"I don't think it is. In this situation, it's not about who did the most damage. The dad cheated. And if he cheated starting early in the marriage, then maybe the mom does have a valid reason to be a miserable person to live and deal with. There's a reason why infidelity is called crazy-making. But disregarding all that, it all boils down to the fact that the daughter doesn't want to accept his affair partner as a family or friend. And she shouldn't have to."
"&gt; He's inducted you into the family.

As someone raised in (and escaped from) the deep south who knows people like this, that's how I read it too. By OP not standing up for himself and accepting being treated this way, he's passing Poppa's test. Now Poppa knows he can walk all over OP as well as OP's girlfriend, and he considers himself the patriarch of their relationship too. Next up is probably Momma talking about the heirloom rings in the family that OP's girlfriend has always dreamed of wearing one day. 

I do not advise sticking around for this, OP. I know you love your girlfriend, but she is 100% drinking the kool aid and doesn't see anything wrong with what is happening. The fact that there is a disowned sister proves it and also shines a lot of light on OP's gf's possible future. If OP's gf kept in contact with this sister it would be one thing, it'd show that she realizes her family is a bit nuts (and may even follow in sister's footsteps at some point). But the fact that she goes along with the parents and doesn't speak to or about her sister at all points to her probably getting pulled in (she probably would call it ""bonded"") even closer to her parents because of this event. The likelihood of her ever realizing that her parents are abusive nutcases is much lower, in my experience, since the perfect opportunity for her to have that epiphany came and passed when her sister was disowned. It doesn't look good, OP, your girlfriend has to see what's wrong with this picture and want to change it before anything can change."
She has a boyfriend? That may have something to do with her shit talking you to anyone who'll listen.

Closure is fictional. It doesn’t exist in real life.
"Just say thank you. It's a very kind gesture, and it's a gift that she didn't need to go pick out herself. If you feel weird about it, put it into savings or something, so you're not interacting with it directly. "
"That's enough for some people, and yeah, I'd classify that as affluent. It would be extremely rude and awkward to ""return"" it. Just dump it into savings or treat yourself if your overall financial situation is good! "
Have your dad look into what the courts say about that. Was he already stationed there when they went to court or was he in the US?
"Why are you surprised that a cheater lied to you? Stop seeing him and if you can, the decent thing to do would be to let his wife know he's cheating on her. Do these kids really deserve a dad who isn't committed to the family?

You're his side piece. He isn't leaving his wife for you and you're naive in thinking this guy is doing anything but using you."
I have a feeling Mark is a gold digger...
"OP please make sure that you inform campus police and local authorities of who he is. He should not be allowed to try to make contact with you near or at school, or at all for that matter. If they know who to look for, that’s 90% of it.

"Well, she must not love you.

Did you get into a lot of fights with people growing up? It seems like the minute things aren't perfect for you you go out to scorch the earth.

How 'bout you use your words. Talk to your wife and learn what her intent was before you flip out."
"Thank you for the guidance. I do need to remind myself that he disrespected my wishes about something relatively simple. Then, he hid it from me. I think I would have always wondered what he‘s keeping from me after that. The trust was broken way too soon.

I KNOW their dynamic. I’ve seen it a hundred times. She is vastly more attractive than he is and she knows it. She loves the attention of a “nice guy” and he loves the attention of a “pretty girl.” I just... I get it because she’s only 22. I wasn’t always very respectful towards other women at that age. But shouldn’t he be able to identify this kind of dysfunction and stop himself from shooting his own foot?

I think they have this “us against the world” mentality and I was never going to crack that. Unfortunately me and our relationship will just be another inside joke to them about how “no one can handle their friendship” or some crap. I’ve been there; maybe it’s karma."

"This is the advice I gave someone about 20 days ago when they asked advice on gift giving on a budget in and r/advice post :

&gt; "" My advice to you is to focus on the little things and the experiences that make up the holidays. Make it about spending time with others and conversation....

&gt; And since your gonna be forced to give gifts anyways.... make that about the connection and the (oh! I thought of you-ness, rather than the gift itself...) I used to do this growing up and even now by getting VERY SMALL/MODEST gifts for everybody, then splurging on one person and spending more on them (each yr, it would rotate)

&gt; **Each Idea was more creative and showed that I knew their taste, than expensive** ""

Your gift's were fine, thoughtful/tasteful, and how most people do gift giving. You give what you can, not what you can't afford....Your family's reaction to having been given something was rude and immature at best.

"How much time does your rabbit spend in a cage? I took over a roommate’s rabbit many years ago and it sounded very much like yours. After I adopted it I litter trained her and set up the house so the rabbit could be cage free. That rabbit went from being a boring bump on a log to the most loving pet full of personality. At the end of her life she was hopping in my lap for pets and following me around the house. I even earned the elusive bunny face licks. Once I saw the turn around in her personality it made my heart hurt regretting the fact that I kept my childhood rabbit in a cage.

Or, if your mom has paid you for them, they are your mom's hats."

If you choose not to tell him I think honestly you have no ethical choice but to leave him.

Yes, telling him could mess things up... but does that justify lying to him for years / forever and risking the much deeper wound of him discovering that betrayal? "

The control element and the going back and forth is because he needs you to be available if he changes his mind or his new adventures don't work out like he's hoping.

For yourself, this is all very unhealthy. He doesn't distrust you. He's keeping you on a tight leash for his own needs and is using trust as his cover story. I know that you have hope and are possibly afraid to close the door on something that you still want. But you need to slam it and change the locks.

And consider therapy if you can manage it. For perspective. There is so much it sounds as though you have gotten used to that is dysfunctional and unhealthy for you. "
"OP, I am a 6'0"" female who admittedly hasn't weighed myself in a while, but would bet I'm over 200 pounds right now.

Like your friend, I went through a phase a couple years ago where I was getting plenty of male attention and hooking up casually with a few guys, but was unable to find a meaningful, long-term relationship. 

I finally bit the bullet a year ago, realized I wanted a steady boyfriend, signed up for OkCupid, went on a series of dates in one week, some good, some bad, the last one being the first date with my now partner.

Of course I think that weight and the subsequent hit to your self-esteem can impact the way potential partners see you, but I never felt like my weight was the thing preventing me from finding a partner. I have pretty high self-esteem and self-confidence though, and my weight has never even come up as something my partners have been bothered by.

Your friend sounds like me, where she's more than capable of attracting men, but she's maybe just settling for men who feel a certain way about dating and committing to her. (This could be for any number of reasons that include her weight, but could also be related to personality, fear of commitment, the guys’ insecurities, etc.)

Instead, she should really focus on dating a wide variety of guys of all shapes and sizes, who assert fairly early on that they are interested in commitment.

I hope the best for the both of you!"

"My father told me it is better to raise a dog than a daughter. A dog will stay loyal to you all its life while a daughter will leave you when she marries, as in my culture a married girl must regard her in-laws as her more real, more important family than her own. "
"Just saying, I grew up with an “ethically bred” Australian Shepherd and that poor dog was a complete psycho. She hated everyone that wasn’t our immediate family and would try to bite/attack them, and would try the same with us if we got too close to her while she was eating or would just snap sometimes. 

Getting an ethically bred dog doesn’t guarantee it won’t have an aggressive personality anymore than getting a rescue dog guarantees it will have behavioral problems. "
"This is just unfortunate timing really.  This relationship is not to the point where it's appropriate for you to drop this bomb.  You really have two choices, either forget what you saw and continue seeing him or end the relationship and move on.  Either way it's not advisable for you to tell anyone involved anything."
"Sounds like you have one foot in the door because the idea of permanence is scary. That’s a bad way of dealing with it, honestly. You shouldn’t need daily reevaluations of your relationship if you’re happy in it - try 6 months, maybe, barring sudden major crises? Whether your relationship is happy shouldn’t be something you need to think about, other than the occasional checkup to make sure you’re not falling into harmful thought patterns.

The other issue is your “if issues arise I will leave” declaration. This is fine if it means “if issues arise, and we try to work through them but can’t or my partner refuses to work through them, I will end the relationship”... but it just seems like an insecure and fearful lack of any real commitment if it’s just “the moment anything gets tough I will run away from the relationship rather than working with my partner to resolve it”."
"&gt; Even if it was a one-time thing (and his long record shows it's probably not) I think his reaction is very telling

&gt; That's where a genuinely changed person accepts responsibility for what they did and provides a patient explanation to the person they are dating. his reaction was instead to get defensive and ignore you. 

This is why I wanted to talk to him in the first place instead of assuming the worst (which kind of blew up in my face anyway). You are completely right, I honestly expected him to calmly tell me what happened and that he was in counseling or anger management but got a very different response.

After reading the previous post, I don't think you have real feelings for him.  I think you just want to possess him because as you and he are getting older into your late 20s soon approaching 30, it is he who is becoming a better romantic prospect.

I haven't read a single word of how whatever you feel is making you want to do things to help him.  It's all about jealousy when he sees other women.

&gt; I want a relationship that will eventually (**not right now**) lead to a commitment.

When even in a post where you are trying to express your best feelings toward him you have to use phrases like **gives him all the power** and **not right now** for commitment, it shows you have no intention of actually being serious with him.  You just want him to keep him away from anyone else."
You should join some intersex support groups if you havent already. They can also help you navigate dating.
"Agreed. Mom is the one with most of the issues here. She wasn't able to let the divorce go and made co-parenting all kinds of awful by making OP feel like he has to choose sides, which is also exactly what she's doing with the sister now.

"&gt; He also constantly brings up to our other friends how bad the breakup was, three years after it happened, despite asking him not to.

So *you* said this was a bad breakup, your friend *knows* it was a bad breakup from you telling him, and yet he's *still* bringing her along for this movie.

Without knowing just how bad this breakup was I can't really say whether you should be over it by now or not, but it sounds like you still don't want her around in your life and will be extremely uncomfortable. You said you're going to go either way though, so good luck. 

To answer your question, I wouldn't say you're being overly sensitive about this."
"Tell her and save her some time. Be nice and explain how it all happened and how you started to doubt him. That way, you make sure she'll actually believe you. "
"So wait. You're a medical student posting about maybe dating a resident who you call a workaholic for working a typical resident schedule (hint: he's not a workaholic, he's a resident. This will be your life as well very soon.) (*but now you're living at his house with his parents? Or is this a previous boyfriend and you've been flirting with the resident? Or did you recently get attached to this boyfriend and suddenly decide you're too good for your parents?) who rebelled against the parents who pay for everything in her life. I really think you need to step back and evaluate how you look at relationships and what you give vs what you get before you nuke things with your parents."
"I know all too well about how long coming out can take, it's just frustrating to think that we might have a legitimate connection that will just fizzle out because he might be too scared to consider it. Thank you for being blunt, I probably need it more than I think I do right now"
"God damn, it, Tarzan. I was rooting so hard for you here."
I've found condoms in my ex boyfriend's jacket pocket.... he was cheating on me. 
"I was with a serial cheater, and left him when he cheated on me, now i am with a non cheater. They exist. Don't leave hope, not all men are like this"
"Yeah, it's not so much looking out for predators--it's keeping in mind the fact that a relationship with people at such disparate stages isn't good for anyone involved."
"She said in another comment that she doesn't believe in doing that and doesn't want to be in a relationship where that's expected. Her expectation is that the person waiting around should be the one to call/figure out what to do, not that the person deviating from the routine should proactively let the other person know that they're off schedule.

Edit: Apparently this is well-established in their relationship and he doesn't call/text about being late either, in which case, I have no idea what this guy's problem is."

"Yeah, my mother in law kept falling asleep with my newborn like this after being told not to and it was honestly so frightening. You're bombarded with stories of babies dying like that. It took a long time to let her be alone with our kid, and we still only let her take over for small amounts of time (she's repeatedly shown herself not to be responsible). 

I vividly remember my terror and anger. And I've never lost a baby! And my baby wasn't hurt! In this case, the baby could LITERALLY have died if she hadn't come in then. It was a bad situation.

Accidents happen, and as someone removed from the situation I can certainly feel sympathy for OP and say he didn't mean to and shouldn't be punished for it. But at the same time, I really feel like I understand her reaction. It's so hard to let that baby out of your arms as it is."
"Maybe because she never dealt with depression and never knew anyone who committed suicide. When I meet people and become close to them, some of them say very disparaging things about drug addicts when we see a high homeless guy on the street or something. When I tell them that I was addicted to heroin as a teenager and got clean through the Substitution program at 19-20, and tell them that I would have never made it without a supportive family, a good education and this program, and what it is like to be addicted, they completely change their mind. They just always thought of it in an abstract kind of way, and never **really** thought about it. 
That’s still no excuse for what she said though. "
[removed]
She probably also believes that mental illness is a choice.
"I understand businesses involve some degree of risk, but it sounds a bit off that it fluctuates from incredible to terrible, as well as the 25 moves in 10 years partly due to opportunities drying up."
"She sounds alarmingly immature. No matter that she's sheltered - grown adults usually know it's not okay to laugh at people's appearance. Get thee to a marriage counselor if you're intent on saving this, but honestly, I see no trace lf that stellar personality you supposedly married her for, dude."
"If you're pregnant and plan on terminating, you don't need to tell anyone. If you're looking for emotional support it'd be much better to go to a trusted friend, family member or peer rather than this guy. If you decide not to go through with the abortion, he has a right to know that you're pregnant (plus if you want child support or the chance at healthy coparenting, he needs to know.) 

I hope everything goes well OP. "
"What has been your partner's reaction to all of this? How has he been pushing back, because it seems like he keeps subjecting you to these shitty people and that's my real concern."
"Fiber rabbits and fur rabbits are different. Probably neither have a great time under commercial conditions but with fiber rabbits you just collect what sheds every day, not skin them entirely. Still. I doubt gf is looking to get into cottage industry weaving 😂"
"&gt;  I am not sure what to do in the immediate future.

1. Say ""We'll prioritize couples counselling on iur return""

2. Do everything she suggests without argument."
"First, the practical side: I work in respite care, and we do anything from domestic work, to showering, overnight in group homes whose residents have some form of mental or physical disability.

Google respite care to determine your local provider/s, and check out whether you are eligible for assistance on that level. You usually need to be a low income earner or ex-services but every state will have different criteria. They will come out and do an in-house assessment to determine what you require in terms of cleaning, gardening, etc and what your husband needs. They will review this plan periodically and amend as necessary. You may go from 1hr a week of domestic (linen changes, bathroom toilet cleaned, floors vacuumed/mopped) to overnight stays. It is usually free, or with a minimal co-payment ($5 or so.) ask for help. It's called respite care because it's meant to provide you with a reprieve. 

Whether you are or are not eligible for respite care, you need to get some counselling. This is a massive change and you will grieve for the change to the quality of your life/lives. There are free and paid services available, your Dr should be able to help. If not, let me know.

Secondly: this is a really shitty thing. I'm really sorry for what you both are going through. Luckily, you seem to be a pretty good team. Feel free to pm me if you think I can help. Take care. "
I wish this were higher up. People can be so unreasonable about what is and isn’t acceptable behavior until it’s their own personal property that’s been destroyed.
"I was thinking the same. Josie is not allowed to have any conversations with others without phoebe groping her, it seems. It’s a control thing and a problem."
"He sounds much less mature than you - I feel like the ""hanging out with my mates"" move is very high school and might betray either serious insensitivity to your needs and the situation or perhaps some insecurity. Either way, what a pain. 

And you've already talked to him about this with no success, AND there might be fundamental incompatibilities in your long-term goals; it's up to you, but this relationship doesn't sound like it has a long shelf life."
"&gt;Please don't comment if you plan to educate me or bash me on the age gap

I'm going to disregard your wishes because I'm older than you and know better. That's how things are going to go for your relationship too. Dating this guy is like someone your age wanting to be romantic with a second grader. "
Seconded! The right woman would *swoon* with compassion for you at the generosity you are showing this family. Don't settle for negativity and bitterness!
Ok I have a severe peanut allergy myself and I can understand what most likely occurred. OP’s gf probably knew that OP used peanut butter replacement spreads in the past and assumed that is what it was. Most likely she hasn’t consumed it often enough to know the difference. I know that when I recently tried almond butter it tasted pretty much identical to the few times I accidentally ate tiny amounts of peanut butter. And there are other spreads that most likely smell very similar to peanut butter as well. 
"Jealousy can be a bottomless pit. My ex was jealous about my relationship with our children (they were babies at the time) and also jealous of my relationship with my siblings.. it was a ""WTF? Who is this??"" moment when he told me."
"&gt; I was on food stamps and was definitely low income, but I put my money towards the things I enjoyed (owning horses and horseback riding/camping)

How the heck do you afford horses while on food stamps?? And if you had money for horses, why were you on food stamps to begin with?"
If there's a child involved though that all becomes more complicated. That could mean additional childcare costs or OP caring for the child alone a lot of the time. That's very tough on him. 
"People are calling her immature because hair is seen as ""trivial"" and ""superficial"" but it's not *at all* unusual for people's anxieties or mental health problems to manifest in a fixation on some part of her body: c.f. trichotillomania, skin-picking, disordered eating, obsessive exercise, body dysmorphia. If anything, this sounds like a case of body dysmorphia focused on an unusual body part (i.e. the hair). The extent of her distress indicates there's something going on that goes further than being sad about cutting her hair. The fact that it's so extreme and so irrational makes it more likely to be something related to her mental or emotional health."
 Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house were the sounds of her slurp and his rug munching mouth...
"I would fucking cut a bitch for unpacking my face care products. Shit is expensive as fuck all and it took me until I was 30 before I found the products that work for me.

You know what my husband does? Buys me lovely bath bombs from lush and tells me how soft my skin is. OP's bf can fuck right off. "
I would never speak to the MIL as long as I take in breathe and would divorce my husband if he didn't give his head a shake and get with the fact that his mother nearly killed our kid. Fact: my kid is ANA to peanuts and would acortch fucking earth should this ever happen.
"Srs he was raised super Christian but had pulled away from his faith and the church a few years before we started going out. Turns out he still had a LOT of unresolved shame and weirdness about sex and women's bodies.

So, kind of a downer conclusion, but that's why he was pleasantly surprised that a Sinner Woman (me) could be so clean."
"I think it is a similar problem for her. She's never had a belly either and has always been very thin. This is without a doubt the largest she's ever been, and I think that is partially to blame for her reaction. 

It's winter here, so she has been able to hide her bump under heavy clothing up until just recently. That may also be bothering her that now everyone can she how big she is getting. 

I like your ideas. I'm going to try to show her belly some love and try to emphasize that I think it makes her even more attractive. "
"The crime of attempted murder requires intent to kill. Dumb as it was for  granny to give the kid a cookie, she didn't mean to kill her. She seems to have truly believed that no harm would come to the child. Reckless endangerment would fit much better.

When prosecutors bring charges on a person, they have to think of whether a jury would convict someone of those charges. Most likely, any murder trial would end in a Not Guilty verdict since it cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the granny knew for sure that the kid would die. Reckless endangerment, however, would be easy to prove since the granny willfully took a chance to prove a point."
It's your wife's house too. Most of the people here are offering compromises because that's what you do in adult relationships.
"Holy shit she sounds unhealthy for you to be around.  You are *extra small, losing weight* have an *eating disorder* and she bought you *large* clothing.  That's either super dimwitted or malicious.  My money is on the latter. "
and you like definitely didn't give her like accidental signals that ur into poop stuff right??
See I have ADHD and I'm chronically late to both my job and hanging out with friends! And other very important stuff. It's terrible. I hate my brain sometimes 
"The problems you are having (standard of cleanliness etc) are normal relationship problems. The way your wife deals with them are NOT.

It is NOT normal and ""just part of life"" to have massive amounts of yelling and throwing things, in front of a toddler no less. It is NOT normal for her to expect you to read her mind and get irate when you do things the way you think is best. 

Your wife is verbally abusive, refuses to change, and refuses to get help. Yes, it may be good sometimes--but if abusive relationships were all bad all the time, fewer people would be in them. Ask yourself if this marriage is really the best thing for you and your child. Do you want your kid growing up to think this is normal?"
"Upvoting because, yes, it sounds like there is some weird gender stuff going on here that needs to be addressed.

The existence of women who have short hair/don't wear pink/don't wear makeup/wear pants/whatever shouldn't be upsetting to you."
"Yeah she's never been in trouble before. I used to be that way too. I would smoke weed ANYWHERE, any time and almost have a feeling of ""fuck you"" towards law enforcement. Not anymore..."
"Indeed, many unscrupulous grad schools give out scholarships to 2/3 of the class, and then require you to stay in the top 1/3rd to keep it"
"The thing is, when you start making adult choices (like having sex in the first place, and *especially* having unprotected sex), then you start having to deal with adult *consequences* of those choices.

If it turns out that she is pregnant, then you have some *more* adult choices to make."
Face masks no- but she does mention hair masks as well. Definitely a personal thing but I despise the feeling of lotion on my body and have to wait for it to fully dry. 
"I am writing this to you as an adoptive mother myself with a beautiful 3yr old boy. I would never ever badmouth his birth mother, not in front of him not with friends not with family. I have respect for her and the love she has for our son. 
Any child that is adopted, no matter the back story, needs to know that they were loved from the moment they entered into this world. He does not need my feelings clouding whatever decisions he might make when he is an adult regarding contact with birth family. 
What your SIL said was callous and irresponsible. She is showing that she is not ready to deal with the complexities of raising an adopted child. If she has no respect for you how will she have respect for the child she has chosen to raise? You are after all forever going to be a part of the child's story no matter the path your life has taken. 
I don't know what you should do. Maybe keep your child while you consider other options. There are other people out there who might do a better job of raising your child and respecting your sacrifice. This is a decision you will have to carry for the rest of your life and you need to make sure it's the right one, firstly for your child, secondly for yourself. 
I wish you both all the best."
"Why not ask your own partner, the only important opinion here, what she thinks about this? But I think you already know the answer to this question.

It's not the gender difference, or even being alone together. It's the history and context with this particular person that makes it bad."
"Maybe I'm missing some of the detail, but the the stroller have a way for the car seat to be attached? That way you have the two matching bits together, and then have the black car seat in the car.

"
"Whoa, I'm so sorry she's reacting like that, and glad you have the strength to take some distance from her.

For what it's worth, the vast majority of female doctors I've gone to see have had short hair. Especially surgeons. It's so, so common. If anything, I think medical professionals consider it the more practical choice to have short hair if you're working in a hospital environment."
"&gt;  I'm the only one there who can take care of her right now. I know she hates drinking, but I know she's doing it anyway. I know she's barely eating. She'll drink, she'll throw up, she'll drink again. If I was there, I could make her feel better. She wouldn't drink. I'd give her some water, and put her to bed. I don't mind sitting in her puke all night if I have to, I just want her to feel better.

She's an adult that shouldn't need to be ""taken care of"".  You're talking about her like she's an invalid.  I understand feeling this way but that's pretty creepy language to use man"
"Have you discussed your feelings with him? I don't think it's that he loves you less, they just seem manipulative and your bf is a doormat who can't stick up for himself. He also seems to not empathise with you - not buying you birthday gift is particularly bad, even something small.

Why do you pick him up from work if he can drive? Why do you lend him money when he clearly doesn't struggle for money? You also need to start sticking up for yourself and voicing your concerns when your bf does something you don't like

"No one is all bad. Literally HITLER wasn’t ALL bad.

This behavior is waaaay across the line. When someone demands things like this, your brain needs to translate his words to, “I am not capable of a respectful relationship. You should not date me.”"
"It's not like all women have to be friends with each other, so I'm not seeing how that should be a red flag to anyone in this situation. That idea rankles me. A woman is not obligated to ""make nice"" with others just because they're female. Sometimes you meet someone and just don't feel a desire to get to know them better, and that's not wrong to do. Being friends with one half of a couple isn't automatically suspicious.

And no, drake leaving Holly doesn't ""prove"" that she was right to be insecure and jealous. It just shows that she pushed him too far and he stopped putting up with it. Holly created a self fulfilling prophecy. "
"Well, if you live in a Vault-Tech Vault, I doubt that a car seat will protect you long anyways."
"Hi OP,

My boyfriend, while not in the same boat as you, has a very similar issue. He has trouble cumming and always has since he was sexually aware. He can't really jerk off because it would take hours.

He's had girls feel completely wrecked because he couldn't cum with them.

And you want to know a secret? Even though he says he's cum more with me than any of his previous partners, when he rarely doesn't get off it can still nag at my self esteem. Logically I know it's just how he works, and I know it's hard on him too, but feelings of inadequacy still can rear their ugly heads. 

She is on an emotional roller coaster of insecurity and unfortunately, the only thing that's going to help is patience from you and therapy. I know a lot of people are saying she's being way overboard, but I disagree entirely. 

She is going through a lot and is struggling with everything. She's thinking you don't love her as much, that you lied to her, that she isn't attractive, that she's not as good in bed, etc.

Are any of these true? Probably not. But unfortunately sometimes insecurities can take a real and scary hold of our emotions and thought process.

My main advice is not to respond to her outbursts and stay neutral. But to reassure her and comfort her when she's in a calmer state and let her have that opportunity to get all the ""crazy"" emotional reactions out. Then suggest therapy and actually do it. Find a therapist that specializes in sex, personal, and monogamous relationships and make an appointment as soon as possible.

If you want to work past this with her you are going to have to be patient. These insecurities won't go away in a month or maybe even a year. It's going to take both of you wanting to work on this as a team."
"The medical advice seems to be the excuse you’ve given yourself to force contact, or justify why they should accept your contact. It sucks, but it takes two to tango and if they don’t respond it becomes harassment at some point. I’m sorry, but, I don’t think they want to acknowledge you. I’m really sorry"
"It is from the Bible - but it generally means do not give something of great worth (in this case, business knowledge) to those who either will not appreciate them or don’t deserve/understand them (in this case, the sister who refused to learn anything about the business before this point)."
"My sister is in the best law school in our country. She goes to school with mostly people older than her as well as some 40 year olds.

Sounds like this is your brother's problem. You could tell him to stop being an ass to you because he did something stupid and got into trouble. 
"I have a friend who only very recently came out to everyone in his life and the very last person he told was his female best friend. The way he later explained it was that telling her made it final and true because she was the only girl he had ever, maybe, possibly, seen a future with. "
"You and your sister might want to consider renting an apartment together instead of paying rent to live with your parents.  Bottomline : it’s your parents s house, they can pay the rent/mortgage without any financial contribution you and your sister may be making therefore they hold all the cards. They don’t have to wash their dishes nor clear their clutter if they don’t want to. Move out."
"This👏🏻Is👏🏻Spot👏🏻On

Your family of narcissists is doing their best to manipulate you into getting you back under their control. As soon as I heard the whole “he left the room crying and then was heard throwing up” I think my eyes rolled back into my head far enough to see behind me. What a load of shit. This guy is being dramatic to make everyone feel bad and your mother is obviously more concerned about him than you. Do your best - he’ll, do ANYTHING - to stay independent of them and pull yourself out of whatever your going through without their help. "
"I'm a corporate attorney and make great money.  I helped my friend this past week with her holiday party.  She's a kindergarten teacher.  I was there an hour and...oh my God.  She's amazing (I knew that anyway), horrifyingly underpaid and anyone that.questions her work ethic is out of touch and kind of terrible.  I was exhausted."
Yeah. It looks like he got more of a gift for himself than for OP. It's pretty obvious that he wanted the Google Home system to use it and killed two birds with one stone by gifting it to OP. I'm wondering if giving her the waffle maker was his way to get OP to make waffles for him because he is the one who likes them? Lol.
"Congrats on your sobriety, your lady and your future family"
"How long have you guys been friends?

I'm glad he hasn't said or done anything inappropriate, but often when grown men groom girls your age, they spend a lot of time (months or years) trying to establish a friendly rapport while doing favors for the girl so that they can manipulate the girl into believing they ""owe"" them romantic or sexual favors down the road. Be on the lookout for this possibility.

You say he has friends his own age- have you spent a lot of time with them? 

What is your own friendship situation like? Are you close to any of your peers?

The way you met seems concerning. Call me paranoid, but that may have been a way for him to test your ability to trust strangers see if he could manipulate you further.

How old is his girlfriend? If I was his girlfriend and in his age range, there is zero chance I would be comfortable with him being close friends with a 15 year old. If his girlfriend is in high school, that's even more concerning. 

This is probably my most unpopular opinion on the matter: many posters here are saying that if your parents know and are ok with this, it's a probably fine. I believe if you are hiding this friendship from your parents, it's a red flag. However, if your parents know and approve, it's not a green flag. Adults who groom teenagers sometimes manipulate their parents, too. 

I hope this doesn't sound judgemental- I truly hope that nothing bad happens here, and perhaps it won't. I just know a lot of unhealthy relationships adult men seeking out teenagers for friendships that initially appear happy and platonic and eventually develop into something bad. I truly hope my gut is wrong here, but I'm a little worried for you.

2 marriages and 2 sets of kids is fast. Who knows how many relationships he's had. 
"In the medical field, it's probably a plus cos the hospitals don't have to worry about hair peeking out of hairnets"
"&gt; it's not JUST that it was positive things said about the past relationship... But that there is a perceived betrayal here.

There is literally no betrayal here.  It's understandable that the girlfriend feels uncomfortable that he used to date someone that did some thing better for him than she does, but that is going to be true for every ex that every person she dates has and it's something she's going to have to learn to cope with.  I also agree that people can be irrational and unreasonable at times, and that it's not helpful to just label emotional responses as ""crazy"" and ignore that the person needs help, but that doesn't make her behavior at all reasonable or okay"
"You’ve mentioned multiple times here how much money you make, how desirable you are, how you’re a “total package.”  It’s possible that you’re only looking for mates that you perceive as “worthy of you” instead of people who you might connect with and love on a deeper level.  If you’re focusing on strivers, gold diggers, people who love the superficial - you’ll find yourself with people willing to cheat because they don’t love you, they love the image of themselves you help them create."
"As she’s in the uk, /r/legaladviceUK may be more appropriate."
It's cool that you're OK with her dancing with other guys but she really needs to be aware that most guys would take that as a green flag. So if she's going to do it innocently she needs to be aware of them potentially making a move on her. And prepare for what she's going to do in that situation. You need to talk to her again to see clarify this. 
Bring her to a psychiatrist asap. She needs to speak with a professional. 
"Woah dude you need to seriously stop jumping to conclusions on this. I have no idea about watches and this could happen to me looking for a nice watch for my fiancé! People pass knock offs off as real and even charge a high price for them. There is a high possibility she has no idea at all this watch is a fake. 

I’m curious why you seem to WANT this to be something she has done maliciously. You haven’t even spoken to your wife about this and you are so insistent that she has done this on purpose.

I feel so bad for your poor wife honestly... She probably thought she was doing something very nice for you that you would appreciate."
"Hi, you're being awful. You snooped through her phone, found out she had sex with someone else after *you* broke up with *her*, and then called her a slut and destroyed a bunch of property. If she were writing in right now, I'd tell her to break up with you. 

You need to figure out how to handle your feelings. Look up therapists. Look up anger management resources. She should not be apologizing for doing nothing wrong. You should be figuring out how to handle your jealousy and anger in non-destructive ways. "

"It sounds like he has an issue with alcohol or drinking responsibly. I was this guy. I would never stop at my predetermined limit. I drank until I couldn't anymore. I'd be that funny guy everyone laughs at, then become someone who can't shut up, says and does dumb shit, etc. Although I'm never violent, the point is alcohol, for people like us, just has no place in our lives. Be it psychological or physical. I cut out alcohol from my life and every once in a great while I decide to try it again. Never goes good. I get depressed and feel stupid. Even when I don't do anything dumb, I still feel like shit mentally. Anyway I'm just going on and on here but if he is willing to cut out alcohol and he sticks with that promise, give him a chance. If he's not violent when sober, and he seems to feel genuinely bad about what happened, he will make changes and the best thing for you right now is to comfort him because although he fucked up, deep inside it's eating him and he feels like the biggest piece of shit right now.

"Why?
If OP didn't match the wedding colors or style of the bridesmaids dress then she should be fine."
"All entirely possible. However not knowing what kind of woman his ex is, I can see how she might consider taking him back as finally *winning* against the sister and anyone else who ever doubted her. 

I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's not entirely out of the question. "
"Sounds like the friends who wanted to go pick up girls got him to do just that. 

Flat out ask him. "
I don't think any of us need a psych degree to see that this chick is super insecure and believes her own shit don't stink. 
"Yes, that's a totally normal number. As long as she was safe and everyone involved was a consenting adult, there was nothing wrong with any of those encounters. And think about it; she's probably been having sex for to close a decade. Three-ish people a year isn't crazy."
"Unless there's more to it, I don't see how this constitutes to emotional abuse. The ""id rather kill myself"" comment was a bit iffy but people flippantly say stuff like that all the time. If you'd said something along the lines of ""if we don't leave now, I'm going to kill myself"", THAT would be emotionally manipulative. And when you care about someone, often you do say that you are doing things for them. It's just part of a relationship. 

She's obviously very sensitive to this... has she been in an emotionally abusive relationship before? That could be why she's reacting so strongly to fairly innocent remarks?

You need to talk to her about it, but no, I do not believe you are being emotionally abusive based on this post."
"You're being a complete immature little brat.

I know that's harsh, but it's true. You're acting completely entitled and selfish. It's one day. Suck it up and go. And don't pout in the corner like a toddler who didn't get their way.

Your parents literally don't have to do anything more for you than put a roof over your head and feed you. Do they do more for you than that? Do you get birthday and Christmas gifts? Have a smartphone? Gaming system? They don't have to give you any of that shit. 

Grow up a little. Go to the wedding."
Dude that wasn't a compliment. You're acting like an ass. Suck it up and go to the wedding.

"She should also feel rightfully hurt her mother cares more about keeping her step father happy than allowing her own daughter to stay for a couple of days in her own childhood home with her. I get she is having issues with her husband. But this is your own daughter and there is nothing in the post that implies they have had any issues. I would tell my SO that our marital issues are our own, but I'm not dragging my kid into them and they have as much right to the family home as they do. "
"It sounds like this may be a source of lifelong friction. Your faults will be colored by your lack of faith. Even if you have faith, it's not the right amount for her, which basically means you don't have faith. 

If you do have kids get ready for some fights of biblical proportions about you not going to church. In her eyes, you will be setting a horrible example for your children by not going. If you loved them you'd go, because that's what a REAL believer would do for his family. 

So she wants you to get more involved with her faith as a compromise. What happens when you ask her to be less involved with her faith? 

I've dated women like this. They weren't bad people. They were just raised in a way that made it very difficult for them to see the other side of things. Right is right and wrong is wrong and going to church is right. 

The really sad part was my religious ex truly believed she was trying to help me and I wouldn't let her. It wasn't about converting someone for god points, it was that she cared about me and wanted to save my soul. She just couldn't understand why I didn't know in my heart the same things she did and it made her incredibly sad or angry. 

Think of how doctors must feel when a patient refuses simple effective medicine in favor of prayer healing. That's how she felt

Good luck. "
"It's a cultural thing.  I think it's American, but I'm not even sure because I'm American and I definitely wasn't raised like that nor do I think there's anything wrong with the 18-23ish age range being transitional towards independence.  Unless something is up with your family, it's weirder to suddenly flip a switch at 18 than to have a healthy transition of responsibility and independence."
"You really don't see how roommates and someone you thought you were spending your life with are different? Really? 


If my roommate disappears for 3 *weeks* I don't even know that I'd be concerned. If my bf or even a family member I lived with couldn't be reached for 3 days, especially after something big happened, I'd be either pissed or freaking out. "
This is perfect. Thank you.
"A proposal can be a surprise, but the whole idea of an engagement shouldn't be.  You should have discussed the whole idea with her before you ever thought about talking to her dad.  You aren't marrying him.  Even if his blessing is important to both of you, it's not the final deciding factor here.

You need to sit down with your girlfriend and talk about your future and possible marriage.  No knee, no ring, no dad, just talk.  Are there things you two need to work on before you should consider getting engaged.  I'm going to throw in communication as a HUGE one.  You two clearly aren't good at communicating.  If marriage is on the table for the future, I would highly recommend you get some couple's therapy to work on your communication and other issues, as well as your expectations for your marriage and future.  There is a lot to consider here that you two obviously haven't talked or thought enough about.  

You also need to be open to the idea that she doesn't want to get married to you.  Her first response to the question was to ask if you'd asked her dad.  That makes it seem like she was looking for an out, hoping you didn't ask him.  

How long have you two been together?"
"Hell, I hope she files for sole custody. Their co-parenting arrangement is a traumatizing wreck to begin with, the extended family is all referring to the kid’s mother as “The Whore,” and now there’s some kind of remorseless calculating life-ruiner in the mix? First wife should extract herself as much as possible. Second wife should maybe think about the underlying issues here too."

"from the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC 1281): 

&gt; Those who die for the faith, those who are catechumens, and all those who, without knowing of the Church but acting under the inspiration of grace, seek God sincerely and strive to fulfill his will, are saved even if they have not been baptized.

she is a catechumen, a convert to Christianity who is studying the faith but has not yet been baptized - thus she is still saved by her belief in Christ, and baptism is not a necessity for her to be saved in the eyes of Catholicism.

"The only time I take off my underwear is seeing a gyno and as you know, they've seen everything.  "
Just so I understand correctly.. you were fine with her dancing with this random dude up until the point that he touched her lower back and got too close ? 
"Hell no. Doesn’t matter one bit. My GF has been with probably 3 times that many people. Do I get a little jealous if I start to think about that in detail? Of course. But can I blame her for anything she did before I met her? Hell no. It probably actually made her better in bed, so fuck it. She’s with ME now, and that’s what matters. She’s been with many men, but still loves having sex with only me now. So I take pride in that she chose me after all that. 

Some men might try to make a big deal out of your situation, but they’re the wrong guys for you anyway. They’d be too jealous of a boyfriend. I don’t think 35 is super high for a 25 year old. That’s what? Like 4-5 people a year depending on how long you’ve been active? That’s not that many. Live your life. There are plenty of men out there that will see past any sexual history you have.

Cheers and good luck!"

"&gt;She was my goddess

Woman worship is problem #1

"This should be higher.  I'm not Muslim, but have a Muslim friend that had similar situation (wife was off the charts lazy and expected to be catered to).  The Imam actually encouraged divorce."
"You can find a small bit of solace in that she told you immediately after. Not enough to outweigh her infidelity, but a small bit of info to take into consideration when you are looking at your options.


How big a deal you make of it is however much this crosses your boundaries. Obviously it was out of line and you should not tolerate it happening ever again if you decide to stay with her. She cannot control herself or her drinking so she should consider cutting down or cutting it out."

"I'm just imagining a guy saying, ""Well, *my woman* will have to wear a large princess-cut diamond with solitaire rubies around it so everyone will know how much I spend on her and how good her life is with me.""

Or maybe, ""I want you to be a practical, humble wife who wears a modest band and is grateful for it.""

There's no way someone who wants his input to override the wishes of his fiancee's, on the issue of what she and she alone will wear every day, comes out looking good. Notice how he doesn't offer to give HER input on his future wedding ring in return, and she doesn't even think to ask because why on earth would she have minute stylistic preferences over a ring she won't be wearing.

Everyone commenting that she's being greedy by insisting on her chosen ring style because it's ""his money""... relationship finances don't work like that! Or at least, one hopes they don't. Unless you are very very rich, spouses effectively share finances, and major expenses should be a joint purchase with the amount agreed upon by both. Not the husband shouldering the costs alone.

If u/Goodtimes32 boyfriend doesn't want them to spend $1600, he should just say so, instead of hedging over her probable ""disappointment"" because that already makes it clear he doesn't want to get her the ring she likes.

So boyfriend, why the hell not? Are you concerned about spending? Did you already buy a different ring and can't be arsed to return it? Or are you a control freak who wants to dictate what your woman wears?"
"An engagement ring is a gift from one partner to another, purchased and given as a symbol of the promises that go along with marriage.  So if you picked out and bought yourself a ring, that’s not an engagement ring, it’s a piece of jewelry.  If you think it’s pretty and enjoy wearing it, that awesome, bit it’s not an engagement ring.   

I am not overly romantic, and some of what you said resonates with me. I say that so you know that I agree with you that your friend is a bit overly romantic.  That being said, I do think you are unusually stoic.   I talk up my partner in public not because it’s expected of me, but because I genuinely think the world of him and am excited about him. His accomplishments make me proud because I love him, and I want him to receive accolades for being the great guy he is.   It’s not an act I put on. Likewise when I post pictures on social media...I think he’s handsome as hell and I want to show him off a little.   Most people do these things out of genuine emotion, not because that’s “what you do” in a relationship.  

The same thing can be applied to you constant analyzation of your relationships and the reasons you have ended past ones.  Your friend is a “love conquers all!” kind of person.  But you and I know that love isn’t enough, and many relationships have been destroyed by lack of compatibility.   The thing is, are you giving your partners the chance to make reasonable changes? If something in your relationship is bothering you, do you talk to your partner and give them the chance to work on it with you? Or are you just marking it down in the “negative” column and when you get enough negatives you bail?  If it’s the latter, this may be what your friend is picking up on, and is concerned that you aren’t going to make reasonable efforts to work through problems in your relationships. 

The way you have described yourself and your relationships isn’t totally unhealthy, but it’s also not typical. The way you feel and act makes you an outlier.  Does that mean you have to change anything? Not if you and your partner are happy.  But if you want to explore this a bit further, just know that most other people are somewhere between yourself and your friend.    "
I bet he's done this before too. 
"I'm in an open relationship and have been doing various permutations of poly since the mid 90s and your fiancee's behaviour is awful. Not only is contrary to what poly/open should be (open refers as much to the communication style as the sexual relationship), it's manipulative and coercive.

The problem isn't that she wants an open relationship. The problem is that she's brought it up when a third party is already involved and she's trying to push you into excusing her underhand behaviour.

Unless an open relationship has the active consent and opportunity to communicate for everyone in it, it's not open. It's infidelity dressed up with fancy concepts to hide the fundamental lack of respect.

I'm actually in the opposite situation that I started out dating my BF and sleeping with other men, then got involved with his wife and fell madly in love with them both and decided I didn't want to sleep with anyone else. 

I was worried they would be unhappy with the change in relationship and it was scary talking about it but we talked it over in some big conversations, some small but meaningful comments and I spoke to my therapist a lot. There was no pressure of anyone seeing anyone else and it never occurred to me to guilt trip, coerce or utter ultimatums even though it really mattered to me.

So picture it this way: if your fiancee and you already had an open relationship and she wanted to close it would you be happy with her language, behaviour and timings and the way she is communicating? Because that's how you know you know it's about a poly relationship and someone isn't just trying to bribe you into a 'hall pass' so they can cheat and pass the buck to you.

And spoiler alert: your fiancee just wants permission to behave badly. The issue here is her not the style of relationship. She's manipulative AF (and people like her give poly a really bad name on top of breaking their partners' hearts.)

Trust your gut instincts. You have done nothing wrong. Monogamy is great for some people. Poly is great for some people. Your partner trying to coerce you is not good for anyone. "
"I know two sisters who were in a similar arrangement. For several years it worked but eventually the younger sister and her husband wanted to be independent and self sufficient. Their incomes had gone up enough that they were able to afford a small fixer-upper. Unfortunately the older sister and her husband could not afford the shared home on their own and it wasn't easily sellable because of renovations they had made specific to it being a shared home. They had to cash out their retirement, undo the renovations and then they still sold it at a loss. They are now in a home that is not nearly as good for them as one they could have bought in the first place. Also the sister's relationship has never really recovered. "
"Because marriage is the socially approved way of saying ""I choose you for the rest of my life, and I am going to do everything in my power to make this partnership work."" Who doesn't want someone else, someone they love, to demonstrate that they love you back in that same ""I'm all in"" sort of way?"

"Okay, so there’s leaving towels all over the apartment after you shower. There’s leaving dirty dishes out for too long.

"You clearly don't like your cousin or his girlfriend much. Spending time with them, talking to them, and following them on social media stresses you out.

I volunteer for a rescue myself, so I know how...*passionate* volunteers/workers can get. They're never really going to get over you buying a dog, especially after all the escalation on both sides. 

So yeah. Wash your hands of it. 

(Also not relationship advice, but dog advice: be very careful with an Australian Sheperd *puppy* around your daughter. I wouldn't leave them alone together until your daughter is at least as big as the dog, and the dog is trained to obey her commands 100% of the time. Aussies can be bullies to children, seeing them as in need of herding.)"

"&gt; Also, you don’t know his parents’ situation. It could be possible that his mom and dad have an open marriage and that they don’t want their son to find out.

&gt;He literally got on his knees and begged me not to say anything to anyone, especially not his son or wife.

Which part of that suggests that maybe it's an open marriage? The terror of having his wife find out?"
"I recommend getting a dog.

No, for serious. Dogs take and return that sort of emotional intensity beautifully. They love spending all their time with you. Their lives revolve around yours. They make you feel special and loved. You want devotion from him that isn't healthy in a relationship, but it's perfectly healthy and natural to get from a dog.

Then, with your partner, you can focus on those things only another human can give you: communication, respect, understanding and intellectual companionship. He isn't bearing the brunt of ALL your emotional needs. That means you can make sure you're with him because you two actually LIKE each other and not just NEED each other."
"She's being selfish? I agree that OP sounds like she's coming down hamhandedly, but I also would guess that she's freaking out. I don't think she's being selfish by feeling betrayed and shocked by something huge like this. Not sharing your plans with your wife, of all people, and keeping her in the dark isn't cool at all, and is incredibly selfish. 

That's said, OP, I think this situation is going to be incredibly difficult for both of you. But like the other posters are saying, you need to sit down and have a difficult conversation with your husband before you do anything. Take the next couple of days to calm down. Then let him know that you two need to discuss what you found immediately. "
"I'd definitely see if your mom can go to bat for you - that is a long-lasting relationship for Cathy to throw away, the more you explain this the less sense it makes.

Spend the day with your husband. Spend the day how you would like to spend it. *In fact*, turn off your phones and leave the house. This way your family can't call you, or stop by your house to harass you.

"What a joke. Life has screwed this woman over recently. Her husband fucking left her for someone else after 15+ years and she lost her job and is broke, through no fault of her own. I see anything but a victim complex. She's willing to work at anything to make some money. She didn't ask any favors of anyone. She accepted this guy's OFFER for her to move in for a short time while she got back on her feet, and he went back on it. Quite rightly, she put an end to his cosy fuckbuddy arrangement and told him to go fuck himself when he finally offered her his place out of guilt. What a champ."

"Everyone’s giving you a hard time here, but frankly I see exactly why that would bug you. It would bug me too. Yeah, breasts aren’t sex organs, but in our culture they *are* sexualized. If, for that reason, it makes you uncomfortable then that she’d do that, then your feelings are perfectly valid. Of course, on the other side of the coin, she’s entitled to her views about this too, and she seems to have a more open, non-traditional view of modesty. Try to talk to her about it, but at the end of the day, neither of you are wrong here. Yoi both have equally valid points of view, and so you each have to decide if the other’s views on this particular thing is going to be a deal breaker or not. "
"This is ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous. You're going to waste the next 2 years in this faux relationship only for him to dump you and immediately get engaged to a Muslim woman his family approves of. Mark my words. It's a promise.

"&gt; The age range didn't really bother me as I've always been mature for my age,

This shows your immaturity right there. When someone claims that they are mature in this type of situation, really it means they aren't mature because they can't see that it's not normal for a 24 year old to be interested in a teenager. 

&gt; I see these age gaps normalised in movies like Dirty Dancing and wonder what's wrong with it now.

THOSE ARE MOVIES. They aren't really life. If you're basing your real life decisions on what you see in film, that really shows how disillusioned you are. You've very very immature for this kind of thinking. 

This is not a healthy relationship at all. He is using you. I don't know for what, but you have to question someone at his age going after a teenager.

"He's an asshole. 

There are more incidences of developmental disorders/birth abnormalities now, and it's thought to be because of the increased amount of chemicals and pesticides. 

I have heard that girls born with ambiguous genitalia produce more estrogen, because their bodies are trying to compensate for the increased testosterone (it's something I learned in high school, don't remember exact detailing). Thus, girls with it are more beautiful (clearer skin, thicker hair, bigger breasts) as a result.

There are many guys who will not care about an operation you had as a baby. 

Edit: I am sorry for being insensitive, as one comment made clear. While I think girls with thicker hair and bigger breasts are more conventionally beautiful, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and it matters more who you are inside. I was trying to make OP feel better, but I didn't go about it in the best way."
"Yeah, you were an ass. Different women have different problems on their period. Some get basically incapacitated to different degrees whether it's the pain, or generally feeling like shit, or being hormonally fucked over. Some get all three at once.

You're her BF, not her dad. "
"In my husband's dysfunctional family, despite age gaps all kids were treated quite differently. He and his brother were regularly beaten black and blue. For two of his sisters, in the very rare occasion they'd ""get a beating"", his dad would hit the bed with the belt and they'd yell and cry to make everyone think they were getting hit. And his youngest sister did get beat with the belt, especially after my husband moved out, but not hard enough to leave the kinds of bruises the boys got. She might get a few red marks, not be black and blue from the small of her back to the backs of her knees. The guys seeing him change in the locker room probably had a better idea of what he was going through (and they'd comment on it) than his own sisters."

&gt;I said to her that every woman has their period and should be able to deal with the problems 

This is quite an ignorant thing to say. Periods affect different women differently at different points in their lives. I've had cramps so bad I've nearly passed out. I've had really bad exacerbations of my depression that have made me almost suicidal. I've also had periods where I barely felt them, and periods that weirdly enough made me feel energetic. There's such a wide spectrum of period responses and you can't always deal with them.

I would apologise."
It's completely legal. She's old enough to babysit others now. 
"If she was not hot or a brother would any of this even be an issue?

Honestly it was rude of him to not finish watching the movie with you. 

But then you spent the whole next day passive aggressively punishing him. 

One third of this is you being insecure. Why even bring up her boobs ffs?

One third of this is him being rude &amp; breaking plans/not prioritising you.

One third of this is shit communication from both of you."

Still here some 10 years later. "

"You need to take it out of the shower, have a serious talk. Make sure he is 100% clear that you are not angry in a funny way but seriously not happy about what he's done.    
    
Be active, not reactive. Don't wait for him to do it to tell him not to. Tell him now."
"Seconded. OP, if you’re in the US, the National MS Society provides services to people living with MS and to their families. They also have community programs and support groups. You are not alone. "
"My neighborhood is great for the most part, but I left a bag out on my porch overnight (d'oh!) and someone stole it. The police found it two blocks over, nothing was missing because there wasn't anything in there someone could easily sell, but the officer told me that people just walk around with nothing better to do and steal stuff. They'll try car doors to see if they're unlocked and grab stuff. I would think the same would go for a home, although that would scare the shit out of me if I were a would-be thief. I live in a small city, in a residential neighborhood. I didn't really think crime happened here, but I guess there are opportunists everywhere. I'm locking my door now."

"Because the vast majority of people do not sleep as deep as you. Don't be obtuse. 


Especially a new mom will not sleep very deep but be very intuned to her newborn's slightest stir. If a woman is breastfeeding it is very common that the symbiosis between mother and infant becomes so perfect that she'll wake up to feed the baby before the baby is even fully awake itself. This is why safe sleep practices reccomend that babies sleep in the same room as the parents for at least the first 6 months. And if they are bed sharing, then it is reccomended that the baby only sleeps next to the primary caregiver.  "
"Ex gf was 28. Current gf is 25. 

but I agree with you completely. She's getting mad at him about things he can't go back and change? She needs to grow up."
"I know it seems absurd but Michael didn't tell his mum about Emily or Isobel until after they died. And only because his mum noticed how depressed he'd become. It makes sense to me his family never connected the dots because of the relationship he has with them (he doesn't tell them much). 

I think it's a bit crazy he never did the math himself, you're right. But the baby looked so much like him and Michael is a very trusting person. Isobel also named the baby ""Emily"" which she knew was a special name to Michael. To be honest, because I know so little about their relationship, I can't be sure why Michael never questioned it, and why Isobel lied."
"These types of views are toxic and dehumanizing. It will color his interactions with your family and with your friends. He may view you as one of the “good ones” now, but what if you two fight or you make a mistake and it reinforces one of his stereotypes. His invective may start to be directed toward you. That’s not to mention his 19th century views on having kids with you. There is no future with this man as he currently is, but you breaking up with him may serve as a wake-up call."
"Seriously. Called just twice and message a handful of times? 


I don't understand why he couldn't even take half an hour each day away from his friends to get on skype or facetime to have a face to face conversation with her at the very least. This was his fetus as well. He's acting like she came down with the cold or something instead of going into an emergency surgery and suffering complications afterwards from the result of a *pregnancy*. I'm pissed just reading about it. "
"I get that you're angry at your bf, but it was your responsibility to not let him inside you until you knew he was clean. You are just as responsible for the situation you're in and while your bf was irresponsible in his past, you're being unfair to him because it wasn't his fault you're at risk chlamydia. Go get an STI screening yourself again."
"Expecting people to wax all-the-time is absolutly a shallow fantasy-land thing.
Hair grows here. Removing it is costly, waste time, very very painfull, cause a higher propability of deseases. Also, ingrown hairs and scratchyness when it grows back.

Just make the addition of how much money and time you will have wasted on it after 40 years. What amazing thing you could have done with al of that instead. 

Sure if you are both into it, it can be a funny thing to do every other months. But it souldn't be required. That's when it becomes idiotic.

The fact that the natural state of the female body is considered neglectfull is a crazy patriarchal-fantasy-land-thing.

Women just don't get to have this much requirement about men's grooming habits.

"
"&gt;Not to mention a completely different person with already obvious character defects

Well, predators do tend to go for minors who are troubled, they are more vulnerable, and more can be blamed on them by society. Are you sure he is into dating women who are not minors?

I don't like how you made the child the bad guy in the sentence I quoted.

You should look up a checklist for codependency and see if you identify with it, because I do not think this situation is good for you."
"&gt;&gt;At the hospital my MIL admitted that she intentionally gave Ella cookies that had both peanuts and dairy in them because she thought we were lying about the allergy so that she couldn’t give Ella treats. She thought by giving her the food she could catch us out and shove it in our faces. Instead she nearly killed her granddaughter and my child.

OMG, this is a relationship extinction-level event. My kids didn't have allergies, but my son had a close friend with a severe peanut allergy and we *bent over backward* to be safe when he came around the house because of how severe the consequence were if he had a reaction. 

Your husband, perhaps, is conditioned to defer to his mother's narcissism, but your child's life is on the line here. If you can afford it, can you get emergency counseling so that your husband can understand, from a neutral third party, that what you MIL did was beyond reprehensible. It was assault at the very least."
"See, you are a full grown man dating someone half your age. No matter what you are going to be in different phases of life, why keep this up? In my eyes this relationship is creepy and weird"
"She's being unreasonable and materialistic there. I've found designer stuff at thrift stores and consignment shops. When I was your age I made my own prom dresses, which was a blast and ensured I didn't look like anyone else. If she's stuck on wanting you to spend $400, she should pony up to get you there."
"hey OP, I have experience with my local child welfare system (probably in a different state but still)—if you decide you want to raise this baby, I have no doubts you can.

when I’ve worked on behalf of family court with families requesting a change in custody, visitation, or guardianship, my agency was primarily looking for the will and the resources to raise a child until age 18. you have support from your twin and their spouse, you have your job, you have your car, you have a place to live; you mention a history of drug use but 3 years sobriety means you’re doing well for yourself and having someone to care for, someone to keep you busy with massive amounts of maternal love, I’m doubtful that relapse will be an issue. 

if you still feel like you don’t want to give it a try, that’s fine too, but if you want to raise your bio daughter and are just wavering because you don’t know if you’re capable of it, you are. much worse parents than you would be have raised wonderful children, and you sound like someone who is smart and who gives a shit. I think you’d be an excellent mom!

if the alternative is setting this child up with someone you have even more faith in, that takes courage too. if it’s a family you know or get along well with you can follow a plan close to your original one if you’d like, remaining involved and helping guide your daughter.

anyway, just my two cents as someone who has known a lot of parents, great and not-so-great. I have no other qualifications to give advice or anything so this is purely reassurance—whatever you choose, you’ve got this!! "
"That's obese, but not to a degree where she should be having issues wiping herself.

At my heaviest I was 226lbs at 5'5, and I'm currently hovering around 200. I'm obese as fuck, but I have no issues wiping my own ass."
"&gt; ""that's nice, I don't care for olives""

Hahaha yeah you cant really come back from that one. Good that was the end of the discussion too."
As a teacher l couldn't agree more with this comment. She keeps telling that she didn't wanted to make him sound like a loser and that we are putting words in her mouth but in all honesty l wish the guy could read this and realize what the concerns of her girlfriend are.
You are both adults and hence can do whatever you want.  Listen to the parents and then tell them that you have considered all that they have said but that you are choosing a different course of action.  Then go out and do what you want.  The umbilical cord has to be cut some time and 28 years is long enough.  
The non hormonal copper IUD is a good option if there are concerns about hormonal birth control. 
"Wife: I don't know what to believe, there are two sides to every story. 

OP: Ask our friends who were witnesses what happened.

Wife: ...nah, I'm good. 

She knows Laura did it. She knows Laura behaved in a ""troublesome"" manner, because that's what Laura does when she drinks. But she'd rather you just put up with it because she doesn't want to admit her best friend is a sexual harasser and a problem drinker. 

If a woman came here telling us her husband wants her to apologise to his best friend for yelling at him for sexually molesting and harassing her, I'd tell her to strongly consider leaving her husband. I'm telling you the same thing. 

Your wife may not know who to believe, but she isn't on your side. "
Any redeeming qualities to this guy? I mean the way you wrote this he sounds insufferable. Maybe you really meant it but you don't want to admit it to yourself. Why are you spending weekends at parents when you are functional adults anyway?
"&gt;  I literally earn more money than him at my job right now, but he has the audacity to call me a failure?

Like he would ever mention that to his friends. Wouldn't impress him enough. 

I'd seriously confront your father about this. And make sure mom knows too. Honestly, I'd tell him either you both work on your relationship or it's effectively over. You can waltz out of his life without being a burden or a ""fuck up."" 

A grown man talking about his own daughter this way is just plain pathetic. "
"Exact same situation here. I keep flip flopping but really, when it comes down to it, he hasn't changed and dying won't make him understand that he actually did something wrong. Seeing him will only make me feel worse. I got my ""closure"" years ago when I decided talking to him was no longer something I wanted to put myself through. "
"Since the fourth baby was unplanned, I hope that the OP’s husband will take that into consideration with his long-term planning.

I’m a firm believer that any number beyond four kids starts cutting into the quality of life for the parents AND the kids."
"As someone that works in law enforcement, many abusers will slip right under their victim's friend's, family's, and even parent's radar. These things regularly come as a total shock to people who probably should've known better. 

I'm not saying he is. But parental approval has failed miserably in the past."
"First of all, drop this fear of being a crazy girlfriend. It's a stereotype that cheating men created to keep their partners in the dark. Be respectful but be absolute. Be the confident girlfriend that stands up for herself.

Secondly, rumours don't mean anything. The first thing someone told my now SO about me was that I'd definitely sleep with him because I'd apparently sleep with anyone. I was a virgin at the time.

However, in saying that, he's either cheating on you already or he will do soon. Hiding conversations is never a good sign, nor is him admitting that she makes him feel good. "
"Maybe OP should write two letters - one with all the good things and one with all the bad, just to get it all out there - then give her son the good letter, and burn the bad. Let his sins die with him. "
"I get what you're saying, but I've done a weekly two-hour drive to take a class before (it's that far to my closest major city).  It doesn't sound like she's being ultra-persistent, she hasn't even asked him out herself.  It's always good to be careful, but just because the girl is a fan it doesn't make her Kathy Bates."
26 year old female here. I completely agree with this comment. I’d never want anything but monogamy with my husband and as far as I know my entire friend circle feels the same.
Do it with Dad there. Surely he'll be able to explain his reasoning when out on the spot 
Kind of puts it in a different light though. Not saying step mom deserves it but... Maybe don't harass someone HAVING A GODDAMN PANIC ATTACK.
"I'm going to have to disagree. An abuser who feels his controlling slipping refusing to allow the victim and their small child to visit the in-laws over the holidays... That absolutely smacks of using control over the child as an insurance policy against her actually leaving him. 

Also, ""refused to cuddle her once"" is not what was described here. What is described is him expecting sexual contact immediately following a fight and being unwilling to accept OP's refusal is valid."
Sleeping around works for some people. Other people get really into painting. Some people dye their hair purple. Do whatever makes you happy and is healthy for you. I really think you have the right attitude about this. I hope your fresh start treats you well :)
"Nope. 

However genuine your reasons, from her perspective why should she believe you after so many chances? From the evidence available to her, she'd be *mad* to trust you. Indeed, given your sustained programme of *not* making a clean break, she'd be mad to even *believe* you: in her shoes I'd assume the ""friend"" was ongoing and that I (work woman) would be the side piece. 

It's classic cheater's speak: *no, that relationship is historical, she means nothing to me.* It's right up there with *my wife doesnt understand me* and *I am in the process of divorcing*. You can't expect her to believe that, even if it's true."
Often enough to have caused many pregnancies and making pulling out not count as safe sex. 
"Maybe you need to branch out.  There are PLENTY of people in their early 20s that's planning for their future.  I'm not saying you are immature.  You've been raising another human being!  But a lot of my friends in their 20s that are thinking 401ks and college funds.  It's not uncommon to discuss real estate, mortgage, stock, and retirement!"
"Is your sister young, too? Is he early 30s or late? I know your question wasn’t about that, but her fiancé sounds so young. 

I’d let this situation go for now. Your sister may need your help for bigger problems later. She may also be thinking she gets some new respect as a future wife. And that’s not how it works. "
"Some really great points in this comment. I’m also very worried for OP about what his fiancée has in mind for their wedding. OP, has she mentioned what she expects for your wedding yet?"
"None of that excuses his actions whatsoever, and none of that would cause anyone besides a psychopath to say those things about their own flesh and blood. Do the issues you mentioned cause people to do hurtful things? Absolutely. But  they definitely don't make someone say those kinds of things about their own daughter just to get a few fucking chuckles from some friends. The dads behavior is abhorrent and inexcusable. "
"What disgusting people. How good to get them as far away from you as possible. 

Have an awesome New Years! Living well is the best revenge &amp; all that jazz"
If OP does go to the police I hope she posts an update. I have no faith that the police would pursue this manner in a criminal way.

"Wait until everyone has calmed down a little bit, then have someone who is the best at words and speaking with sensitivity with your aunt. 

This person should keep in mind that she might be feeling pretty hurt about her son's weight and that even his jokes hurt her, but when your dad joined in, it was an opportunity to find a release valve for the frustration she had been feeling all night. Perhaps, your cousin might be pretty sensitive about his weight as well, but joking is his way of joking about it. It just hurts to hear somebody else joke about it.

None of this excuses her comment, but this is about helping her understand how her comment was hurtful."
"You deliberately and knowingly gave the phone number to Sarah, because you thought it was ok to do this.


After that blew up, Ben and Amanda made it very clear that Sarah was no longer part of their lives, **that they did not want her knowing any contact details about them**.  You then proceeded to disclose address information to Sarah. Why did you do this? Wasn't there an alarm bell going off in your head to change the subject??

You may like Sarah, and you may not agree with what they do in excluding her.  But if you want to repair the relationship with them, you need to comply with their request.

Why so jealous of them anyway???"
She's got a binge drinking problem and she's done this 3 times in less than a year.  You leave her and figure out the gamily stuff as you go
"wow i'm just wondering why you came to the conclusion that the wife is insane and her mother is a r/justnomil from this post?

i feel like both op and his wife acted strangely and that this isn't really a big deal tbh - they should just keep both. "
"Even though I don't believe she's the only red flag here (I was going to say the things about the obvious gap in maturity and the fact that he probably has kids around her age, as well as retirement issues, future dead bedroom and faulty sperm, but seems as though all the other commenters have covered that for me) I think that just because she's a single mom with a house at age 25, doesn't necessarily show any signs of being more mature than most other people her age. 

I've literally met and known DOZENS upon DOZENS of people exactly like her; mid (and even early) 20's with kids and a house, as well as several jobs. Hell, I've met plenty of 18-20 yr olds with their own house (with money they earned themselves) and a kid. A lot of them weren't necessarily more ""mature"" than anyone else their age. So in short, there's not really any proof that she is more mature than everyone else her age. I know it doesn't have a lot to do with the actual subject, but if she's taking her own maturity into account, she's doing it the wrong way."
"Except for all the little *s on CR saying that the car seats they deem ""safest"" haven't been tested properly, by their own admission. Example: this car seat was only tested as front facing with latch system, it wasn't tested as a highback booster, etc. - paraphrasing If CR wants me to believe them, then they need to actually give a FULL report, not some half-assed one. 

And my G-d, even the NHTSA only suggests refacing until 2 years (when a lot of states that's becoming the minimum). Most people who do any reading on the topic knows that children should stay rear facing as long as their car seat allows. 

I stand by what I said, you don't have to agree, all car seats that are properly installed ARE EQUALLY SAFE. Human error be installation or how a child sits in it doesn't make one more or less unsafe than the others. Children that are taught how to sit in their seats (especially sleeping ""looking up"") are less prone for injury during accidents in all seats.

"You've been in a really bad accident. You've broken your back, endured reparative surgery, no doubt months of difficult physical therapy, the healing process is far from finished, and you're literally lucky that you're able to walk. 

But oh, your poor, poor husband -- he doesn't get to boink you as often as he used to. Man, he's got it rough.

Your husband's complaints are *nothing* compared to what you've endured and what remains to be endured. I would read him the riot act. He swore an oath to be there when you needed him, to stick with you for better or worse, and this ain't the worst -- trust me, it'll get worse when you're older. It's well past time for your husband to shut the hell up, be a man, and more importantly *be a husband*. "
"Can confirm.  Am nurse, have seen countless genitals."
"My boyfriend told me he loved me after two months. I wasn't ready yet, and he said that was fine. I said it later, when I felt ready. The fact that he gave me the respect and the space to come to it on my own is one of the many reasons why I feel so happy and secure with him. Give him time. 

Also, maybe have a conversation about what ""taking things slow"" means. It sounds like you're on different pages about that and you'd be happier knowing more about what he means. "
"I understand you now. Your wording was just really, really bad. Still, let's day this was her best effort. If you go into a situation with absolutely no knowledge, it is really hard to find your bearings and you wind up lost. So, let's say she got your link to the watch and wanted to research the company...she opens up Google, types in ""brand name of watch,"" naturally the first results are watches for sale. She probably went down a rabbit hole of bad websites, scams, eBay, etc. She is going to feel super bad.

In another comment you said you are mad she gambled and lost. Dude, she probably didn't know she was ""gambling."" You are seriously dense. Are normally like this? Do you struggle with empathy or do you tend to be very concrete with your thoughts?"
"That's why she feels forced, dude. If she says no you get visibly upset. You can recognize that getting visually upset at someone *when they've done nothing wrong* is a douche move, same thing here. (I've had a couple ExBFs do this. Notice - they are **EX**BFs)

When you get upset do you know what/who you are upset at?"
"I don't think your restaurant analogy works very well, people get meals comped all the time because they don't like them. Especially if there is something missing from the dish that was promised on the menu. "
"This comment is important - I felt the same after reading the post. Their relationship is already more ""relaxed"" than most people's. But in those cases, boundaries still need to be drawn and discussed. I really don't think the GF was at fault here, because she literally didn't know where the line was. OP draws the line at ""hands on lower back"" but never informed the GF of this. GF probably draws the line at ""grinds on me"" or something else just past ""hands on lower back."" This issue is all about communication, and having a normal, non-heated conversation about each of their expectations."
"Uh...

So you didn't clear it with your BF that this dude would be showing up to stay in what is also his place, the dude has a history that includes going after you, and then you excluded your BF from doing stuff with you and this dude...

And another dude is about to show up, too...

And you're wondering what the problem is?

Honestly, I'd be breaking up with you over this 100% just for being that unaware. You don't sound ready to be living with someone.

The problem isn't that you have male friends, it's what you do with them and how you treat your boyfriend."

"Just not necessarily the ""is my bisexuality bad"" crisis. Maybe it's a ""I probably haven't come to terms totally with my bisexuality being a normal and okay thing that doesn't require overcompensation"" crisis.

Well now it's easy to see how she developed her toxic mentality
That and presumably the person who had the least to gain from lying.
"Obviously, he can't put any energy into making your stepbrother pay for anything.

He can, however, get onto your mom and stepdad. He can advocate for you because you are his child. He shouldn't even mention your stepbrother. He should make his argument centered around the fact that your boundaries were violated under their roof. And when you confronted them, they showed a significant lack of disrespect for your boundaries and your feelings, AND blamed you for your boundaries being violated. That they told you to ""be more careful with it,"" when it was out of the way and hidden in your closet and one had to actively seek it out in order to get into it. It wasn't like it was sitting out in the open in your room. I hope this helps!"

I haven't seen a single caring thing for her you did in the entire evening."
"She just pushed his baby watermelon out of her genitals. Postpartum care is SO important. Women sometimes die when they can't get postpartum care. There are  so many things that can go wrong. It's possible she needs the **stitches on her fucking genitals looked at**. So YES making her skip a doctors appointment is ABUSIVE. 

She probably needs the doctors appointment more than the baby right now. She probably had wounds to be checked and she needs her blood pressure monitored and vitals taken. "
"You’ve been broken up with your daughters father for two years, but your boyfriend has been interacting with your daughter for 1.5 years? How quickly did you introduce the two???

My husband and I have agreed that should we ever divorce then our kids will only ever meet a new SO if we’ve been seeing them Consistently for over a year, and it’s a very committed relationship. You should not be introducing a new boyfriend to your kid less than six months after meeting them. That’s a huge warning sign to me, both about your sense of appropriateness when it comes to your children, and your boyfriends motives behind dating a single mother with a very young child."
"Thank you. He never said anything aggressive to my mom, but he was certainly getting under her skin. I think she's glad he apologized, but more glad that she has jer her house back. I hope he will adapt and think about his actions from other people's perspectives.

And as for the outrageous expectations, I will be laying out what guests can expect well in advance from now on."
"Surprised nobody's mentioned this, but if your dad was legitimately asleep and unaware that a sexual act was being performed on him, your servant assaulted or raped him. Do you know if he was actually unaware that happened at all? "
Correct. Too many babies.

"girl. RUN. or make sure she is GONE. She is DANGEROUS. I'm telling u from experience. what she is doing is sick and twisted and TOTALLY not normal. If she feels comfortavle enough making a SHRINE of his things and doesn't think that's odd.... trust me there's a thin line between that and escelation.  It could take one manic episode for her. 

In the end of my experience, the girl actually broke in and pooped on my clothes. peed in my vaginal wash and all my toiletries, tried to stab me and continued to stalk me and my bf for.... a year following jail?"
"&gt; buying the bed

oh goodness, yes, of course: you have no idea about the other person's sleeping habits, so you won't even be able to buy a BED with confidence: you may have miserable sleepless nights! what will THAT do for the marriage. 

Listen, nothing we say will make you change your minds about pre-marital sex and/or cohabitation, but at least realise you are setting up avoidable problems: so cut each other a LOT of slack in the first couple of years. There WILL be incompatabilities (levels of cleanliness, tidyness, spending versus saving, chores...) and the marriage will depend on how well you negotiate those conflicts. "
"This situation is no good, OP, I'm really sorry. The way she approached it is not how open relationships work. 

What she basically said was ""I'm emotionally cheating, and I really want to make it physical, but I'm not sure this guy is worth giving you up so.... I want both. I'm going to do it either way, but I don't want to break up with you, so I'm hoping I can manipulate you into agreeing.""

I know it hurts like hell but you've been given warning that your girl is going to cheat (or already has and is looking to retroactively get permission so she doesn't have to acknowledge that she's an asshole). What you do now is up to you. 

Personally I'd say ""I thought about it a lot and non-monogamy doesn't work for me. I understand that this means the end of our relationship and I think that's for the best. You lied to me about the true nature of your feelings for (guy), spent time with him to encourage the attraction, and made it clear you intend to date him regardless of how I feel. You may not have had sex with him yet but you've become emotionally involved to a degree that I consider cheating, so we're done.""

"It sounds like you know what you're getting yourself into, so why not? Life is short, so why not text him and ask him to go out? I'm not saying being stupid, bring condoms and watch how much you drink, but it's okay to live a little."
God forbid a woman try to show appreciation. Can't even say thanks without you thinking she's flirting.
"you need to work on being more self aware of your behavior.

As the leader/manager of several people, i often have to teach skills to others and have a tendency to start explaining tasks to nearly anyone (including people who don't need an explanation). the best way to counter this type of thing is to catch yourself doing it and realize what you're doing.

but you're so *accomplished*, I'm sure that'll be simple for you."
I wish that were the case
"You would do some form of investigation though. Eventually the stories wouldn’t add up from the sister, a lie that big could have been doubted so to me it sounds like the husband just blind,y believed his sister. "
"This mindset isn't terribly well informed. Art school can be expensive depending on where you go, and not every job pays the same, but jobs in certain areas like technical art, games, animation etc pay fairly well (in the 60-100k range where I live). But that's neither here nor there, it's pretty shitty that OP's parents are showing favoritism at all."
"Chances are, someone like the groom or her new MIL commented to her how stunning you looked. Possibly even her own mother said to her ""You look lovely, but everyone has told me how beautiful OP is tonight.""

You apologized. There is nothing else you can do.

"I don't know how your bf might feel about therapy, but it seems like he has a lot to unpack there.  "
"Give a copy of her letter to your supervisor. Ask your supervisor to advise you. 

If anything in the letter is true, your supervisor will retrain you. If it is not true, he/she will tell you that you are doing fine and don't  worry about it. 

Either way, your supervisor will now know that this coworker is trying to do the job of supervisor and she will now be on the radar."
"You're making a horrible decision. Absolutely tragically horrible. You are incompatible with this guy, and you are making a stupid decision out of petty jealousy.

Frankly, you should go no contact with him and you know it. You are sexually incompatible and not fit for a monogamous relationship. Plus now you've found out that he might be committing statutory rape? No.

Stop yourself. Use your brain. Tell him that it's over forever and lose his number.

&gt;I can’t leave him

You have to. You are literally making a choice that dooms you into a permanent life of unhappiness."
I kind of agree... If this were a man they would be shitting down his throat
Where does it say that?
"While I agree with the commenters who pointed out that anything could have happened (fires, burglaries, neighbours calling CPS), he is most likely going to dismiss this as exaggerations.

So, let’s look at something that can definitely happen with 2-months old, shall we?

What if the baby threw up or needed a diaper change? Your idiot husband might not know this, but babies poo several times a day. How would he like it to be left lying in his own filth? Has he ever heard the term “diaper rash”? 

Would he like it if I filled his underwear with pepper spray? Would he like it to be stuck with clothes that smell like vomit? 

What if the baby needed to eat? 

The end result is always the same: needless distress  for your child. 

Moreover, your dickehead of a husband had options: he could ask his buddies to pick something up for him or they could stay home and order in. 
But he chose to neglect your child. 

"
"That's a weird double standard. If everyone's kissing just for fun, and he can kiss his male friends, and his ex is also just a friend, it should not be weird for you to kiss her. It's understandable if it stirred up some feelings for him, but he doesn't get to label it cheating or hold it against you.

You should tell him what happened, hopefully he'll see it differently when he's sober and rational. Don't go into this conversation acting like you did something terrible - you didn't do anything wrong, he was kissing other dudes, and you had no way of knowing he would react like that.

We've got a broken down van for you! 
"You should not expect financial gifts/favours from your partner if you have not combined finances.

Be more responsible with your money."
"Last time I saw something on askreddit about arranged marriage a guy had to deal with his wife screaming and crying and calling her parents because she thought he was trying to rape her on her wedding night by coming into the bathroom while she showered. The sad thing is, she wasn't taught that specifically - she just assumed the whole procreation thing and thought sex in generally was painful and terrible for the woman. I believed that as well, raised conservative christian and my mom just said 'well, it's for men mostly, they enjoy it'. My mom has since admitted she's asexual."
"Him wanting on average one more kid than me seemed like something we could compromise on (3 is a number in both of our ideals), especially considering people often change their mind on how many once they are actually parents. And I didn't say that's actually how he sees me, I told him that's how I felt because of his attitude."
"Usually I'd agree about telling the wife, but I think OP may have a lot more to lose, especially if the woman leaves her husband and her ex decides to retaliate by suing for visitation or even custody. Her own kid is more important now."
Must have been some date
Tattletale?  What a dipshit.  It’s not like she stole some cookies.  She putting lives in children’s lives in danger.
"The police caught him 3 times already and the only thing they did is a 3 months controlled recovery, when it was over he kept using drugs again even worse than before. Also he smokes just outside of my house 7-8 times a day, 2 years going still not caught."
