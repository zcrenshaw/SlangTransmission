Nah dude def had a fuckin tapeworm 
"It def gets damaging. If I don’t have a set schedule (like I’m on break from class, or little work) I’ll stay up till 5 am, and sleep till 2 pm. My eating habits get fucked, and then so does my gym time. 

When I’m in class or working, I’ll be daydreaming about PUBG, and not work to my full potential, I’ll take longer breaks, etc. 

I know I’m addicted to gaming, and I know it’s bad for me, but I’m just not at that point yet where I want to stop. I just don’t think I’ve had a big enough scare where the video gaming is really effecting me adversely, and that might be the final push that makes me tone it down. "
"Yeah my first thought was ""this was a tonsil turd.. not a popcorn kernel""

If it smelled like bigfoot's dick... def tonsil turd."
