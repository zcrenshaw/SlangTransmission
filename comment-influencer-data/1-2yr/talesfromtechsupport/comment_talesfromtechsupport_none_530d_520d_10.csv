"The Google. The Facebook. The YouTube.


That's when you know you're in trouble."
"I love to reply to these emails and add all the original people back on and say something to the effect of ""you were misinformed but see my attached email that has the correct information"". Then attach the original email where the complaining user was informed of the correct email address. Lol. "

"We're sorry, but our work machines are required to play The YouTube through The Google due to business licensing requirements with The Apple. If you want to use your iTunes we suggest you do so on your PC at home during your off-hours.

Seriously, I assume this is a work machine, is she really telling you she wants to get her iTunes set up on her work machine? I wonder if her manager would be interested in the content of this..."

"I've often considered that, perhaps, the best sort of computer class would be a series of guest speakers providing both a clinical post-mortem, for the lessons in communication, and the I-Shit-You-Not retelling to cover the process - successful or no. "
Because people complained that we were forcing overly complicated passwords on them and it decreased productivity. You are using logic. Stop.

"I used to run the help desk at a university. The university selected a new Registrar, he was a great manager who started as a procurement executive in our IT department. He had been involved with the procurement and implementation of the school's new registration &amp; course records system and they were so impressed they made him the Registrar when the old one left.

On his first day, he started asking questions about the registration &amp; course records system. To his utter shock, he learned that because they didn't like making requests for new accounts or for account permissions, they had ALL started to use the credentials of some of the senior registration employees in the system. Worse, these usernames and passwords had been shared with *student employees*, which meant student employees had full rights on the system, they were in a position to *change their own grades* and the records would only show that the senior employee did it. In fact, ALL corrections &amp; updates in the registration system were apparently by the same group of senior employees.

He called an all-hands, and with everybody in the room he rang up the system admins for the registration system and had every single account locked. Full work stoppage until the issue could be corrected, and a full audit of the carbon-copy forms that students &amp; faculty use to request registration changes, submit or correct grades, etc. was initiated to insure that grades were accurate. Any change that didn't have a corresponding signed form would be investigated.

That was a goddamned trial by fire, and he is still the registrar today."

The real MVP. The story looks great but OP is a philistine for not linking the previous post. 
"I know it is a little spiteful, but you *REALLY* should have replied adding everyone else back in and said ""I would suggest that you let that person know that they have been providing incorrect information to our customers so that we can be preemptive in something like this from occurring again."""

"I am not condoning the actions of those who illicitly leveraged your software to initiate backdoor freelance loans. That is wrong on both a legal and ethical perspective. That being said, I am looking forward to the conclusion because this woman needs to be fired. She is reckless, not only in her complete disregard for basic security, but for letting people go due to circumstances outside of their control. Being the catalyst for all this, I have my fingers crossed that she is shown the door."
"&gt; The lawsuits finally were settled so I am able to write about it now.

"Why were the I.T. techs setting the password for the user? Why not give the user a password that auto-expires after the first use and have them change it? Why no password ""history"" that prevented the user from re-using the same password?

That also means that every tech whoever handled the password resets is also able to log into her account, or am I missing something?"

"Sounds like it's time to develop a separate system with a trigger to pre-screen the bug reports. If it sees a problem with 'the triggers' and no description of which trigger, it sends the report back to the tester with a standard reply saying that it can't be processed without information on which trigger it applies to.  

Maybe another trigger that waits a day, and if there's no clarification, it resends it to the tester and their manager."

"How did this lady not have a wrongful termination suit filed against her like ever? Instead of going that route, people just decided to live beyond the law and steal locked in loans? It's like peeling back layers of an onion. Wow..."
I agree. Show people why these rules are in place (even though it seems obvious to us). Otherwise users just see them as a bunch of arbitrary hoops they have to jump through. 
"You did well. Respond with what you need, they either get with the program and give out the info, or you/they ignore it and move on to something that is making you money. "
"Uninstall iTunes and advise user she does not have authority to enter into a binding agreement like the EULA using a company owned asset.  Then filter her access to youtube, and while you are at it grab the other streaming services into that filter so she realizes the level of her mistake."
Never test for a condition you do not know how to handle.  Programming 101.
"This used to happen so freaking often at Big News Agency.

Some program, or website, or switch or something would go down. We'd send out an email telling what was down, what was affected and when the estimated time of repair was.

There would always be 5 or 10 people (out of a few thousand) that would call and say

&gt;User: I use *specific thing* and it isn't working. 

&gt;Me: Did you see the email we sent saying that *specific thing* was down? 

&gt;User: Yes, but I didn't think that applied to me.

"Duh!  She doesn't have her music library at work, so she has to go to The YouTube to get the music, OF COURSE.  But if it's music and it's coming out of a computer, then it should be using iTunes because it's all the same!  

I swear I'm the only one around here that knows anything about computers...."
"Engineering company I worked for was all PCs.  I wrote some software for common tasks, all of us used it.  New guy comes in wants Mac.  Boss told him ""The software you need to run here runs on PCs, not Macs.""  New guy asked ""What kind of idiot would write software that doesn't run on a Mac?""  Boss said ""Your supervisor.""  

New guy didn't last long."
"I hope the lesson you learned there was, you were the IT guy; you were not the physical Security guy nor the HR guy.

You tell him once, and then you let him walk with the phone and you report it to your manager. After that, either the manager does nothing, or the manager does something; you're covered and you're not unconscious in the parking lot.

Good on him for actually making the call that needed to be made instead of doing the easy thing. 
"At my company for the internal applications, we log every single mouse click our users make.  We also produce and XML file of all their data on a page as they go from page to page that we keep for 30 days. It is basically the same concept as recording. They call support desk and lie about what they did or didn‚Äôt do and we just go through the XML and logs and will be like:
At 1:03:56pm you clicked the drop down box and changed the value from yellow to blue. Then at 1:06:32pm you clicked to change this value from x to y. That is why the system did what it did. 

Thank goodness for recording üòÅ"
"To be fair, he might have gotten away with that when mailing via the post office.

Except he should have used * instead of ? obviously."
"Now, this is how you know the guy is a rookie and not a natural, head-strong leader - instead of making idle threats, a *real* Network Admin would have left a time-bomb in place to do exactly what he threatened should he fail to log in for X days or X time after his account is marked Disabled."
But who would test it?
If she doesn't change the password in 15 minutes I am legally allowed to leave the company and keep using it.
"HAHA! Thank you. Thank you. *Bows*

Looking back, I can see that. I didn't feel very legendary at the time though.

I just had a really awesome director and a really cool lead."
"&gt; and kept lecturing me about how he builds computers and develops software so he knows what he's doing.

That's a red flag. Someone who truly knows what they are doing is normally quiet / humble about it. The ones that try to build themselves up as an ""expert"" on something usually have no idea about the subject at hand, and instead of asking questions / taking advice to get to the bottom of the problem and solve it as fast as possible, they are trying to protect their own reputation.

In reality, a techie couldn't care less if a user has a hole in their knowledge. You don't know how to take a screenshot? No worries, I'll tell you in 1 minute and if you listen and follow what I say, you can do it in 30 seconds (and that includes attaching it to an e-mail or pasting it into a chat window or whatever). That ensures that the resolution of your issue is on track. 

But if a user is focusing on their ego instead of the actual problem, that makes it harder for both parties, as it *will* eventually be revealed that the user has no clue about something, and the tech support person has to endure minutes upon minutes of ranting about how ""expertly"" the user knows what they are doing. Don't brag then, *just do it...*"
Do... these people think that if it plays music it's all the same? Can you even do this with itunes on mac? I literally cannot work out what set up she's got on her home computer such that if u play music on youtube it plays it on itunes. wtf im so confused.
Isn't it a bad idea to plug a fridge into a power strip anyway?
