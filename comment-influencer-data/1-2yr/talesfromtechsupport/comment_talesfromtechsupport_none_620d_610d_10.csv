That chuckle was the laugh of a man proven right.
"&gt; consultant with less pay  

Doesn't compute... Aren't those the guys who can cash the big bucks?"
"&gt;So I gave my grandma some homework: Playing solitary to train mouse usage.

10/10 response IMO."
It's a cereal killer
"And then your boss gets a complaint that you ""refused to help""."
"My best friend's wife also majored in flute, at the same time as her, so I asked her this very question. Her response:

""She was only second chair.""

Evidently flautists are harsh."
"Well, it started with ""Huh, that's weird"" and ended in panic."
"Not your technician, not your hardware, not your SLA, not within contract. Bill them. "
"I feel for you, I occasionally get this at work: ""What do you mean you disposed of my laptop, this is unacceptable!"" ""Um, you brought it in a year ago, and never responded to our calls and emails so as per the contract you signed we disposed of it after 3 months of no contact"" ""But I want it back!"" ""It's gone, we can't keep them forever."""
"After being told off because they ""know what they're doing""."
Funny fact: I recently learnt that boss was making big money..AND asking her retired mother for more money
"There is a gunsmith in my town who's had the same guns on the wall for the last 10 years due to people forgetting them and him not wanting to sell them. 
He had a customer get burgled and they stole his guns, so he claimed insurance and sent the new ones in to get work done (threaded for suppressors, scopes mounted, etc)

6 months later the customer came in to see if he had the serials noted as they'd been stolen AGAIN, ""No sign of them anywhere!"" The smith walked over to the wall and read the serials off the guns to a very sheepish customer!"
"This just made me think, my server sends all it's alerts through the mail server it is running..... Perhaps I should change that...."
"I HATE when I hear one of us in IT say, ""Huh. Weird.""   It never results in good news or donuts or time off."
"This guy gets it. All of my grandparents served in WWII. Only living one is 93. She has a spoon collection of around 400 spoons (it used to be cool to do) of places they traveled together and no one has really wanted to document the collection before (I documented it a few weekends ago and recorded her telling me the stories of various favorite spoons). When she was in DC in the waves, there was a building near the river that she did secretarial work in for years, but now it is just greenery there. She knows 1918 (100 years ago) from a totally different perspective than you or I. 

It is the COOLEST THING EVER to hang with your grandparents and I too regret not doing more of it sooner in life. "
I had this idea after someone posted in r/todayIlearned how solitary was actually introduced to teach people how to use a mouse. 
I feel like this person either needs to be prosecuted for fraud or be barred from gun ownership due to negligence.
"So, the company was already on fire when you were hired, and was burning down around your ears by the time you got out."
I would have thought a flutist would need to know her right from her left.
"And that's why i hated my job. People can't even understand that you're there to give support on the service you sell them. Nothing less, nothing more.

And even if you help them more than you should because you feel friendly today, they'll still spit in your face..."
"In IT, as in science, ""Huh, that's weird"", usually leads to new, exciting discoveries. In IT they are just discoveries of meltdown in progress."
"Should have ended the call with ""Do svidaniya, comrade."""
"&gt; consultant with less pay of course.

Ahahahaha... oh wait, they were serious? Let me laugh even harder: AHAHAAHAH!

Counsultant wage is pretty much what you ask for. If they need you, they should and will pay for your knowledge."
"For her, money has no intrinsic value.  

The time she gets to spend with her grandchildren has value beyond compare.  "
"Wow. That's going to be a shitstorm...


So, anyone wants to count the odds of someone reading this who then tried calling their mortgage company and got that ""We're down for 2 days"" message? Assuming the business type wasn't obfuscated."
"It's like if Task Manager isn't responding:

you're in some deep shit"
"New ceo, thought the only important thing was how much she earned "
"The only possible way W thinks this is logical is if they think the modem operates solely off of the landline connection, since those power landline phones when the electricity goes out. 

That's pretty fucking stupid logic, though, since most people have been using cable modems for internet connections during the past decade and a half."
I sometimes use the website [Is It Down](http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/) to check whether the site has a problem or my system or network has a problem.
"It’s always a tough call. This time it’s easy next time it’s 2hours. How do you know?  Mostly you can until you start troubleshooting. 

At the end of the day nobody cares. They just want the issue fixed. Because IT is complicated most people dont understand or want to understand.

And to top it off after fixing it all you get a customer who while has a restored service is pisssed, and your employer could be equally upset at you.  Blah blah this is when we drink....

But as an online colleague good work!"
"In the city where I live there is a Japanese CEO that cares about employees, he says a happy employee is more productive and more loyal,he still earns a lot"
"Depending on the alerts it's sending, that may be fine. But if you've got something that tells you when your mail server goes down... it shouldn't use the mail server in question to send *that* alert. Everything else though... /shrug"
"Perfect customer! Respectful, listens to your suggestion, implements your solution without complaint.  No time wasting arguments, just an immediate acceptance of your guidance. What's not to like?"
Let me tell you the tale of how many guns are left in rental cars. Lots.
I was constipated before I read this.  I am no longer constipated.  Holy shit.
If Is It Down does not load  what then
"&gt;Ahahahaha... oh wait, they were serious? Let me laugh even harder: AHAHAAHAH!

My exact reaction, had to mute the phone twice"
I blame computers in movies and on TV shows for this. The correct way to access your files from anywhere is to create a GUI in Visual Basic to track the killer's IP address.
"Old habit of always putting the changes in a physical medium that is less likely to be tampered with. The pen copy shows up any attempts at making a change in his mind, while he thinks an email is, because he can edit it before sending, something that can be changed after the fact."
"Have thing.
Remove thing.
If someone screams or say they miss thing?
Add thing back."
