"*“I divide my officers into four classes as follows: The clever, the industrious, the lazy, and the stupid. Each officer always possesses two of these qualities.""*

*""Those who are clever and industrious I appoint to the General Staff. Use can under certain circumstances be made of those who are stupid and lazy. The man who is clever and lazy qualifies for the highest leadership posts. He has the requisite nerves and the mental clarity for difficult decisions. But whoever is stupid and industrious must be got rid of, for he is too dangerous.”*

I almost feel sorry enough for you to grant you a cold spot in hell if you go on a killing spree.
"I used to put up with shit like that. *No one* talks to me that way any more. I will absolutely give it back in spades, one way or another. I am not your tech bitch, I am your co-worker and you do not have the right to abuse me in any way."

"A company I worked at had a little-used support line that had a number very similar to a non-emergency police line elsewhere in the country. (The company still exists and I'm betting the numbers are still in operation hence being vague).

Oftentimes the local newspaper at that elsewhere in the country would accidentally put our number on their website or in print. We worked out that somewhere in the police, they had a source with the wrong number on it and they'd been giving it out to anyone who asked.

We'd get calls from people wanting to report suspicious activity or someone launching into a story about something they thought the police would be interested in while we tried to get a word in edgewise and tell them they had a wrong number.

Worst was the domestically abused caller wanting to follow up on their case. We gave them the right number."
"At ""YOU NITWIT"", I would have turned around and made a beeline for HR. After that, she gets blacklisted until I get a written apology and if it *ever* happens again, she gets cut off permanently. Ain't nobody got time for that kind of abuse."
"I'm actually Canadian, but most of my business is in the US. 

But, I had an honest-to-god purebred Aussie on my team for a while. The guy was absolutely a riot!

I appear to have picked up many of his mannerisms. I've basically taken some Aussie and some Trucker-Talk and glued them together."
"""The customer is always right.""
Hah, yeah, anyone saying that can try tech support for a few hours. Props to you for being patient!"
"My husband is not particularly computer literate.  One thing he gets right is he never opens an email if he doesn't know the sender.  As in a newsletter he signed up for or a vendor he works with or a coworker.  The rest of the email, he ignores.  


They hired someone to run the employees through a security course online.  Afterwards, they sent pretend phishing emails to everyone.  He didn't open the phishing emails.  He also didn't open the emails that had the link to take the course.

"
"Instructions unclear, printer now prints in blood instead of ink."
"You've confused me.

This

&gt; Fuck me swinging... 

has me thinking you're one of my Aussie brethren, since it's slang I've only ever heard coming out of an Aussie's mouth - but there's no best Buy down here, so you can't be.

I'm so confused!

(I've also worked in a place with a similar attitude to ""backups"" - but not for very long!)"
"I'm trying to get to that point, I'm mostly there now but still have a ways to go. Sadly that seems like a part of growing as a tech. You have to learn to do that or you get fucked over so hard, I wish I'd known standing up for myself was an option when I was younger."
"Ah yes, this little tidbit, which is in the oldest email in my yahoo email account from 2003 (not all that old really):

bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the
Universe trying to 
produce bigger and better idiots.  So far, the
Universe is winning.

"Not a bug, working as intended. That's how you know that you've done it correctly."
"Here is the problem with that, this was my first ever job and first ever ticket. I didn't even know what HR was at the time. And if I did I would have only suffered more as HR at this company was obliterated by lawyers later on for good reason.

It has nothing to do with their habit of sexually assaulting me sadly but that was also a thing. Young me saw a lot of shit and was really bad at dealing with it. Sure I might do like you suggested now but we're talking about a 15 year old boy here. A 15 year old autistic boy even so it was kinda hard on me.

A lot of shady shit went on here and this was a good day there by all accounts. Thank god lawyers got involved later on."

"It is rather easy to guess the company - I'd remove the city names to keep it anonymous. 

I feel for you - I work for a medium sized company in Bavaria and for the last 6 years we've been working on shutting Access down.  
Migrating all data and processes... It is hell. We hope to have all active customer data migrated by the end of the year.

Access is no database! "
This video made me sick to my stomach.  
"You are the hero we need, but don't deserve. 

Can you also make it so all automated marketing calls are redirected to the relevant CEOs?"
"So IT has this done right and she is running her own shadow IT department to get something done in Access? Why is the real IT department even giving you access to the data and why are they letting a shadow IT run without doing anything about it? How do you have a job? 

You are stuck in a political game between two managers and apparently their bosses are to clueless to step in and put a stop to it. What a waste. "
We'll let you think about that for a minute.

"&gt;The operations supervisor then proceeded to go to every damn machine in the building and disable the wired connection and put them on the wifi because ""it's probably faster that way"".

"You gotta take a three-prawned approach with callers like these. First, understand their motives are shellfish. Second, they may be salty about sand irritating their sensitive bits, try to get them not to clam up. Third, make sure to thank them for their time so you can claw them back in for the next service."

"My work town just recently got a new area code. My desk number stayed the same, but some numbers around town changed. Now I get calls from patients calling for some doctors office...

"The way I understood it is the following:

- Management keeps complaining that they want a management tool so they have all the information.
- IT says: ""Okay, we´ll do that."" They work on it for about a year.
- Management says: ""This is too expensive. Throw it out.""
- IT is pissed.
- Management comes around and says: ""What about our tool?""
- IT says: ""We threw it out. Screw you. We got the mails right here.""
- Management whines around.
- IT is outsourced to another company.
- Little IT departments crawl out of the dust and settle in between the other departments. Each department seemingly gets its own little IT department.
- Chaos ensues.

Since the ""newest version"" of that tool should´ve been presented about two years earlier, $boss was pissed and did not want to wait around any longer. How she got the idea with Access is anybodys guess."

"That was an advertising slogan in the thirties, not a moral imperative. I wish customers knew that. "

"""Broken pie. I done put it on my driver seat and forgot it was there. I done sat on it.""

"And it also doesn't mean what people think it means. It just means that you should be selling what customers want to buy, not what you think they should want."
"I mean if it's even a remotely competent upper exec, this shit costs them a ton of money, to have all their techs burning company time arguing with users about a mythical 2nd tier tech support. If you assume they spend 2 minutes on this, over 4700 calls, that's almost 7 days worth of employee time burned on literally nothing.

Anytime you need to make a case to management about how something in IT needs fixing, all you need to do is find a way to say it in money. My go-to is taking my salary and finding out how much $company is spending for me to do $dumb_thing when we could do $smart_thing instead. Most managers aren't rock stupid, they're just ignorant, and ignorance can be fixed.

Plus, you don't need technical knowledge to understand wasting money. "
You better believe I'll be sharing more. They'll be a bit more heavily edited though because lawyers were involved so I cannot disclose too much. This place gave me shitloads of stories it was kinda terrible working there but at least this way something good comes out of it.

"Forecast:

You will implement it as requested, on the date requested, and it will work as agreed upon.

They will complain it isn't working how they want, and withhold payment, and demand a bunch of changes that were not agreed upon or even mentioned at all until after implementation."
