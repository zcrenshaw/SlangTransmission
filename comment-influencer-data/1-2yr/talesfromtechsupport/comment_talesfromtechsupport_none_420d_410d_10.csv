Would have been better to point out that czechoslovakia ceased to exist in 1992.
"Boss: i found someone who will do it for half your price, care to match it?    
me: nope, but im telling you now, its 4x if i have to emergency clean it up.    

Then i read the rest of the story, yep thats what happened."
"&gt; What do you think? Could I have handled this situation differently?


Yes, complain to his manager, about

People need to learn, that that's not acceptable.

"""Educators"""
"I know how lacking the US education can be regarding geography, but how could they not hear about the fall of the Soviet Union???

Nitpicking: Czechia is just a short-name of the Czech Republic, which is still the country's official name

Edit: As others rightfully pointed out, Czechia is **official** short-name, my intention was to state that the 2 names refer to the same country."

"Back last year I had a Facebook friend I hadn't seen since my youth message me that her son needed help with a PC that he'd virused out. He was about 13/14 so was in with the whole Minecraft/Ark lot at school and wanted to record and stream videos after watching various Twitch channels.

Single parent family mum doesn't earn that much so they'd bought the son one of those supermarket all in one computers just so he could Skype and talk to his friends. You know the ones... a motherboard and bits in the back of a monitor like the old Macs a basic all in one with keyboard and mouse. Needless to say it was an 3rd gen Intel i3, 4gb of RAM and Intel onboard graphics with a 256gb sata hard drive, 3 usb ports and no DVD drive. 

She had about £30 to spend max! I did my absolute best to reinstall windows, configure it and stop various memory intensive services running but no way it was going to run Ark... Minecraft was just playable but had to explain the PC just wasn't up to streaming and recording. Fair play to the lad he said he would work hard over the summer washing cars and doing odd jobs to start saving for a better computer."
The first time he pushes back is when you forward the whole chain to security and let them use *their* clue-by-four on the user and wipe your hands of the whole thing.

Make sure she knows how to back it up as well. I know I wouldn't want to lose a file like that.

"Yeah sometimes i'm not sure if people are trying to just be a PITA or are just Dense AF. Makes me wonder how how people like this get ANYTHING done.


You are being told, repeatedly, EXACTLY what to do to solve your issue, why are you still wasting time?"
"I had a director in the IT department at a university tell me I should put in a request to have Microsoft change one of the fundamental ways Outlook works just because she doesn't like it. And while we were a significantly sized university, in the grand scheme of things (20k employees total) we were still small peanuts to Microsoft. Unfortunately that person is now working in VP level jobs in IT so I'm sure she still does the same BS"
"Incidentally, both of these guys retired from the Navy in the mid 90's. Seems like their political and geographical knowledge did at that time, too. "

"&gt; I work in a law firm where, you'd assume that being in school for so many years, lawyers would have at least *some* basic computer knowledge.

"I work in Prague, Czech Republic, for a multinational. In my previous project, I used to receive hardware prototypes quite often. Most of them were shipped from the US. 

Around 30% to 40% of shipments were directed to ""Prague, Czechoslovakia"" (mind you, this state doesn't exist for 25 years already). But one shipment from Intel was especially interesting. It was directed to ""Prague, Czech Republic, United Kingdom""."
"I was hesitant about emailing any of the main admins regarding this access request because as mentioned in my story, he was emailing in from the Admin's email account. If he really had taken over, who's to say he didn't have access to the inbox of any other accounts?

I got the internal account manager for that company involved and asked them to give the company a call and check what's going on. "

I'd say as soon as you realised he was in an admin account that wasn't his it was time to lock it down and pass the mess over to data security. 
"Hey, not a luser! He not only immediately recognized he was wrong, but admitted to a stupid mistake. He just had to think through what he did. Cut him some slack."
This reminds me of that time everyone got *real* confused about the difference between Czechia and Chechnya.
"I have often been surprised at the normal mail I've found in my spam folder, sometimes even email from senders who are usually NOT marked as spam. edit to add: just now checked since being reminded, and found a promo email from a business I WANTED promo email from."

"Nahhhhh.

"&gt;She thought hard but turned the idea down, citing her sons tantrums, and exclaimed that if the kid can't be happy with what he wanted, too bad for him, she's done trying.

A late realization, but better late than never "
"She didn't say White?, she said !White. the pronunciation is very similar.  "
"You misunderstood the problem - she has a problem with being snippy, the tool."
"I actually got contracted to deal with a similar aftermath to this.

Picture this:  Small optician's office, previously cheaped out on network cabling.  Inefficient application that doesn't play nice with anything less than gigabit.  2 ports routinely cabled with 1 wire (which you can do if you're prepared to forego gigabit speeds).

I had a proper networking contractor come in and quote for re-doing the lot with 2 ports per desk with fully certified Cat6.  It was pretty obvious with even a cursory glance that precisely nothing was worth trying to salvage.

My client didn't bat an eye.  Nobody pretended it was a cheap job (it wasn't; it was very expensive) but that the whole point of the work was to ensure they wouldn't have to do it again.  I can only imagine what a nightmare trying to get anything done was before we fixed it up."
"I get this a lot here, thankfully on a much-smaller (dollar-wise) scale.  What this means is occasionally the only way I find out we own something is when they need support for it.  Bring that thing by and we'll get it added into my inventory, THEN after it's actually ""official/supported company property"" you will get my support.
Happens A LOT when the fiscal is about to turn over, and all these departments have ""use it or lose it"" money to burn.  They'll send secretaries out to local box stores to spend money.  And we have this *wonderful* policy here that ""if a department only spends 90% of their budget this year, that 90% IS their budget for next year"".  So unless you want your budget to shrink every year, you better spend every dime you're given.  Yay for fiscal responsibility huh?  Wish I had some say in this, but they've been told, and they don't seem to listen.

"Yes, but

could be attributed to ignorance/not knowing. I probably would've made the 4000+ software solutions comment after that. 

Luckily, I only do 3rd level support in software development, so I rarely have to deal with people that are that obnoxious."
