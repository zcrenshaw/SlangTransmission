"&gt; Go pour some water out into the river, they say, so that you can put more, better water in the bucket you like.

The bucket is now on fire. The water in the bucket, which you would expect to put out said fire, is somehow also now on fire. The customer themselves, however, is seemingly fireproof, while they insist that this is all most definitely *your* fault, and demands reparations for smoke damage."

All set then, Brad will perform the necessary changes and deploy asap.

"&gt;It's hard to explain the hate that Tech Support breeds for waste...

Because we're constantly told there's no budget for new hardware or software, we get stuck with the shittiest laptops in the company, no raises this year because times are tough. Meanwhile, Johnny Salesidiot is demanding another 20GB on his expensive hotspot so he can stream Netflix while he's on the annual corporate sales cruise in the Bahamas.

No, its not hard to explain at all. For the last 30 years, we've been consistently told to do more with less while everyone else spends money like they just won the fucking lottery.


Sorry, got a little ranty there."
"The other network doesn't have ""WiFi"" in the name.  So obviously it's not ""wifi"".  Duh.

Similar story, sort of... 

We were called to pick up a person-in-water (PIW) who had been thrown from their rental speed boat.  It was in San Diego, so there’s lots of little boat rental places to tour the harbor and Mission Bay area.  This particular guy decided it was a great idea to throttle up as high as it would go and then do doughnuts in the middle of the channel where massive Navy, cruise, and cargo ships roll through just about every ten minutes.  He was drunk and the force of the circles threw him right out of the drivers seat (think playground roundabout), leaving him in the water and his boat flying in circles.  We picked him up, checked him over, and were drying him off waiting for a harbor police boat to come grab him while we figured out what to do with the unmanned vessel.

We tried throwing netting to get lodged in the propeller to stop it, but that failed.

We tried just shouldering it out of the channel to make room for the big boats, and just letting it run out of gas, but that failed.  

We were a younger crew at the time and were pretty much just working off of what our manuals were telling us to do.  Some of our seniors were listening to us on the radio, and about ten minutes later they pulled up in a second boat.  

While we were just staring at it dumbfounded, they brought their boat to the same speed, doing circles on the outside of the runaway boat.  The coxswain is casually sipping coffee and maintaining course, while the navigator reaches out his side window with a boat hook and bumps the throttle down on the driverless boat.  We watch, jaws on the floor, wondering why the hell we didn’t think of that.

Thirty seconds later they drive off, not saying a word to us, and leaving the tow job to us dummies. 

Good times.

Could have been ~~worse~~ awesome; it could have been a 3D printer.
"he deserved it, not checking your cables and only complaining.... comon sense is a rare thing    
didnt you check on the cables with him or wasnt he willing to cooperate?"

Chances are you are 100% correct.
Wait a minute... you read the MANUAL! No fair!

Place steak on serving tray and cover with foil.

Remove skillet from heat. Add remaining shallots, mushrooms, and 1 cup of red wine. Stir briskly with fork to loosen any burnt on steak particles. 

Return skillet to heat and bring to a light boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 8-12 minutes. Sprinkle cornstarch or flour to thicken, then pour into gravy boat."

"That's how I got my first gig in IT.

This tech guy ($TG) had a day job as tech support for a school, but on the side, he had gotten a contract to install linux on 500 computers donated by Texas to Haiti. 

The contract was through some local church so he was being paid almost nothing, and with a deadline approaching, he needed help but could only pay me peanuts. 

I was 27 at the time, I had never worked with a computer at all, (1998 in a 3rd world country) but was eager to learn. 

He accepted to answer as many technical questions I could ask, so I started the gig along some teen neighbor of his.

Everyday, $TG would come back home and I had about a dozen or so fully installed systems, while the other kid had about 4 or 5. 

The teen eventually quit and I helped finish the project in about 2 weeks. 

Once we were done, $TG came to me and asked if I wanted to fill an open position as his full-time assistant at his day job. 

I had no certifications, no knowledge, I had dropped out high school, no experience, but this guy gave a chance, and I took it. 

That couple weeks where I was setting up computers like a possessed man, are some of the happiest days of my shitty life. "
"no, they're aliterate.  they can read.  they just refuse to."
My money is on it being the *same* people.
"Or if they do, they call it ""The Internet"""
This is why the question 'can you try removing the power cable from both ends and plugging both ends back in?' was invented.
"Yeuch.  I've worked with people like that.

I'm setting up my tenth computer and they're on their third one."
"Nonono. You wait for the water to evaporate INTO THE CLOUD.

"It's probably not laziness.  It's learned helplessness.

She's been taught that technology is complicated, and she can't possibly understand it, so she doesn't even try.  

She didn't see the words on the screen as instructions to her.  They were ritualistic incantations that only the tech-savvy knew the proper response to.  To her, this was like walking up to a door in an alley way, knocking, and saying, ""The crow flies at midnight.""  They were words, she knew how to read them, but they didn't *mean* anything because it was a secret language."

He has a certificate of proficiency in computering so he is obviously qualified for these sorts of things. 
To be to be fair i dont think anyone ever expects a boat to have auto pilot.
"Actually a simple autopilot (course only ) has been around for 50 years. And most boats have them. 
You can buy one for under €500. 

And you would expect the owner and operator of the boat to know he has an autopilot. He payed for it!"
"True, but you'd at least have a boat at the end that way."
"&gt;And you would expect the owner and operator of the boat to know he has an autopilot. He payed for it!

fucking hell that statement is flashing me back to too many moments when dealing with people...

"As far as I remember he had his modem tucked away in a small cabinet. I think he was just lazy and didn't check the cables because he was confident enough that his modem broke down. Some people, man. "

Yes, because you aren't a guest. You are an employee.

Maybe she has a degree in screenering and we underestimate her skills? 
"Somebody needs to show him how to ""move stuff around"" by moving some of *his* stuff around with a clue by four..."
"Yeah.

The printer takes 6 cartridges (3 of which are black. 2 matte black, 1 glossy black). We pay 1200kr per cartridge (~$150, Even more overpriced than MSRP, but you know, the ""support local resellers"" stuff)

He hit those cartridges pretty damn hard."
"Yeah, it's not so much the copper degrading (it does but takes some time) but it's the repeated flexing of the cable, especially in this case, that would make the conductors break or lose contact with the pins in the plug. Way to stick to your guns."
"Oh, you saved the company how much money by consolidating servers and killing unnecessary services?  Cool, let's spend that money NOT in IT!"
"I remember getting asked on multiple occasions to ""install the internet"" on someone's computer. Of course they were just missing that blue 'e' shortcut on their desktop.

I bet more than half the people reading this who have done tech support have heard that one, too."
