"It's either users won't do the simplest things or they go hog wild and do WAY more than they should and screw stuff up.

Trying to walk a user through power cycling a router and come to find out they are disconnecting network cables and everything.  DID I TELL YOU TO DO THAT."
"&gt;$User - Yes. Now THAT goes to my phone. I have the yahoo mail app. It popped up four times yesterday so I just hit yes on it. 

Users going to user. What the fuck."
&gt;A lack of preparation on your part does not equal an emergency on mine.
"I seriously wonder how these people go through life without the ability to follow very basic, logical instructions."
"Yep! 

excerpted paragraph: 

""I understand that the policy is for at least two months lead time for specialized equipment, but according to &lt;customer&gt;  we need to waive that requirement due to the importance of the new employees work.  Please refer to &lt;customer&gt; for further questions on that as I feel they are best suited to explain the urgency. """
"&gt;I even went the extra mile to CC the customer's manager along with a quick explanation of the situation.

Hopefully with the reference to 30-days documentation."
"At least the user called IT to report a potential breach themselves.
However bad it was, it could always be worse."
"Trick question, a bad light bulb is obviously a hardware problem."
"&gt; At this point his eyes get that unfocused look like Elmer Fudd after stepping on a rake, or like a third-floor suit getting told that putting it on a spreadsheet doesn't make it true

I died. That was the funniest thing I've read all week."
"Yeah, people who know just enough to get themselves into trouble are the worst. ""So, we need to power cycle your router."" ""Ok, I'm holding the reset button with my toothpick."" ""That's not... we'll, now you've turned this 10 minute call into a 20 minute call, congratulations."
"Sadly, this happens all the time.  The one that we get is ""This is unacceptable!""  

My boss' response is the best I have ever heard ""It is interesting that they keep saying that this is unacceptable when it is the one thing that they must accept.""  I think my boss may be part Vulcan.

Classic..."
"This happens to me nearly every time someone new is hired, often from the same people, and most of what I do is provide system access and the like.

We recently had one big VP training a new, same-level VP, who started on Monday.

On Thursday, I get a short Skype chat: ""Are you ever going to get around to giving $NewUser access so she can train and actually start work?""

My reply was ""Who is $NewUser? I never got a request for such, and I haven't even heard anyone mention her in conversation."""
I wonder how these people get dressed and make it to work.
Why give users laptops if they can't move them? Just give them desktops.
"Man this reminds me of the LAN we set up on the FOB so that we could all play CoD together from the different b-huts.

Enter connex of random networking supplies left by a prior unit including a non-standard color cat5 pile, and a ton of switches/routers.  The 6 shop grabbed all of it and set up the hardware and grabbed those of us who knew what an RJ45 was and we dug trenches and ran cable and tubing all over the FOB to set this up.

Then someone got the smart idea of buying our own satellite internet setup and using the already established network to set our own ISP up....and that's how I got a small line on my resume about being a co-founder of a ""regional"" independent ISP."
"Guy in here a few years ago on about his third day got tired of one of the people in the office complaining about part of her job which was compiling a weekly report.

So being the young keen guy that he was and wanting to help her, he spent a bit of Friday afternoon automating that part of her job and showed it to his/her boss.  And that's when the office told him that, that was her job and she now had nothing to do and was let go. 

It was /u/zarokima

Mmmmm wonder how that bus feels on that users back.
"It reminds me of the time I was working for repair shop... a customer came in and asked us to repair a laptop, and after opening it up, we saw that it had obviously been in contact with water.

Customer told us: ""No water has been spilled on it ! I was outside with it and some rain fell on the laptop, but that's all !"""
"If it were me, I would probably have just ~~watched the world burn~~ let him continue on and kill his PC."
"Reminds me of when I worked for a small MSP providing cheap AF services and only employing fking appretices to save money.

To give you some idea of the hell I was in, there was me, and another trained member of the support staff, our manager, and 10 apprentices.

Basically, I was constantly given more workload disguised as an ""opportunity"", for no increase in pay. I was one of the only competent employees, and my workload was as follows;

* Escalation point for everyone (which was every ticket the apprentices dealt with, as they had no idea what to do).
* I had the same ticket quota (yes, ticket quota) as everyone else.
* I had to be on the phones, like everyone else.
* I had at least two other time sensitive side projects at any given time, which I would later learn my manager expected me to complete in my own time, A.K.A at home.

Couple this with the fact that the company (the owner and his wife) didn't want to pay any money to employees, or provide decent facilities (the milk in the coffee machine was powdered), but would flaunt their new cars, suits, and holidays in our faces, and you have a recipie for a goddamn uprising.

This went on for a year, and it nearly killed me. Granted, I did become a productivity powerhouse, and my ability to problem\-solve is now my best quality, but I'm not sure it was worth it.

This one time, I was scheduled to go on\-site for a customer (which I almost never did), but I'd already booked it off for some extended me time. They scheduled it without even talking to me, and then asked me to cancel my vacation. I did actually do it, but it was my last job, because i resigned the next day. I tried to tell them what a shit show they were running, and they said I was ungrateful.

Oh, and I should also mention that while there was no dress code for the women at this place, the men (even those with desk jobs) were expected to wear proper trousers, smart shoes, a shirt, and tie. I wore black jeans for about a 6 months, when eventually the HR lady (who at the time was wearing a very casual yellow summer dress), told me I had to buy proper trousers, because mine were the wrong type of fabric! Oh yeah, and this was a written warning about adhering to the dress code.

Moral of the story, you can always find a new job!"
"This feels like the kind of situation where I'd say ""I cannot advise you on this, but if I was to cut the cable, I'd cut it right there."""
this is when I would want to tell her simply hitting no may have saved her ass. she would have still been screwed but less so
"Well, if you complain about the *only* thing you do... don't be surprised if someone fixes the issue just to get you to stop complaining."
"Well, they can move them in the office, they frequently need it for meetings, but they're not supposed to take it back home. Unfortunately, we as the tech team, do not have our word to say on the equipment..."
It was a running gag in our team to check if the users were wearing velcro on their shoes because we were sure they couldn't tie shoelaces without help.
"They can probably still use those first servers for testing purposes.

Or bashing their new procurer over the head with them."
"This is why i over document on EVERYTHING. People know me well enough now that when they ask me a question on something I handled and I say ""Hold on let me check the records"" that 99% of the time I will have ten times more info than they think they need documented on the subject."
"I keep WPS disabled despite its convenience. On account of it being a security nightmare. 

Edit: No offence meant Op, I understand why it exists and WiFi is always to some degree inherently insecure. :)"
"Last Friday night I got a frantic call.  ""The UPS is beeping and our internet is down!!!!""

Okay, is the switch lit up?

""no! I have to leave the office, please come out and fix it!"" *click*

I call them back\- straight to voicemail. No answer.  I get a text\- ""Left office, please take care of this asap""

I billed 45 minutes drive time to\+from to flip a circuit breaker back on."
Please tell me you charged them for the full hour of work plus the 3 driving.
"I get this one all the time!    

“Hey,  can you create a new sales rep code for XXX.   They’ve been using mine for 3 weeks now and it’s making my sales average dive”

Sucked in.  If you are dumb enough to share your code with the newbie, rather than request their own, then you deserve too miss your KPIs.

"
"There is actually a way to turn one monitor into two, but it involves a chainsaw.  "
"Yeah, when I used to work for -insert bank name here-, we got a lot of “I got an email from you guys asking for my password” calls. 

I would always ask “did you click on the link and give your password?”, praying to my deity that they hadn’t, and my stomach would sink that little bit lower every time someone said “ah yeah, was I not supposed to?”

I’ll admit to being slightly naff with my passwords, a lot of my social media (which is rarely if ever used) has the same handful of passwords, with slight variations between them, but all my banking, my phone contract, my utilities and my emails have completely separate passwords for this exact reason. "
"I was the customer during an install and, because it was a rental property, the installer told me he couldn't drill a hole through the wall without the owner's permission.  I asked him if he could go back to his truck for a minute to get something, but leave the drill sitting there at the site.  He said ""*I'll be right back.*""  When he got back, it turned out he was mistaken about needing to drill because there was a preexisting hole he could use."
"&gt; No water has been spilled on it ! 

Well, he wasn't lying..."
"Good suspension, but a tendency to rock to one side as it's passing OP...




10/10 would throw idiot under again."
"Fun fact \- Velcro actually does a superior job at keeping shoes closed, but due to the association of velcro shoes with children, elderly, or sick, most people still insist on using laces."
"I'm a software engineering manager, and I know what power\-cycling is.  The average non\-technical person does not, however.  You might get better results with one of the phrases ""turn it off and back on again"".  Or ""disconnect the power cord and then reconnect it"", depending on whether the device has a power switch."
"The squeaky wheel gets the grease, but the greased wheel that still squeaks gets replaced."
"Whats that, all computer ""stuff"" can do what ever you need? Why can't you use this pack of paint brushes to calculate the GDP of Brazil?"
"It's obviously not IT hardware, so not IT's problem. Call facilities."
How wholesome. 
"I don't think anyone here likes the term ""power-cycle"". It just came as a necessary thing to say instead of ""reset"". The word ""reset"" should never be uttered to an end user at anytime.

""turn it off and back on again"" is very straight forward, but also ""obviously won't fix the problem"", so it doesn't get done."
Although most of the world is made of bullshit every now and then you get a chance to sprinkle a little pixie dust

(Un)reasonable expectations..."
"Once at a University student medical clinic, I could find no parking.  Typical university.  This was in the days before cell phones were reasonable.

So, I drove to a gas station and dropped a quarter into the pay phone (ask your parents) and called the clinic.  They told me to come back (server was down) and park in the medical director's spot.

When I returned, the medical director's Mercedes was parked up on the sidewalk and grass.  No matter, I took his spot.

While bringing up the server I asked the director, ""Aren't you worried they'll tow your car?""

He said ""I do the police department fitness for duty exams.  I can park where the fuck I want.""
"
"sounds to me like it should be 6 hours of driving (both directions count because you can't help others while you are stuck in the car) plus the on site min.. (typically i see an hour for that)

“Put it back”
"My experience is he'll have gotten a promotion and a bonus when he ""saved them money"" and then when the truth comes out it'll be chalked up to ""well he's not even in that role anymore"""
Not a day!  Four days!  We had the ENTIRE WEEKEND!!!! /s
"My furnace went out last winter so I called a service to diagnose it.  The guy did some tests and determined that the limit switch was out.   He said that it would cost around $300 for them to replace it but they would have to order on and it would be a few days.  In the meantime, since everything else on the unit was working fine, it would be possible to simply bypass the limit switch with a jumper wire, which would allow me to use the furnace until the part came in.  He was not allowed to leave the furnace in that condition but if I were to do it after he left by placing a jumper wire accross these two connectors right here, that was none of his business.  Oh, and by the way, it is possible that I could find that part on this particular website for $14 and replace it myself by removing these two screws.  He finished up his work and bid me a good day.  After he left I went down to perform the workaround and discovered that he had 'accidentally' dropped a jumper wire on the floor when he was packing up his tools."
"She wasn't, I can almost guarantee. "
This kills the monitor(s).
"He would have never ever shut the fuck up.  Sooner or later OP would have given in (if only to shut him the fuck up).  Trouble is, this wasn't something that could be fixed in 5 minutes.  Dude didn't know the fundemantels of what he was doing.  Only God knows what would have been found.

Not only would it have never ended, but you are running the risk he would have blamed OP for his mistakes."
Why have one when you can have many many reasons haha.
"I would pay good money to see a slow mo of that laptop hitting the ground.  That must have been IMPRESSIVE.  

Yet another reason I love me an SSD."
I really feel sorry for you for the last line
