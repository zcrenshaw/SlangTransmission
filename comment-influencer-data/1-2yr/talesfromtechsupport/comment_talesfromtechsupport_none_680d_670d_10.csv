"Who here still remembers Windows 95, with the message when you shut down ""You can now safely turn off your computer"" ?"
"It's a common mistake. They thought by keeping the server in the kitchen, they'd be served tea and coffee at their tables on demand. *shrugs*"
UGH the people that try to get you to do free help for their totally not work related devices or issues on company time! Bring Your Own Device policy issues get...complicated though.
"Was expecting something like a dead dad’s last letter or something equally onion cutting. 

Glad I went ahead and read it. "
"Dear God.  That's an amazingly huge HIPAA suit just waiting to happen,"
"&gt;I hope that in the following years they moved away from that, or virtualized it

Haha! Of *course* they didn't! That would cost money!"
"Hey man, it's tales from tech support, not tales from computer support.  As is often pointed out, the lovely ditch_lily has regaled this sub with many a tale of sewing machine support.  
Just like the end user believes, if it plugs into a wall, it's tech support"
"From now on, require all requests from this user be in written format. "
The first mistake you made was assuming your end users had any knowledge or
"I felt sorry for the guy until
&gt;Honestly, at this point, I can't ask where they are. It wouldn't look good for me.

Mate, asking where a lost server is is not going to make you look bad. Not knowing is."
"Woah, I was expecting Anne to be the idiot but PLOT TWIST."
"Good story. Reminds me that one of the first questions I used to ask as a helpdesk noob was ""Can you please check that your equipment powered on?"" And that sometimes there would be an embarrassed silence on the other end."
"""Please unplug the microphone and tell me if the plug is a silver or gold color."" :)"
Can't be. It directly controls external hardware through a custom interface with no source code or other documentation.

".....well.

Positives are that it’s a well-lit, climate controlled room with easy access.

Negatives are easy access and everything else.  "
"I get increasingly angry with our password policy as well. Every three months I need to change it.

Even NIST says that it far better to have users use a strong password they can remember well and only use for that single service rather than permutations of a weak one they likely reuse. 

And only have users change their passwords if a leak is suspected.

If I wasnt personally invested in having my data secure I would use permutations of blowme and fuckthisshit as well. 

//edit: The default password for new accounts is pwstart01, go figure what you can do with that information and a list of accounts that you periodically retrieve via exchange."
"My first question is why didn't they atleast wipe them anyway?! If you're going to give them away or take home company property, why the hell wouldn't you reformat the damn drives anyway?!?"
"You mean these poor ladies now have to learn a new OS?

*And* you were the last guy to touch their stuff?

...you're in trouble"
"I work with a number of schools, some do BYOD, but it's very clear how we do it.

1) You have to bring it to me and we have to do a full deep clean for any nasties.

2) I take note of the serial number, and both wired and wifi mac address and they are added to the whitelist.

3) If you need to change to a new laptop (need....) the old one is taken off the access list, and all the new details are added.

4) Bringing in ANY other device to ""can you just take a look"" is something I can do. But it's charged separately and done only when I am off the clock with the school in question."
"If the server ever catches fire there is water right next to it.

On the other hand the sink will most likely be the reason why the server catched fire."
This sounds like a client that needs to be wholly fired...
"Yeah. I got the feeling this was like one of those situations where you have been hanging out with someone for way too admit that you can't remember their name. 

My guess is, he figured he could find them without needing to ask for help. That goal did not go as planned, and now he is months committed to the lie that he understands his system. "
"The scientific term is ""embarrassment"""
I waited in line for a copy of 95. And a mission critical system at work is running Window 98.

"I know, right. It's such a common sense thing to do that we just assumed they were doing it. Hell, the whole org did."
"Strike that, that's a huge mandatory breach report and whistle-blower bounty that'd damn well better have happened.  "

"You're at home, alone, like you are every day. There's no one to check on you and no one to help you if things turn south. You're getting on in years and you have a million things that don't quite work right in your body. Your left arm is a bit sore when you lift it. Did you get stung by a scorpion? Are you having a stroke? Harold had a stroke and nobody found him until he was 3 days dead. He might have made if if he weren't alone at the time.

Wow, your left arm really does hurt. Isn't that a sign of a heart attack? You don't want to die right here, alone, with nobody to help you, nobody to be with, and nobody to know that you're gone. You're scared.

Besides, at least, it would be nice to see someone and talk to them. It's been a while and you might be having a heart attack or a stroke. You're not a doctor, you can't be sure. Isn't it better to be safe than rotting alone in your house?

Better to call the nice men in the ambulance."
"Makes me wish I could read the novel.

Would she give you permission to tell us what it is?"

"they really did drag out hardware upgrades for somethings, but some people got new stuff almost every few months. 

Sort of made sense, but head shakes abound. "

Oh god
"If it's a webserver, I can see the confusion about tea if it was returning HTTP 418. They may also have thought HTCPCP was installed, as per RFC2324."
These people are clients for around 4 years. Its like their brains just turn the fuck off.. arrrgggh

"Wait... You advised a client purchase new hardware

"Who needs more than 65,536 colors? It's madness!"
Not even god can help with that.
There are experiences that I did not experience during my college life.  I am quite glad I didn't.
"They had proper HIPAA violation reporting and tracking in place already so we took it as high as we needed to take it. The org was large enough that there were so many violations getting reported that this made little difference. 

I got the proper recognition and credit for it where it was important (to me).

"...and you watch, you won't get called for ANYTHING for that end user for quite a while, either.  Even stuff that is difficult and requires your attention, they will NOT call you.  I've never figured out if this is some kind of social behavior or not...."
"I've said this before:  it's like when a user has a technical support guy to rely on, they turn off their brains.  I wouldn't be surprised if a user asked a tech guy how to chew their gum. 

User:  Can I chew while using the computer?

me: erm, yes.  Why wouldn't you?

User:  It's bubbeyum brand. Grape.  It's still ok right?

I'm sure there's a psyche paper in there for some lucky psyche student but I don't know any."
"That was a normal Tuesday for us. In my second year, a guy I lived with considered ringing my Mum to tell her I had gone missing because I ""went out for lunch"" on Saturday afternoon and ended up in a ""party loop"" until Tuesday.

"Client replies: I don't like the number 127, it's a bad number on my horoscope. Can we change it to 153? That's my good number this week. I'll want to change it next week as well. In fact can I just make it always be my 4 lucky numbers? Then people only have to look at the horoscope to know my website. Genius!"
