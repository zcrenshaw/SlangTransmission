"Tbh when I read the title, I thought it was gonna be an erotic story of how you converted a ""straight"" guy to the gay side.

But, I'm pleasantly surprised it wasn't. This was a really good read, and good on your friend questioning his belief system and having the maturity to apologize to you. More people need to be like him.

"First if all calm down. There‚Äôs no need to panic and think that you‚Äôre doing something wrong. From your tone, I can guess that you‚Äôre okay with him being gay. And that‚Äôs more than most parents would be. So, just pace it. The important part is that if he‚Äôs still not comfortable with coming out, you should not force him to or keep implying things so as to get him to talk. Just love him and when it comes to actual support when you know he might be hurt or going through a bad phase, be there for him. If you care for him, he‚Äôll see that and come out on his own terms. I would if I were him. "

"That's outrageous that someone would exploit a platform for gay men to give people the hard sell on something like that.  By the way, hve you ever thought about a career as a Herbalife associate?"

"Oh just go. If they want it that way, then go. Make it hard for them. Don't communicate. Just cut them off. They'll be back after they realize the stupid mistake they made. But you'll have to cut them off totally. And be rude and quick about it. They have to get the picture they fucked up."

The guys that feel this way may only get a few messages a week while they might be sending out dozens. Different perspective.
"Report him. Grindr is a ""dating"" app that has an option to display your preferred sexual position. The Army would not like this at all. "
"Yesssss. Lol my boyfriend and I both say it to each other, depending on who's bottoming. It's not meant to be a demeaning thing with us, it's more like a term of endearment where the top is telling the bottom that he's being a good boy and the tops gonna take care of him while he's inside.

"I think a lot of the time when guys have this fantasy, there are unspoken stipulations. When someone says a stranger they mean a hot stranger they find attractive. If some guy you found really ugly and creepy came up and groped you, it wouldn't nearly be such a thrill. This is a turn on I can understand in a fantasy context that I don't think actually applies to reality. "

"Many things in porn look hotter than they actually feel. 

Being in the middle like that - I've generally found it to be to distracting to really enjoy one thing or the other. 

If you start to enjoy doing the fucking too much - you end up moving your ass out of synch, or clenching up and pushing out the other top. If you start to enjoy the bottoming too much - you fall out of rhythm and slip out of the guy you are fucking. 

It can be 'hot' for the sake of the scene for a few seconds - but generally don't enjoy it. 

However, being in the middle of a spitroast - getting fucked while giving head ....  woof! that's fun, and lives up to the expectation / image that it's usually depicted like in porn."

But, don't come on here and tell us that your party doesn't support the pedophile, when the evidence that it does is overwhelming.  However, I'm pleased you aren't voting for the pedophile."

"I hope nobody would consider voting for the crazy, homophobic dinosaur.   Spoken as a fellow dinosaur."
"I had this happen. I don't tell this story. Ever. But here goes. 

I fell in love with my best friend in high school, a beautiful, super fit, extremely intelligent (he's a doctor now), loving, kind boy....who was muslim. So yeah, you can figure how that went. 

I shut my mouth for three years and then in our final year I just took him for a long walk behind the library and told him my feelings. Fully letting him know. The strange thing was, he felt the same way. He told me how much he was in love with me, and how we could date...but his parents could, of course, never figure out. 

We dated for the first year of university and it was perfect. I lost about 80lbs (i was very overweight), came out, loved life, and we were a big ole gay couple. 

Then his parents found out. 

He was disappeared from my life overnight. His cell number was changed, his parents refused to open the door when I knocked, he didn't respond to my emails, no MSN responses....nothing. 

I was devastated and destroyed, but I was also 18, so even though the world was definitely abruptly ending and I had no way of recovering from that, I knew that I would get over it. 

Eventually Aly because a beautiful but sad memory, but before wasting two years of my life chasing after every boy that even remotely reminded me of him. The feelings subsided and eventually I met my husband. 

About four years ago I ran into his brother. His brother could barely hold eye contact with me, because he knew exactly who I was and what his parents had done. I walked up to him and asked him if he knew who I was. He acknowledged me. 

I couldn't help myself, I just had to ask what happened to the first boy I ever loved. ""He's married, with three children in Saudi Arabia"" 

All of the feelings of hurt that I ever felt came flooding back, and I was a wreck for a good couple of months after that brief 3 minute meetings. To know that a man who had so deeply loved me and cared for me, and to be crass, had fucked me so good, could spend the rest of his life locked away in the Desert Kingdom was so devastating. 

Run my friend, run and never look back. His life is his to live. And unfortunately, I doubt it would be happy. "
"Wow, thats a hell of a set of coincidences, glad it worked out for you guys over there"
"It is very important that you see this through and demand accountability. Do not let it drop for fear of making a fuss. Vote suppression is going to be the name of the game for the GOP in 2018, so the future of the country depends on people like you holding the line. A lot of people talk about the military protecting our freedom, but in truth the front line is the one for the ballot box."

"Watched this movie pretty soon after it came out and as a gay man I was really into Meryl Streep's character. 

Funny thing is that when I was in University we had to do a study of a movie and analyze the organizational behaviour of the office in the movie given to us. Groups were random and we walk up to the front of the room and pick our movie and we randomly get the Devil Wears Prada. Queue the other members in my group going ""??? is this a satanic movie I've never seen it I hope it's ok"". Out loud to them I'm just like ""O ya I've seen it once it's not a bad movie should be ok for the project"". But inside my head me is like ""Bitchhhhhh The Devil Wears Prada?! You want me to stand up in front of the class and talk about this movie and Meryl Streep being a bitch? I'm ready right now we don't need research I've got this one solo lets go put the spotlight on"". In the end I decided to go ahead and be a normal person and do my part of the project and not call out everyone in my group every time they ""didn't like the movie because Miranda was so mean"". Ugh straights smh."
"You're turned on by voyeurism. And since it's your roommate providing you with that soundtrack, your sexual feelings are now directed at him.

This is something you usually only experience with porn, but now it's happening in real life right in front of you and you don't know how to separate fantasy and reality.

Unless you and your roommate had a previous sexual relationship, I doubt you're close enough where you can safely bring this up. 

You're just gonna have to keep it to yourself and try not to weird them out with heavy breathing or staring when you see them together."
"It‚Äôs good to speak up for yourself - whether or not this is something that would annoy someone else, it annoyed you, and that‚Äôs what matters. Accepting her apology is just as important though. We all do shit, occasionally, that annoys others - I know I do. Not accepting her apology just escalates this to a friendship extinction level event."

"We had been together for just under 2 months, he invited me to his friend's wedding. We had a great night drinking, went back to his and were lying in bed talking. I don't know if it was the alcohol or the environment of the day but I made this weird show of trying to tell him without actually telling him, if that makes sense. I woke up the next day cringing at how cheesy the whole thing was and wanted to die of embarrassment thinking it was way too soon to tell him and how I'd probably scared him off.

We're married now though, so it worked out well. "

You're really young, so I'm going to chalk it up to life/sexual inexperience, but... you continued seeing him, even after finding this out? If all of this is actually true and not redditbait, I'm pretty sure that everybody would agree that the guy is disturbed.... but **why** would any rational person subject themselves to this shit?

"So I went on a trip with a bunch of guys on a lake with a caravan of houseboats. There was a tall muscular super hot guy who I had met just in passing who was on my boat. There was some sexual energy between us and we connected in a little private area and had some furtive, very quiet sex. There was a little thrill of being caught by others. It was super hot. Later, we made a date to connect again for sex in the city where I live.

I thought about him all the time and couldn't wait to connect and jerked off several times thinking of our boat encounter. 

We met up at my apartment and now he could talk in a normal voice. No need to be quiet and secretive. The first thing he told me was that he shaved his asshole in preparation. I think he thought that that would turn me on but it had the opposite effect, the pressure of someone doing that just to have sex with me created some performance anxiety. Then, coupled with the thought of his shaved asshole, and being able to talk loud, he started repeating every which way how he would like me to ""fuck his boy pussy."" 

He was yanking on my dick trying to get it hard and talking boy PUSSY again and again. Not being able to get my dick hard, and knowing I had had many relationships with women, he then started tugging on me and trying to create some positive sexual stimulus by talking about fucking girl PUSSY.  I couldn't just bring myself tell him that he just needed to shut the fuck up and quit talking about pussy PERIOD.

I finally just asked him to leave. I would run into him every once and awhile and he would avoid my gaze. 

Tl dr;  I agree with OP."

"Cumming in an ass I feel like I‚Äôm giving him what he desperately needs and I‚Äôm providing him with some fuel to carry on with his life and be happy, even though there‚Äôs no science whatsoever behind that. But it kinda describes a feeling that‚Äôs hard to put into words.

A guy cumming in my ass makes me feel happy to be able to provide a warm hole he can use to reach a point of explosive pleasure, and love the feeling of his whole body convulsing strictly because I‚Äôm physically and emotionally there for him and connected to him. 

If in a relationship and not using a condom, can‚Äôt feel his cum because it‚Äôs body temperature too, but knowing he‚Äôs leaving a part of himself inside me is a huge mental turn on.  If I cum in his ass, I love the idea that he now has some of me inside of him."

"It always leaves me a bit saddened. Like, I know it's supposed to be a happy ending because she grows and learns and becomes a bigger person. But it really leaves me blue for some reason. Well not like, blue blue.  At least not just blue, it's not turquoise. It's not lapis. It's actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."

I would be very hurt if a sibling skipped my wedding.  

Be downright frosty to your parents if it helps, avoid them as much as possible, and ask sis not to seat you at their table.  Barring extreme circumstances, weddings and funerals are times to put family grievances aside."

"I was rather desperate one evening so against my better judgement I hooked up with a femmy twink boy.  I was eatin his ass, gettin it ready and he's moaning along then suddenly he blurts out in this somewhat high pitched, nasally voice ""Ooo daddddy..you gonna fuck momma's pussy?""  I fucked him cause I was desperate but I wasn't happy about it  LOL "

Up until that point in time, I had no idea that he had his nipple pierced either. That was a surprise, but a pleasant one. "

"My boyfriend was in the same boat. His last relationship he was pressured into saying it and to this day he doesn't know if he actually felt that way. He believed it would take him about a year to feel that way. Me, I figured several months for me.

We had a really good relationship. Sex was great, communication was great, being together was great. He was heading to my house after work and he called me after he texted to confirm plans telling me he got into a car accident. I rushed over to him, my mind racing, scared as hell. When I finally got to him I was relieved that he was okay. The next few days after that is when I realized I loved him. I was just so scared and had he been hurt or worse, I didn't know what I'd do without him. Rather, I didn't want to be without him. This was 5 months in. 

Anyways, I still wasn't sure if it was love or just a scary experience but we had a small fight one night. We weren't mad at each other but we were arguing about something. After the argument I asked for a hug to make sure we were golden. Instead of a hug, he put his hand on my shoulder, took a deep breath, and told me he loved me. It caught me so off guard, I stared at him a bit stunned, but said it back. "
"I definitely prefer hairy men. We didn't meet online so there were no pics traded. I was crushing hard on him but the first few days were all PG-13. I rubbed his chest once and thought I felt some hair. The first time he unbutton his shirt I was definitely thinking I scored big time. Fur and pecs for days! He apologized for not trimming and I told him he'd probably never need to do that again, which I don't think he has in the past 6+ years."
"Look at this guy, going on a *date* before boning someone. "
"To be fair, the worst word in that sentence isn't pussy. "
"When I was in high school, even though I was deeply closeted, I would still speak up when guys around me would be mean to the gay guys in our school. There were about 3 of them, and they were all flamboyant as hell, so they got made fun of a lot. Jokes, I just let go. But excessively mean statements, or any kind of actions, I got involved. It wasn't so much about them being gay and sharing that with me. I was just raised that you don't treat people that way, regardless of who they are, unless they'd been ugly to you. "
This album didn't get the attention it deserves.
"My relationship with my dad is very complicated. I know for a fact that he loves me... just not the way that I am. 

I'm his first-born son and, according to my mother, he was ecstatic when I came into this world: he was expecting me so desperately, since he always wanted a boy to be his first child. I was his biggest accomplishment. His pride and joy. He longed for a son with whom he could play sports; teach him about languages, history, religion, and literature; watch movies, and read books; being worldly. 

The thing is that I'm not the son that he dreamed of, I am a disappointment to him. I am not very masculine. I'm horrible at playing the sports that he excelled at: basketball, volleyball, baseball, football (soccer)... I was more interested in interacting with girls, because they were nicer and interesting. I thought that Barbie dolls were pretty, and didn't care much for cars, or playing with other boys because they'd talk about things that I'd find boring or idiotic, and behave foolishly. 

My dad began controlling the way in which I spoke, moved my hands, and walked. Yelling, screaming, shouting, and growling at me when he had to repeat that some gestures, mannerisms, toys, movies, and television shows were prohibited because they were for females. Pink was a big no. 
Saying that he was very strict would be an understatement. 

I became very insecure and fragile. I was scared of my father. Terrified. It's not that I wanted to wear makeup or my mother's clothing and shoes (there's absolutely nothing wrong with that), I just didn't see the problem in having more female friends, and sing Britney Spears' songs. I found girls extremely fascinating. I didn't want to be one, I just felt very comfortable in their presence because they wouldn't judge me. I felt that I could be myself around them. 

Obviously, some people started teasing and bullying me; my mother was protective, loving, and caring when I came to her crying because I couldn't stand the insults. My dad not so much. They even took me to a psychiatric to make sure that I was ""all right,"" that my unacceptable and reprehensible behavior was just a ""phase."" 
He blamed my mother for making me the way that I was. He started spending more time with me, because I needed a ""strong"" masculine influence in my life. 
I toned down my real personality. I tried very hard to become someone who he would love. I wanted my dad's love and acceptance more than anything in the world. But there were times when the real me would come out, and that was unacceptable. 

When he began beating me, I started hating him, and loathing myself. ""Why couldn't I be like the other boys?"" ""Why did God send me to this world to suffer?"" ""Why couldn't I be normal?"" It was all my fault. My fault, and no one else's. 
I was petrified in his presence. I didn't want him to come home from work. I was an embarrassment. I couldn't be myself when he was around. 
The other male children were ""normal"", and I was a ""sissy"". 
I was the worst role model for my younger brothers. A few years later, one of them told me that he was ashamed to have me as his big brother, because he could not ""show me off"": he could not call me if he was in trouble and needed me to defend him; I didn't have a gorgeous girlfriend who could make his friends jealous and envious. That hit me hard very deeply. Three of my siblings have called me a faggot. But I digress... 

It's not that I spent my whole childhood feeling sorry for myself, but a big part of it was spent hating myself with tremendous passion. My dad would insult me, and called me horrible names. The first time he called me a ""faggot"" had such impact me on me, that I still think about it to this day. The physical and emotional abuse got worse. He used to apologize to me afterward, telling me that he'd change and that it wouldn't happen again... But it would happen again, over and over. 
There was a time in which I used to monitor my gestures, mannerisms, the tone of my speaking voice, the way in which I walked. It was so stressful. I felt abused, but I also needed to do everything that I was told in order to fit in. 

Being called homophobic slurs by your classmates is an awful experience. Having a few male friends because the majority of them would not speak to me fearing they'd be thought as gay due to association is very depressing. Having your own father call you the names that you abhorred tremendously, felt like dying a painful death. He told me many times, when furious, that I needed to run away or kill myself (I tried both suggestions several times before he even mentioned them, and almost succeeded at the latter). 

My family's religious nature has been a strong component in the way in which I was treated. I'm positive that my parents and siblings would be tolerant and accepting if they weren't religious. 
I used to argue and have discussions with them about liberal topics, but they're too set in their ideas. Today, I just avoid those conversations. 

My dad has shown me that he loves me in many occasions. But I know that his love is conditional. I know that I love him, and I have many reasons to hate him for all the terrible things that he's done to me. Because of him I have many insecurities: I'm anxious; it's difficult to trust other men; learning to love myself has been a chore. I'll never forget any of it, but somehow I'm thankful because they've made me the person that I am today. 

I've learned to forgive, and let go. 
I've learned to love myself. "
Agreed. My brother is a fairy compared to me sometimes.
"My best friend stood up for me once during my sophomore year in high school. She was at a classmate's birthday party, and the people present started to talk shit about me. Then the birthday girl said I was a ""big faggot"" and the other people there grabbed their phones ready to ""let everyone know"". There was when my friend told everyone that I was her boyfriend, even though that wasn't true. I'm so thankful to her."
"As almost everything: it depends.

I know some guys that are ""social media famous"" who are sweet guys and, while they like their social media popularity, they care more about their friends and relationships. Meanwhile I know some guys who aren't as famous and would abandon their friends right away for a chance to get some likes."
"I honestly think about this surprisingly often. It terrifies me to think that I could have been born in North Korea, or hundreds of years ago, etc."

"This is why I *cannot stand* when gay men say being LGBT is not a big issue. In my mind, It's such a thoughtless, selfish and cruel thing to say just because it doesn't reflect your experiences. 

OP your story breaks my heart. I googled for LGBT shelters in Argentina but pulled up a blank. Can you stay with the boy who you were caught kissing as a friend? What about your friend John? Failing that you could try and see if someone on Grindr or Tindr will take you in (I know that's not ideal but I'm think homelessness is probably worse)? 

I thought Argentina was one of the most gay friendly places in South America. I can't believe there aren't more shelters.

OP best of luck. I have my fingers and toes crossed for you bud."
"Yup. I've been told that it's ""unfair"" that I don't ""present myself as gay"" because ""I [she] can usually tell who is gay"" (and thus should not be around her kids)."

Otters are gods.
"First off I want to say good job at being an awesome and supportive mom. I didn't come out to my parents until I finished college, but I always knew that they would support me. The initial conversation is going to be hard, and there's no way around that. I would take the time to sit down with your son and explain to him that you have a hunch that he's gay and that you love and support him unconditionally regardless of his sexuality. It sounds like he has had a tough time accepting it himself, and he might not react well initially. Just know that if he is gay, he will really appreciate your support. Best of luck!"
hey ive heard straight guys with a lisp lol 
"I realized that I couldn't change. It was either die or get used to myself, and I decided that I would die eventually so I may as well live my life, experience what I can, and fuck anyone who doesn't like it."

"No, they're not.  They're just less vocal about their sexuality, and/or you wouldn't guess.  Just like most humans aren't evil, but you'd think so from watching the news."
