"Tinder date. As fate would have it, we had spoken for 6 weeks before meeting. 

He was lovely and I was keen but he had let me know he was shy and that he wanted to work on his face-to-face communication skills. 

I expected a really shy guy, so I came armed with light getting to know you questions. I am a trained counsellor and figured the first meeting might be a bit of making him feel comfortable, not putting too much pressure on him, but rather thinking how i could support him in not being too nervous. I spent so much time googling 'getting to know you questions'. 

None of it mattered because I couldn't shut him up. It was so natural and just flowed. The restaurant had to beg us to leave so they could close. I asked him about it much later, and he said he was surprised as he had never talked that much in his life. 

A year later he asked me to marry him. So I'd say it went pretty well!
"
"I wanted nothing to do with my SO when we first met. He showed up to the bar I worked at with a super douchy guy. They ended up hanging up with a girl whose character I was not okay with, and my SO's douchebag friend started dating that girl right away.

Every time my SO came to the bar with them, he would drift away from their table and hit on me. Long back story short, I assumed that the girl in question had told him that I would be an easy lay, so I was NOT nice to him when he would do this. 

Then, one day I was bartending in the afternoon and I brought my dog with me. SO shows up and spends like 3 hours sitting with my dog. At one point he asked me whose dog it was and if he could take him for a walk. They had the best time together.

When he left, he gave me his business card and said I should call him if I need someone to watch the dog while I'm working. I figured that my dog was a good judge  of character and maybe I should give this guy a chance. I texted him that night and pretty much said the dog was fine, but that I could use some company. 

He never texted back.

At that point, I wanted nothing to do with him. Like, fuck this guy who bothers me for weeks and then can't be bothered to return a text.

 The next weekend, he comes full-on running up to the bar, flings the door open, and yells ""They printed my business cards wrong!!!""

He was so upset when he realized the number was wrong, that he RAN like 1.5 miles to get to the bar to tell me. It immediately melted my heart. I told him to hang out until my shift was over and he could be my date to a party.

We've been dating for 3 years, and I now think that he is the greatest person in the world."
"I've had more than one guy ask me if they could cum in my eye. I declined the tempting offer. 

Also, singing is one of my hobbies and my ex would ask me to try and sing while we had sex. The song I got closest to completing was I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly."
"Abortion.

I was raised conservative Christian. Ever seen the documentary Jesus Camp? That was my childhood. My mom would take me to pro life rallies and protests. I was also raised to be anti gay rights etc. I was so passionate about it. I bought into all the propaganda.

As I got older and slowly lost my faith I became more flexible in my beliefs. Then a few friends came out as gay. Then my mom and dad slowly grew more liberal. I started reading more about gay rights and abortion. I became vehemently pro lgbtq rights but still wavered on abortion. 

Then I got pregnant. I kept it, and love being a mom. But I realized how hard the whole process is. It can destroy your body. And it takes over. No one should be forced to go through that. I started reading abortion stories on /r/twoxchromosomes. And I never found one where I thought ""she never should have had that abortion"". It was absolutely mind blowing.

The best part? Last week I openly discussed abortion with my mom. And she admitted that through her years working at child protection she's come to admit that abortion is sometimes the best option. This is HUGE. "
"2 of my exs had this disgusting thing where they wanted me to deepthroat them until i vomited on their penis. 


I am really not into that sort of thing, so naturally i declined. One of them, however,  wouldn't take no for an answer and tried to force me into it. I ended up covered in bruises from struggling to get my neck and shoulders out of his grasp.


Still makes me feel icky to this day. "
"My now SO asked me to eat a slice of pizza naked when we first started hooking up. He just wanted to see if it would do anything for him.

It didn't."
Mine came from the track club. Now I also harvest friends from my kid's daycare. 
"I've been with enough people to count on one hand, and yet I've still been asked by half of them to do foot shit. like jack them off, *finger them with my toes*, let him finish on them, etc. I think my hatred of feet is attracting them, so I live a sock filled life. "
Or bite down.  I will never understand why men think that the time to start being an asshole is when their dick is between my sharp teeth.
"I lived in Kabul, so I maybe have a different take on this than others. After my workplace was attacked by the Taliban and my friends were killed, I realized: terrorists have one purpose, in that is to terrorize. Their goal is to make you so afraid, you stop living your life and being a person. We fight this shit by having the courage to live our lives in the face of it. Waking up every day and being your own self is you looking terrorism in the face and telling it to go fuck itself.

The second you give in to fear or hatred, they've won."
"They should have, it's their job. My guess is they didn't see the Nazi flags and their slogans as a serious threat but freedom of speech and protest. But the Nazi ideology itself involves violence based on race and religion. So even if we say they thought the slogans weren't threats, the flag outside a synagogue alone shows threat IMO."
"Everyone's being serious so I'm going to say onions. I used to pick them out of everything, but now I like them in most things except raw (still too harsh for me) or in onion rings. And I love French Onion soup so much."
"Enjoying our time together with freely flowing conversation, comfortable silences, good rapport, and doing a background activity that we both enjoy that doesn't stop us from connecting (walking around a park or going out to eat are good for me, watching a movie or a play are not)."
"We were supposed to be going to a restaurant we both really enjoyed (must have been our fourth date). He met me at the train station in the pouring rain, walked around the corner to find said restaurant surrounded by fire engines. Plan A ruined. Busy Saturday night and no hope of getting a table anywhere else. He rather meekly suggested we could get stuff and go back to his, and he would cook me whatever I'd enjoy, if I was comfortable with it. I said yes.

Anyway, turns out he was really good at cooking dinner *and* breakfast. A few years of marriage and a couple of kids later, he's still pretty good in the kitchen."
"The ""should"" part depends on the life you live. As far as universal rules, I'd say you should know a trade that can get you by in rough times. Whether that's waiting tables, working retail, farming, sewing, cooking - have a backup plan.  If you currently work retail or food service and don't want to stay there, figure out where you want to be, and start working towards that. If you have a great career where you're making decent money, understand that nothing lasts, and be prepared to find different work, and lower your standards, if times get tough.

If you live in America, I'd say you should know how to drive, how to cook a filling meal for under $5 (/r/eatcheapandhealthy is great for this!), and how to do basic cleaning stuff like laundry and vacuuming. You should have at least one outfit that makes you not hate your reflection in the mirror.  You should know that your happiness is not contingent on romantic partners. You should have at least one hobby that you enjoy - even if your only hobby is watching TV, you should know which shows you like, what you like about them, and how to find more shows to watch.

And you should know that if you don't have this all in place by age 30, that's just fine. I'm going to be 37 next month, and one thing I've learned is, we never stop changing. I still go through fashion phases, I still act immature sometimes, and I still wonder how I've convinced lots of people that I'm an adult."
Next time just upper cut to the balls. He will get off real quick. 
"They obviously should have, it's their job. 

But I imagine it's hard to protect against a march you're in. "
"I commented on a thread in r/oldschoolcool saying people shouldn't be making sexual comments about the 15 year old girl in the photo. (A lot of the thread was sexual comments about her). 

Then I commented about how ironic it is that redditors complain all the time about men being stereotyped as pedophiles, but then don't want to give up sexual comments about underage girls. "
Never have I ever given birth.
"I used to be a huge homophobe and now I'm a huge lesbian. 

Edit: WOW, thanks for the comments/karma everyone - wasn't expecting it at all. 

But yeah, long story short - I used to be staunchly anti-homosexuality when I was in middle/high school because I thought it was a sin, etc. Staunchly as in, I would spend hours getting into internet debates about it and believed all these weird theories that ""explained"" homosexuality. I also supported shitty things like conversion therapy, etc. 

Eventually, there was a point when I started to became more progressive-thinking and eventually accepted that I was bi my freshman year of college, although I still dated men only and tried to suppress my ""gay feelings"" quite a bit and saw them as shameful. It wasn't until this past year that I finally realized - at age 24, that I was actually not attracted to men romantically/sexually at all. Middle school me would be pissed, lol.  "
"Want to know the truth? I've had some awkward and mediocre first dates that showed that even when there's no chemistry people can still be good.

Like the guy I met who was so nice, but not what I was looking for at all. He asked if he could hug me, I said yes. We talked later and both agreed that there was no chemistry. And that was it. No weirdness. He was a good guy."
"Upvote for use of ""harvest"""
This is the only time I've seen R. Kelly mentioned in a sex story and it didn't turn out bad!
For me to stand in front of or face a full length mirror when fucking me from behind so that they could see as much of me as possible. I mostly find it bizarre because I'm overweight and was surprised numerous men wanted to ogle my naked body that much.
"Someone on AskEurope downvoted me because I hadn't been to a sauna. Really, that's all it said ""No, I haven't been to a sauna"".

It sat there with a 0, haunting me. Was I missing such an important aspect of life that someone had downvoted me for not having reached this milestone? I had to delete it, for I could feel existencial dread creeping up on me. Have you really, TRULY been alive if you've never been on a sauna?

This is a question I cannot answer.
"
"I wouldnt call them partners but more than one person that I've talked to off of okcupid and pof, like a shocking amount of men really, have asked me to take pictures of my panties stuffed in my vagina. Which idk how you even manage to do that. Fabric absorbs wetness and idk i cant just stick things in there, especially dry. Follow up question was always if they could buy my dirty underwear. Which if i had said yes id probably have run out of panties but been a couple of grand richer, so i really missed the boat on that. "
The less fuckable I get the less nice people are. ugh. 
"I've always been a late bloomer with everything. (Except biologically I was super early on everything) 

No one would teach me to ride a bike. I was taught by someone else at 13. 

I didn't get my drivers license until I was 27. 

I still haven't finished college and I'm 29.

I'm not married, I have no children. 

I didn't move out of my dads house until I was 27. 

I didn't deal with a lot of my emotional issues until I was 26. (Anxiety, prior events, depression)

Mentally I have never felt more confident and better, way more grounded, open minded, not hard on myself. I have a pretty low paying job, life isn't the best but I'm working on improving. 

I guess the best advice I could give is life isn't a race. Work on what you need to and try not to compare it to other people's lives. 

"
"I work with highly aggressive special needs individuals. I've been punched in the face several times. It's a huge shock every time and takes effort not to react with rage.

Even worse was when a client jerked off into his hand, ran out of his room, and slapped me across the face with cum. "
"Yes, finally something I can contribute to! Lol

I very recently (June '17) donated my eggs to a family. I started the process in October '16 by filling out some light paperwork online for the nearby big city clinic. December they responded and wanted me to come in to do blood work, urin test (drug test?) and more paperwork etc. They got a hold of me again in January and said everything looked good and advanced me to the next stage. 

April they sent out a final packet questionnaire which included extensive background info on my parents, grandparents, siblings etc. They had me book an appointment to see a therapist they referred, to get a psych eval to make sure I was mentally stable. She asked me things like..

""what happens if the kid seeks out their bio 'mom' ?"" ( I didnt really care that much. I wouldn't be their mother, just someone who donated some genes. In no way would I consider this making me a mom).

""Why are you donating?"" (I want to be able to give a gift that can never be repaid... The money was just a bonus in my eyes) 

""what do your parents think?"" ( They weren't exactly over the moon since they want my husband and I to have kids of our own but they were okay with it.)

After the eval in April, I submitted my questionnaire and profile to the clinic with about 20 pictures of me aged 0-15 and waited. I got a call in May that a patient had selected my profile and they wanted me to come in and get things started. It moved fairly quickly after that. 

We decided that June is a good month for me and the patient. She requested I get a DNA test and I had no problem. ( This isn't with every case, but she wanted it and I didn't care. After all, they're paying for it and I get a copy so yay.)

I get my fertility meds and it's 1-2 shots every night for like 15+/- nights. I was terrified but actually turned out to not be bad at all. My husband was a huge help with giving me the shots in my belly. They're just tiny tiny insulin needles. I do the shots and have to report back to the office about 3 times a week for the first two weeks with blood work to test my level, ultrasounds etc.

Finally it's coming on the 3rd week and we're approaching retrival day. My belly is bloated AF and I'm a little tender but no biggie, I feel fine. They take me back to my own little private room to relax. The doctor, nurse and anesthesiologist all come in and explain what's going on. This is when I first get nervous because I was about to go under and since they're telling me everything, it was a little overwhelming. Then I think about the patient and her husband and think how all they want in life is a baby and I can give them that. It was comforting and reassuring and gave me the courage to continue. Then they handed me my $5,000 check. Woo! :)

Finally it's time. They take me back to the ""throne"" and put heated blankets on me and make me very comfortable. The anesthesiologist lady is holding my hand as I go under and it was very comforting.

Literally 15 mins later they wake me up and I'm totally fine. I was never, ever sore or anything. They retrived 24 eggs total but won't be able to use all. I think they pick the best and try to go from there, I'm not 100% sure. I'll never know if my eggs worked or if she backed out or anything. We both signed papers saying once they're out of my body they are no longer mine. Also, our identities will remain anonymous. I'm just known as Donor #1234.

Edit: formatting.

TL;DR I donated my eggs to a family in need. It went very well. I am very, very happy I did it. I personally would do it again."
"When I first started identifying as a feminist as a kid (around 11) and told my mom I thought women and girls could do anything men and boys could do, she responded by cutting me down. One of her arguments was that there are biological differences in terms of physical strength and that sort of thing, and I pushed back and was very fierce in insisting that it might take a woman more work to get there, but I did believe that women could physically beat men at anything if they just tried and trained hard enough.

Around college age I started getting interested in fitness and such more and I came to terms with the fact that on that point my mom was right - there are differences between men and women in terms of strength, and women who excel in physical feats to the point of beating men are the exception, not the rule.

But that doesn't mean we can't still try, damnit."
"if they're willing to have sex with you, they probably find your body attractive. I think more men are into larger women than they admit"
"I wouldn't consider it bizarre, but I was surprised to have three partners in a row who really enjoyed being dominated by me in the bedroom. I'm very shy and vanilla in my every day life, so I think it's a pleasant surprise when I go into dom mode. That being said, always get consent before you start sexy times. "
"i used to be one of those really annoying atheists that take every opportunity to mock religious people, even when it's out of place. i have several mental illnesses due to trauma and i took issue with people who thought god could exist.

i guess i just mellowed out with age, stopped caring so much, and became less of a bitter person that wanted to have a ''righteous'' reason to bully others. and i've come to see the benefits of having faith, and have even wondered if perhaps some form of belief is coming to me. when i look at how perfectly everything worked out, even if it was absolutely fucking terrible at the time, i have to wonder."
"I was the last girl in my grade to get my period. I was almost 16 and then it came once, and then did not come again for another nine months.

DO NOT pretend that you have your period. You will have it for long enough. There is nothing wrong with you!

Also, if you pretend you have it, then girls will be very suspicious when you ask for a tampon, but they see it fall out of your pocket four hours later....try explaining that one!"
"I don't have any friends.  I'm cordial to  everyone but don't really care what they have to say.  Never have. I'm 72 and have been mostly a loner all my life.  It is definitely by choice.  I am not good at small talk and I just don't like socializing.  I know I'm an introvert and don't fight it.  I love being by myself, and doing what I want when I want to especially now that I'm retired and can sleep til noon if I choose.  I live in senior housing and don't partake in their little gathering of gossip and plans.  I'm just not interested. "
"Advice doesn't apply to all women everywhere, but my main preference is: I'm trying to blend in. Don't fuck that up.

Don't be extra nice- don't offer to do anything more for me than you would another dude coworker. Don't make jokes about having to ""keep it clean"" while I'm around. No need to refer to the group as ""guys... *and lady""* or shit like that. 

I just want to be included in all the same shit as everyone else. I work with mostly older married men, and as a young vagina-haver, I get left out of after-work drinks most of the time, which I find totally lame. Or they get lunch together and don't invite me. We were working on-location and the day was going much later than expected. My boss said I could crash at his (and his wife's!) house if I absolutely needed to, and their was a collective ""ooooh"" from the male coworkers. Like, seriously?"
"I questioned a post in /r/gaming that was a picture of a princess peach cosplay - more notably her peachy ass cheeks. I just asked something like ""How is this related to gaming? Shouldn't this be in /r/cosplay?"" and got fragged by a bunch of assholes insisting it was on topic... There are a bazillion subreddits for both asses and cosplays, why does /r/gaming have to be another one?"
"I'm a lazy, self pitying shit sometimes."
"These tests aren't perfect, but they are a decent place to start when evaluating how well female characters are written.

The Bechdel test: a) At least two named women b) talk to one another c) about anything other than a man.

The Mako Mori test: a) at least one woman b) has her own narrative arc; c) that is not about supporting a man’s narrative arc.

The Sexy Lamp test: a) at least one woman b) who cannot be replaced by a sexy lamp c) is present."
Never have I ever been in a tanning bed.
"Anytime someone tried to shift the blame towards me. ""I'm sorry you feel..."" instead of ""I'm sorry I made you feel..."" "
"Scene: Late 1980s (I'm An Old®)
Me: Senior
Him: Freshman

Waiting for the bus to go to some field trip thing (don't remember exactly), talking to my good friend I'd been buddies with all year. He asks who I'm going to prom with. I tell him nobody. He's not having it. What do I mean I'm not going to prom? I tell him I asked a couple people who already had dates/turned me down flat, and nobody had asked me, so... Meh. I'd gone to a prom at another school the previous year, so I'd had the experience and didn't care much to repeat it. 

Guy is still flabbergasted, can't believe I'm not going. Finally, in exasperation, I tell him, ""Guy. If it's so damn important to you that I go to prom, why don't you go with me?"" :: record scratch sound :: ""Really?"" He says. ""You'd go to prom with a Freshman?"" 

""Only if he's cool,"" I say with a wink. (This guy was smooth as butter at the tender age of 15. I'd always respected how he was bold and fearless, yet not cocky or arrogant in any way. Just self-assured, confident, and ballsy AF.) 

So we rush around one week before the thing. I find a dress I sort of like, hated the color, but whatev. He gets a tux. Without talking about it or coordinating, we ended up matching perfectly. My dress was pink and his tie and cummerbund was this nice pink Hawaiian pattern (see also: Bold AF). My friend is not driving her bitchin' Camaro because her BF is driving them, so she offers to lend it to me to drive. Because my date isn't old enough to get his license yet. LOL 

We meet up with another pair -- both of whom we were both pretty good friends with -- and go to dinner. Then to the dance at a ski lodge that was obvs closed for the summer. Then our class had rented a racquetball club -- the entire facility -- so people could play racquetball, or use whatever other things in the facility. One of the rooms was set up to show some movies. We opted for the movie, which was The Fly with Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. I fell asleep on him. Then off to the Ponderosa breakfast buffet. 

No funny stuff, no fooling around, no pressure, just a really great time. He was funny and charming and just a delightful date. We both had a great time and he came to my graduation party. Soon thereafter, I went off to college and never saw him again. 


Uuuuuuntil recently. 

Thanks to M. Zuckerburg and his algorithms, this guy's name popped up in my feed as a suggested friend, ""Dogzilla_Mom, do you know [Prom Date]?"" Hells yeah! I click the friend button. He messages me a couple days later. We move off FB to text. That turns in to FaceTime and many, many late night phone calls. Finally, we agreed, this is friggin' perfect and we're totally made for each other. 

He just moved in. After 30 years. 

:: mic drop ::"
"Peanut butter. 

My SO was under the very wrong impression that peanut butter belongs in the fridge. We bickered for months because I couldn't justify keeping two of something we only rarely eat anyway, but every time I went to use it, it was hard and impossible to spread. Every time I'd put it back in the pantry, he would move it back to the fridge.

In the end I caved and bought another jar. Then when I went to use it, it was nearly gone. 

SO's answer? ""Oh, yeah. I used it. It spreads better.""

Words failed me and I just got up and walked out of the room. He slept on the couch that night, and by morning, the fridge jar migrated over to the cupboard without further comment. We seem to be at an agreement that it will stay there, and we will never speak of it again. "
"When men say dumb sexist stuff, tell them it's not cool. "
I feel like the kind of guys who would force you to try to do this are the same ones who would resort to domestic violence if you bit them. 
"Never have I ever had sex. I think I may be asexual.

Edit: I could see how this could be a very personal and intimate topic, so I'm not looking for replies!"
"Getting gangbanged. No, did not happen."
"Making women TOO badass. And then, suddenly, it's because some dude did something to her. It's fine to be delicate, vulnerable. You don't have to be an ass kicking, violent hardass to be a strong woman. You don't even have to be a strong woman. You can just be a woman in a story. 

Women who are not people. Who don't have their own motivations, own pasts. Who stink of ""prop for protagonist"" instead of being fully defined people who live their own lives off the page. 

I majored in Creative Writing. Even the character your protagonist passes on the street should have a story; it doesn't matter if you're the only person who knows it.

"she doesn't work, doesn't contribute to rent, or help with any household chores. she's the laziest thing I've ever met. i try to be understanding because i really love her and she's a cat, but some days it's hard. "
I have never smoked a cigarette or done an illegal drug. 
"I'm never passive aggressive to rude people in my bar,  I'm just aggressive.  Last month a dude was being drunk and obnoxious,  bossing me around trying to look macho for his date (who looked embarrassed) . He snapped his fingers, condescended, yelled at a bus boy,  etc. I brought their drinks over,  a beer for the lady and apple juice in a sippy cup for the dude.  He left.  

If I don't feel like being an asshole, I usually say ""we don't speak/ behave like that here. You are invited to leave at this time"" "
"It's a lot less.. sensual? Than I thought it would be. Skin tastes like skin. Bodies are bodies. Most of the fun is who you're with, rather than the act itself. "
"I'm in the same boat. I moved to a new city about 4 months ago, and got a new job. I am the only female in my office, and don't do too much besides go to the gym. Meeting friends has been much harder than I expected. "

Yeah but pizza tho...
Cum is like spit. Not that bad if you're getting it straight from the source but fucking disgusting as soon as a secondary container comes into play.
"Achieve and maintain a healthy weight! That's probably one of the biggest, most attainable things that most people can do to be more attractive and feel/ look better. 

Also, drink plenty of water. Dress for your body. Wear sunscreen. Don't smoke or overeat or overdrink. Be a happy person surrounded by uplifting people. Work *with* not against your natural hair/ height/ eye color/ skin tone. Stand up straight. Don't have nervous habits like nail-biting. More water. More exercise. "
"It was a deleted account but over at /r/cscareerquestions I said that someone should dress nicely to an interview slacks not chinos. If everyone is wearing a suit, you should wear a suit. ""Nice jeans"" don't exist. Evidently that's horrible advice. Maybe because I'm a woman and I know I'm to wear my pantsuit to every interview...I guess it doesn't translate well to men. 

Also, on a female fashion subreddit someone asked about cheap shirts and I mentioned Walmart website has a lot of nice quality affordable shirts. Apparently Walmart is shit and so was my advice. "
"God I'm so tired of people throwing *Gonzales* around like it is some ultimate proof of ""see cops don't care"". All *Gonzales* said was that there is no duty, **IN THE LEGAL SENSE**, to protect citizens. As in the police can't be held liable for preventing crime. ""Duty"" in the legal sense means you are legally obligated to provide/care for someone. A parent has a legal duty to provide for their children and can be held liable if they don't. The government has a legal duty to provide healthcare and reasonable safety  for those in its custody. This is why prisoners can sue for lack of medical care or negligence when it comes to classification. This is different from moral sense of the word ""duty"".

SCOTUS ruling that law enforcement has a legal duty to protect the public from crime was be a terrible idea. That ruling would open up law enforcement agencies to a lawsuit **every time someone is a victim of a crime**. SCOTUS isn't stupid, so they shot *Gonzales* down. But no, lets spread some mis-information and keep the anti-cop circlejerk going. "

This could be a movie I'd like to watch lol
"How to cook, clean, quick sewing repairs (think button replacement),  how to change a tire, how to check and hanged their own oil, how to balance a check book, apply for loans, check their credit score...I personally think these are basic life skills that everyone, man and woman, should be able to do.


Edit:  I said balancing a checkbook when clearly I should have said managing a budget. Personally to me they are one in the same since they both deal with maintaining your cash flow. Sorry for the confusion."
"ah, this is such a sweet story! and it gives a shy person (a.k.a. me) hope"
"I quit smoking cigarettes last year. You're not missing anything.

Drugs on the other hand... some are fascinating, mind-altering experiences, some are just a temporary escape from the mundane. They're definitely not necessary, they definitely can be abused,  but they are not intrinsically harmful. Some of my happiest memories involved recreational drug use."
"they seemed to think that if i agreed to meet, they pretty much won me over already. i'd show up to meet and they couldn't make conversation verbally, were rude, or sloppily dressed. sometimes all three.

and then if i said i didn't want to meet again, they'd get all mad because i ''led them on'' or was ''shallow''. again, probably because they thought they already had me/i fell in love with their ''real'' self online... after 3 emails.

i think of online dating as an online meeting service, and they seemed to think of it as an online instant girlfriend service."
I am not going to be or do anything extraordinary in my life. 
"From what I can remember, the Bechdel test was never intended to be the end all be all feminism test for stories. It's more like a ""Look how low we can set the bar and lots of stories will still fail"" deal. "
"Haha we have the opposite argument when we go grocery shopping. Grocery stores here are *so* crowded so I hate using a cart. Using a basket makes it easier to navigate the store, plus I know that if my basket is too heavy to carry through the store then it's also too heavy to carry to the train. 

Anyway, whenever we go to the supermarket together, he always insists on getting a cart and my response is always ""fine, but I'm not touching the cart."" And then at some point in the middle of our shopping trip he'll always insist on having me steer the cart while he runs off to get something in another isle. We get into an argument every time. "
"&gt; Then I commented about how ironic it is that redditors complain all the time about men being stereotyped as pedophiles, but then don't want to give up sexual comments about underage girls.

"I lost my sense of smell after being attacked and getting a brain injury 2 years ago. There are pros and cons for sure, mostly it sucks but I try and make the best of it. It has vastly changed my life but I'm starting to get used to it. 

Pros: I can change both of my boys dirty diapers with ease. 
I can eat basically anything now because no smell = little to no taste. Except spicy foods (that's a feeling not a taste, and I'm a big puss with that)

I no longer have to smell anyone's farts which is pretty awesome. 

I can drink any liquor I want it's all basically water that burns going down. 

Cons: Forcing myself to eat because nothing really sounds good anymore. I have a high metabolism so I don't have much spare weight to lose. 

I miss the smell of rain almost more than anything..

I miss the smell of my wife's perfume and her hair more than anything and I would give anything to smell her again. 

If there is a gas leak I'm fucked. If there is a fire in my home I won't know until I SEE the smoke or start to choke on the air I'm breathing. 

If I forget to put on deodorant I either have to count on someone's brutal honesty to tell me or hope that I remember at some point through out the day. 

I have no idea when food goes bad. I'm pretty terrified of drinking bad milk or eating bad meat and getting sick. So I stick to labels pretty strictly 

Edit: I keep adding as I think of things."
We met up at a bar and shared a couple drinks.  We talked all evening and then he walked me to my car and gave me a quick hug.  On the way home I got a text saying he wanted to kiss me but that he also wanted to make sure that it was what I wanted too.  I told him he can kiss me next time.  Now he talks about moving in together and blending our families.  So that was a good date.
"I had a non linear career path, though I guess my first degree never really gave me a career at all 😬 😟 but now I'm very happy and would say I'm successful. 
I majored  in English first, graduating in basically the peak of the recession with no real job prospects because I didn't want to be a teacher or go to law school. My parents were both English majors with great careers - an editor and a travel writer - so I had hoped to follow in their footsteps . However, when I graduated my classmates were taking unpaid internship or really crappy jobs because there just weren't many options. I luckily saw the writing on the wall shortly before graduation and took a few extra nursing prerequisites my senior year. I also volunteered in a hospital to make sure I liked it. After graduation I waitressed, lived with my parents again to save up money, and applied to nursing schools while taking more nursing prerequisites at community college. 
I got into a really competitive accelerated BSN program, graduated about 6 years ago, and have been really happy ever since. Nursing is hard but so rewarding and now I'm in grad school for my MSN to be a CNM. I wonder sometimes if I should have tried harder to use my English degree but I am really passionate about healthcare and I know I'll always be able to get some kind of nursing job. I highly recommend it for a second career; I meet a lot of people who became nurses later in life for a variety of reasons and are happy with their choice. "

"Does clit biting count as bizarre? It was certainly bizarre in the context of everything I had learned about oral sex. And yet, I've had 2 partners asked me to do it in the heat of the moment. I only obliged with 1 of them,  and she loved it. I didn't understand it and it hurts to think about, but hey, what the lady wants, the lady gets"
"In sixth grade I got my period before my friend Lisa. She was jealous. A couple months later as 12 year old me is trying to get used to the diaper feeling of a pad she tells me she has to go to the doctor later in the week, she thinks she started her period. I a curious youngster asked her to explain, you either start one or don't, right? She nonchalantly tells me, ""it's blue, like powerade."" 😯

I'd like to take this moment; almost 17 years later, to say this: What in the actual fuck Lisa, you're a dirty liar."

"Fixating on breasts and nipples.  Male writers will lavish descriptive prose on heaving bosoms and permanently perky nipples, but men are rarely described from the neck down (and if they are, it's in the most general terms like ""broad"" or ""strong.""  Nobody ever writes about male nipples poking seductively against a shirt or dicks bouncing sensuously inside pants, and male characters don't walk around naked for no reason or randomly start caressing their chests.  But male writers tend to assume that women are constantly thinking about their breasts, touching their breasts, or comparing their breasts to other people's breasts.  Really, though, women don't think about their chests any more than men think about their chests."

"I used to think all cheaters were selfish assholes, no exceptions. If their relationship was bad they could break up instead of cheating and if they choose to stay they shouldn't get involved with someone else. More stories I have witnessed, I changed my mind this was a rule. First I saw this man who was having an affair. I learned (and later confirmed) he tried to get a divorce from his abusive wife before he started to date with another woman but his wife tried to kill herself because of this, was seeing a therapist and he was waiting for her to feel better. That had been going on for almost two years at that point. He was a lonely man and depressed himself. I have seen people who were in one-sided relationships, they didn't receive attention or love, were treated like they didn't exist but they couldn't leave and were trying to find strength to leave by seeing someone else. I still think the action of cheating is bad and most cheaters I've seen want to have everything, but not all of them. "
"&gt; Apparently Walmart is shit and so was my advice. 


I used to follow that sub and comment often, but after a post a few weeks ago I just quit it cold turkey. The post was about what differentiated ""classy"" outfits from ""tacky"" ones; the example outfits they gave for ""tacky"" all honestly looked fine, although they may have had some outdated accessories (bubble necklaces and peekaboo socks, for example). The OP said that the difference between classy and tacky New England style was ""authentic, quality brands"" like LL Bean. Instantly I was put off; who can afford to be clothed exclusively in LL Bean? I read through the comments and the consensus seemed to be: you're tacky if you wear inexpensive clothes. And they called J Crew ""cheap""! These people were acting like J Crew customers are all welfare recipients. I had a good government job and I couldn't afford to shop at J Crew! That whole sub acts like $600 handbags are affordable, $200 jeans are ""bargain"" and if you shop at Zara you're basically homeless."

Some things my friends experienced and learned about dating in high school or college years like ""When your date does this, it usually means that"", ""If you don't set boundaries about this it will screw up everything later""... I learned them in my mid and late 20s. I'm almost 32 now and doing pretty good I think. My advice would be if you don't/can't experience something, pay attention what's going on around you, to get an idea what this and that might mean in case that happens to you too. Not everything has to be experienced firsthand to learn."
"Lol, skin tasting like skin is one of most disappointing aspects of physical intimacy, I feel.

Back when I used to work retail though, if someone demanded I check for something in the back after I'd already said I'm sure we don't have it, I'd go, take an extraordinaryily long break in there, and then bring back something similar but not quite what they were looking for. So they'd get excited for a moment, ramping up that I told you so, and then be disappointed. ""Oh, this isn't it? You want me to check again?"" 

Almost never did they continue to want to wait the 15 minutes it took me to check for the mystery item, and if they did, more chill time for me!"

Beer. I've tried so many kinds. But I just hate it.
"I used to only eat local, organic food, and took loads of supplements. I thought everyone else was lazy or ignorant for not doing the same. Now, I'm older, poorer, and a parent. I also live in the Midwest instead of the PNW. Eating local and organic is prohibitively expensive. Making sure everyone has food in their tummy and a roof over their heads is most important.

My plan is to do any kind of part-time job I can get, work my way up, and maybe be someday healthy enough to go studying for a degree that could get me a ""real"" job.

"Abortion was mine too until I got pregnant at 17. My parents were always pro-choice and I really didn't want to be a mom, but here abortion is illegal. So I underwent an illegal abortion, and it failed, and I also almost bled to death.

When I was pregnant, I met other pregnant girls, some as young as 14 which were kicked out from their homes and living with their boyfriend who were in their 30s or 40s.

One of the girls eventually killed herself after her parents kicked her out, her boyfriend left her and she had a baby with Down's.

And given all that is when I decided abortion needs to be legal and accessible to everyone. More than half of those girls didn't want a child, they were forced to carry to term because they couldn't afford the illegal abortion pills or were too afraid or too far along to do it."

Or how despite my boss specifically saying ""jcpianiste is the lead on this project, she can answer any technical questions you may have"" they still direct their questions to my boss or my male counterpart who works on a completely different project.  

Also try not to operate on the baseline assumption that we don't know what we're doing.  We just hired a new guy and despite the fact that I've worked this project for six years and he hasn't even been here for six months, it's like he's decided it's his job to argue with me.  Yes, I *can* provide exhausting levels of detail regarding why I want you to do it this way, but could you just start by assuming I'm a competent human who has thought about this for more than five seconds?  I'm not saying my design ideas should be immune from criticism - there are plenty of people on my team, men and women, that I trust and depend on to give me their ideas on the pros and cons of various approaches - but way too often I encounter dudes that seem to think they know better than me just because they're a guy, experience be damned."

As life goes on, things become more, well, gray. People my age that never changed an opinion of theirs or still see only in black and white, are, IME, usually intolerable Sheldon Cooper types"

This is a lovely, mature outcome!

 I had a date like that once - perfectly lovely guy, really interesting, just... not what I was looking for. We caught it early enough to part ways amicably and with mutual respect. And that was a good thing, because about 2 years later, I set him up with a dear friend of mine who he has fantastic chemistry with and they are now married! Parting ways swiftly and kindly can save so much awkwardness!"

It says ""I think you have a really nice smile and I'd love to hang out sometime"" with his number. I called him later that night and we've been together for almost 8 years.

Super attracted I put them on a pedestal and overlooked their shit qualities because they were so attractive. Letting the attraction build with other people allowed me to properly learn about the other person without having my rose colored glasses on and then properly decide if they were a good fit or not. Of course I still have to be initially attracted to the latter because a physical connection is important to me. 
"We were arguing about how I didn't like to drink around his family (his dad was an alcoholic, as was his uncle). That family would make frat boys on a bender jealous of how much they drank. It was obscene, and it made me uncomfortable. 

I blurted out ""The amount your family drinks is not normal! It's not normal to require thousands of dollars worth of booze and multiple liquor runs for a family wake!"" He stopped and in complete sincerity said ""It's not?""

Unsurprisingly, he eventually developed his own problem with alcohol.

"For anyone reading this thread and seriously considering this, I would ask you to read a NYT article that came out in the last ~3 months about the unexamined long-term health risks of egg donation, particularly liver cancer and liver failure, that may result from the hormone injections.  Multiple young women who have donated eggs have died of liver-related issues within a few years of donating.

There is apparently no long-term tracking of the health and side effects of egg donors, partially because the registries are so anonymized.  There have also apparently been less rigorous testing of the hormones and procedures than would otherwise be expected of such an invasive and risky process.

Please do your research, be aware of the risks, and keep yourself safe. 

Edit: the examples given in the article deal with colon cancer, not liver cancer, and I was misremembering. "

We took turns buying each other drinks. He showed me his Star Wars tattoo. We watched bands play and talked about music for hours. I met some of his friends and they were also cool.

"US coastal city here.  

1) Disillusioned that anything I do will have any impact barring significant time and energy, which I simply do not have.  
2) Privileged to be living in a location with a local/state population that already shares many of my political stances to the point where issues that are contested nationally have little impact on my day to day life, and issues that are contested locally are not really of major importance to me.  
2b) To that same effect, feeling like calling my reps will have little to no actionable outcome since they already vote how I'd request.  
3) Too tired from my everyday life to want to put any more energy into topics that do affect me but are draining to engage in (ie, gender in tech). I'd rather spend my very limited downtime relaxing than getting even more burnt out by what can feel like bashing your head against a wall or screaming into a void. "

my roommate has a depression and has been on a break from studying and when i notice she's still in bed watching tv after 2 in the afternoon i'll knock on her door to ask her if she wants a cup of coffee (she told me she appreciates it when i check how she's doing and always comes downstairs to chat after this) - so if you have nice roommates you could ask them to knock on your door / drag you out of bed!

"Surprised I'm the first person to say weed.

Smoked with friends a few times during/after college and honestly didn't get anything out of it unless I was drinking as well, and then I'd rather just be drinking.

Tried an edible at a concert thinking it would be strong enough that I could finally experience being stoned. It worked! I also hated it. I felt like everything around me was covered in molasses, and then I wound up missing half the concert because it made me sick and I was too busy puking in the venue bathroom to watch the band.

Experiences with salvia and opiates (prescribed to me, not heroin or anything) were both similar."
"I was a late bloomer in a lot of ways. I think I just wanted to stay being a kid longer than most teenagers did. I didn't wear much makeup, didn't want a boyfriend etc. all through high school. I was kind of a plain jane girl. I was super duper shy, didn't get a lot of attention but I kept out of trouble. I have mixed feelings about this now. I was a good kid, had a big nice group of friends, and I'm glad I didn't go through the major high school drama that lot of teens do. But when I finally did come into my own in my 20s it was so great. I studied what I wanted to in University and met lots of people with my same interests. I gained confidence, wore makeup and felt really pretty for the first time in my life. Some times it just takes a little longer to get to that point, but it will happen when you find something to do that you love! And a lot of times what you ""love"" doesn't appear until after well out of high school. Keep going - you'll find who you are. Sometimes the prettiest flowers are the ones that take their time to bloom, and do so when the other flowers have long wilted :) "

"That definitely depends on the person. I absolutely find other men attractive and notice them, but I have no urge to act on it. I just enjoy the view. What I have is infinitely better than any of those other men.

Dear god how do you even react to that
"this. i don't think it's even about being into larger women in particular, it's just that guys really don't care all that much ime. they see the good."
"This sub downvoted me pretty hard once for saying I didn't mind headscarfing (when I lived in a conservative Islamic country) and that I didn't feel oppressed by it. That's when I realized a) how white this sub is, b) how little it knows about Islam, and c) how angry people get when you discuss Islam in a way that doesn't conform to their preconceived notions. Then later someone came back and told me that they downvoted me for how ""defensive"" I got when people jumped down my throat about how I was refusing to see my own oppression. Apparently rationally explaining why you don't feel oppressed is the same thing as refusing to realize one is being oppressed, and that deserves angry downvotes.

It was one of the weirdest things I've ever experienced in this sub and a big reason why I stopped coming around here. ""I don't feel oppressed."" ""BUT YOU'RE BEING OPPRESSED."" ""No I'm not, here are my reasons."" ""YOU'RE BEING OPPRESSED, YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT."" ""I think you have no idea what my life is like and you're really ignorant about a lot of things."" ""STOP BEING SO DEFENSIVE, IF YOU WEREN'T SO OPPRESSED, YOU'D UNDERSTAND.""

And that's when I realized that this sub is full of well-meaning but ignorant white women who don't let you speak for yourself if the thing you're saying isn't the thing they believe.

"I feel stupid saying this but I wish he would take more photos of me?
     
I don't really enjoy being photographed but I love having pictures to look back on. Therefore I'm someone who is always taking pictures of others but rarely have any of myself. When friends take a picture of me it's almost like a compliment because they want to capture the moment with me. But idk this sounds really vain and self-absorbed and is probably irrational. "

"Are you planning on having kids soon? If not, then worrying about this can just cause greater anxiety. 

What's more is that if you look up birth stories (not recommended) you will find mostly negative ones because people tend to be more vocal about their negative experiences. People who have easy pregnancies and easy births don't tend to share their stories as much. 

I am currently pregnant and have a lot of friends who have had kids who have spoken very frankly to me. 

There can be big issues post childbirth. Some of them are reversible and some may have impacts for years/forever. 

However, many (not all) people make a choice that having a child is worth the risk. "

"I started losing weight in March. First thing I did was subscribe to r/loseit. Then, I calculated my TDEE. After that, I signed up for MyFitnessPal and started to track ALL of my calories. I went from eating 2500 calories mindlessly to eating about 1500 calories a day. There was very little exercise on my part during that transition other than a few walks on my break at work and stretching at home before bed. I lost about 5 pounds right away (likely water weight). I also increased my water intake to about a gallon a day. Skin cleared up, I'm a lot less bloated, and it keeps me less hungry. Since March I have lost about 15 pounds and dropped a pant size. I've started walking Monday-Wednesday-Friday for 30 minutes and then Saturday for an hour and a half in the morning. It's coming off at a glacial pace but I'm really happy that I started when I did.

"Offline, yes.

In the past I've been the friend who will be there when you need them, will sub you that fiver you need to get to work this week, look after your kids because you need to go out, look after your house/pets while you're on holiday, sit while you sob at 3 in the morning about whatever heartbreak it is this time, build you up and be whatever you need me to be.

Not once has anyone ever done the same for me. If I was upset or needed someone it was an inconvenience and I needed to ""get over"" myself and ""act like the adult you are - adults don't sit and cry to their friends, they fix what's making them upset and shut up about it"" (said the person that would cry to me literally every night between 1 and 4am like clockwork about how much it hurt that their girlfriend left them and they'd never get over it **for about a month**, sometimes in person after they've made me go and *pick them up so they could cry to me in person*).

They didn't even want to spend time with me if I wasn't fixing them somehow? There was no going to the movies, or shopping, or having lunch out, or watching some goofy thing on netflix at home. I was occasionally an afterthought for group activities, where I was invited but ultimately sat on the fringe no matter how I tried to join in. If I tried to spend time with them they were always busy. If I was upset, they were always busy. The only time they weren't busy was when they needed a shoulder to cry on or a babysitter so they needed to butter me up.

It just got exhausting and depressing that I was outputting so much effort and those people would never do it for me.

I figure there's probably something wrong with me, but there's no use in dwelling on it. I've been burned repeatedly for 20 years, I'm not going to spend the next 20 trying to cultivate relationships that are likely to go exactly the same way as all the ones before it.

Now I have friends online and that's about it. They're there when I need them, I'm there when they need me, but otherwise there's enough distance for there to not be expectations. I'm not lonely because of that, and that'll do me."
"I don't know if this counts. But first date with current SO was amazing. I didn't really have any expectations. I was day drunk, we had been talking on Tinder for a few days. I wanted to keep being day drunk, so I invited him to the bar I was at on a whim. He wasn't busy, he came. I wasn't dressed for a date. I was in a crappy tshirt and jeans. I had been biking all day. I was sweaty. My hair was flat. My makeup wasn't flawless. But I just owned the moment because I was a little tipsy and had the confidence of a super star.

Date was amazing. He was amazing. He still is amazing. Being able to be that comfortable with him right from the start without getting worked up or stressed out was awesome. It definitely set the tone for our relationship. "
"I have said it once and I will say it again, get in good with the dog, get in good with the girl. 

This reminds me of a a time when I had an apartment downtown and I had just shed myself of a parasitic roommate who never paid any rent. 

In celebration I cooked a lasagna and on a crazy whim I made it vegetarian. This was right after cleaning my entire apartment top to bottom.

The moment​ the lasagna was in the oven the cat starts going bonkers ( (this is him)[https://imgur.com/gallery/zn2rj] ).

He demanded that I take him on ""an adventure"". Which is him walking in the hallways of the building and I follow him then he eventually would pick a random apartment door and command me.to open someone's apartment... I Never did more than follow then take him home when he wanted doors opened (the place used to be a huge three story House so Harold thought he should live in all of a huge house). 

he we downstairs and wanted to sit on the front porch... and we had a lasgna worth of time so sure. 

we went out and he went to the bottom steps and sat on the bottom step looking at all the people, and coaxing as many of them for pets as he could. he even snapped at a man in a business suit who didn't comply with the demands for cat/ hand interactions.

about 10 minutes till my lasagna was to be done I noticed that the street car stop out front of my house was actually rather full (a whole 5 people!) and when I noticed it the cat saw me looking and charged on over there.... so I had to ho get him, keep him out of the street and all.

He sat right next to this girl and meowed at her. she went from starting off into space to noticing a cat had arrived. I stooped down to pick him up apologize and take him back inside when she picked him up and got a little misty eyed. 

apparently she was on her 2nd year of college and had really missed her cats at home. I said that it was fine if she held/pet/played with him as long as it was on my porch. Also the porch was covered and it JUST started to mist with a tiny bit of rain.

As she, still holding the cat, walked up the stairs she slipped! and she turned and sacrificed all comfort and safety to make sure my cat was ok. she wanged her head pretty hard and I got her sitting down on a chair on the porch. The cat scattered back inside. 

we talked for a bit she had bit her tongue a but as well and I was afraid she wasn't ok... but after two.minutes she seemed ok, and asked if I had a bathroom she could wash up in.

I showed her to the bathroom and waiting to walk her back to her streetcar station. while she was in there my phone alarm went off and my lasagna, that I had wholly forgotten about was done. I pulled it out and set it down to rest... and promptly burned my arm. 

I will admit the yelp I let out was less than manly, but it did expedite her use of the bathroom. I asked her if she could keep the cat out of the molten lasagna whilst I tended to my arm beyond cold water in the kitchen sink. 

I start to Neosporin and wrap my arm (a long thin burn on the inside of my arm) when I heard ... singing? I came out of the bathroom, all patched up, and there she was sitting in the kitchen cat on her lap sound asleep with her singing to the cat. 

She said that she always used this song on her cats to get them off her lap. I responded that once Harold started a nap he generally finished it. she said ""Well we are this far into this surprise date we might as well have dinner. I made her up a plate and when she saw it was vegetarian she got all excited but wouldn't say why. we talked for like 3 or so hours and had a lot of laughs (she was super funny, and the poor girl thought I was funny too). 

We finished eating and she asked me what I thought I was going to be doing with my evening so I motioned at my computer and there on the screen was tge DvD menu to Monty Python's Holly Grail. 

She screamed in excitement and we both laid on my bed and watched/sang along to the whole movie. After the movie the cat (who chaperoned the whole film by laying in between us) decided that another adventure was in order but this time we needed to go to the balcony and hang out with my very gay nextdoor neighbor James out there. 

James is simply a delightful person and the three of us laughed and talked into the night. Then it happened. She asked me/James how long I had been a vegetarian... and James retorts ""/u/Tetragonos You aren't a vegetarian!"" I agreed with him I am and have never been a vegetarian. I just on s whim made the lasagna vegetarian. She looked so crest fallen and in 15 minutes she had packed herself up and was out of there. 

was a nice date otherwise. "

"Yes. I was in a relationship where I was putting in all the effort and I really loved him... but, it wasn't being reciprocated. We were both really busy with work, and we lived an hour away from each other but he was putting in minimal effort and bailing on plans. I knew I had to end the relationship because I was unhappy... I hated having to do it because he was my first love and first everything. "

That shit was just straight up depressing."
"Do you want to know the real reason it is more expensive to be a woman? Because of things like the ""pink tax"" where items marketed toward women are priced higher than the same product that is marketed toward men or to no particular gender.

And then there is the fact that tampons and pads are taxed as LUXURY ITEMS so we have to pay a high sales tax on items that are already pretty fucking expensive, every single month. 

So, no, it isn't more expensive to be a woman because we think we need to do all that shit to be pretty. 

Edit: fixed a word and want to clarify that by taxed as a luxury item I mean that they are taxed at all, whereas other medically necessary items are not. For people who live in high sales tax states like I do (9.5% combined) it is brutal. "

"The first time I had sex it was a theeesome. To be fair, it wasn't my first 'sexual encounter' but the 'first' one was assault so I don't count it. 

It was Halloween, or the night before, I was with friends and friends of friends, we went to a college party, went back to one persons apartment, we were all chilling and one guy just sort of gradually entered my personal space. Very slow and subtle, but not sneaky. Like he was testing the waters, and he asked before he ever actually touched me. Things start warming up and it goes from ""oh this guy is just a touchy friendly person"" to ""oh his hand on my leg is teasing the edge of my skirt, this is DEFINITELY flirty""

Despite my previous nasty experience, I felt extremely comfortable and safe, never pressured. He asked me privately if I'd like to go home with him and his girlfriend, so I did. Everyone there was VERY aware of what was going on with us, they definitely teased us as it escalated. The three of us went home, and things moved at a comfortable pace. I confessed that my only experience had been a bad one, and they were both very understanding and very careful. They asked before everything they did, and I didn't have to do anything I didn't want to. I mostly ended up watching them, and we all fell asleep together. It fixed a lot of the things in me that had been broken, and to this day I'm not exactly sure WHAT about them made me feel so safe and comfortable right off the bat. 

And then the next night us three and three other people all had group sex, it was a wild few nights of losing my V-card. 

EDIT: For the record, even though we lived kind of far apart, our relationship continued this way for about a year, with a few more encounters. Somewhat recently, all three of us realized we wanted different things out of a poly relationship, and I've stopped having sex with them, but we're all still good friends. I'm hanging out with them in a few days for an ice cream housewarming party. "

You learn not to.
When am I going to have kids..... so infuriating 
I used to be attracted to guys that were cynical and negative about everything (usually using humor). Sincerity and enthusiasm are things I find more attractive now.
"So I didn't expect it to go bad per se, but it was my first date from an online site so yeah. I've also given part of this story in a previous thread. And I wasn't even planning on meeting up with him to begin with, I was still nervous and new to the dating scene from a 9 year relationship that spanned my entire adult life from high school. So suffice to say I was starting from square 1.

So I'm at Disney (I have an annual pass and was just killing time walking around). During my walk back to the car I open up Tinder to finally get around to deleting the app. I hadn't had much luck because I hadn't really clicked with anyone. I open it up to see a message from a guy I swiped on weeks ago. We just matched and he messaged me immediately. I figure that I'm bored and it's like 10 more minutes to my car, so why not. We start talking and I definitely feel comfortable with him. I decide keep the app to continue talking to him. 

Two days later he asks me about my job (911 dispatcher). He asks specifically how long I've been there, the areas I take calls for, and what time I usually work. I'm sitting here thinking that this guy is going to kill me or steal my identity or something. Like these questions are oddly specific! So I show my concern and he says he was in a bad accident where he almost died, in fact he should have died. He just wanted to know if I might have been involved in the call, though he's aware it's probably a small chance because he was hospitalized for 4ish months and by the time he was released, he felt weird showing up to thank the firefighters involved all that time later. I look into it, and *holy shit* I took the only 911 call! And due to a specific question I asked out of my own volition it probably made all the difference since they ordered to launch a helicopter after hearing it. At this point he insisted on meeting me to thank me in person (makes me uncomfortable, but I figure he feels strongly about it so why not). I've never met anyone I've taken a call for and it makes me feel awkward to be thanked, but he seems nice enough and it'd make a cool story anyways. 

So we keep talking through text for a few days and meet up at a bowling alley between us for drinks and pool. I definitely have tons of fun and time flies by fast. I don't even notice that we were there for like 6 hours! We click and he's super polite. He doesn't even use pool as a reason to get touchy or look at my ass (he'd move to the opposite side of the table when I shot) so he got points from me for that. Afterwards as the alley is closing and they're kicking us out, he says he has something for me in his truck and he gives me flowers as a thank you for taking his 911 call. I basically just take the flowers and stand there awkwardly mumbling thanks and other awkward things about the flowers.... then he kisses me. It's not an aggressive kiss or anything, very tentative. But it was the first kiss I've had since my ex... and this might be TMI but it kind of made me realize I'm a sexual person. Sex with my ex was basically all about his benefit without foreplay and very little affection (little to no kissing unfortunately). This kiss was solely focused on me. We basically ended up making out in his truck for near an hour and every move he made was very focused on me and not pushing me farther than I was comfortable. We just... clicked. 

We've been seeing each other casually for 5 months now and as far as I know, we're exclusive. Things seem to be moving towards a more standard relationship the last few weeks, so who knows. I just enjoy who and what we are in the moment whether it lead to something more solid or us remaining friends. 

Edit: grammar and clarification"
"Fanny. I nearly choked the first time I heard someone say 'fanny pack', and refer to their derrière as a fanny. In Scotland, it is a slang word for the female genitals.

Also, the word 'cunt' here is used fairly easily at people (not always as a terribly bad thing either), but I know American friends who were absolutely astonished to hear it."
"It's not a mistake per se, but I find it annoying and distracting when the physical descriptions of male and female characters are vastly different from each other. Like ""The woman steps into the room, her long blonde hair cascading like liquid gold down her bare smooth shoulders, nipples rigid under her red silky dress, hips swishing, heavily lidded eyes sparkling like emeralds, she speaks in a soft hoarse lispy slightly childlike voice and her smile brings forth something poetic or a childhood memory blahblah. The man steps in. Is presumably dressed. Rubs the scruff on his chin thoughtfully. Is tall and has a scar.""   

Example from Stephen King, who's terrible at this: 
&gt;&gt; Frannie leaned one hand against the warm metal of her car, took off her sneakers, and put on a pair of rubber thongs. She was a tall girl with chestnut hair that fell halfway down the back of the buff-colored shift she was wearing. Good figure. Long legs that got appreciative glances. Prime stuff was the correct frathouse term, she believed. Looky-looky-looky-here-comes-nooky. Miss College Girl, 1990.

Note that she's being described by the narrator and by herself. Who refers to themselves as prime stuff?

When this woman character later meets one of the main male characters, he describes her in a similar way as the narrator:
&gt;&gt; She was tall and pretty and very fresh-looking. Her dark eyes and hair accentuated a look that could be taken for dewy helplessness.

There are no physical descriptions of what she sees when she first meets him, what his level of freshness is, if he's sweet-smiled and dewy-eyed, etc. In fact, I read that entire book without ever knowing how long his legs are. "
"I got a degree in manufacturing / industrial engineering and worked in oil &amp; gas for a few years before I rage quit.

"Abortion is probably one of mine too. But my story is different and not Jesus Camp-y, although religious.

My parents would both probably say they are prolife. My dad studied to be a pastor but my mom is more vocally prolife. I say vocally but she is absolutely NOT waving signs that say ""abortion is murder,"" and harassing women. She's actually big on birth control access and tends to focus on social service programs and helping support women and children. So I never had the indoctrination and vehement antiabortion bs even though my parents are ""pro life.""

As an example, One of my best friends had an abortion in high school. My mom knew. She responded by giving her a hug and letting her rest at our house. I'm sure my mom didn't agree with the choice but she loves my friend and wants to support women and girls. She also doesn't think pro life is just abortion; she's very vocally against the death penalty for example.

I considered myself ""personally prolife"" for years. I wouldn't likely not get an abortion myself but think it should be an option. I've come to realize that's not what ""pro life"" means and ""personally prolife"" is really pro choice. I think all women should have access to safe, affordable abortion but also to birth control and support if they want to raise their child. Reproductive justice of all kinds, abortion and others."

"I have! I don’t do it anymore and never did it for a long period of time. I tried it in high school around prom for like a week or so. 

I love the relaxation aspect of it. I find the heat in combination with the alone time really nice. A lot of the ones you actually lay in also have fans at one end. I kind of got that ‘laying in the sun on the beach with a breeze’ feeling from it. 

The smell is uh unique. Tanning salons reek of tanning oils and burnt skin. I wasn’t a fan of that. "
EXACTLY. And it has to be instant for me. Cum from a penis as it's cumming? Perfect. Leftover cum that I'm supposed to lick off the penis and it's now had time to get cold? Disgusting. Or even like...my ex would cum on me and then scoop it up with his fingers and he wanted me to lick it off and the thought makes me queasy now.
Why the Hell would a mother know how big their adult sons penis is?

"Lisa would lie about anything. Her boyfriend at the time was a member of the semi-popular band 98°. Not the main guy, but a background member. That has to be less conspicuous right? I found out because my mom bought me the CD and I recognized one of the guys in the CD booklet.

 She was 11 and we lived in BFE, looking back blue Powerade shouldn't have thrown me as much as it did.

"""They see the good"" this is the best way to explain it that girls just don't ever get. Every guy checks out ALMOST every girl. But what they are looking at rarely isn't the negative but the positives. Girl has a larger stomach, so what she's got great boobs. She has small boobs? I'm checking out her toned legs. Guys will look for the most attractive attribute of the girl and focus on that. They completely will ignore bad hair days, or a little over weight, or cellulite, legs with a little stubble etc that is until YOU point it out. The moment you point out what your insecure about and draw attention to it then yes that's all we are looking at, but it's by far not the first thing we see until that point in time.

"I support people cosplaying whatever they want but I wish the line wasn't so blurry between general cosplay and the fanservicey stuff.

"When I was in college we had a required class for first year students that covered topics like consent, it also covered topics like how to find an apartment that's not a scam or how to register a car.  Just sort of a general ""how to college"" course.

"A popular (and controversial) example of this: ""When she went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt."" George R. R.

Just to clarify, a sexy description can absolutely be good writing. If it's relevant to the character and/or situation, then go for it. Hell, maybe it's just the tone of the book, the personality of the narrator, etc. But if an author objectifies a character too much, the character seems... well, like an object, not a person."

"Gottman (the marriage therapist who can accurately predict divorce) describes four styles of conflict resolution:

* Volatile: lots of screaming and plate smashing, but also lots of affection and passionate making up.
* Avoidant: try to solve problems alone, wait for things to cool down or blow over.
* Validating: the ""Kindergarten teacher"" style with lots of compromise and processing emotions together.
* Hostile: the toxic couple that treat each other with contempt.

Any of the first three styles is valid and can make for a happy relationship. Trouble can arise when couples have mismatched styles, though.

My partner and I are both the validating type, but I come from a family of avoiders. My sister and I drive each other crazy when we have a misunderstanding, because we want to handle it in such different ways."

"Didn't happen to me, it was a friend but I'll answer seeing as no one else has.


My friend was pretty sexually adventurous, always known for trying anything and just a generally audacious girl. Then she met this guy, who she would later marry and just fell completely in love with. She left her at the time boyfriend, they started dating, it seemed that she would do just about anything for him. 


So one late evening they went to a house party with some of our other friends. This one girl was there, I guess I'll call her T, who has always had a thing for guys in relationships, she is now not friends with any of us for obvious reasons but this took place fresh out of high school so hey, that explains us being naive and continuing to hang out with her. 


T came up to her, began talking about how hot her boyfriend was, how she would totally be down for a threesome. BF appeared completely into it. To please both T and boyfriend she agreed, it turned into just T and boyfriend having sex. T completely ignored my friend and wasn't really interested in including her at all. She ran out of the room crying. From my memory, the boyfriend at least had the mental clarity to stop and go after her. 


They were able to work through that incident and divorced later for unrelated reasons, partly because he was an asshole. "
Neither. I can't stand people forcing food on me after I've refused so I'd like to join whatever culture OP is part of. 
"My first time was in Thailand. I was trying to get somewhere and hailed a cab. A few minutes in the cab driver is like ""... there's a jam because of the protests. If you get out now just go over to those guys over there and tell them where you want to go."" 

Okay... So he doesn't charge me anything and I wander over to a group of dudes. One of them nods and starts walking over to a motorcycle and ... I just hop on. It was so fun! Weaving in and out of traffic, seeing the protests (this was late 2013) like that and getting to my destination faster. Would recommend, haha. "
"When I was younger I always fantasized what sex would be like. When I finally did, it was insanely underwhelming. I think it could be very different if you have the ""right"" person, but I can get my thrills elsewhere. "
"I found my friends through hobbies! I found it was a good place as you have 1 thing in common, but it's a large group so if you talk to one person and it doesn't click, it's easy to segway talking to the next person. You're gonna end up cycling through a lot of people but I think it's worth I think. 
 
I'm a big foodie and into cooking so I went to Yelp events and met a ton of people that way that have become my people. We often hang out at someones house and have a potluck and play board games and drink whiskey. We've been friends for 7 years now. It started with 3 of us getting along and we would pull people in that we thought work. Some  drifted off but now there's 10 of us that aren't going anywhere. And our potluck crew is about 30 people strong. "
"They think that being 'female' is a character trait and therefore neglect to give her personality, motivations, ideals and agency.  

They think that a 'strong female character' = a character who is tough, smart, sexy, determined and snarky ONLY.  They then get confused when said character is condemned.   A true strong female character is simply a three dimensional character who has both positives and negatives about them.  Writing a ridiculously idealistic female character is just as dismissive as writing one who has no personality whatsoever.  It's like that quote about how there are two ways to dehumanise someone: by dismissing them and by idolising them.  It also creates the aggravating trope where a really 'powered up' female character inexplicably steps aside to let Newcomer Male Hero save the day (and also bang her) despite the fact she's 100x more qualified than he is.  It's ridiculously aggravating when the bar for a three dimensional character is SO LOW but male writers can't even manage that. 

Another thing - when women only exist to help the male protagonist's story along.  This especially aggravates me when a woman is killed, raped and/or tortured to spark the Male Hero's acceptance of the Call to Action.  I'd be here all day if I tried to list the number of movies and tv shows that use it.  Its such goddamn lazy writing and it's a pretty shit feeling as a female viewer to watch a movie that's casually informing you that your life isn't valuable in of itself, but only how you exist in relation to male characters.  This also bleeds into real life where you have people protesting rape with signs of ""she's someone's sister, someone's daughter"".  Fuck off.  She's SOMEONE, that should be MORE than enough.  If one more movie starts with someone's mother being killed in the first ten minutes I am turning it off."

"Illegal immigration. 
My parents are both conservative, but my mom is *really* against illegal immigration, so I was raised believing that illegal immigrants were stealing our jobs and leeching off the government. I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to spend 18 months in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island, New York, where I worked with Spanish speaking immigrants. I met a ton of people from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and less critically dangerous (though still unsafe/impoverished) nations like the Dominican Republic, Columbia, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador etc. After learning what it's like there and how much better their lives are here, I can't justify the fact that our nation only lets in a trickle of the many people in dire need. Economically, we would be better off adopting an Ellis Island-style program, where only disease or criminal record bars entrance. There are plenty of jobs for uneducated/non English speaking workers, despite what Trump seems to believe (he wants to change to a system of merit based immigration with more restrictions on those coming in).

"What hurt worse for me was delivering the placenta...which may I mention no one told me about.

I had two nurses on either side of me pushing on to my already destroyed abdomen. I'm a very reasonable person but as it was happening I looked at my husband and said ""This is it. This is how I die."" "

"Yes, it's foolish to argue that there are no biological differences when the idea of sex (i.e. male, female) is based on biology. Now of course there are nuances; trans and intersex people exist. However, people with uteruses can carry a child, and people without uteruses can't. There must be some biological differences between the two to support such a drastic difference in fertility.

The real question then becomes: what bearing do these biological differences have or should have on the way we treat men and women? My answer? Treat them the same until given a reason to treat them differently. And try to accommodate people's differences instead of blaming them. You'd build a wheelchair ramp for a paraplegic person. Why wouldn't you offer maternity leave for a woman who has just given birth?  "
"I guess it wasn't technically a ""date,"" but the first time my boyfriend and I ever hung out one-on-one (we were friends for years before we dated and hung out in groups but we always had this kinda unspoken thing for each other, yet timing was never right) he came over one night and we walked to this playground I used to go to when I was a kid. It has this almost hammock like structure made of old tires, and we just kinda laid next to each other and just talked for HOURS and the entire time I was just like ""Oh god oh god what is happening"" and my heart was racing so loudly and I was SO SURE all night he was going to hold my hand or make a move and he didn't!!! It's better that he didn't because I was dating someone else (entirely wrong for me) but I remember thinking that was the first time in a long time that I was able to just talk with a guy and actually felt like I was being listened to. We got together a year later, and have been together for 4 years and I STILL feel like I'm actually being listened to! So that all definitely went way better than I expected it to :) "

&gt;As a girl who needs expensive bras with underwire, this is wayyyyy beyond petty. I get that she hurt your brother, and it sure is revenge, but that can cause pain and fit issues from bras that will no longer work correctly and cost her hundreds of dollars and hours to replace them depending on how many bras you did this to. Also the fact that some of them might be discontinued and she may not be able to find the same one or one that fits the same way.

&gt;Bras aren't like a pair of socks where if they are in your size they fit automatically. Getting bras that fit is a complex, frustrating, and time consuming process.  "

"Oh gosh. I did this for the first time last week. A friend of mine bought a Groupon deal for a sugaring Brazilian and couldn't use it before it expired. Honestly, I expected it to hurt A LOT more than it did. It stings pretty good for few seconds, but the pain dissipates pretty quickly. There are some awkwardly intimate poses you have to get into with a perfect stranger right up in all your business, which can be a bit disconcerting if you're shy or modest. Haha. The girl I went to didn't do a super amazing job, actually. She straight missed a patch of hair and there were wild strands abound when I got home and looked in natural light. The biggest issue for me, though, even if I went to someone more efficient is this: you get perfectly smooth skin for like 2 weeks, but you have to let the hair grow out long enough to get waxed again like 2 weeks later. What if I have a hot date or a pool party in between? Then I gotta shave and reschedule my appointment. I just can't stand the interim hair, no thanks. I'll stick to razors!"
"So, I get what you're saying. But implicit bias is a thing. And it's a huge problem in the tech field. I have a friend struggling to find a job right now. She's highly qualified, has awesome letters of recommendation, has gotten her resumes and cover letters looked over by lots of higher-ups in big name companies to give her pointers, but...wouldn't you know it, all her peers seem to be having an easier time than her. Even the less qualified ones. And all her peers just so happen to be male. 

I'm not saying that these companies are blatantly hiring men over women. As I said, implicit bias is a thing. But when you're one woman in a sea of hundreds of men, you tend to get shoved into a corner. It's a real problem. Just getting tech companies not to throw your resume out as soon as they read your name is a challenge. 

Someone shouldn't be hired purely based on gender. And that goes both ways. I think this seems like a non-existent issue to a lot of guys, but it's really not. 

And this problem continues into the workforce. You get less assignments, trust is handed out more slowly, customers will walk right past you to talk to male employees (even if they don't know you or said employees). Less leniency is given when it comes to mistakes. You get pulled aside by your manager and he tells you ""I know it seems like I'm being extra hard on you, but it's because you're the only woman here, and I'm preparing you for the real world"". Um, are we not in the real world right now? Jeez."
"I used to work at a small town cafe, and there were a lot of extra charge add ons to things, but we were also encouraged to let a few slide 'as gifts'. Get people to come back more. So, most of the time, I would never charge you for extra cheese or to substitute almond milk, or for flavor shots in your coffee. I'd also always charge people for a medium coffee instead of a large because honestly there was such little difference in the sizes. 

But if someone was an asshole? You betcha I am going to charge them for that extra cheese, every add-on to their double-shot vanilla-caramel almond milk latte, and I hope you enjoy those two ounces extra coffee for a full dollar. Adds up. Feels good. "

"Went hiking with my ex and he made a huge deal out of how much he hated it. We'd been together for four years but lived together on the coast -- he'd never been as active as me, but we were back in my hometown, it was an easy hike, and being in the mountains is something I love, so I thought he'd be a trooper. 

Nope. He started throwing a fit as soon as we hit the trail. He was hot, he was sweaty, there were bugs. We turned around a mile in. He apologized later, because he knew it meant a lot to me (and, you know, number of shitty, out-of-town concerts I cheerfully endured and even enjoyed because he was having a blast vs number of hikes he went on with me? Never counted, but at least 8:1) but I just...knew I could not spend the rest of my life with a partner that didn't enjoy hiking. I couldn't be with someone who took something that made me really happy and complained and complained and complained about how unhappy it made them.
