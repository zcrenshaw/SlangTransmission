"Everyone on this sub likes to say things like ""use your words, signals are lost on us,"" but there is more to it than just ""guys are oblivious.""  We're not oblivious, we're cautious.  For every story you hear about a guy missing an obvious non-verbal clue from a woman, there are ten more about a guy acting on a seemingly obvious signal and being completely wrong about it.  "
"That using words like mansplaining and manspreading instead of ""being condescending"" or ""being inconsiderate"" is actively harming the progress of egalitarianism.

I don't care how tired you are of gender bias. I am tired too. The way you fight a battle is the way you define your power, and if you're going to used sexist gendered rock throwing, then you're a troglodyte. It doesn't really matter the cause that you're championing. It's your own words and actions that define what you're advancing."
That talking out a problem isn't exclusively for when you want to talk about it. I've known a fair number of men whose girlfriends/wives think it's okay to push them into a conversation but will sit resolute and quiet when the man wants to really talk about a thing.
My silence doesn't mean there's something wrong. 
My divorce attorney still sends me a Christmas card.
"no experience, no referrals"
The odds are good but the goods are odd. 
"That when I tell her she's beautiful, I mean it. 

The number of times I've heard, ""you're just blinded by love"" or ""you're not objective"" makes this very frustrating. Sorry that I'm not a third party test laboratory operating a double blind study! "
Having the room completely dark for sex is about 85% less fun. 
"I'm just as, if not more, insecure as you are and my insecurities aren't any less real just because I'm a guy. "
We cannot read minds. 
Playing *hard to get* is sometimes indistinguishable from *not interested*
That receiving nudes/naughty pics from a woman and looking at porn are not the same experience at all. 
"Sometimes when I'm on top of her, she says ""flex your arms"", and I throw up a solid front double bi. She giggles and grabs my arms, then we keep going at it. I  feel like a king"
"I got a Lass pregnant when we were both 19, I decided I'd better do the ""right"" thing and marry her. We've been married 12 years now and have 2 kids and it all worked out alright in the end, but I wouldn't recommend it."
"No, you can’t beat your bf/husband."
"Personally I found it hilarious but then again not everyone has a sense of humor like me. About 12 years ago I was at a Publix in Florida trying to use the public copy machine, I'm going through my pockets to find some quarters when all of a sudden some old white guy comes up behind me and says ""ya do know that the machine doesn't take pesos right?"" I personally believe that he said this joke with no malice since he had the friendliest old guy smile ever. My brain didn't know how to react at first but i decided to play along and laugh with him. It just felt right "
"Well, correlation isn't causation, but I was a virgin until I started experimenting with Red Hat, got my first girlfriend when I started using Linux regularly, got divorced when I was back onWindows for gaming, and started my current long term relationship after going Ubuntu as my one and only."
"You sound like a real sociopathic douchebag. I think there may be a reason why you have trouble with women: you hate them. 

Downvote me all you want, this guy just deserves to know how backwards he is.

Edit: I leave reddit for 3 days and come back to a shitstorm of messages calling me fat, ugly, misandrist, white knight, and desperate. I actually am a woman, in a long-term relationship with a man-- so much for hating them!-- and to be completely honest, I don't care enough about any of your rude responses to merit giving them an answer. It's pretty incredible that someone can accuse all women of being calculating, cold, manipulative bitches, and that when someone points out his bullshit, they are also accused of being a calculating, cold, manipulative bitch. But then again, reddit has a terrible userbase. You can downvote me to hell, makes no difference that you guys are wrong and backwards. PS: I'm not interested in talking to anyone who's already decided that I'm less than them. God forbid."
"Most romance movies are not good examples of relationships, they're more like relationship porn. You put yourself in place of one of the characters. There are tropes like two men pursuing one woman and she picks her true love, there's the manic pixie dream girl who changes a guys life.

&gt; What about the nerdy nice girls? What happens to them?

In the movies they take of their glasses and shake out their hair from a pony tail, and put on a dress, and it turns out they were hot all along. In real life, they probably date around for a bit and then meet a guy they want to settle down with. Happens all the time. 

&gt; Why is it that no one talks about us? 

There's not much to discuss. That doesn't mean guys don't want to date nerdy nice girls, it's just that there's not a lot to say on the subject, as opposed to hot girls, crazy girls, horse girls etc. "
I'm fat and jobless at 29. But I've been going to the gym every day for the past two weeks and have been job searching for 10 months. I'll find a job eventually.
So they can read us the directions that we don't need. 
"I had just gotten home from Iraq, and was back in my hometown in NC. I went to the bar with some friends, and while there a beautiful blonde girl with blue eyes kept staring at me. She was FAR too beautiful IMO to even approach. I’m not a bad looking guy, I’m not afraid to admit it - but this girl was a perfect 10/10, dream girl, kind of beautiful.

Eventually I went to the bar to grab another drink, and the bar tender showed me his phone, and said, “I think she’s talking about you, bro...” and on his phone was a text that read, “I can’t quit staring at the guy with all the tattoos.” I was the only guy there with both arms sleeved out. 

So I finally got the courage and I went and sat at her table, and asked if I could join her and her friend. She smiled and immediately asked, “Did *insert bar tender’s name* show you my text?!?”

We had a lot of good laughs, and talked until the bar closed, and her friend decided to leave. Her bar tender friend  let us stay inside and kept pouring us free shots for a good hour after closing.

When he finally told us that he wanted to head home, we walked outside the bar, which was in the downtown area of one of NC’s largest cities. It was so late at this point that there were no cars, or people around. Just us, the sky scrapers, and the lights associated with a city scene. It was even slightly raining. The moment could not have been any more movie-esque.

We stood in the middle of the street, and she walked up to me, jumped up and wrapped her legs around my waist and arms around my shoulders, and we just stood in the middle of the road kissing for what felt like a split second and an eternity all at once. 

She took me home, but we didn’t have sex. Just more kissing and some topless cuddling. In the morning, we woke up and had to part ways. For a multitude of reasons we never spoke again. It’s been 8 years now, and I still miss her. "
"I can look at hardcore, raunchy, sweaty, nasty porn with 3 goddesses pleasuring each other and get half a chub....

When my wife sends me a random booty pic or lingerie pic, I jump to full mast almost immediately. "
I need to get my own shit together first
When we lift together she can't reach the pulldown bar so she lifts her hands up and waits for me to bring it down to her. 
"Rookie mistake, gotta keep that poker face stone cold, otherwise those in the know will interrupt your important boobie meditations."
I’m just here to say that these responses are all really cute and I enjoy reading them
"When I was in grad school, I dated a blind girl for a while.

We were at a crowded bar listening to live music.  She was sitting in my lap, head tucked into my chest, and she told me she felt safe with me.  Like she didn't have to worry about anything, it would all be okay as long as she was in my arms.

That's the best compliment I've ever gotten.  "
"Do not get married or have kids until you are at least 30 and your education is finished and your career is on track. 

Go to r/personalfinance and learn how to monitor you credit score and save up an emergency fund. 

Go to the gym/work out and eat healthy. 

Never drive drunk. Ever. 

Never do anything that risks you having an arrest on your permanent record. Ever. 

Pay to have your taxes done by a professional, or learn how to do them yourself. 

Never abdicate responsibility for your situation to anyone, ever. This is especially important when it comes to safe sex."

"That the default experience for a **lot** of men is being utterly invisible to the opposite sex unless something is wanted from them.  So when you think you are just being nice or friendly, they think you are interested in them.  Because you might be the first woman who's treated them like an actual human being in over a year.

I've had to explain this to so many women who don't understand why when they tried to befriend the kind of awkward guy at their company, he immediately developed a crush on them and thought they were interested.

The worst was my friend who thought that was kind of ""cute"" and decided to throw some pity pussy his way.  I really don't think that was helping :/"
"That being straightforward about your intention romantically doesn't work. I had a girl at work asking me why a guy she liked can't just come out and say he likes her.

That's because he's probably done it and been unsuccessful a triple digit number of times. "
"I got married at 22 and my now-wife was 21. We're still good. Got a nice house, a bunch of kids, and we like being with one another."

"Okay that’s the real question. I feel like all the guys I’ve been with have fluorescent bulbs in their room and exclusively want to have sex with all the lights on. I don’t mind keeping lights on, I’m confident. But damn, when the bright-ass lights are on it makes me feel like I’m in a hospital!! "
"""I've told you a hundred times, those jeans making your butt look bigger is a **good** thing"""

The plot of the movie we are watching together.
Veto Rule: You can't veto a restaurant suggestion without a suggestion of your own. No new suggestion? Then the proposed restaurant stands. 
"Stick to your guns. If you don't want to hook up, don't hook up. The whole reason things are the way they are is that a lot of people who don't want to hook up are doing it anyway rather than be alone. It's like junk food but for sex and love. There are people who are happiest that way, which is absolutely fine, but everyone else needs to stop pretending they're ok with it and actually have some integrity.

EDIT: Oh for crying out loud. *I'm not saying people who hook up have no integrity.* I'm saying that if you hook up and pretend to be casual when what you actually want is to date someone, then that is dishonest and places unfair expectations on the person you're hooking up with. If you're hoping for anything more than casual sex without emotional attachment or the potential for it, then don't lie about being ok with casual sex and hooking up. Be honest about your intentions and values, you know, *integrity.*"
"My ex always would say women are as obvious as they come across but play the plausible deniability card if they didn't want to commit to whatever they started. She (bi) encountered it a lot when girls would flirt with her then get all ""ew, no"" when she would try to take things further. But those girls would still fuck her in secret ..."
"Any, as long as it's honest. "
"Love isn't going to just ""find"" me. You are an incredibly attractive woman, different potential loves are actively hunting you down. It's not the same for me. "
"I was 22, she was 19.  We're still together and in love after 35 years."
You said crazy girls twice
"You will forever be remember as a legend here, ButtPlugSteve."
"I was in high school. I had had a crush on the harpist in our orchestra for a while. We were in the same circle of friends and spent a lot of time together, but I was always too shy to make a move.

There was a high school dance that our friend group was going to and she asked me to go with her as friends. I was a little disappointed that she wanted to go as friends, but I agreed and tried to have a good time. We ended up dancing all night and having a great time together, but being the young idiot that I was, I never made a move out of fear of violating the ""just friends"" agreement.

I drove her home after the dance and walked her to her door. I was expecting to just give her a hug and say good night, but she ended up kissing me. It was really short, but I'll never forget the initial confusion followed by the rush of joy. She told me years later that she had been trying to get me to kiss her the entire night but that she was too shy to say something and I was too dumb to catch her hints."
Tells me she’s cumming.
Girl here. Dump her. 
"If you're saying that on Tinder, I can understand why some might have a negative reaction. But in general your wishes should be respected. Guys who aren't into hookups get plenty of crap as well. Hookups put me off because of the lack of emotional connection. "
"In one of those photo albums with the sticky page that has a clear plastic overlay.

Was going through some photo albums from my uncles and I because some of my old pictures from when I was a kid were in there and I was moving them to another album where they weren't mixed in. Flip the page toward the end and bam, used condom in there with the date and the name of a girl. Idiot uncle saved the condom from his first fuck in a family photo album. "
Tell her good luck and dump her bitchy ass. 
"Too many people hear that relationships are work, and think that means they need to stick around in bad relationships.

EDIT: No surprise, the top reply is ""Relationships are work."" I wish more people understood that no, they're not. Sharing finances is work. Raising a child is work. Living with someone is work. But spending time with someone you love? If that ain't as easy as breathing, what do you consider ""love"" to be?"
Women truly cannot fathom how little attention or barebones compliments most men get.  
"That men also have issues. It's like every time you mention something that seems to mainly be centered around men, women will bring up ""well women have it worse.""

It's not a fucking competition. Men deal with shit too. 

Women are really really good at getting attention for issues that are important to them, partly because they drown out men who speak up about issues that affect men. 

Men who bring up how most homeless people are men, most people who commit suicide are men and super majority of people in prison are men, are often told to shut up and that men deserve it. 

You are made to feel like you are making excuses for criminals and homeless drunks.

It gets exhausting spitting out stats when women don't give a shit about them. "
"Believe it or not we understand that sometimes people just want to complain instead of fix everything (I'd definitely say women are generally better at it though, men tend to be more task-oriented than they sometimes need to be). But when you complain ALL THE TIME about the SAME THINGS, we want to fix it because it wears on us to hear the same stuff day in and day out. I'm not gonna ""just listen"" to you complain about a simple headache if you say you have one at every opportunity, moan and groan while I talk, or get upset when I go do something else if you haven't even had a glass of water or taken anything for it. That Parks and Rec episode with Anne whining was bullshit, even if the overall message was sound. She didn't communicate with her obviously understanding partner and dumped all her shit onto her friends to the point where THEY solved her problem for her, and she was happy. So while she was bitching about not wanting her problem solved, she still wanted her problem solved.

Also, women are just as fucking dirty as men. I'm so sick of hearing about how men don't clean while I trip over my girlfriend's random stuff on the ground, throw out her expired food, and empty the dishwasher instead of filling up the sink. How many times have we been told to ""hang on a sec"" while women take 5 minutes to clear out all the shit from their passenger seat?

"
"If being in a long-term relationship were the end of fun, why would we get into these relationships to begin with? 

So I tend to agree with you. If your friends' relationships are the end of their fun, they are probably with the wrong partners for them."
That removing dissenting opinions from your sub doesn't make those opinions stop existing.
"She curls into me, and she fits under my arms perfectly, and loves being dominated in bed (that was new for me, and hotter than anything!)"
I don't want to discuss in depth issues and friend drama at 11:34pm. I want to sleep. 
I really enjoy sleeping until it's time to drink again.
"""You pick the place"" is super annoying when it comes down to deciding where to eat.  We can't keep track of all your *unapproved* restaurants, and don't wanna spend 30 minutes listing every single place while you give a reason *not* to go there"
"Don't depend on anyone else to make you happy.

Don't worry about what others think of you.

20 minutes with a condom is better than 20 years of child support and baby mama drama."

"She called me ""the man [she loves]"". Not ""the guy"" or ""the boy"", but ""the man"". It might sound weird in english, but in my language, it's pretty satisfying."
This makes me more sad than all the divorced comments. 
"But we have to be confident, and be uber-tough guys!"

"Girlfriend hates driving, I love driving. It just happens to work out"
I want a relationship but don’t want to put in the work or time commitment. Equally needy and distant.

"The time I met up with a girl to have casual sex with and she slipped what I thought was a note into my hand as I left afterward. Went to read it at home and realized it was a 100 dollar bill.

"Traveling through Germany, sat next to an Englishman on a long distance bus. He did some pretty over the top impressions of Indians, asked me if I did tech support or if my family owns a corner store etc. It was really uncomfortable for just about everyone involved.

Towards the end he said I was a really good chap for putting up with him, so Im not really sure what to make of it. Is this a common thing in England?"
"The best compliment I've gotten is: ""You're really good at knowing how much butter to put on someones bread"""
"I think it's one of those things, like your house getting hit by a tornado. You never feared it before because you didn't really think it could happen to you even though you know it's possible. After it happens even though you feel safe in your new house from day to day, storm clouds always bring dread of what may happen. "
"With you 100%. At first I was shocked at how many upvotes that post got, but then I remembered how many ""woman-hating"" posts I see around here and it made more sense. Most of these people are too self-centered to even consider that *they* could be part of the problem. It's always ""all women's fault"" that *they* have dating issues. Like the idiot above: ""The last *2 women* I dated didn't like me as much as I liked them, so obviously all women are incapable of love."" ....Or, you know, those 2 people just didn't like you..."
"A girl I used to date when she felt bad, would hold our her arms and just say ""bear hug"" and I'd wrap my arms around her and lift her, putting my face in her hair and I could feel her lips on the side of my head smiling.

Sometimes I'd get a Bear hug requests and carry her from the bed to the couch when she was all frumpy and sad on the weekends.

Ohh another one is if you're sitting and your lady puts her hand on your shoulders or brushes from one to the other when she passes by. Tiny hands on your shoulders make ya feel big and manly."
"In Canada, was going to watch a movie with a russian friend of mine. We saw a couple of classmates coming out, they were dating, he was black, she was white. He turned to me and said “black guy, white girl, that is not right “ it actually took me a few seconds to understand. The way he said was so natural. Anyway, turns out a lot of the russians that came to Canada were a bit racist and very homophobic. They all changed about 2 months in though. Canada has this effect in people I guess. I was a bit homophobic when I came there too, but after a few months I reevaluate. Great place."

"Too right, and damage a creepy man can inflict is so much greater than the damage a creepy woman can inflict. Excuse me if I err on the side of caution because I don't want to be mistaken for a rapists and get a reputation for it."
I love my wife for 23 hours a day.   That hour in the morning however...  It's like being married to an angry bear. 
"It’s nothing too mysterious, or novel-worthy. 

I also just realized that I wrote we never spoke again. I was multi-tasking and writing this while getting my daughter ready for daycare, and wasn’t fully focused. We never saw each other again, but we did speak.

I texted her the next day, which was probably a mistake. She didn’t respond. On my last day in town, I sent another text saying that I apologized if texting so soon was weird, and that I would always remember her fondly for making one of my first nights home from war so memorable, and to take care. 

I left to go back to my duty station which was a 26 hour drive away, and remained there for about 3 months before they re-stationed me in Kentucky, near Louisville. I’d honestly moved on from that night, when out of nowhere she called. We spoke for a good hour, never once bringing up why she never replied to my text. I just enjoyed that she called. 

She would text or call me a few times a week. I always left it up to her, afraid that I’d seem too pushy and lose her again. 

After I had been living in KY for about 3 months, she called me and confessed she had met a guy. And she was only interested in him because he reminded her so much of me, but he was actually there. Pretty soon after she became pregnant with twins. Not long after she had the twins, she deleted her Facebook, and never contacted me again. I deployed to Afghanistan and lost the phone that had her number in it. I imagine she married and her last name is different. So I was never able to “find” her again. 

Life turned out fine, though. I’m married, and have a beautiful 3yo daughter. I don’t regret how my life turned out at all. But there will always be that sliver that wonders, “what if....”"
"This is so true! I recently went on a day hike with a friend of mine, and one of her friends - someone I'd met before a number of times, who I always got along with, and I also thought she was super cute. The whole day, this girl was (imo) giving off vibes: laughing at all my jokes (even the shitty ones), casual touching on the arm, joking around about how ""we look like a couple"" in a photo, saying at the end of the day that she had been looking forward to seeing me, etc. Hell, at one point she asked me ""I'm really hot, do you mind if I take my shirt off for a bit?"" and she just sat around in her bra for a while, until we heard some other hikers coming up the path and then she covered back up. After that, I was *extremely* confident that she was keen. I asked her out a couple days later and got the ""I think you're a cool guy but I don't really see you that way"" line.

I can now say, with confidence, that I have *no fucking idea* how to tell whether a woman is 'signalling'."

"In my case, it was a series of warning signs that I didn't really see as a pattern until later. But for entertainment's sake, I'll share one:

We jointly decided to go see *Kill Bill* in the theater. Now, there's a part of *Kill Bill* where Pai Mei (a lethal, centuries-old, generously-eyebrowed master of spurious Kung Fu) tells the protagonist that all American women are good for is 'ordering food in restaurants and spending a man's money'. We are not, even in the context of the story, meant to agree with him.

And, apparently, this meant it was Argument Time At The Movies. Not with Quentin Tarantino. Not even with the fictional character Pai Mei. With me. At full volume. As the movie was still showing. 

(""Do you *really* think that?"". Not looking at the screen or saying it rhetorically at the air, but looking right at me and demanding an answer.) "
"The invite to my apartment has always had the flimsiest excuses. It was its own form of communication: if she was willing to get drunk, make out, and come back to my apartment to see the plants in my backyard or something similarly frivolous, she probably wasn't there for the plants."

"Was walking home from the bar with a friend when we come across a girl crying. We ask her if everything is ok and it turns out some dickhead cop was writing her a $200 ticket for jaywalking. We wish her the best of luck and go on our way. I mention something about how I thought she was cute and my friend talks me into posting a missed connection.

So I do, and the girl actually sees it! We meet up for a drink or three and end up going back to my place and having a pretty great one night stand. She leaves that night and I never see her again. 

About a year later I get a linkedin request from her. I still check in on how her career is progressing from time to time.

"Relationships *are* work, and there *are* some times when you've gotta be willing to give on what gives you the most immediate enjoyment, but your partner should be willing to put in the same work and give just the same when you need it.  

Just like with anything else:  balance.  If you or your partner is expecting too much or too little, you're going to have a recipe for unhappiness.  This is why honest communication is so important.  If you're feeling stressed or overburdened, you're supposed to talk about that to see if there's a way for the couple to make it right.      

Edit:  lol at the other guy saying relationships aren't work.  Living together is work?  Guess who does that: people in relationships.  Taking care of someone when they're sick is work, managing each other's family expectations is work, setting reasonable goals together requires work.  A successful relationship is way more than whether you love each other or not.  "

"One time my family was at a restaurant in Rome. My family doesn't drink alcohol or pop and after a long day of running around and seeing as much as we could, we were thirsty. An adamant waiter was trying to convince us to eat at his restaurant and promised us two plates of bruschetta for free if we ate there. So we sat and perused the menu. When he came around for our drink order, we all ordered water. The smile slid from his face like a dropped plate of spaghetti and he took away the bruschetta before we got to eat it. Incredulous, I told him we weren't going to eat there after the bait and switch. The dude went off! Started yelling at the street that South Asians are all cheap and the worst customers. Was honestly incredibly funny in retrospect because he literally cried out ""mamma mia!"" when I called him a racist."

"When we would both be laying down cuddling, she would have her leg draped over me, her head on my chest, and if I made a sudden movement like get up to use the restroom or get some water she'd pull me back in as if saying not to leave.

"it is because it shows that you are a self actualized human that can be self sufficient.  so that means men should also know how to cook.  and both men and women should know how to clean, mend things and first aid"

- Don't know what to talk about for conversations. If it's a passionate topic, like sports or music, I start to spiral and rant. I once went from favorite teams to how my cousin got killed in a gun raid... for a class introduction.


- I am a boring person. I can't remember the technique name for this type of singing but it's when you can abruptly end a word mid-word. I do that at the end of sentences and create instant silence.

- Can't cook eggs right; the edges always get crusty.


- I habs smol bladder and pee a lot.

I tried to communicate but she wouldn't. I called her out on this and she said that sometimes women just don't want to talk about things right away. She seemed taken aback when I said that I sometimes felt like that too.

Testosterone produces higher muscle density  I think
 silence is my default.  I don't need to verbalize the stream of consciousness in my head
"1.  Listen to how a woman describes herself and don't shrug your shoulders at it.  If she describes herself as a bitch or an asshole, she probably is.  Don't be lured in by someone that's really attractive, it leads to so much pain and heartache in the long-run!

2.  Observe their daily habits and compare it to their future goals.  Often, younger women--especially those in lower division undergrad--have these grand visions of their future without realizing the amount of work that goes to getting there.  You can try and work with them to reach their goals, but ultimately it is up to them to strive for their goals.  Don't sacrifice your own time and part of yourself on what's a big ""if"" on their future.  Also, these kinds of people often don't invest as much into you as you will into them, and over the course of time, it will take its toll on you.

3.  Pay attention to their expectations in a relationship, especially pertaining to finances.  Do they expect the man to pay for the first date? The second and third as well?  All of them?  Do they offer to split the bill(s) early on?  When it comes to their worldview (e.g. politics, religion, sex, etc), is it in-sync with yours?

4.  Something I learned the hard way, big time, and happens a lot by younger women.  If she says when she hates when something is done to her and makes a point that she avoids doing that, yet does it to you, it means she has zero respect for you.  Get the hell out, it's her way of putting you in your place and walking over you.  

5.  Watch out for being stringed along.  If you suspect it, ask your friends.  If they think so to, she probably is.  

6.  Every text message is likely getting shared in a group chat.  Be careful with what you tell them, because whatever you tell them is also be shared with 1-10+ of their friends."
"I asked her out.  We went on a date, but at the end of it she said she was afraid of ruining our friendship and wanted to keep it just platonic.  We did, despite me still secretly crushing on her.

"If somebody is in a very emotional state and they take it out on someone who had nothing to do with it, they are a dick.

"For girls, it seems to be three camps:

1. They just love casual sex.

2. They use casual sex as an intimacy surrogate or self-destructive  coping act.

3. They've been told that empowered women have to have lots of hot kinky sexy with both genders, and feel socially obliged to comply.

Probably the same with guys but I don't date then so maybe not.

There's a social expectation to sleep around which makes people think everyone is by-default promiscuous, which discourages people from seeking relationships."

"What made it the best was it was kissing the girl I had pined over for years.  What made it great was how it happened and the tension in the air between us.  We were in my car talking after having a few drinks in the bar.  I grab a stick of gum and ask if she wanted half.  She said yes.  I put the gum in my mouth with half of it sticking out and told her to get it.  She went for the gum and next thing I know, we're full on making out for a long while.  Probably one of the sexiest things I've ever experienced."

"From Chris Rock:

In a relationship you should be doing two things- fucking and going places/doing stuff together. When you stop either of these things it becomes boring and stale.

Also a relationship is like being in a band. Sometimes you get to be the lead singer but sometimes your partner is lead and you gotta play tambourine. And no one likes a half ass tambourine player so play it with enthusiasm. "
"True story, word to your mother.

In middle school, I wrote a love letter to a girl whom I knew and was quite infatuated with, and had a very real chance of dating. She chose not to return my affections, continued to keep me at a friend's distance and sorta flirting with me (including letters), and instead dated a friend of mine *and* kissed him in front of me. 

We had a back and forth like this for years. I was baffled by her behavior and had genuine feelings for her, and everybody knew I treasured her even though she was generally regarded as annoying and a black sheep at school. Eventually, I simply stopped trying, and gave up! I decided she just wasn't interested, finally, much to my disappointment. That's when, one day out of the blue, sometime later, she asked me (in public) if I still liked her. I told her the truth, and that was sincerely, ""No"". 

Not long after that, she wrote me a letter explaining that she'd been playing hard to get the entire time, including dating my friend to get my goat and make me jealous! Her exact words were IIRC, ""I've been trying something that only works in books: playing hard to get"". She apologized, and revealed that she was moving. She moved and I never got to see her again, unfortunately.

We were crazy about each other, and could have been happily together. Blew my mind."

"I met a girl who warned me in one of the first few dates ""Portuguese women are crazy."" I laughed it off and proceeded to chase. 

After 2 months of honeymoon period, her personality took a sharp 180 and she tried to cause an argument over literally anything and everything. I'm a pretty passive guy. I'll put up with something I don't particularly like if it means my SO is happy. 

The arguments were so fucking trivial. She wanted a pizza. Ok let's order a pizza. She wanted some combination I'm not too keen on. So I suggest w order two separate smaller ones. They arrive and we swap a piece because she wanted to. Then she says she prefers mine and then complains when I refuse to swap more. 

She'd get loud and aggressive about me being too stubborn. Other times, she'd get loud and aggressive about me being too passive. It felt as though she was always looking for a reason to shout over. 

Literally couldn't win. I put up with that relationship much longer than I should have, given that I was unexperienced. 


P.S. Portuguese people; I'm literally just quoting her. I hold no stereotypes one way or the other due to one bad experience. "

"That listening to complaints from someone who is literally just complaining and not looking for help solving the problem is tidious and exhausting.

A common complaint I hear from women is that guys always try to solve their problem rather than just listen. I get that what they want is their determination to make, and that they are allowed to simply want to vent. That's a normal human thing. However:

* compassion fatigue is real

* I know you are just as capable as me when it comes to solving them and don't need my help. Me offering suggestions is not me telling you that you need my help. I'm just trying to be helpful

* I am trying to solve your problem because I want you to not have to deal with it again because I want you to be happy

* it's unclear when you're venting and when you're looking for help unless you specify. And I look like a dick if I ask

* it's kind of annoying to hear a solvable (to me) problem but not see any solution ever attempted

* it's tiring to be a sounding board when you're not the type of person to need one

* I am not always in the mood to hear about your problems even if you don't want me to help you deal with one

How many people would see me in the elevator, then refuse to get in?  I didn't even bother to count.

Very similar to the above."
"I don't know if it is reasonable or unreasonable, whether it is truth or not, but here goes:

I do not believe that women are capable of love. Well, of love in the same way the men are capable of.

Men love women for who they are. Sure, it takes some time to actually FALL in love rather than think that this lady is simply good-looking, or fun to be with, or anything else, but we do fall for the woman we see and hear right here, right now, in the present.

Meanwhile, women operate with cold calculations in mind. Sure, they may find a guy cute, or sexy, or like how he knows how to play saxophone, but there is always a thoughts of ""What will he do for me?"", ""What will he become?"", ""Is he worth the investment?"" and other similar thoughts.

My experience is obviously anecdotal and obviously may not represent the situation as a whole, but in my two previous relationship I was the one who liked the other person just for who she was. Meanwhile, they were always in love with who I can become for them. Usually it came down to questions about my career, calling me ""a good husband material"" (which recently I started translating as a ""doormat""), telling me that I would be a good father (I wonder if it meant that I can be forced to be a house-husband because I am weak, while they pursue their careers and romantic interests?) and various other things like that.

I want to succeed in life, I want to marry sometime in the future and have my own family. I am more than willing to both work and take an active part in building and supporting my family. But you know what? I also want to be loved for who I **am**.

There is a line that a certain category of women use. It sounds like ""Men invented love so that they won't need to pay"". I think this sentence is only half-truth, because I do believe that men invented love, but not because of aforementioned reasons, but rather because they (we) are actually capable of selfless affection. Women, however, are cold, calculating and pragmatic to an insane degree when it comes to relationship.

These are my thoughts and beliefs on subject of how men and women differ in their approach to love and relationship. I am labeling it under unreasonable because I want to, I **hope** to actually find a woman who will love me for being me one day, thus proving me wrong

While the topic of this thread is supposed to be controversial, in hindsight it was too much. While I am right now in a mental state that leads to such thoughts (which is not my usual one), I do believe that I may have overdid it.

As other have said, you will run in to the occasional homeless, and I have had a couple run-ins with scrappers, and even once with a urban decay tour group that seemed to sneak right up on my crew.

I would say the most creepy experience was just walking through the basement of one abandoned hospital, mostly because is was pitch black and dead quiet, with the stale air smell. Literally the darkest and quietest place I have ever been, and most of the rooms still seemed setup, though rummaged through.

Come to think of it, this one abandoned community college (I think) had a very large atrium in the center which was actually really cool. But upon entering it, there were mannequin/cosmetology heads set up all over on every ledge and balcony just staring into the center entrance that we happened to use. We eventually found an entire wing dedicated to cosmo, so it made sense where they all came from much later."

Get your finances in order, take care of your health and learn to be a self sufficient. From there, make friends.

"Macho answer: when she fucks me.

Cute answer: loves it when I wrap my arms around her for a hug and she says she feels safe. 

Also, weird fact: she's actually much better than me at tinkering around in the house.Thing is I grew up in an appartment and tinkering around was never really needed, so I never really learned to do it. I can handle a hammer and a screwdriver but anything more advanced than that... ehh less so. I'm great at demolishing stuff with a sledgehammer though and at handling the axe to chop wood (thanks, Boy Scouts!). She on the other hand, grew up in a house, outside town with a really handyman kind of dad as opposed to my dad who is a nerd.

So anyway, we were installing new door locks in the house and she had to show me how it's done and I just listened and followed her instructions. She says she finds it a huge turn on that I accept that a woman gives me instructions for a typically manly thing. I asked her why? She says ""because most men would feel their masculinity damaged in such a situation. You however are manly enough to not need to prove it to me through shit like this"".

A few other things she said during our breakup:

""I never found a guy who loves me as much as I love him.""

""I don't want to be with someone who I have to teach how to be in a relationship"".

Told her she was the first person I really loved and it's why it was my first long term relationship. She said ""I could tell it was your first.""

So, yeah. This breakup sent me into a depression which I'm still trying to recover from. I was nothing but kind and respectful during the breakup too (aside from the crying and begging the night she broke up with me).  It makes me wonder why people are unnecessarily cruel in breakups.

"Probably the breakup of my first girlfriend. I am a honest person. I could never hurt someone, but now after years I realize what an idiot I was.

My exams for high school were coming up. I was 16 at that time and was with Eve for almost 2 years. She was my first with everything. I had to study hard (never studied before) so I told her I would be a lil bit on low contact. She understood. Great! Study it is!

I study for 2 days and do my exams. Exams are finished and I started playing videogames with my friends for the weekend. Never texted her. I go home on sunday evening and my mom asked ""How is Eve?"". I told her I don't know and went to bed. I hang out with friends, took a job as a dishwasher and paperboy for the summer, play more games and suddenly its friday. I have hundreds of texts and missed phone calls from Eve. I realize I don't care and continue on with my life. Play more games.

Two weeks later my mom comes in and wants to have a chat. She said Eve called her in tears that I never replied to her. My mom broke up with Eve for me during that phonecall. The only thing I said was ""yeah, I dont love her anymore"" and I continued gaming.

Now I'm 24. I feel so sorry for what damage I might have caused her. Two years after Eve I went into therapy for my gaming addiction. It ruined my bachelor after high school, so I guess that was my karma..

We do talk sometimes now and then. I moved to Amsterdam two years ago and I saw her there. We had a chat and I apologized deeply. She's okay with it, we were both young she said.


But still..

Edit: i did not ignored her the entire summer it was ""only"" for a week. I took the 2 jobs in that week for work during the summer. My bad for bad grammar!"

"First let me be clear. I don't know you. I haven't seen your profile or interacted with you. But I'll give you my perspective on how I've encountered most of the profiles that express ""no hookups."" For me personally, I tend to gravitate away from women who have negativity in their profile. Let's take a hypothetical case. And to make the point, let's make it a little more extreme. When I read something like ""i don't play games. I'm not into hookups. I'm here for something real. So if you're into casual sex, don't bother"", it comes across a little unpleasant. There's nothing in that sequence of words that makes me want to message someone. Instead, it's explicitly telling me not to message them. And I just am not interested in negativity.

My recommendation is to frame it into a positive conversation piece. Instead of ""I'm not into hookups"" frame it as ""I'm looking for a best friend and partner in crime.... You game? :)"" That invites conversation while still expressing your desire. 

And for the record, I'm not into hookups either. Every girl I've ever had sex with, I'd known her at least 2ish months beforehand and the relationships lasted months to years. So for me, it's not the ""no hookups"" that would throw me off, it's the attitude in which it's expressed. "

* Do not think about if she'll like you. She's already thinking that for you. Doing so means there's two parties thinking about her and none thinking about you, thus putting her on a pedestal. Instead, think about if you'll like her. 

* When it comes to what you value, do NOT compromise. Determine where you're an automatic ""no,"" and stick with it. She's a cute blonde who's Christian and you're an atheist that refuses to date a religious person? End it right there. She voted for the other guy who you think is Satan incarnate and despise all that voted for him/her? Do. Not. Compromise. She's 50 pounds heavier than her pictures? Nope the fuck outta there. What you care about and value matters. Never forget that. Side note: this is why I highly prefer coffee or getting a drink for a first date. It's easy to leave on-the-spot if a red flag pops up.

**Moment**

Several years ago, I was stood up for a first date. This really cute blonde that I was psyched to go on a date with, especially since I was in such a dry spell, so desperation was kicking in. She never showed up. I sat there for 15 minutes waiting for a ""I'm gonna be late"" text. Never heard from her. The waiter came out and asked if I wanted to order anything. ""No, I'm done waiting on her. I'm going home."" He says, ""I respect that, man. Good luck to you."" Hearing those words, two things dawned on me: 1. Respect yourself. You don't deserve to sit there waiting on somebody like a desperate little dog. 2. Women can be selfish assholes. They are nowhere near perfect. They're human. They will let you down. 

Your values matter. Your time matters. Your likes and dislikes matter. YOU matter. Never forget that."

"Getting married. Why pay money to say you love each other? 

People have told me it's about making a commitment to someone you love. You can make that same commitment without getting the government involved. Other people have told me its because you get tax benefits. Great, now you want to get married for money. 

Then you have to pay more money to break up *and* you're entitled to half my shit? Fuck that. I'll buy you a pretty ring. Hell, I'll even buy you a pretty dress that you'll only wear one time. I don't need a piece of paper to say I love you. "
"I live in the Netherlands for a while and sometimes a bunch of kids (probably in junior high school) shout ""Ni hao!"" to me when I pass them. But I am not even Chinese, I am from Indonesia. 

Another time I was walking with my friends and we saw a couple of kids on the end of the road staring at us, like waiting for us to walk near them so they can approach us. At first we thought, ""aww look at those kids"", but when we walked pass them they immediately squint their eyes with their fingers and said ""Konichiwa"". Again, I am from Indonesia and not Japanese 😂

Sometimes these kind of encounters become funny stories, but what bothers me is why does the kid do this kind of thing? Some people told me ""it's just kids being a kid"", but I think that's not a good excuse to let children do this to other people. Just a thought. "

You don't need to give counter arguments to a absolute batshit insane belief of 'every single woman in this world is incapable of love.'

"She cheated and lied to me multiple times. Took my money and my car and that was all I was good for. Made me feel worthless like I was less of a man and wouldn’t ever be good enough for her.

"Lincoln High School in Downtown Sacramento. I lived out in the suburbs, but volunteered at the downtown YMCA. One time I had to go downtown on some errand, past Lincoln High in the summer time. That school had been closed a couple of years. Before that it was a continuation school were dropouts and pregnant girls went to school. My mom had taught there in the 70s (she has some tales). So I'm walking past the school, and had never been inside. The old style schools were built on a high foundation, probably had a basement. The windows were about 7 feet off the ground. I could step on some little ledge and get a jump. Just high enough to grab a peek, but I couldn't stand for a look. So I make my maneuver, and see kind of what I expected to see, beautiful old-school hardwood floors. A bunch of really old desks stacked against one wall. In the 70s, we still had wooden desks a hole for the ink bottle. These looked like those kind of desks. But ... but one desk was by itself. There was a little boy sitting at the desk, looking straight at me. He had a bored look on his face, elbow on the desk, resting his chin on his hand. Crap, I about had a heart attack. I made my jump again, and saw it better.



It was a poster of a child sitting at a desk."

It’s frigging exhausting."
"Mine was the first time I kissed another guy. 

Growing up in a conservative area I was always taught that gay people choose to be that way, and they all die of AIDS and burn in hell. This was really distressing when puberty came around and deep down I knew I was attracted to guys, but thought I was straight since I was brainwashed by hateful religion. 

I had a few girlfriends and hated doing anything with them (holding hands, kissing, etc) and never understood why anyone liked it. It felt gross and unnatural to me. 

It wasn't until I moved away from that area, became un-brainwashed, and accepted that I was gay that I went on my first date with a guy. The first time we kissed my entire world exploded. I finally understood *why* people enjoyed kissing and intimacy. It felt natural and pleasurable and I couldn't get enough of it. 

I also felt really angry afterwards of being robbed of those kinds of experiences in my youth but there wasn't much I could do at that point except live in the moment. 

It's been many years since my first real kiss and I still think back to it in fondness. "

"Depends on region, club and dancer. In some regions touching is illegal. In some clubs touching is off limits by policy.

"This is a fascinating point of view. As a woman with many past relationships to reflect upon, for me it wasn’t about loving a man for who he was. It was about loving the man he became through the course of our relationship. That man was increasingly needy, dependent, and helpless. I’ve never been in a relationship where the man made significantly more money, it was usually close to equal or I made more. That never changed his expectation that I would cook, clean, do laundry, etc. I should not have to ask my partner to pull his weight around the house nor should I have to bend over backwards with gratitude when he assumes responsibility for basic human activities. No one is thanking me. So if you feel like women have become indifferent to the love aspect of a relationship it might be because she wants more than that. "

"This happened to me about 8-9 years ago. I'll start with saying that I know I was in the wrong too, but it happened and I can't change that.

I was talking to a girl at a clubby bar for a few minutes and didn't feel like it was going anywhere, so I excused myself and went back to my friends. I started talking to a second girl a bit later and the first one came up and interrupted us. She started yelling about how she couldn't believe that I was talking to someone else when I was supposed to be talking to her. After trying to be nice about getting rid of her, I told her to get lost. She had a fit and slapped me. I told her that if she hit me again, I'd fight back. She hit me so I bopped her in the eye. A couple bouncers jumped between us before she could fight back. The one who was on me told me that he saw what happened and suggested I leave.

One of my friends stayed behind because he was talking to a girl, and he told me that the girl came back with cops but they talked to the bouncer and left after giving the girl a warning about hitting people bigger than her."

"Generalization is the death knell of activism. That’s why shit like Occupy Wallstreet is DOA. It might *sound* noble to say “why can’t we just focus on egalitarianism” or whatever, but the reality is that you need a narrow focus and a specific mission to achieve anything tangible. A goal as nebulous as “equality for all” will go absolutely nowhere. And in that sense there’s nothing wrong with approaching the fight for equality with a specific focus on women’s issues, or men’s issues, or Black issues, or Gay issues.




Things like “All Rights Matter” and “Egalitarianism” (in this context) are almost always used in a very dismissive manner. Imagine if the pleas of Civil Rights Leaders like MLK were simply shut down with equally loud calls of “why are you so focused on Black people!!!”."

Expectations in the dating world are so lofty that they have become impossible to meet. I've begun to realize that love isn't something everyone gets to experience. Some of us, simply, won't find it, or will only find pitiful attempts at what love could have been. Some of us are destined to wade through the endless rivers of watery shit, never finding any relief from the putrid stench of this hedonistic window shopping fuckery. "

Besides, being cold and calculating is not always a bad thing, just not something I want in relationship.

"True love is being willing to stick with someone not just when life throws a big pile of manure at you, but being willing to stick with someone when life throws several big piles of manure at you. And it's being willing to stick with someone when they're the one who caused the big pile of manure to be thrown at you.

It's also weathering those big piles of manure and finding that you and your partner's relationship is somehow stronger for it.

True love is those times when your partner is sick and you have to clean up their vomit and/or their feces, day after day, sometimes for years. Sometimes for the rest of their lives.

It's also seeing your partner get better, or at least come to terms with their sickness, and you both find things to celebrate together.

True love is those times when all you want to do when you get home from a grueling day at work is deal with someone's shit, but you go ahead and fix a nice meal and do the dishes and take care of the kids because you know your partner is dealing with something even more emotionally draining and they need time to process it.

And it's when you know that when you go through that same thing, they'd do the same thing for you without complaining because they love you so much.

True love is that time when you just had a disagreement and possibly some words were thrown around in anger that hurt you so deep and you're still hurting, but you see that thingamabob at the store and you know that they'll love it so you buy it for them and give it to them as a surprise gift along with a kiss.

It's seeing your partner's face when you give them that gift, and you can tell that maybe they're too proud to say it, but they're so grateful and they really, really like it.

True love is when your partner says or does something that drives you up the wall and you are just *so angry* right now and you *know* you are right and you know just what to say to prove it and you *really* want to say it but you know that it would be so hurtful to them so you bite it back.

It's that time later, after the argument is ended and you two are being affectionate, that you are *so* glad you didn't say that thing that you really wanted to say, because you know if you had, you wouldn't be experiencing the closeness that you are experiencing right now.

True love is when you see your partner doing something that is not in their best interest and you *know* how hard it is for them to get rid of that bad habit, so you not only hold them accountable, but do so in the gentlest way and do everything you can to help them break it.

It's seeing your partner *finally* kick that bad habit and celebrating with them and being just so damn proud of them.

True love is when you have a kid just like Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes that is so trying and so frustrating to deal with at times, and you see that they have inherited some of their negative traits from your partner, but you read those parenting books and you don't blame your partner for helping make a kid that's *just* like them sometimes.

It's seeing your kid learn to deal with that negative trait that you know came from your partner, and somehow deal with it better than you or your partner have, and you can also see all the the good things that they got from your partner.


You don't see that in movies. But it's true love.
