Customer sees a clearly panicked worker running out of the store. *cracks knuckles*  
"Darn millennials, too busy eating Tide Pids to know what wax paper is "
"You jewelry store people are great. I went to pick out my wifeâ€™s engagement ring with very basic knowledge from the internet. The lady sat with me for about 45 minutes explaining all the cuts, clarity, and all that, showing me examples of each ring. I left without retaining any knowledge because there was so much, but I also left with an amazing ring. 

Also, no pressure salespeople make me spend more money because I respect their willingness to help over their pushing of an expensive sale. "
"Being too cheap to pay up 75 cents for lettuce isn't your average everyday cheapskatery, this is *advanced* cheapskatery.

I work at a hardware store and people complain about our prices all the time."
Military Parents and Spouses can be so freaking insane. 
"Why do people try to get away with the whole 'I've only had it a week, month, etc' crap? We're neither blind or stupid. It's obvious when something has been used or is old. ðŸ™„"
Spouses are the worse. They think their SO's rank applies to them. God forbid you're uniform and do anything to slightly offend them or they'll pull rank on you.
Wax-ED paper. Gosh.
"Iâ€™ve actually heard of people letting strangers buy their ID off them (I assume it is mostly people that are underage), and it must be one of the dumbest things you can do. Giving someone else your easiest form of identification seems like:

1) a pain in the ass 

2) a criminal offense (aiding in false identification?) 

I donâ€™t think that people asking to buy your ID have the initial intention of stealing your identify (beyond getting into bars and buying booze), but down the line they could change their mind, or your ID could be found/taken by someone else. Just stupid. "
"I'm sorry you had such a bad experience but you should take some solace in the fact that you did your job well, helped these people out the best you could, and treated them with respect and compassion.  You're a good person.

Bad things are common. Good people are rare."
"Just because you haven't seen me before doesn't mean I'm new.

Ugh, God. I hate when someone says ""you must be new here"" as if I'm incompetent and they know how to do my job better. I don't mind if they ask ""oh are you new"" but when they get that condescending ""you're new and this is how *YOU ARE GOING TO* do this because they aaaaaalwaaaaays do it this way"" just pisses me off."
"I had a woman when I was working at Dunkin pull up in booty shorts and a track jacket in a convertible camaro, no handicap sticker, and park in the handicap spot.  She came inside, ordered a caramel iced latte with splenda, and I told her, you'll have to move your car first, or put your handicap placard up. (we had a LOT of handicapped regulars in wheelchairs and with canes or walkers.  We had 2 handicap spots.) she repeats her order and says it'll just be a second.  I tell her she needs to be in a nonhandicapped spot if she doesn't have a handicap plate or placard, that spot is for less mobile customers.  She starts yelling at me to get her latte, or she'll call her husband, and he's a deputy.  I told her to go ahead, and I'll have him write the ticket.  Your husband being in law enforcement doesn't mean you get to break a law, no matter how minor, and that just makes him look bad as a police officer.   She stormed out and said she'd never come back here, and immediately went through drive through instead.  "
Customer sees a clearly panicked worker heading toward the restrooms. *cracks a smile*
"The best salespeople to deal with are the ones who view their job as being to educate, not to sell. I pretty much flat-out refuse to deal with salespeople who push or are obnoxious."
A legend in her own mind
"My mother works at a grocery store, and I work night shift right next door. Her opening shift starts right as I'm getting off, so sometimes I go see her and visit while she's starting her shift.

It was winter. I was wearing a big winter coat, boots and a bright orange hat. I'm leaning against one of the fridge displays drinking a coffee. 

This guy comes up to me and asks where the frozen chicken wings are. I told him they're probably with the other frozen food. 

He did not look impressed. Starts talking about how he wants to see my manager. Called me a jackass. 

""I don't work here numbnuts."" He instantly stopped talking, eyes wide, and just walked away. Was hilarious. "
"Iâ€™m a military Mum. 

Oh, so youâ€™re a Mum whoâ€™s also in the Military?

No, Iâ€™m...

Oh, so youâ€™re just a regular Mum then?

No, my husband is in the military. 

So youâ€™re just a regular Mum then. Gotcha. "
"I work carts and I have my name tag on a lanyard, which I keep behind my vest, cause otherwise it gets caught in the carts and either hurts me or sends my name tag flying. However whenever someone has wanted to know my name they've always asked and followed it with ""I couldn't see your name tag"" so I tell them and pull out my name tag at the same time, and then explain why I have it hidden away like that. They always go ""Well that makes sense"". Point is, if you really want to know who's serving you, just ask the person themselves, not like the name tag is there to help them remember their name."
"OK, I'm not young by any standard, and I've always called it 'wax paper'. Yes, I know the proper name is 'waxed paper', but nobody has ever mistaken it for parchment by calling it 'wax paper'. Parchment is completely different."
"&gt;Woman #2 has seen me. ""Oh my god, she's holding it like this! What does she think is going to happen? That's so funny! What a weirdo!""

She's the weirdo or just plain stupid. She's probably both. Even if it's plain water, I wouldn't by choice *want* to touch it."
Which is stupid because this can get their spouse in trouble for doing that.
"&gt; She stormed out and said she'd never come back here, and immediately went through drive through instead.

Bahaha"
"If she'd put the bread in the right way, she would have gotten away with it ... must be kicking herself."
"Haha, maybe I should have mentioned that LL is one of those ladies that almost exclusively buys the groceries that are on weekly, or coupon sale"
"Bravo, Lettuce Lady. You took a risk in an attempt to get away with some extra lettuce and instead wound up with assault charges. "
"I had something sort of similar happen (as far as customers who don't understand you're not supposed to touch cashiers goes), on St. Patrick's day I had a mid-40s male customer (I'm a 17 y/o girl) wait until I turned around so I could grab him some cigarettes off the wall to reach ACROSS the counter and pinch me (very hard, mind you) for not wearing green. I don't even celebrate St. Patrick's day smh."
"As that's sweet. I had kind of the opposite experience, actually. Very sweet older guy came in looking for something for his wife. He said his budget was under 60 or so dollars, so I lead him to sterling silver since anything we had in gold was above budget. He ends up picking out a sterling and mother of pearl necklace that came right in on the price point. I pack it all up for him nicely with our complimentary gift bag. He's pleased as punch.

A few days later, woman comes in to return said necklace, still in gift bag. She grumps the entire time about how ugly it is and how her husband has no taste and would buy any ugly thing a salesperson pitched to him. I keep quiet about that, but offer to help her find an exchange more suited to her taste. She insists on money back since everything we have is ugly. Lol

Poor guy. He just couldn't win."
Because what I would have called her would have gotten me fired. :3
I commend you for not throwing a proofed dough ball at her head lol. 
"Oh man... I get customers like this on the reg. The best are the ones who call asking for my boss (my boss is the owner of our company and is very well-known in our industry, so it's not uncommon that many people want to pick his brain for advice).  When I have to take a message, it usually goes like this:

Me: ""Let me get your name &amp; number and I'll have [bossman] call you back."" 


Customer: ""Um yea my name is Steve.""  


After an uncomfortable pause where I'm expecting them to keep going with their phone number, but it never comes... Me: ""Okay Steve... can I get a last name please?""


Customer: ""Oh, he'll know who this is. I buy stuff there all the time.""


Me, dying a little inside: ""I have spoken to three other 'Steves' this morning, sir, can I please have your last name? I need your number as well, please.""


Customer: ""*sighs* I don't know why you need my last name [bossman] knows me but fine. My last name is Blahblah. My number is XXX-XXX-XXXX.""


Me (internally): ""Yeah... you're the only Steve that's ever bought anything in the 25 years my boss has run this place. Fine. Whatever.""

After this type of exchange, I like to go look up our records for the customer.  More often than not, ""I buy stuff there all the time"" translates into ""I bought one $50 thing 10 years ago."""
"&gt;go fuck yourself

&gt;thanks you too

Oh my god I would kill to be able to get away with saying this to some people."
"Glad you let her have it. She knew they werenâ€™t returnable, thatâ€™s why she sent her grandma in."
"I have been walking around my store before, jacket on, handbag over my shoulder while talking on the phone and clearly shopping, and a customer has seen a peek of my uniform from under my jacket and decides to ask me where to find something. Itâ€™s happened on multiple occasions with multiple different people.

like BITCH how fucking rude to you have to be to bother somebody who isnâ€™t working, let alone someone whoâ€™s talking on the phone. 

god i hate my job sometimes."
"Ask your name? Like you're a person? Lady was reading her label. Fucking customers, man."
"Just because I respect the men and women in the military doesn't mean I have to respect you.

I would have thought that anyway..."
"I always loved it when people pulled that and the product was caked in dirt or mud, or could clearly see the decade old manufacturer tag."
"You should have checked for her under ""Moron""."
"Any time someone asks for a product I'm not familiar with, I immediately go to the default ""What's it used for?""

About 80% of the time, that'll get me to the right place in the store, whether we carry it or not."
Hold on to that.
"Yep, definitely advanced cheapskatery. I witness the practice on almost a daily basis. One time some older guy needed a new water heater, which are at least $400. He wanted it for less than $80. Made a big fuss about it."
Someone taught their kid well. Kudos to the parents as well as the kid. 
"I mean simply at, ""Isn't that strange?"" she could have easily said.

""OK. I only want one lettuce. Would you please remove the other two from the bag. Thank you.""

That's it. End of story. 

She took this up to a new level at every possible juncture. "
"If they were going to let their kid teeth on something, why not an actual teething toy? Are these folks stupid?!"
