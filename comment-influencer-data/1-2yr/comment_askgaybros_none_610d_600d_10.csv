Glad you let us know you've never been murdered 
Most youtubers are garbage people.
"When I saw him, it was crystal clear."
That's really gay.
He is scouting your apartment to break in later.
"Oh my fucking fuck already!

Stay away from those toxic people. That is a clique you want no part of. I feel so sorry for you. That's kinda traumatic. "
"Are you a Saudi Citizen or an ex-pat?  Are you safe at your friend's place now?  His parents are not suspicious?  Is your friend aware of why you were kicked out?  Is he also gay?  

I am an American who used to live in Saudi Arabia, and was closeted while I lived there.  I can connect you with a few people who might be able to help get you out of KSA, but of course a large part of that would depend upon your nationality and getting a passport, etc.  

I know you're hurt and upset and in shock-- you have been betrayed by the people who should love and accept you.  I know you feel suicidal-- those feelings are natural.  But they're not permanent (I've also survived a suicide attempt, and much betrayal at the hands of my family).  

Please don't give up!!  Go to school with your friend, try to carry on as much as you can your normal life-- and help your friend's family with chores and be useful.  Show them your gratitude.  

If you decide you are ready to leave KSA, I would gladly sponsor you and you may live with me here in the US.  I'd expect you to finish your schooling, and I would be happy to mentor you for college or whatever you want to do as a career.  Feel free to PM me.  

You have options.  There are many here will support you with a few dollars, friendship, and good counsel.  Hang in there!!

UPDATE:  I exchanged 5-6 e-mails with /u/cluelessjacq and he was enroute to Dubai with his uncle 8 days ago and he said he'd contact me once he was able to escape Saudi Arabia.  The last message I heard from him was that his mother was helping him find his passport, but his father had already come looking for him with one other and it was clear they intended on killing him.  This young man is afraid and I hope that he is out of the Kingdom now and contacts me soon!!!  Sorry I don't have more update to share with you all."
"That's terrible. I have never been murdered, but when I was 15 (legal in my country), I went to meet a guy for a date/hookup. My first time meeting up with another gay dude. Ended up spending about a week in hospital. No interest in hookups ever since. "
"I'm definitely not a slave but I enjoy cleaning as an activity. I also like to cook. And give head. 


....why^am^i^single? "
"What's the difference between a straight and gay relationship?

Both people get to cum in a gay relationship."
"My first college roommate said he was straight and not interested in experimenting so to please don’t try shit with him.
He got offended when I told him that he wasn’t my type... "
"If you want to have faith in humanity, stay away from hookup apps and sites."
"&gt;He got offended at me calling him homophobic, and said that just because he doesn't want to hang out at a gay beach doesn't mean he dislikes gay people. He said he didn't want people getting the wrong idea of us at the beach. Also, he said that he would never go to a gay bar, because he wouldn't want to be hit on by gay dudes, and that he doesn't want to give gay people the wrong idea.

That's pretty much textbook insecurity due to homophobia. You were right to call him out on it. Your ambivalent, slightly amused attitude is normal. His freak-out was definitely abnormal and unhealthy. "
I think it is extremely offensive. Unfortunately straight people will never understand how difficult it is to come out and so to them they might not see it as being offensive. But to me at least it is. 
"You confided in her, so you don't have to have secrets.

She confided in you, so she doesn't have to have secrets.

If she didn't freak out by you telling her you're gay, why are you freaking out on her? It's not like she tried to jump your bones, she just confided in you her feelings. Man up and don't be a dweeb."
"My boyfriend has a kink for sucking my cock when I ignore him. So I have been sucked when doing work, when I'm on the phone with my parents etc. He is happy to basically live between my legs and suck out load after load. One of my favorite activities is watching kinky straight porn with the volume up as he sits under the desk and sucks me off - basically giving him free reign over my cock as I sit back and get lost in pussy.  He loves being reduced to a tool as I get off to chicks being pounded, and I'm all too happy to use him hard.  "
"Most people are garbage. With YouTubers, it's just easier to identify them"
"There is, but I deliberately included that phrase to lighten up the mood of my comment a bit."
"&gt;Fun fact: I've never seen a gay person, sissy, or trans lose a fight.

We have a lot of pent up anger."
"No, I'm the protective one who looks for a more submissive guy. I love cuddling him under a ton of blankets on a cold night making him feel safe."
"I think this whole Pineapple on Pizza internet hate is just dumb. It's okay if you don't like it, but don't nail me on a cross and set me on fire if I like it because you saw three posts on 9GAG that told you so. I mean come on, it's perfectly decent to buy a pizza with 7 different types of meat and barbecue sauce but a simple pizza with cheese, ham and A FRUIT is suddenly a capital sin.


(rant over)

I like Pineapple on Pizza and I hope you can accept me the way I am, I was born this way."
"Young, dumb, and full of cum. It's ok."
no i want a guy who will mug me at the earliest opportunity
Did you make him put the lotion in the basket?
Me. It’s good for your loads too.
"First of all, having two female roommates and listening to them talk about dating and the men they meet, I can honestly say I am very VERY glad I don’t have to deal with women in a romantic fashion. 

Second, straight women frequently objectify gay men, our culture, our clubs, etc. While that is no reason to be a misogynist, it also helps add to my reasoning of why I’m glad I don’t have to deal with women and their often selfish behaviors.

Finally, I do find breasts and vaginas unattractive. Although I wouldn’t use the word disgusting. However, women frequently make faces or remark negatively when I talk about anal sex, so it works both ways. "
"He's overreacting. If any gay man approaches him, he can just say ""no thanks, I'm straight"" and be done with it. 

Straight guys tend to worry that gay men will treat them the way straight guys treat women. Maybe this experience will give him some insight for the next time he thinks about going to flirt with some girl. 

If he's that uncomfortable and worried about what people think, he's probably hiding something."
good
"Hi gay, I’m dad."
"&gt;I have never been murdered

OMG SAME"
Something tells me theres a bit of a language barrier lol
plz be a real typo
"As a frequent wearer of jock straps, you’re gonna regret it. Especially on hot days. The pouch edges become like little razors along your thighs. I switched back to briefs. Much more comfy and still give a nice basket and booty lift. "
"I was the President of my university's LGBT+ Society for a year (was also involved throughout my time at uni) so what I may be about to say may come off as a bit harsh considering that fact, but it's based on my experiences.

Honestly, you can probably give the LGBT+ Society a miss, and this is coming from the guy that spent three years in it, one of those running it. I never got on with anyone there and I had barely anything in common with any of them (except for this crazy, Swedish lesbian, who was the best). Looking back on it, I wasn't really attracted to the kind of people that were in the society and I could've sunk my time into basically any other hobby that I was actually interested in.

The irony of things like LGBT+ Societies and events is that they're ultimately a self-fulfilling prophecy for segregation. Sure, LGBT+ Societies are open to straight people being involved, but realistically you won't see many there, so it's just an isolated clique of people that define their sexuality as basically the entirety of their person hanging out with other people that do the same thing and they all shun the idea of the real world while they live in this echo chamber where they just hear all their personal beliefs about what being gay means reflected back at them in an unnecessarily glorious and affirming way. I understand the need for newly out people to have somewhere they feel safe and with people they can identify and share their experiences with, but I honestly found that many of my members never saw the bigger picture of their lives and the world while they were there."
"I had a ""hookup"" where all we did was cuddle and a little dick sucking. Basically 2 hours of cuddling and talking about life, the world, etc."
"Nothing. EDIT: Correction, he's wearing nothing but a chastity device. "
Sounds like we got a bottoooooooom 
"Hehe that it was something that happened to ""other people"""
It's always funny to see people who are full of themselves having to deal with the fact that not everyone is trying to have sex with them.
How do you think he got wealthy?
"Unprotected sex is like eating raw chicken. You’ll probably be fine most of the time, but if you get unlucky once you’re screwed. "
"Oh c'mon dude, at least give him your dick as a reward for the good job, that's just common courtesy."
"I wish he would! I’m the one always asking if I can suck him, lol"
"Congratulations!! But...

&gt;I came without touching my thing

You got plowed infront of an audience of onlookers...you can say ""dick""."
you're getting scoped out lmao
"I’m 24 and still in the closet even though I believe my parents would completely accept me.

I’ve always been a shy person and I don’t have the self confidence to not be ashamed of being gay. Also I have this irrational fear where things will go really bad in life if I do come out."
"Congrats!!  Here's your membership card, toaster oven, your copy of the gay agenda, and our secret meeting places and times (hint: they're all brunch places).

"
"This makes me so happy! Many would be proud to have you as a brother. 

I hope your brother's issues are resolved."
Like finding a needle in a haystack
Wait are people this stupid? You got into a random car not even knowing if its the STRANGER you been talking to for like 20 minutes? 
"Being abandoned is heart breaking.

Being abandoned without an explanation is soul crushing."
...only at weekends for me! I don't want to bend down to pick up a pen from the floor in work and for all to see my peaches 🍑

""STOP USING MY PICTURES."" Nearly every guy around here that says that is a catfish themselves. "
I cuddle my pillow after masturbating.
Ooh! Why did I think that would be the end? [Goodies](https://imgur.com/a/a79L6)
He tweaked my interest.
"Depends on the guy, the butt and the circumstances under which I am seeing the butt. "
"I had a group of guy friends back home. One of them was the annoying kid that sort of just hung around (like most groups have, I'm guessing). He had nasty, longer hair and was super skinny, so not my type at all. On the other hand, another of our group was a very fit, very good looking guy. So, nasty hair asked me if I would rate him. I told him I didn't want to. He told me it was ok if I found him attractive, that he wouldn't be weirded out-so I told him, out of 10, I'd give him a 4. He was shocked, and started going through pictures of himself with shorter hair, to which I responded that he was maybe a 5 with the shorter hair. He still bitches about that moment to this day. Then hot friend shows me a shirtless picture of himself and asks for a rating. I took his phone and said I would need to send the picture to myself for a closer look. It was definitely 10/10 worthy though. "
"One of the biggest hurdles that almost all bi/gay men have to overcome is figuring out healthy ways to cope with feelings of shame. Too many go thru life never even figuring that out. The world tells us every day in lots of little ways our entire life that what you’re feeling is wrong and makes you weak. It’s getting better but it still fucking sucks. 

Being honest with yourself and really *knowing* that who you’re attracted to is perfectly normal and ok is an important first step in figuring out how to feel happy in your own skin. I know it sounds like some hippy dippy Oprah book club psychobabble shit, but it really is a journey of self-acceptance that you have to go through. The sooner you start the better, and the sooner you can start being honest with the people who love you and just want you to be happy."
"first question when I came out to my straight friend at the time was:

""thats cool I guess......so am I good looking or ugly?"" XD I had to dodge that question because no, no he was not good looking"
"Well we both didnt have any teeth, so we knew we were perfect for each other. "
"You get to be manhandled around hehe, which is something straight guys will never experience."
"If he's hard, we're alone and he wants to, it's happening, no need to ask. Lol"
"Those who matter don't mind, and those that mind don't matter. "
"You shouldn’t have told him, but he was being absolutely ridiculous. It’s not like he was sucking off dudes in a shower, he was eating a goddamn sandwich. He can’t bear to be assumed gay for *one lunch?* What a screaming mess of insecurity."
"It's very possible to find. 

Source: am one."
"Whenever we go out for a drive or just anywhere really, we hold hands during the duration. He drives and sometimes he would kiss the back of my hand occasionally. He did a lot when we had a road trip together. We kiss whenever a red light.

Another thing is that he's very affectionate when he's asleep. He likes to hold my hand when he sleeps. He's just an amazing guy who does small things that mean the entire world to me. "
"I don't know about extensive collections, but [a wine bottle holder can work well for a single item.](https://i.imgur.com/yf8c0xI.jpg)"
"Tell him to blow you, cmon... let him have some fun lol"
You really need a blog or something.
Thanks for pioneering for us back in the day. 
"He's 46 and I'm in my 20s haha. He's all like ""I know you have options, so I won't even bother asking for anything sexual. The apartment won't clean itself."" My thoughts exactly. "
"It would be like other nudist places- full of old people and fat people, not to mention the sweat and sanitation issues that come with The nakedness. No thanks."
"TL;DR: Stupidity multiplied by horniness. I'm deeply ashamed. :(

He was kinda creepy from the very beginning but I was too determined to get some d to pay attention. Though later I began to realize I didn't really want to do anything with him sexually. He touched my face, his hand stopped on my neck. He suggested we get down to business. I said something like naah, I've changed my mind, I don't wanan do anything tonight. He sadi wrong answer and choked me a bit. i t escalayted.

whew. But I ended up in hospital not because he hurt me much. It was because I couldn't get my stuff back (coat with phone/monies). It was below zero, dead hours...long story short, I got pneumonia. It was pretty bad.

Last time I told someone this story they asked why my parents didn't look better after me, etc. As you can guess, I had no parents.

Sorry for mistakes, but I really don't want to re read what I've typed
"
"The only real one I feel like I run into as a man is how double income no kids starts to make your life better starting around 30 if you don't have kids. That combined with not having the same pressure to have kids means you can actually enjoy your earnings in a way many straight men don't experience until they retire.

With that said, the wealthy gay couple still isn't the majority experience for LGBT people. Lots of challenges that gay people suffer tie heavily to poverty and financial hardship. Estrangement from support networks and smaller career networks in general make earning a bigger challenge for gay men until they get a break with the right kind of job."
Cuz that’s life dirkdiggler
"Some get offended some don’t. The weirdest experience though was when a group of guys I know, came up to me and asked me to rate them from hottest to ugliest(the 1-10 scale). After I told them what I thought, some of them reveled at the idea of being a 9 and belittled the 4s and 5s. It was really weird because this was when I was in the military, so I had all these hyper masculine guys bragging that they were a 9 or an 8. I then realized men don’t get complimented as much as they’d like, many hetero men will never realize just how hot they are because women are self centered bitches."
"I’m an artist and I’ve always struggled to make ends meet. I’ve had a ton of shitty jobs on the side while trying to get an art job, and I struggle with all manner of mental health issues (I have PTSD, not from combat). I look at my friends who have lucrative careers, who are animators for big studios, who are concept artists for big name game titles, who are doing work for Marvel and DC, and I feel like shit. There’s one person in particular who, I’m ashamed to admit, I straight up envy. The guy is a great artist, he’s prolific, he has thousands of adoring fans. He’s also ten years younger than me at least, and much better looking. He has a social life, he travels a lot, he has a loving family. He is everything that I wish I was, and the older I get the more I realize that I’ll never be like him, I’ll never have what he has. 

Looking at him, I feel like a child scrawling in a coloring book with a crayon. It’s a horrible feeling and it makes me incredibly depressed. I’m ashamed to say that sometimes I regret every one of my life choices and I often cry myself to sleep. 

If you saw me greeting my husband when he comes home, you’d think “wow, that guy has a great life. Look at that beautiful relationship!” 

You wouldn’t see how miserable I am. You wouldn’t see my husband’s mental illness either. You wouldn’t see the EBT card I blame myself for, or the tooth I really should do something about but can’t afford to. You wouldn’t know that my entire wardrobe is from goodwill, you wouldn’t know that sometimes I lose myself in guilt and fall apart crying and mumbling apologies to my husband, who deserves a better life than I could ever give him. 

You’d see me running into his arms and smothering him with kisses and you’d wish you had my life, just like I look at that other artist and wish I had his life. Just like, I’m sure, he looks at somebody else and wishes he had their life too. 

TLDR: don’t compare your bloopers to somebody else’s highlight reel. 

Edit: that ended up being a lot more depressing that I intended. I am managing financially and my life is not all gloom and sadness. I was just trying to make the point that we don’t really ever know what’s going on in other people’s lives and in their minds and hearts, and we often make the mistake of comparing our lives to the happy snapshots that we see of other peoples’ lives. "

"That gay people wouldn’t cheat on each other because it was so rare / because we were oppressed. I used to think finding a boyfriend would be like finding a needle in a haystack, and that you should appreciate that needle so much once you found it. 

Not true. "
"If you think that hating vaginas and breasts is considered misogyny, then you haven't been paying attention to what the feminists are saying. Women aren't vaginas and breasts, they are people."

"So you thought you and the guy would mess around at your place while leaving the toddler in the car or something??wtf

"Actually yes. It's weird, but for some odd reason, straight men think if you're gay you're automatically into them. I ask them, do you find ""every"" woman attractive? That answer has been no across the board. So it is an odd thing. "
You clearly dodged a bullet in not getting hitched to that cuntbag.
"""Just looking for friends"" while their profile picture is them with barely any clothes on."
"Thank you so much. Yes, I’m a citizen of Saudi Arabia. 

Edit: they are pretty confused and their main question right now is why my parents didn’t take me with them on vacation. I said something about preparing for exams. When they asked me for my parents number, I gave them an incorrect number so that my parents wont get a chance tell them what happened. I told my friends family they can’t reach my  parents now cause they’re away. They are still pretty uncomfortable about me staying with them. So I don’t think I can stay here for too long.

"As we would treat anyone we don't understand or disagree with - by listening to them, by trying to learn what factors in their life brought them to this moment or choice, by sharing our own beliefs and what factors in our lives (or evidence) brought us to them if appropriate. But definitely stand strong in your position / don't let them bully you about it.

Maybe he's misguided. Maybe his priorities include having biological children without a surrogate or whatever. (A priority I'm weirdly understanding more and more these days.) Maybe he's taking the easy way out. Maybe his homosexuality was indeed just an expression of some other rebellion and he's really into women. As I head into my late 20s, I'm also starting to have funny glimmers of understanding about certain things that make women sexy when I used to not even look at them really. Who knows. Even if his story is totally effed up and ""wrong,"" it'd probably enrich your life a lot to hear it and digest it."
He’s still at work. Should be home any time now
He doesn’t need anything I have. Makes way more money than me. 
Before I knew about anal sex I had thoughts about just getting naked with another boy and rubbing dicks together. That's what I thought gay sex was.

For longer than I care to admit I thought oral sex was talking dirty.

"I mean, statistically, I'm pretty sure that on average Asians have slightly shorter penises than the world average. So I would probably have lower expectations. However, I wouldn't act any differently because every ethnicity is on a normal distribution and you don't know how hung someone is until you see it yourself.

Anyway, penis size should be a minor issue in romantic relationships. Anyone who won't date someone else because the other person is slightly likelier to have a small penis than him is an asshole that doesn't deserve you anyway."

"No for me it was the opposite.  Everyone around me couldn't stop talking about me being gay.  Every joke was around me being gay.  Every time they would see a gay couple, I would get a phone call so they could tell me (because, you know, gay).

Its annoying.  I had to sit my family down and tell them that there is more to me than being gay, and that I want them to realize it just isn't a big deal.  (it didn't work)."
"I would just say that everything happened so fast that you forgot to tell him. You said that you planned on telling him earlier, but was too busy/ distracted.  

I would tell him that you hope nothing changes in the relationship just because your gay. "
"One that kind of surprised me is that apparently (at least in Canada) we have an open-adoption advantage.  My husband and I adopted a baby almost two years ago and it we were chosen the second time they showed our profile to someone.

The social workers don't really have a good explanation but the speculated that there is what they called the ""Modern Family"" effect and then they also speculated that the birth Moms subconsciously like not having female ""competition"" as it were—in one sense they're still the only ""Mom"".

I think there's also a stigma attached to infertile couples. Even though it makes no sense, I think subconsciously the perception is still that there's something ""wrong with them"". We don't suffer from that same stigma.

And then, holy crap does every one treat gay dads like heros! (Not saying it's right, just that it's my experience). Like we told people—not really close friends even—we were adopting and they'd be SO overjoyed. Sometimes crying! It was really weird... And by contrast I heard some really horrible stories from almost every straight couple about reactions from other people.

And then I had a bit of an epiphany that adoption for a gay couple brings our relationship closer to the cultural norm—it kind of makes us easier to understand and it's perceived as a positive change. For a straight couple it takes them away from the cultural norm so it's an overall negative shift."
"Exactly. My sexuality shouldn't defined me. Being gay doesn't mean that I have to hang out with gay people. Straight people get together and make friend based on the similar lifestyle, the common hobbies, the same thoughts, not just because they want to fuck people of same gender. I enjoy being gay, but I am not very fond of these aspect of gay community."
That's great! Treat him well and don't fall in love with him!

In your circumstance, he could have been more considerate of the fact you had to get up so early. At this point though, there's nothing you can do about it. It happened and there's no point in holding resentment over something that can't be undone. 

Since you didn't like him waking you up like that, calmly talk to him about it and ask him not to do it in the future. Then he'll know you didn't like that, and hopefully he'll adjust his actions to respect your wishes."

"Gay people aren’t always stereotypes or caricatures.

I'm not sure how, since I do not tell these men where I work, but I have had several men that I have talked to on Grindr come sit in my section.

Some of them ended badly, but they were cordial and tipped me well. One was so toxic to me that I pawned him off on another server and took on of her tables instead.

"Remember that you being gay has no affect on anybody else, that it’s your life and that people who have a problem with you being gay (or not being gay enough) should mind their own business. You don’t have to hide your sexuality and you don’t have to wear it on your sleeve. You don’t have to refrain from holding your boyfriend’s hand in public and you don’t have to be overly affectionate with him in public either. You don’t have to do anything really, other than don’t be an asshole."

Someone who does a gay prank will also do pranks about teen pregnancy, drugs and so on. I always can’t help but think „you little piece of shit, why are you laughing after you revealed it’s just a prank, when there are real people out there who get beatings from their family and can’t just fix the situation by saying that it’s just a prank because that is their reality“. "
"It's not at all to not want to have sex with a trans guy. Though it is transphobic to call them gross or otherwise insult them in the process.

Some people confuse one for the other or use rejection to feed their insecurities."
Or ya know... just plain old homophobia. I don't understand why everyone loves painting all homophobes as secretly concealing same-sex attraction.

"RETURN THE SLAB still haunts my fucking nightmares ❤

"Yes, and I already found a guy like that for myself!

In the beginning, I really needed that safety, guidance and protection he was giving to me. I low-key loved these moments when he almost picked a fight with bunch of guys who pushed me, or when he was giving me his hoodies, sweaters or jackets when it was getting cold and I was shaking.

But with time, under his wings, I evolved into less dependant person. I still really frigging enjoy when he's protective over me, but I also like to offer him comfort and give some ""safety"" in return, even if he doesn't need them that much."
"&gt;he has a mini crush on me... he said I could do draped or undrapped, and as a bit of an exhibitionist the idea of being undrapped sounds fun

"In my personal experience this is predominantly a straight mans hangup. Straight women are generally a bit more open in their appreciation of good looking women where straight men are a little bit more likely to become intimidated when asked to give opinion on how a man looks etc. 

I haven't *yet* witnessed anybody from the LGBTQ community be quite so reserved about aesthetic appreciation (which is basically what it is when there isn't a sexual longing there) but I suppose there's always time yet!"
"God, I feel so miserable after reading all your comments 😫"
"Ha! No, he knew what I was doing. He didn't care. He knows I find him really attractive. "
"I’d get mad, yeah. That’s disrespectful."
"I'm so glad I don't have to deal with women anymore. This is definitely a case of ""I regret it so it was rape"". 

Like bitch you went on a date with him and he rushed through the meal and invited you back to his apartment afterwards. What the fuck did you think was going to happen there? Even if you changed your mind mid hookup you could have *just fucking left*. Like he asked you to suck his dick and you did, he didn't force you to. Just because you thought it was gross afterwards doesn't make it sexual assault.

Don't even get me started on that article from babe.com. She's over here acting like him choosing which wine to serve was evidence of him forcing himself on her (It's his wine he's giving you in the first place, don't act like you're entitled to his property)."
Talk about convenient.
My roommate once. He was hot and I was horny. 
"As a gay guy I see straight women treat straight men the way you describe again and again. I don’t understand why most straight women aren’t perpetually single. 

I don’t understand why straight guys willingly buy drinks on ladies nights while the women get in for free. To me at least a guy is worth buying him a drink, show him some attention, a tiny bit of enthusiasm, treat him like his existence is not an inconvenience, and honestly the attitude of a lot of straight women matches what you say. It’s not an enticing look. "
I always find American accents to be quite obnoxious. Generally because I have the feeling that Americans think they're better than everybody 
"By their logic only liking effeminate guys is internalised homophobia too because of being attracted only to males that have female-associated values. 

Also I love how ""I am not attracted to X"" is sufficient information for some people to diagnose you with some deeply embedded psychological disorder that you aren't even aware of having. You can never win with these people.
"
"I can only answer for myself but personally about 1,5 points. The most important aspect of physical attraction to me is the face. If I like your face then we're good to go. I'm someone has an above average face I don't care as much about them body. If someone has an ugly face ( keep in mind that this is subjective) I just wouldn't be attracted to him. You could have the most amazing and muscular build on the planet. It doesn't matter to me. I'm all about the face."
"Shy guys need a second chance. They need a chance to say no at first because that’s what they’re going to say by default. 

First they freeze up. Then they’re going to deal with it, they’re going to think of what they wanted to say, they’re going to quietly cringe with embarrassment that they said “no” instead of the smart thing they just thought of, and then for at least five minutes or until something distracts them, they will believe this is the reason they will die alone. 

A second chance feels like a miracle and it gives them a shot at remembering to say yes. 

Shy guy:
“Dear Brad Pitt, I’m only writing you this letter because I know you are heterosexual so there’s no pressure at all but I wanted to let you know how awesome you are. I have literally fantasized about you every day of my life for the last 15 years. That felt fun to say. You’re awesome. I wish I could be this honest with real men I actually have a shot at dating. But until then I wanted you to know you’re the ideal. Yours truly, a fan.”

Brad Pitt:
“Since Crazy Wife and I broke up I’ve been rethinking a lot of things, so don’t assume I’m all that heterosexual. You’re super cute and I’m in town for filming, starts Monday. I would be honoured if I could take you to dinner and this sounds crazy but I really feel a connection.”

Shy guy:
“No.” 

(Throws laptop downstairs, locks door to basement and turns off the light.)

Brad Pitt, 3 days later:
“Aww come on! You sure??”

Shy guy:
“OMG YES! I would love to! I can’t believe you wrote back!!!... where should I meet you??”"

"The funniest thing I have ever seen was a guy who sent me a dick pic, but his dick was the same colour as his bedsheets. Instead of just taking the pic somewhere else, he put a piece of paper underneath it to create the contrast necessary for me to be able to see and appreciate his penis. 

I do not know why I find it so funny. Just imagining the thought process makes me laugh."
"Reading this made me smile, aww!"
"To me its a ""meh"" thing. I can live with or without them.

"Grindr Culture does not equal Gay Culture. Careful to confuse them as the same.

From what I have noticed by living in Atlanta. If you want large muscular guys get a big dog. If you want twink get a small dog. I need to do further research for bears. 
Took me more time to accept myself than for them to accept me. My biggest fear was that I would come out them realize that I wasn't gay..
Attraction requires a measure of defamiliarization. Your mind gets jaded by its familiarity with your body in a way that makes admiration possible but also makes attraction unlikely. There’s a reason you don’t get attracted to your siblings (under normal circumstances) regardless of how hot they may be

"There's real transphobia and then there's trans people who are salty about being rejected, unfortunately rabid social justice knights haven't been able to tell the difference as of late"
"The evidence is pretty damning, and I'm not sure what you're expecting people to say. From an outsider's perspective, I think that you either have to redefine what you want in this relationship, or move on. If monogamy was the goal and the expectation for your relationship, then your relationship has failed. "
"I can't turn it into an unified theory so:

- Good kisser. Not too much spit, tongue soft (not fucking my mouth) and taking time to switch kissing position.

- When he's blowing I can't feel his teeth and my penis penetrates nicely

- He triest to guide the action by choosing positions but is comfortable when being guided

- Penetrates slowly and carefully watches the bottom reaction

- When penetrated arches his back, pulls his legs high and spreads them while relaxing his rectum

- Never moans like a dying seal

- Can identify well his sensations and can get closer or more distant from orgasm without cumming

- Knows a lot of tricks = sequences of areas to touch/lick to stimulate your partner. Some work with almost anyone (ex. mouth-neck-go up to the ear-nibble the lobe-tongue in the ear-go down kissing to the nipple) but aren't easy to pull off.

Before having sex posture is a good clue. You want him to stand tall and comfortable, his back relaxed and legs never stiff."

"You write fairly well, I enjoyed the read. Care not to abuse ellipses, they clash with the fluid flow of the story.

In the US gay people are mixed with everyone else? Here in Italy most prisons have a special wings for them so that the bullying and the raping are rarer.

&gt; for reasons I never understood

Lesbians and gay people try to compensate the social stigma with overachievement. They have statistically better grades in school and university and aim for better paid job positions than average. I imagine financial crimes are a way to get the same results without getting involved in violent crimes, which are otherwise connected to homophobic criminal gangs."

"Just live it one day at a time, and before you know it, you won't be able to imagine how you ever spent so much time NOT being your weird true self naked, eating a block of cheese, and watching trash TV, all with that breathtaking view laid out in front of you.

I think that, as we get older, we learn to love that poignant feeling that marks the passage of time - next time it'll be your last day in the office, or as you drive out of the city in a moving truck, or the days right before your wedding (if that's something you want etc). As it happens more and more, it will still grab at your heart, but it'll be familiar and maybe even enriching/fulfilling if still complicated and bittersweet. Welcome to this big milestone - you're gonna do great!"
"You don't need to compare yourself to their relationship, that is the first problem. They probably have been together for quite a while to have such a bond. (I, as a bi drag queen can confirm gay relationships are the hardest to maintain.) Just try doing yourself for awhile, learn to enjoy yourself and attract abundance. Don't focus too hard on finding anyone as we live in a very anti social society. Live spontaneously so you can meet new people. Try new things. Maybe get to be friends with your neighbor. It sounds like he's probably lonely. In other words live life for yourself and let your positivity attract more positivity."

"I'm also from the UK and I wouldn't consider that particularly weird. Not much of a generational gap and like you said in a few years the 3 year difference will mean nothing. Besides I think gay relationships have a bit more leeway when it comes to age differences anyways.

That said, there can be a big difference mentally in 3 years as a teen so y'know, be nice."
My response to this is simply that no matter what you have done in your life you will always find shortcomings (No pun intended) and you will always regret not doing something more. 
"Hi. I'm a really submissive kinky dude. I don't enjoy the cleaning or the servitude aspects of the Master/slave, so I don't do that (much to my boyfriend's lament), but I am a humiliation masochist and regularly enjoy/endure activities that would probably be against the Geneva Convention if I wasn't consenting to them.

On behalf of subby kinksters everywhere; **Please don't feel bad for us practising kinksters.** I completely understand why you would, but it is (sorry but I'm being honest) misplaced and not helpful. I would like you to consider these three things:

* Everything is consentual, and we always have the power to stop our scenes at any time (I think you already know that, but it's so very important).

* Although kinks arising from tramua is a popular theory, I've never known anyone who has actually had that happen (and I know a lot of kinksters!). For me personally, it's a lucky brain-wiring thing. I know because when I was a child, I saw cartoons of characters being tied up and felt flickering tingles of desire to be tied up, and this was long before I developed a sex drive or had knowledge of Kink Culture.

* I wouldn't be any other way than how I am. **I wouldn't trade it for anything**.

However, if you are feeling sympathetic and need an outlet for it, you should spare a thought for the kinksters who, for whatever reason, don't have an outlet for their kink and can only jerk off to porn of their favourite activity instead of actually engaging with it. Or those kink-minded people who are ashamed of what they like, and never have the courage to speak to their lovers about their desires for fear of weirding them out. "
"Usually in the shower. They call that the ""4 legged shower monster"". I went to get a lighter I had hidden above a light in the bathroom at night once and saw what looked like a guy taking a piss at the stall. 
""woaah homie hold on!"" he said
""Naw don't worry I'm just grabbing something"" I replied. 

When I went to stand on the sink I saw that someone was sitting n the toilet sucking his dick. I ran out, scared, but came back because I wasn't going to -not- smoke the weed I had. I asked the dude if he minded me getting up there again and he said ""you good playboy"". That was kind of funny. 

In higher security levels its 2 man cells so you can do it there.

I picked up a case of beer and met up with my best friend from back in high school. We played video games and just shot the shit all night. Super fun to catch up! The whole time I wanted to tell him that I was gay, but the moment never really felt right. Eventually we had almost finished all of the beer and my friend says, “I gotta be straight with you, it’s fucking awesome to have you back, I missed you bro.” I drunkenly responded, “Well, I gotta be straight with you, I’m not.” He didn’t even flinch when he told me, “Dude, you asshole! You didn’t miss me?!”

It’s weird and amazing to go from such a high anxiety situation to having it completely deflated by laughter. The rest of the night was full of a lot more gay jokes than I expected, but in the end he told me I’m like his brother and nothing could ever change that. I’ve got such a good friend. :)"
