"Not as bad as some of things on this thread but this was a dick move...

I asked my uncle, who is a mechanic, if he could install new belts on my Honda since it would be much cheaper then taking it to a shop.  He told me he would do it for me, I just had to buy the parts.  Bought the parts, took the car to him and came back a few hours later.  He told me he was finished and I paid him $200 for a $450 job, which was dope.  

A few days later my cousin texts me a picture of some parts that his dad asked him to put on eBay.  They were all the parts that he said he installed on my car.  My cousin thought they may be from me since he knew what job his dad was doing for me. I called my Uncle and he denied it firmly.  I still had the receipt and matched the bar codes to the ones on my receipt, so they were clearly mine.  My cousin, who is also a mechanic, installed them for free for me a week later.

Uncle still denies it and kept my $200.  Don't talk to that pleb anymore even if he's around at family gatherings. 

Edit: wow this blew up and for everyone asking/wondering..

You have to remove a ton of parts to get to the belts in a 2002 Honda Accord so you can't necessarily see what work he did. Plus I'm def not a mechanic so I honestly don't know.    "
"Hey huge hip hop fan here. I actually used to hate it tbh, preferred punk, metal and drum n bass. 

If someone is coming from a punk background I think the whole 36 Chambers album would impress them. It has a very punk ethos.

Otherwise I would advise Doomsday by MF Doom or Lions of Hip Hop by Talib Kweli and Mos Def. Both of these tracks have impressed non hip hop listening friends.

EDIT: The song is actually called ""Definition"" not ""Lions of Hip Hop"", apologies folks."
"This is my time to shine. Let me tell you about the Spawn of Satan. I was in a long distance relationship with a guy, and his parents seemed pretty sweet at first. They both appeared to like me through the few times we Skyped, all was well. Eventually my the boyfriend wanted to come visit and his mom actually imposed herself on the trip making it a family trip to Montreal. Holy shit what a fuck fest that was. 

When she first met me, she was inconsolable because of the way I looked. We had a dinner with my own parents, and she chose this time to express her profound dislike for tattoos while I had mine showing. She went on for so long that her husband tried to stop her because everyone was getting uncomfortable but she just wouldn't let it go. Her son was staying with my parents and I, her husband and herself chose to stay at a hotel. She sent him a very long email the first night carefully warning him about me and ""my body issues that make me do horrible things to myself"" and demanding she be made aware of the bedroom arrangement. He didn't answer until the next morning, and to her that was enough to feel like she had to hire a private investigator to find my parents house. She was dead serious about it until her husband made her change her mind. 

After that horrible first few days, we spent a week in Toronto. She booked the fanciest hotel suite, everything was always the most expensive too... Except for food. She refused to pay for food. The woman couldn't even get herself a tea when we went out to a fancy buffet at Niagara Falls and instead asked my ex ""Honey wouldn't tea sound nice?"" to male him order one and the grabbed it for herself. She kept trying to micro manage our food intake, even if we'd pay for it ourselves (even made us throw a milkshake out because we didn't need the rest). She made sure she let everyone know how disapproving of me she was by actually moping around an entire day of the trip, making it impossible to do anything. She couldn't even speak to me.  Once in the car, she turned around to look at my ex (I was sitting next to him) and said ""we're all out of data and need to call the canoe place, we need to use her phone, Matt"". She didn't ask. She INFORMED we'd need my phone. Through my ex. That I was sitting next to. 

The fuck fest continued. We went canoeing and she made a huge deal out of me not wearing a hat. It was inconceivable to her and she gave herself so much trouble to find me one even if Id say no repeatedly and then blamed me for making them waste time. After the canoe trip, she hung all the clothes except mine. They were in a pile next to the drying rack, which she made sure to spread all their clothing on so I wouldn't be able to put anything there. After we went for dinner at the CN tower and she made us pick from the cheaper menu while she went ahead and picked something out of the most expensive. Even if I said I'd pay for it she'd insist on paying and make us choose from that menu. That night, her husband bailed on us and never even wrote back to her so she moped around more. 

Later that year, my ex found the emails she exchanged with her mum and we both were so shocked. She described me as morbidly obese (Im def overweight but not obese at all, she was much bigger than I was), mentally ill, troll-like (she even gave my the nickname troll girl and never referred to me as otherwise in said emails), immature, who would put up a fuss with anything and made the trip miserable and expensive for them. She of course never mentioned anything about my offering to cover for my expenses. She also bitched about my family and pretty much described us as peasants. 

I also learned that whenever she was really mad she'd slash her husband's paintings with a kitchen knife, or if her husband would cook a meal his kids wouldn't like she'd smash the plate on the ground and tell him to make something else. This person was just so surreal to me. "
"When Hurricane Ivan hit (2004, I think), we were told ""you have work responsibilities &amp; family responsibilities &amp; one is not more important than the other.""  People who asked to leave to prep their house for the storm were allowed to leave but it was definitely frowned upon. Fast forward after the storm, when quite a few employees had major damage &amp;/or lost their home, there was no power, no ice, no gas &amp; we were in line for MRE handouts from the National Guard (bless them!), those words came back to haunt management. It was a mess, but def a hard lesson (for mgmt anyways) learned for future storms. "
