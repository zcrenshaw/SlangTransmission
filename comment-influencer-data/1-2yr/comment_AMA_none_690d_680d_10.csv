"I would say (in my experience) most of the nudists were middle-aged and older, and the children tended to be under 10. I assume, because like myself, after then children start to recognize this is considered ‚Äútaboo behavior ‚Äú by society and their bodies start to change- which can cause one to feel very self-conscious. 

At all of the beaches and resorts clothing is optional. They consider nudity to be a natural state of being and work hard to de-sexualize it., so there were no rules about clothing your children. That said, specifically for the resort, no single men where allowed- you had to come as a family or a couple. "
"To me the fact that single men were not allowed, but single women were says volumes about the state of our society. "
"Yea, they were trying to make it a more ‚Äúsafe‚Äù environment by excluding single men because they might be there for the wrong reasons. 

However, I had been on a number of nature walks where I stumbled on pornography being shot. So, people are not always respectful whether they come alone or not. "
"In the last night of our stay they held a dance party- I was wearing a sports bra and spandex shorts and was really feeling some Salt‚Äôn‚ÄôPeppa when a man came over and started to dance in front of me. I was eye-level with his flailing penis. I didn‚Äôt quite know what to do. Fortunately, my mother saw this and removed me from the situation. 

It could have been innocent, but I did not feel comfortable with it.

I would also see illegal photo shoots happening when I would go on nature walks. I knew about Playboy so I knew what was happening and that it was against the rules. Nudity wasn‚Äôt supposed to be about ‚Äúsexy‚Äù in these places, so these occurrences made me feel unsafe. "
"I have two questions:

1. Does the age of nudists skew young or old? Or neither?

2. What are the rules about child nudity? Are children asked if they want to go nude like their parents?"
I would suggest keeping that just between you and us for now
It would be considered a problem. People are required to carry towels with them at all times as to not sit on surfaces without a barrier- he would be expected to cover himself and remove himself as to not make anyone uncomfortable. 
"I was 17 at the time.

I was at a party with some friends. I put in half for a case of beer that everyone was drinking. A girl showed up with a dude. Another dude at the party had a kid with said girl. People started making plans to jump the guy the girl brought over. She tipped him off and he left.

Another guy shows up (A), grabs a beer, and goes to smoke weed with everyone else. So I go ask if it's cool if I smoke with them. The guy says he doesn't have that much. He was smoking with 4-5 other people. So I said something to the tune of, ""Well you're drinking a beer that I put in half on."" He says, ""I'll piss in this beer and give it back to you."" I told him not to grab another beer then if that's how it is. Basically everyone else sided with him and went against me. So I said I'm not buying any more beer then.

Short while later a friend of mine is like, ""Hey, dude left, let's buy some beer."" So we all leave to go to the store to get more beer. At this point I knew something was up because I've always been pretty good at reading body language, and things just didn't seem right. But I didn't know exactly what was up, just that something wasn't right. The store refused to sell the beer to the buyer because no ID. 

We get back to the house and A is there again, and says ""What's up, bitch"" when he sees me. I sit down on the couch. A and another guy (B) start whipping me with some sort of plastic tube and a belt. It doesn't really hurt much, so I start laughing it off while trying to figure out how I'm getting myself out of this situation. Then another guy (C) comes from the right side, jumps on me, and starts hitting me. So I start making for the door. They have both doors locked and people are deliberately blocking the doors, and are actively trying to prevent me from leaving. I'm taking punches from multiple people at this point, my back turned to them with my hands covering my face trying to block punches.

The owner of the house (D) starts screaming, ""Get him in the basement."" I called 911 twice during this. I didn't know the address where I was and they were trying to get the phone away from me. So literally the only words I ever said to 911 were the name of the street I was on. The first time, C presses the hang up button on my phone. I dial again and repeat the street address. This time C grabs my phone and snaps it in half (it was a flip phone). Eventually they pick me up by my arms and legs and start carrying me towards the basement.

This is the point where everything goes a bit fuzzy. I remember kicking one of the people carrying me by my legs in the face, and they all drop me in what couldn't possibly be a more defensible position. To the right of me is a case of stairs, and nobody is upstairs. Behind me and to the left are walls. I pull the knife out of my back right pocket, flick it open, and swing at C's gut, who is in front of me, and has been throwing the majority of the punches. Pull back, swing again, this time towards his chest. I don't remember the second swing actually landing. At this point, none of what I'm doing is conscious aside from pulling the knife out of my pocket and opening it. The next thing I remember is getting up, with nobody in arms reach of me, and running out the door. I didn't have the slightest clue where I was running to.

I ended up running into the first open door I saw with light, which happened to be a medical transport company up the street. They called an ambulance, which brought me to the hospital. Ended up getting a couple gashes in my forehead stitched up. In the hospital I learned that I stabbed C 4 times, cut another guy's arm who was apparently trying to get the knife away from me, and someone else was in the hospital with wounds as well, but I don't know any of the details on him. Another guy had a cut on his leg but decided not to get treated for it.

In total there were 8 people at the party. At least 4 of them were throwing punches at one point or another. I know one was blocking the back door, and at least one blocking the front door. At least one I know didn't take part, because her statement to the police was the only honest one aside from my own. All of it happened over the course of probably 10-15 minutes from the moment I walked back into the house to see A back, to the moment I ran out the door. But most of what I know from the second swing to running out the door is pieced together from what other people have told me based on what they heard, and what the girl whose statement matched mine told me. My memory is completely blank between those two points in time. Most of the people at the party were people I considered friends at the time."
"When I was little I thought it was amazing! What‚Äôs better than being able to run around naked?

However, when I was about 11 I was in the swimming pool and I saw a boy I thought was cute over in the hot tub. Now, seeing another kid my age naked was an infrequent occurrence so it never occurred to me that a boy I thought was cute would be naked. Well, he was. He stood up out of the water and I saw his penis. I remember seeing it swing slightly and water dripping from it and I was MORTIFIED; ‚Äúshook‚Äù as the kids like to say. 

There was 3 days left to the vacation and I felt like everywhere I turned, there he was.  This, and one other ‚Äúevent‚Äù from that stay was what made me decide I never wanted to join my parents at the resort again. "
Was it hard when you had to leave the Thieves' Guild? How did Brynjolf react and did you ever catch a glimpse‚Äã of Sapphire's titties?
"Yes, I believe so.  "
Were single men allowed
"I don't want to edit the original post, but there are more details as well that I want to add. When they planned on jumping the first guy, they went around trying to take away everyone's phone and everyone's knife.

I think this is important because it played a major factor in my survival. When they asked for my knife, I told them I didn't have one. When they asked for my phone, I refused to give it to them and agreed to turn it off instead, turning it right back on after.

The effects of this are massive. Had I given up my knife, it would have made my survival much more unlikely. Not only that, but the fact they took everyone else's knife meant that they weren't able to respond with equal force before I had already done enough damage to incapacitate the major players."
"That is what I‚Äôm saying. Being at least minimally clothed is so much more comfortable and convenient. 

I knew a guy that cooking cooking naked and spilled hot food all down his front- takes awhile to heal from that direct contact! "
"If a guy is excited, is it normal or does he get weird looks?"
"Look at it like this - you'll have an adult child by the time youre 36. As a 34 year old with a 9 month baby - I wish I'd had her sooner. When she goes to University, I'll be 52..."
"When they were discussing jumping the first lad did you not once think ""I'm hanging about with a bunch of dicks, I'm off home""?

Also I know the knife saved you from a good beating but the fact you all carry knives did it ever occur to you you might be hanging around with a bunch of dicks?

Basically I'm saying you made poor friend choices"
"All you need to do amigo is be there and love the kid. There's no magic secret, or course or qualification.

Be there to change the nappies, feed where necessary and cuddle and play.

That's it.

The rest comes later üòä"
"&gt;woman sounds a little hostile to me

That's.... odd. "
Hopefully continue and spend the rest of my life with her... that would be nice
Interesting. If I were required to carry a towel I'd rather wear underwear for the convenience!
"I imagine that single women would probably want to go for the same reason as single men, but such is modern society I guess."
Have you been diagnosed with a disorder?
"I stopped when I was around 11. I mentioned a story in the comments above, and to really drive my decision... on the last night of our stay there was a dance.  I was wearing a sports bra and bike shorts and really feeling some Salt‚Äôn‚ÄôPeppa when a nude man came up and started dancing in front of me. I am a short woman, and was a shorter child so I was making eye contact with the mans flailing penis. It could have been innocent, but I felt very uncomfortable. 

My discomfort was gradual, but really hit home on this particular trip. I told my parents I would no longer join them at the resort, but did go to the beaches clothed.

At around 13 I asked my parents to stop walking around the house naked because I no longer felt comfortable with it. Fortunately they acquiesced! "
How about a quick explanation of what happened?
"No, while I see nothing wrong with adults enjoying a naked beach or even a little kid getting to feel the wind on their tush- it simply is not for me. In the comfort of my own home, but I just don‚Äôt find doing life‚Äôs daily activities in the buff comfortable or safe."
That's all so interesting! Thank you for replying!
Yes lol why not. They sell GUNS in supermarkets in US
"It was more that I had never really seen a boy my age naked and honestly it didn‚Äôt occur to me that cute boys had penises.  It was a shock. I knew adults had them, I knew what penises were responsible for (peeing and making babies) and the reality just got too real when I connected the two.  Kids think differently than adults!

It also occurred to me that he could see my body, and it was the first time I really felt shame about it. I knew he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to see me, according to social mores, so I was embarrassed. 

Goes to show we are true products of our environment, and that society weighed more heavily than just my parents niche practices. "
What if you're a single nudist dude who wants to join a community of his fellow people? I think you might have missed his point.
"I don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll prevent me from getting a boyfriend at all. I‚Äôve had several. Derek leaves me alone when I date other people. He tends to walk in and out of my life as I see appropriate. He doesn‚Äôt acknowledge that I‚Äôve been with someone else. I don‚Äôt see it as cheating on him, because I‚Äôm perfectly aware he isn‚Äôt real. However, I think I‚Äôll maybe have difficulty maintaining relationships because Derek is literally perfect. He‚Äôs my dream guy. Everyone else might pale in comparison. That would suck. But so far, I haven‚Äôt seen any issues in my sex/dating life because of him. "
"Why would you betray my trust like this?

-Derek"
"That, as well as calling her a ""lady""."
"As in what's my job or how I get through the day. 

I'm on a contract that got issued a stop work but the company is keeping me on until it's resolved. 

I read newspapers and Reddit and other things to get through the day. "
"I was born blind, unfortunately I don't work as there aren't a lot of places willing to hire people with disabilities in general. I'm currently trying to break into the music industry."
"I know that, but I am afraid that I can‚Äôt give this kid a 100% of love and support because I‚Äôm not ready for things like this"
"I asked a guest to flip over to wax her butt and there was a piece of corn dangling out of her so I waxed around it and the corn fell back into her butthole, she clinched &amp; it disappeared. "
"Thank you! 

Well, because I didn‚Äôt see anything wrong with nudity I talked about it to other people. Once my parents told me I wasn‚Äôt allowed to talk about it, or other people would act like what I told them was wrong I started to understand. My next door neighbors mother told me that, ‚Äúwhile it is ok for your family, it is not something most families do or understand- it isn‚Äôt a secret, per se, but not something you talk about‚Äù. 

As a teenager there was much intrigue from me peers, because teenagers live anything that can be considered dramatic.  

Even to this day people don‚Äôt respond to it favorably- it is just very unusual, especially where it involves children,

I grew up near Tahoe so we were at the beach almost every weekend of the summer! I liked the public beaches better because there were other kids (clothed) to play with. Old naked people are pretty low-key and boring. "
"Well, how do you feel about that?  "
"Thanks for your interest! I‚Äôve always tried to find someone with a similar case as myself, but never had any success. So I figure, let me be the one to start talking about it! Please keep asking as many questions as you like. Here we go:

1. Yes, I speak to Derek out loud, but only in private. If other people are home, I whisper or mouth words to him. I can‚Äôt not speak to him out loud. Talking to him in my head doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. He doesn‚Äôt leave the house with me so it‚Äôs not an issue. I‚Äôm not walking around the streets having conversations out loud. 
2. Yes, I have sex with him. I‚Äôd say about 90% of the time that I masturbate, I‚Äôm imagining being with Derek. 
3. I do not buy him presents. If I buy something for myself, I‚Äôll pretend it came from him sometimes. But I‚Äôd never take a gift someone else got me and pretend he got it. 
4. He differs from me the most only in that he wants children and a marriage. I want neither. I don‚Äôt believe in marriage and I have never had any interest in having kids. We argue over this a lot. 
5. I don‚Äôt typically compare the men I date to Derek. Derek is 100% what I want. Which means every guy I ever dated is ‚Äúlike him‚Äù because they have something about them that I like. If that makes sense. So one guy might be really funny and romantic, like Derek, but not smart or driven like Derek."
If you're a single guy and you want to go to a nude beach by yourself so you can look at naked people then you're exactly the kind of person that isn't wanted at a nude beach
"Private in the way that no one else is allowed to touch them without consent.

They also become a bit more private with the presence of pannus. "
cancer and an unacceptably sickness benefit.  I was hungry.  It eventually became greed.
"I get that it's for safety, but life fucking sucks for a single guy. "
"ahhh right.  Sorry, video games were very difficult to steal"
We have time. 
"I wouldn‚Äôt know! Again, I like to think MOST people would want to go for the liberty of not having to wear clothes and no tan lines. "
It was rare.  For the most part teenagers are self conscious enough clothed. 
"Feels great, I did a little dance when she said yes"
Stay to yourself and keep out of people's business that's the number one thing. If you walk up on a fight or anything just keep going eyes forward it ain't got nothing to do with you. If you get in someone's business they'll put you in it for real 
Nope! I did go to counseling for other issues but I never talked about him. 
"So, uh, [do nudists have private parts?](http://imgur.com/4gVeIeA)"
"She said above a man came in front of her and danced naked, that may be it."
I was gay before I went in ;) 
May I recommend:  https://longform.org An excellent site for such days! 
"Really really consider talking to someone.  At this point, you have a really unhealthy thing going on here.  "
What was the other ‚Äúevent‚Äù?
Well a girl implies she's a child. And woman sounds a little  hostile to me. Lady sounds classy and fun
Right because there has never been a married pedofile. 
Now what is the plan??
"The fact you came here to talk is a good sign. You care. That's most of what the kid needs.

It'll be tough - but so worth it dude!"
This bothers me because there are plenty of female sexual predators.
Why hasn‚Äôt he become a citizen in the 30 some years he‚Äôs been here?
Do you think your imaginary boyfriend will prevent you from getting a boyfriend in the real/physical world?
"The beaches don‚Äôt really have any restrictions. There was an old, tall man known as ‚ÄúNorth‚Äù that monitored for inappropriate behavior and the beach we went to, but aside from that there weren‚Äôt restrictions.

There was a separate beach for gay couples that we did not go to.

As far as the resort, I don‚Äôt remember seeing same sex couples. "
Right on the paycheck
"Hi! Interesting AMA. At what age did you discover being part of a nudist family wasn't 'the norm'? Did your friends at school know, and if they did, did anyone mention it in a positive/negative/curious way?
Also, how much time did you spend at the beaches etc.?"
I‚Äôm glad to hear your parents were respectful.  I‚Äôm curious to know more about the ‚Äúcute boy‚Äù in the pool.  What was it that made you uncomfortable? Did it just gross you out or what? 
Fuck
This comment was both funny and creepy üòÇ. 
"Hi!

Were you born blind? 

Have you ever you find some minor advantage from been blind?

What do you like doing in your free time? 

Do you work? If so, where? 

 "
"hey,  thanks for doing this AMA! Do you actually speak out loud to Derek? do you imagine having sex with him? Do you ever buy him presents or pretend a present came from him? How does he differ from you the most? Do you find that the men you date are anything like him? 

I know that's a lot of questions but I find this fascinating!!"
"I was born into a nudist lifestyle and had been taken to the resort/beaches as long as I can remember. 

I was about 11 when I made the decision to stop going to the resort.  

Perhaps what I took away from it was, that most people were there for themselves- but there is always someone who is there for other reasons.  
By then I already knew men could be dangerous to our body, so I felt alarm when he was so close and naked in the middle of a room full of people.  I wouldn‚Äôt say it is something I think about, but now that I‚Äôm actively thinking about it I realize just how inappropriate it was for him to interact with me in that way.  In general people kept their friendly distance from eachother, but he got close. "
Ouuuuch I don't even have a penis but my imaginary one just retreated up into my crotch.
"Not when I was little, but once I hit my teens I thought it was weird to be around my dad when he was naked- for no other reason than he was naked. "
"I don‚Äôt understand the desire to want to desexualize the naked body.  I used to work in a strip club, and for years afterward seeing a naked girl in of itself would not arouse me.  I didn‚Äôt like that.  I enjoy the mystery, sexiness and anticipation of seeing a woman I am into naked. "
I had a counselor when I was 18 who asked me if I had an imaginary friend since I was bullied a lot in school growing up and since I was grounded a lot. She said it‚Äôs a coping mechanism that sticks with some people and that she‚Äôd be very surprised if I didn‚Äôt have it. I found that to be an interesting conversation. I refuse to seek help because it doesn‚Äôt affect my life negatively. 
Thanks for that buddy
"Yep, nope. Goodbye."
"I wasn't made aware they were going to jump him. I wasn't present for any of those discussions. I didn't find that out until after the fact. But in fairness, I was 17 at the time, and my moral values weren't fully developed. So I likely wouldn't have said or done anything to stop it. I wouldn't have taken part, either, but I'm very much of the school of thought that those who are neutral to injustice are just as guilty as those who commit injustice. Today, I absolutely would do something to stop it. My most likely course of action would be to tip the person off and leave with them. Because that poses the least potential for a violent result.

When they went around asking for everyone's knives, I didn't really think much of it. I say they went around asking for everyone's knives, but that's not to say that everyone had a knife on them. Most probably didn't, they were just trying to make sure. Even then, carrying a knife isn't a bad sign, just like carrying a concealed handgun isn't a bad sign. Brandishing is a different story. But simply carrying one is a smart decision in my eyes. I carry a knife today as well, even though I hope I never have to use it against a living being again.

I'm aware I made poor friend choices when I was 17. It's very likely you did, as well. Along with the vast majority of the population. I learned quite a bit from the experience, and choosing my friends wisely was probably one of the most valuable lessons learned from it."
"Sorry but you say above this affects relationships because he's ""perfect""

That's a concern.  "
"Going out on a limb here, but he may have already figured that out‚Ä¶ "
Talk to your parents. And then talk to your parents about talking to a doctor. Life is too short to not ask for help.

most expensive thing I stole was an iPad.  Biggest haul in one go would be about ¬£600.  I had to sell them on so the actual value I took was not the return I could expect.  Average return from each shop would be about ¬£100-200.  I used to set a target of ¬£200 a day.  Sometimes I was able to achieve that by 9am and could take the rest of the day off.
I think $250 is a good price for peace of mind in a situation like this. 
I really don't think it does. It's a sensitive subject and a bunch of random people in the internet don't need to be throwing out opinions and theories about someone else's past with no context out first hand knowledge. 
"I would think that dating an escort would be annoying simply for the reason that they'd be working the evening shift. Like when would you get to spend time together? How did it work for you guys?

"I get that, I really do. But OP is the one that started this conversation. It is an AMA after all. And not only that, it is a integral part of his post. "
No I would not. Derek is part of what makes me who I am. A medication strong enough to kill Derek would probably have serious effects on my personality. Even when I was just taking antidepressants I didn‚Äôt like who I was. 
"Well one perk is I can get a card that gets me free transportation for bus and lightrail train, though I don't use public transit very often due to my PTSD and social anxiety."
"Sometimes yes and sometimes not. I've had dreams where depending on what position I was laying if I had a dream where someone was talking to me, it's like I could hear them in reverberated echo form and I could respond and they'd respond back. I've had more nightmares in my life though, it was always difficult for me to sleep deeply possibly as a result of being traumatised and abused throughout my childhood and youth, I have to take medication to help me sleep peacefully at night which kind of sucks."
Does he know Tyler Durden?
"Sorry lad, I've got important things to do. We'll speak another time."
I've never heard of Reddit in braille but I guess if I got a braille display and hooked it up to my computer I could possibly read what was on the screen and it'll show up in braille. Problem is that braille displays are expensive and I really only use braille when it comes to reading signs in buildings and things like that.
But women are fine
"So did she, in fact, attempt to come to the wedding and get stopped by the off duty officer? "
"I don‚Äôt recall. They were always flaccid and I didn‚Äôt pay them much attention- they were just there, much like a nose or belly button.

Also, like I‚Äôve mentioned, most of the people I saw were large enough to have pannus to cover their genitals and men and women alike had boobs... so..."
A friend that's okay with being nude with me? Nah.
I dont feel i need to 'wow' her or impress in crazy ways. I plan on being myself and being honest.
To be honest: I have no idea. That‚Äôs a tricky one. On one hand: he knows everything I know. On the other hand: there‚Äôs no way he could possibly acknowledge the fact that I‚Äôm posting this AMA because he doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôs imaginary. So I guess I‚Äôd have to say he doesn‚Äôt know. 
Are you still a practicing nudist?
What are you doing?
No she did not come to the wedding. Although she was telling people she was going to attend. 
That guy is an idiot. Every nude cook I've ever met always wore an apron to keep their bits safe. 
Tips for surviving prison? 
"You definitely have to elaborate on changing national security policies. Is there any way you can describe what happened without identifying yourself?

Have you visited r/JustnoMIL before?
"You're right, what I did was wrong. While doing it i never tried to justify it. I had worked for 16 years before I got ill. This was the first time I had ever relied on benefits. I am now free of cancer and back in work. "
"Right? Cause women don‚Äôt molest children, only in movies like Antwon Fischer. "
"It does not affect relationships because he‚Äôs perfect. I said I fear that it might in the future. I‚Äôve seen plenty of people on a hunt for the absolutely ‚Äúperfect guy‚Äù that matches up with their dream guy. You don‚Äôt need an imaginary friend to have that flawed thinking. You can think that way regardless. I honestly like the way my love life goes. I focus on my career and I date some really great guys. I‚Äôm really not at the point in my life where I want a legitimate relationship. 

Anyway, for the record, I didn‚Äôt come here to be judged or to be told I need help. I came here to answer questions and find someone with a similar experience. Both of which I have done. "
"This was in the 80‚Äôs/early 90‚Äôs.  Yea, same sex partnership were not generally accepted as ok.  Unfortunately I grew up in a bigoted time/family/place. Despite being open-minded enough to be nudists, people were still generally closed-minded. "
"My PTSD developed as a result of being abused at school and in college, it started very young and I was bullied a lot for a lot of things, most people made fun of me for being gay and it kind of hurt because I didn't even know what it was to be gay, I just knew I wasn't sexually atracted to women. But most people made fun of me for my being blind and teachers and professors would yell and scream at me, and one time I had a professor in college who cussed me out and almost made a motion as if they were going to punch me in the face. That's why I don't really get out very often and if I do, I make sure I never go out by myself unless I really truly have to."
So it was Jamie Oliver?
"I feel the same way, but I think that could be due to our exposure to naked people on the regular. For us, clothing can create anticipation and sexiness, where everyone else looks at clothed people all day every day, so seeing someone naked is exciting. "
She is a toxic person who has no filter. She also is a persistent liar. My fiance and I decided not to invite her. 
"It is a societal thing, absolutely. If everyone was generally naked and it was just how it was I doubt anyone would question it much... look at aboriginal cultures who still live mostly nude.

My general perception is that is an equally and personal decision as what you wear. I had both options and generally preferred clothing.  Perhaps if my peers had been naked all along I‚Äôd feel differently, but I‚Äôll never know! "
So were you pretty popular?
"""Yes""

*(Dances)*

""No"""
No this was my full time job (although somedays I could achieve my target in about an hour).  I had a job before and was suffering from a glomus tumour on my ear.  This was causing me to collapse and struggle with balance so had to leave my job. 
"I never actually saw the wounds. Blood was pouring down my face so my vision wasn't all that great, and everything was more or less a blur.

I'm quite grateful for this, actually. Because I would imagine actually seeing the wounds and the results of my actions would have had a much more drastic impact on my mental state than what I actually got from it."
There's no chance a 7 year old would write this.
"Hi there.

I'm not gonna ask you anything, but I'm gonna instead tell you to at least try to get ready for it and ENJOY having a baby. Its the best feeling in the world and they are cute too. 

Once it's born your whole life is changed for the better believe me. 
Come back to this threat 3 months after your kid is born and tell me different.

Give that kid a good childhood, nourish your babies mother and keep your head up to get out of that depression !

It's not the end of the world"
"No, we were in University. There were a balance of day/night shifts. Time was never an issue."
"His personality changes as mine does. He grows with me. I presume that when I was 12, he was probably very childish. Our relationship was more what I thought my life would be like. I mentioned earlier in the thread that I never wanted kids. That‚Äôs not necessarily true. I decided I didn‚Äôt want kids when I was about 14. Which means from age 11-14 Derek and I were either married or engaged, and wanted kids. As I get older and my desires change, our story changes. His childhood was pretty shitty. His parents divorced when he was really young and his mother died when he was 14. His dad is a dick and he doesn‚Äôt talk to him. He has a sister that‚Äôs about 2 years younger than him. He did his best to ‚Äúraise her‚Äù but she fell through the cracks. He doesn‚Äôt talk to her much anymore either. But she shows up sometimes. Her name is Rebecca. "
