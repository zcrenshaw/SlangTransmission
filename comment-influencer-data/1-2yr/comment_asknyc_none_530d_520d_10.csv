"Some train related ideas:

* **It's** ~~sh~~**owtime** - accidentally kicked by performer
* **Open the pod bay doors** - stuck in a stinky subway car with no way out
* **2 Fast 2 Furious** - fail to notice the subway switched to express
* **End of the line** - ride through a subway turnaround point
* **Musical chairs** - win a fight for a subway seat

"Selling a car is about presentation and let me guess you took a few pictures of it parked on the street and wrote something along the lines ""F/S 2007 Honda Accord with 90,000 miles in great condition"" 

thats the wrong way to do it

go wash it, wax it and clean the interior

then take photos of it from every angle, and of the interior

then for description, write a detailed reason why people should buy your car over another

""For sale is my 2007 Honda Accord (SE/DX/LX/EX/EX V6/LX6) with 90,000 miles. Its a Honda, so you know this thing will last you at least another 100,000 miles. It's a 2007, so its the last year of the 7th generation, which means it is the most reliable year to get and it has the mid cycle upgrade which improved its looks and performance. 

* The color is Black...a classic color that looks amazing.
* The color is silver/white/gold...a classic color that has the added benefit of not showing dirt, which means you can go months without washing it and it'll still look mint
* The color is blue/red...a pretty rare color(everyone just gets the black/silver).

Overall a great car, that has all the modern features(power steering/power windows/[all the extra features]) and all the safety improvements. 

I'm selling it for $____ OBO. Which is $1,500 below the KBB value [screenshot of the KBB value]

Won't last long, first come, first serve."""
A positive complaint is a compliment
"JetBlue because they give tall people a little extra leg room, Delta because LGA is the closest airport to my apartment."
"It definitely smells like shit but I also think you need to let go a bit. There are a lot of unpleasant smells in the city (every sewer grate in midtown in the summer, the piss sauna that is the subway, disgusting people eating in the train, etc.) and there isn’t shit we can do about it. It’s nothing new and it has been a part of this city as far as I can remember. 


I remember being very young in little league and wondering wtf the smell wafting from the handball courts was lol. It’s just one of those things people are gonna do, maybe with the popularity of vape and edibles you’ll smell it less in the future. "
"My neighbors cook a lot of pungent Indian food. I don’t like the smell at all, but it doesn’t literally keep me up at night. If it bothers you that much get a diffuser. Living in New York means living in close quarters with other people who make independent decisions that sometimes bleed into your life. It’s just a part of reality here. 

I don’t smoke but my neighbors occasionally do. If I really felt bothered I’d just knock and politely ask them to open their window.

Treat it like any other smell you don’t particularly like. It’s not a danger. Just move on. "

"Ravioli's and sauce and smoked mozerella from Russo's LES.  Right next door, canollis from Vieneros Pastry.  Walk the Brooklyn Bridge and the Williamsburg Bridge. Staten Island Ferry.  Ferry from midtown and/or LIC to Dumbo, then spend some time in Dumbo.  Governor's Island.  The real Little Italy in the Bronx.  The real Chinatown in Flushing. Coney Island.  Sandwich from Sal, Kri, amd Charlie's in Astoria.  Late night drunk pizza from Anna Maria's in Williamsburg (""1 slices or 2?""). Just walk, anywhere, around different boroughs.  PATH or train to Jersey.  Walk the Highline.  Sit and people watch in Times Square.  Get lost in Central Park.  See an off off off Broadway show.  See some improv at UCB.  Just wander and discover."
Do not dispose of stuff that isn’t yours. That’s for the super. They probably already know if they live on site. 
2 Fast 2 Furious is the absolute best name possible for that achievement.  I hate that achievement.

"US spends more on our military/defense than the rest of the world combined - that's a big reason why.

Just so you know - save receipts of medical related expenses (co-pays, medication, insurance premiums, etc) - you might be able to use them as a (partial) deduction on your taxes."

The default mustard in New York is a spicy brown variety but it is not Dijon. Dijon contains white wine and is usually more finely ground than New York style mustard.

"I'd recommend taking the Metro North up to [Beacon, NY](http://escapebrooklyn.com/beacon-ny/). A nice, relaxing town with plenty of restaurants and shops as well as a very cool art museum.

The arts sector of New York City can be pretty passive aggressive honestly. =/
"I think state pride isn't really ubiquitous. There's only a handful of states that really take pride in their identity. In my opinion, it's pretty much just:



* Texas

* Texas

* Texas

* California

* Colorado

* Oregon

After that, any state pride pales in comparison to individual city identity, such as NYC (obviously), Chicago, Miami, LA, SF, Seattle, etc. People tend to identify much more openly with Portland than Massachusetts.

"There is an energy around the West 4th Street subway stop at W3rd and 6th Ave, right next to the basketball courts. It’s magnetic and electric and just fills me with happiness to be in this city.

"Anyone making 120k should be smart enough to use income tax calculators and get a rough idea of this. It’s impossible for anyone to say because we don’t know your debt, what other monthly payments you make, what kind of other deductions are happening to your paycheck or how much you’re putting in your 401k. 

Also, you can get decent places for less than 3k or get roommates and go even cheaper if rental costs are a big concern. "
"**One with Nature**: Have you apartment be afflicted with two or more of the following at once: Mice, Roaches, Bed Bugs, Rats, Birds Nest, Fleas.

**Make Momma Proud**: Give up your seat and help carry a stroller up the steps on the same subway ride.

**The Doppelganger**: Make plans to meet friends at a bar and go to different locations with the same name.

**Just the Tip**: Have every meal for the week delivered. 

**Citizen of the World**: Cancel plans because you can't get across a heritage celebration parade you didn't know about.

"Go on Craigslist and sort by cheapest. Be prepared to share a room with 3-4 people. My first apt in NY was a place with 9 girls total, up to 6 at a time bunked in my room. We were all just trying to get on our feet, none of us had any family support. We rented month to month, $300 each. It wasn't a horrible experience. "
"Sorry about your breakup.

I went through the same thing not too long ago, and know that I say this as someone who swore they'd rather die alone than use a dating app--you have to get over your hangups about dating apps.

I know they can feel at first like they cheapen human interaction and turn dating into a transactional numbers game, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that every one of my friends currently in a relationship is dating someone they met through an app. Bumble ultimately did it for me, but the singles population is big enough here that there are meaningfully different user cultures from app to app, so keep trying them. And if you think the swipe apps are a little too craven, plenty of friends who agree have had luck with OkCupid.

It was helpful for me to stop thinking of the apps as ""dating apps"" but instead as ""introduction apps."" If you get mired in long conversations on Tinder, then yeah, it can feel like the apps were designed to reward a specific kind of wit that not everyone has. If you exchange a few messages, quickly set up a date, and then hold off on talking more until you're face to face, then the apps ultimately aren't that different from the way we've always met people."

Blame Albany. A lot of progressive legislation dies in the state Senate and assembly. It's backroom politics at it's worst.
"I agree completely. It doesn't matter *what* you're smoking: Cigarettes, pot, cigars, vape, whatthefuckever - People enjoying a smoke of anything need to understand that this particular activity pervasively affects those around them in ways that push the ""Your rights end where my rights begin"" boundary to a particularly *wide* radius that can also extend through ventilation systems and small cracks building structures, and furthermore need to understand that the way in which their own body reacts to their smoke may *not* be the same as the way the bodies around them react.  
  
I'm a self-professed pothead. But even I understand that 1) Other people can and will be inhaling my fumes if I don't keep it confined to a particular part of my apartment with the doors in a particular arrangement and 2) Those people may not enjoy my habit in the same way I do, and their bodies might not even react to it in the same way as mine!  
  
A lot of smokers of anything are willing to steamroll and marginalize other's agency in order to justify their own laziness and selfishness. There *are* places in the city where you can get away with respectfully smoking your shit, but you have to be really conscientious and willing to self-crit! Just because you're a good 100 feet away from some family with kids in the park doesn't mean you're doing them a favor. Too many smokers take this kind of criticism personally instead of taking it to heart and understanding that other people have just as much a right to *not* experience smoking as they have a right to smoke, and because of that they marginalize and minimize other people's needs.

Related, I'm actually fighting off a cold this weekend and thus not smoking at all. I work from home and on Friday I actually had to end early because my cold + my neighbor's cigar fumes threw me for such a nauseous loop that I couldn't think straight and felt like vomiting. I had to blast my air filter in my bedroom where it was the worst and lay down in the living room. When I walked into the building lobby yesterday after being outside I noticed that the smell was still lingering everywhere.

Seriously people, don't pretend that other people are crybabies only to justify your quest to toke up. Take their complaints to heart and double the amount of caution they ask for. It's part of the trade-off of enjoying all the amenities a concentrated population can provide. If you think that other people are being over-sensitive, maybe consider that you might be a selfish prick."

Clicking that link will give you options to contact the MTA. Because his contract is negotiated by his union, they can't give him a raise or a bonus. I'm not sure if there's necessarily a merit/demerit system, but they do keep tabs on complaints/commendations on drivers for record purposes. 

At the very least, his supervisors will probably get word and he'll get compliments and kudos from the other staff and boost his reputation or something. I'm sure he'll appreciate it. Just don't write anything that might accidentally get him in trouble  (like making it sound like he might be escalating the situation or something)."

"I've done New New York, All The Live Long Day, Coast Coasting, Air Support, The Tunnels, Island Hopping, We Should Be Moving Shortly.

My ideas -

*Fully Furnished* Ride the IKEA ferry, haul IKEA purchases back from the Red Hook store without owning or borrowing a car, successfully buy and sell furniture on Craigslist without being murdered. 

*Apartment Ace* Rent an apartment all by yourself without having a mental breakdown over your budget and what it buys you, resist the intrusive thoughts telling you to leave NYC for more space.

*Classic Slice* eat a counter slice, mastering ""the fold"" and avoiding any oil stains, while walking on the street in over 20 neighborhoods.

This is fun! I'm going to try and think of some more. "

I’ll save the long winded response and just say: absolutely 0 reason to give a single f*ck about other people’s opinion in this case. Go play some games! (Conversely if you would like somebody to go with you I advise using the NYCmeetup subreddit)
"Pretty much anywhere that does hourly rates at night is going to be of the caliber of hotel where you'd expect hourly business to be happening.  Many hotels offer ""day room"" rates where you don't stay the night, depending when you need those few hours that's an option.  Otherwise, you're going to get exactly what you think you're going to get."
