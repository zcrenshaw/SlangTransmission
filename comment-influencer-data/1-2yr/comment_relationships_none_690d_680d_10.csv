"You have fucked up and I feel that you have questionable morals, but here is how you fix it:

-Change your living arrangements and stay well away from your 'friend'.  
-Tell your girlfriend that you misunderstood her instructions, apologize, and will leave all future threesome planning to her.  Sincerely.
-Send flowers.
-No more drunken calls until you get home and fix things.

It may not be salvagable, but this should improve the odds."

"Not only did she rob him of the chance to digitize the polaroids, but she went on his computer and erased the ones he had digitized. 

Such an awful person.

I am married to a widow. I would NEVER take away his pictures of her. Hell, he even has her ashes at our place. What they had was beautiful. I’m so happy he had a wonderful marriage with her. He deserves all the happiness in the world. And hearing about what a great connection they had was what made me realize what an amazing partner he was going to be.  "

"This is the correct answer.  Say it's not going to work out this time.  Then ghost them.  Sounds like everyone in your friend group is tired of dealing with them.

Honestly if I told someone their dog wasn't allowed in my house, and they had the audacity to suggest that I lock up the cat and that the dog has to stay in my house because it's cold outside, I'd tell them good luck finding a hotel that allows dogs because you're not staying here."

"Thank you for replying. This crossed my mind too as his parents are the type of people who like to take measures to protect their financial security and rightly so. It didn't sound rehearsed though. I understand as parents they want their hard earned money going to their child and their child only, not a wife or ex wife who will piss it all away, so I see where they are coming from, but he should know better than that. "
"&gt;I take antidepressants and my psychiatrist said I should try a little bit of drinking to see how I would react to it because I do like to drink 

You need to find a new psychiatrist. No good psychiatrist would EVER recommend drinking on antidepressants, nor would they tell someone with depression to drink as it's a depressant and can make your symptoms worse. Seriously, this psychiatrist is horrible and unethical.

Your boyfriend is right, being drunk isn't an excuse. Drunk words speak sober thoughts. Take responsibility for your actions, it is your fault you drank and got blackout drunk. 

If you want to save this you have to come clean to your boyfriend. Reach out to him and tell him you need to speak to him about what's been going on in your life. Explain to him that you were diagnosed and on antidepressants. Take responsibility, apologize. If he doesn't accept your apology and still wants to break up with you, you have to accept that, respect his decision and learn from your mistakes. "
Change the locks.  STAT.
"People are awesome at volun-telling others what to do with their life.  You do not have to take it.  In fact, since these people have so little sense of respect for what your needs, goals, and abilities are, feel free to deliberately misunderstand them as flagrantly as they do to you.  ""Wow!  It's amazing that you are so interested in this baby.  Hubs and I can't care for it as I know we've told you several times.  But it is wonderful to hear that your interest is growing.  Sure sounds like you are making plans!  Mom will be delighted when I tell her!  So, where are you going to but the baby's room?  Will you be taking time of work?  Do you think you will get any say in the baby's name?  What colour will you paint the room?  Do you think you will attend some of the pre-natal appointments if the jail allows it?  What's your opinion on swaddling?  Co-sleeping?""  

Time to put these pushy people on the defensive and let them see how it feels.  Be so cheerfully insistent that it sounds like they are taking the baby that they become afraid to even mention the child around you for fear of having to answer dozens of dumb questions."

You shoulda just told this POS that you're actually secretly under age and he is in possession of child pornography.

"Do you have to do anything right now? With most divorced parents they don’t tell kids about a new partner for a while to make sure the relationship itself is steady. I’d see this the same way.

Or is it because if you go on dates others will see you? In which case ... just tell people you want to try to start moving forward and dating. Leave the big reveal on who until you’re a bit more sure of where you want this to go. But equally just prepare for
If you are together and run into someone.

"She didn't do anything wrong by having condoms -- in fact, she did something very right! You should tell her you're proud of her for being responsible and using protection. 

You're in a really tough position, because on one hand not telling her dad might seem as if you're keeping a secret from him, but on the other hand you don't want to violate your stepdaughter's privacy by sharing her personal matters. I would tell your stepdaughter that you'd like for her to bring it up with her father so that your family can have open and honest conversations about safe sex, but that you won't make her do it. "
"Yeah, you should completely cut contact.

Also, consider filing a police report."
"""But I don't think he entirely bought that argument""

I mean what exactly does he believe here? That you're secretly harboring a love of anal sex and lying to him about discovering awhile ago that you didn't like it? Does it somehow make more sense to him that you'd lie and not do a sex act you like with him than that you... know you don't like it?"
"For now, go knock at your door really loudly. Tell them, kind of sleepily, ""Hey, can you guys not do that while I'm here? I'll be leaving at 11 for lunch."" Then go to sleep.

Also, you *can't* have sex while I'm there. I get that long distance and sharing a room sucks, so here's my class schedule. Have at it while I'm *gone*, but not when I'm there.""

If you have any trouble after that, talk to your RA. Get some kind of documentation of the conversation as well (maybe write out a time stamped memory of the conversation in a blog or text to a friend)."
"This is **not normal** OP. Millions of people spend an hour or more commuting to their jobs every morning, it is completely ridiculous to suggest you should quit a job over a very brief stint of 20min commutes - I _wish_ my commute could be that short! 

Be honest - is he often trying to restrict what you can do or when you leave the house, telling you you 'won't cope' or refusing to help? Does he often try to persuade you to quit your job and refuse to listen to you?"

Seriously OP, it’s time for a come-to-jesus talk with yourself. This guy doesn’t contribute money OR labor to the household. That’s called gold-digging. This is NOT a normal or healthy relationship whatsoever. Relationships don’t work when one person gives everything and the other gives nothing. NOTHING. 

I’m sorry, but this is probably not fixable. As frightening as being single is, being in this relationship is worse. Maybe breaking up causes him to get his shit together. Maybe in 10 years you can circle back. For the love of all that is holy, this is NOT even NEAR the best the world has to offer. Love yourself to demand equality inside your relationships. When people say “relationships are hard work” they don’t mean you do ALL of the work. You don’t love who he is, you love the person you created in your mind. 

Love yourself. Leave him. It’s the only way he is going to grow up. "

"I think you may be missing the point of what was suggested.  I can see why, you're quite reasonably upset.  However, the suggestion is to offer a compromise in which you will 1) get a babysitter for a night/weekend 2) enthusiastically help plan an adult-only scary party for anyone she wants to invite.  In return she will 1) take down the decoration ASAP 2) work with you to compromise and come up with *adult-only* appropriate halloween times in the future *before* buying and installing anything.  "
"This would seem the fitting answer. But I am wonder why OP only has 2 options: marry her, or leave her.

If you are in a loving relationship and both of you do not want to end it yet, maybe just focus on your own things for a while? Just agree to not have sex for now and bring it up in a couple of months?"

"As a 24F with straight friends, I’ve encountered many guys like this in the wild.

He’s not warning you to get you to leave or dial it back to friends: if he truly wished to warn you, he wouldn’t keep making out with you. By ‘warning you’ and then making out with you anyway, he’s trying to send a message that you’re Special; that you override his more sensible instincts and that your connection is therefore more intense, more passionate, than anything he has previously known. This lays the groundwork for encouraging you to stick around and put up with things you otherwise would not because you don’t want to forsake this incredible once-in-a-lifetime connection.

I realise this sounds like a lot of extrapolation, but seriously, this is a type. The reason you’re posting here is bc your bullshit meter pinged, and you’re right: the whole ‘tortured soul suffers for his art, has a muse to fix him’ schtick is just that—a schtick. He’s trying to pre-emptively blame you for him being an asshole!! ‘Ohh, I’m going to hurt you later on’ — he is saying this (1) so you think you can ‘fix’ him with your ‘special connection’ that causes him to override his better judgement and (2) so when he DOES hurt you he can turn around and say ‘well, what did you expect?’ 

Run, or at least dial it all the way down to ‘friend from whom I take no bullshit’. This guy sees himself as the protagonist in his novel, and it’s a common theme: so many writers will tell stories about how a tortured male academic bravely finds vitality again by sleeping with a bright grad student, and so on. Parts of our culture accept and narrativise the idea of women as objects of inspiration, of lust, etc: as props to allow men to grow. As TVTropes would have it, you’re his Sexy Lamp. It’s incredibly infuriating because you are a talented artist across multiple media, and you deserve to be more than a narrative device for his manpain: but this is already the slot in which he is trying to place you. 

Yes, he truly believes he is fucked up, but he can’t solve this by simply warning people in advance. He needs to respect people and especially potential partners enough to resolve NOT to hurt them: he has to work on himself, not place that burden on others. "
"Tbf OP says the dads job is very competitive and he has to go where there are jobs. Sounds, at least to me, like his options are “move or have no job” and that’s not really a choice. "
"&gt;You were young, in a male-dominated field, and your female. They are going to think you're flirting with them even if you set them on fire and told him you hated them. 

sad, but true."
"As a landlord myself, I’d definitely want to know if one of my rented rooms smelled to the point other tenants can detect urine and body odor scents as they’re walking down the hall. A homeowner doesn’t want to have to clean up after that and it hurts the ability to rent to and to keep other tenants. 

Report anonymously if you like, but report that you feel Ashley’s room is a hygiene issue. The landlord will likely give her a notice that s/he’s coming over to inspect it. 

If the landlord doesn’t find it to be a problem, unfortunately you’re on your own and will have to decide if it’s a big enough deal for you to move over, but most of us don’t like to have our places trashed by filthy tenants."
Yeah it's over. I'm not sure how good I'll look in the court's eyes as a parent... I have mental health issues that haven't been diagnosed or treated and because of that I don't have a good record with police.. I don't know what things are brought up to the court/ what they care about. I might already be screwed?
"My uncle was a bed wetter his whole life. He simply wore adult diapers. 

Getting a bed wet with urine is bad enough if it happens once. But letting it happen more than once is unconscionable. Especially because there are ways to prevent it. And, do something until it gets handled by a doctor. Bedwetting has treatments now. A bit of googling would help.

My aunt was an awesome lady, you sound very understanding too. No drinking before bed, diapers, bed pad, let him sleep somewhere else, etc. It can be worked out."
"The most likely answer is this. Pregnancy tests are cheap, unwanted pregnancies are terrifying. It is a quick, inexpensive, easy way to reduce anxiety. The average person knows vasectomies occasionally fail, so having familiar symptoms led her to take a pregnancy test just for reassurance. "
"Tell her, and tell her to get a lawyer."
"I would add that if she doesn't want to accept your boundaries around family going forward, that is a deal breaker. What she did can be called 'trying to help'. If she does it again, it's 'meddling'. "
"Living together can make this problem worse.  Seeing each other in passing gets substituted for ""quality time"".  The argument goes, ""But, we see each other every day!"".  It's a very common occurrence.

More to the point, you need to have sound communication with your partner (such as discussing this issue and how it affects you) before you ever consider moving in together."
"If you have *any* doubts about having kids with her right now, then you should absolutely not agree to it; It's too early in the relationship and this is putting unfair pressure on you to come to a serious life-changing decision. If you are not comfortable with it right now then you have to be honest with her. "
That's terrifyingly where I think I'm going to end up. Would i be a monster for considering abortion in this instance? Having a clean break? 
"Your perceive their relationship to be wrong because in your head,  they are both your children and are therefore siblings. The reality is you are not this man's mother and your daughter and him are not siblings. The comment that you take offense to is entirely relevant, but you don't want to hear it. That's why people keep repeating it- because you refuse to address it. There's no point in coming here for advice if you choose to disregard what you don't like to hear. Do you really want to try to overcome these feelings, or did you just come here for validation?
"
"Yeah, I don’t blame you. At all. Was she the one who told you she’d done this?"
"But would you call your partner pathetic and say the people in their daydreams would want nothing to do with them?

I'm going out on a limb to suppose you probably wouldn't."
"This is almost exactly what my mom did too, except she never got any job when me and my siblings were born 27 years or so ago. When my dad died 10 years ago, she literally blew through money and had no job because there was such a gap, and relied(still does) on family handouts and odd jobs. She just got a small ""job"" this year at a flea market and does furniture on commission. 

Rule no. 1, always have a back up and think things through before you commit to having no job! "
"I agree, especially because she knows the dynamic better than anyone else."

"Yes, this is too control your fetish. Not to make it right with her."
Exactly! It's all about me me me for him. He doesn't even respect her boundaries. It's something even a child should understand. 
"Whats your question...?

She's moved on with her WoW boyfriend. It's time for you to move on with your life. Go back to what you were doing, just without her.

Did you need help getting over this situation orrr is there something else?"
"I agree. I don't know how the relationship between him and the daughter could continue without severe strain if he stays with OP.  

Shit, as if they haven't already been through enough, and then this?  "
Okay wow that's an overreaction and a ridiculous assumption to make about the comment you're responding to.
"Your mother had made it clear who her favourite child is, and it isn't you or your sister. Your sister's wedding, she decides. It's up to you if you still want to keep a relationship with your mom and your brother. It sounds like your sister is about done with them. Keep in mind, your brother is incredibly selfish and your mother will keep enabling him."
"So you value your ex more than your gf. You don't even keep what your gf writes! Damn right your gf is posed, if break up with your inconsiderate ass too "
"Holy fucking shit. This sounds like an absolute nightmare. Your wife abuses you so badly that you had to *call the fucking cops?*

Is there anywhere you can go? Anyone you can stay with? You do not deserve this. You are being abused both physically and emotionally. You are being led to financial ruin by your abuser. You do not have to live like this. Please please please get out. I'm so so so sorry you are going through this. This is a choice she is making, it's not a disease, it's *her,* it's *who she is.*

You need a divorce lawyer. You need to gather up your things that you care about--especially your identifying documents like birth certificate, passport, social security card--and get the fuck out and talk to a divorce lawyer. You need to tell friends and family what's going on, that you wife is *horrifyingly abusive.* You need to block her, her family, everyone--you do not take their calls, you do not take their texts, you do not take their messages, all communication goes through your divorce lawyer. Never contact her again. It doesn't matter that you love her; she is trying to destroy you and right now she is succeeding. Please, please get out."
"Yeah, I came in here to say this. Dump the boyfriend, and AirBNB should IMMEDIATELY cover ALL of your expenses (hotel and the stuff you had to leave at the guy's house) and block the guy from their platform. They do not want this kind of press, especially not in this media environment."
"Look, I empathise with your predicament, but here's the thing.

You seem to be truly disgusted with your grandfather's affair, but not enough to not want him walk you down the aisle. 

You can't really have it both ways. You want to keep Annie out of your wedding because she ""represents adultery"", even though your grandfather is the one who is cheating on his wife of 50 years. How come Annie gets your disgust, but your grandfather gets a position of privilege in your ceremony? Not inviting Annie to your wedding isn't going to make your grandfather NOT an adulterer.

You have two choices. Either do what the rest of your family is doing and turn a blind eye to his adultery, because you love him and you're super close with him and you want him to be the one to walk you down the aisle. If that means he skips out on the reception, so be it. You can't control his choices.

Or, if you resent him so much for having so little respect for family, don't bother asking him to walk you down the aisle. 

&gt; how can he do this to me?

This actually isn't about you.

He's been with Annie for 20+ *years*. That's longer than most marriages, and almost as long as your life. It sounds like your grandfather is upset at your for ignoring a relationship he's had for 20+ years. 

Is your grandmother truly upset with the arrangement? Is she so passive that she's been letting this woman eat at her table for 20-odd years and hasn't said a word? Are you sure this isn't some kind of consensual arrangement that she has with your grandfather? 

Otherwise, if it is as you said, that your grandfather has been forcing your grandmother to have dinner with his mistress every single night for two decades, I find it hard to understand why you want to sweep that under the rug for the sake of your wedding.


"
What on earth do you expect him to call the room? My god. 
You did the right thing. He could have given her STDs. His mistake wasn't 'talking to you on Tinder'. His mistake was even being ON Tinder. He's a serial cheater whose girlfriend needed to know.
She's still his side chick.
"Something for you to consider:
My parents had a disfunctional transactional relationship. They never had a conversation, ever. It was only about family transactions, like what you describe. I thought this was normal, that this was what a marriage and a relationship was. So when I grew up I wound up in a horrible marriage, because I thought that was normal.  I was miserable but I stayed together ""for the sake of the children"", counting the years in my prison left til they left for college. Until I my son started playing little league and I saw all these happy loving couples and happy loving families. And I realized, I was doing the same think to my own children.  They saw my marriage and thought that was ""normal"", and I realized I was dooming them to the same disfunctional type of relationship. It hit me like a thunderbolt. I was out of there in a few months.  I realized, for my children to grow up and be able to have normal happy adult relationships, they needed to see it modeled by their parents. They needed to see me happy, in a loving relationship. And I am now with an incredible man, even after 4 years we are still in the 'glow' of the honeymoon phase. And my children see me happy and see what relationshp happiness is, and I believe they now have a chance at it for themselves.

My cousin recently tracked down the divorce records of my great-grandmother from 1928. The court recorded recorded her own words, how she described how she stayed with a man who beat her regularly, finally cutting her face with glass (hence the divorce) ""for the sake of the children"".  I hate that fucking phrase 'for the sake of the children'.  It trapped me, it trapped my lovely gentle great-grandmother.  It's a big lie, it's not best for them to be in an abusive home, or like you and me, a cold home."
"My bf as well has long hair and loves having it braided. If friends or acquaintances want to braid it, I have no issue. He's let both our female and male friends braid his hair. Its fun. But strangers braiding it is really weird, I dont want strangers touching me or my friends in any way shape or form.
However, as a man, he may not find it weird or creepy to be approached by strangers the way women do.
On the other side, its kind of like kids braiding each others hair. But its just weirder to do it as an adult than as a kid."
"And i guarantee if he worked fewer hours she'd be having the affair because ""he just doesn't pull his weight in the relationship"" or some such."

Really? No man. Just no."
"I know one such couple, actually, and it's possible that I know others but just don't know about it.  I think they've been together 6 years now?  It's not like I usually ask my friends about their parents, so unless it came up as a relevant topic in conversation how would I even know?  For them it wasn't a big deal when it came up, and nobody was bothered by it. "
Sorry but your husband is completely evil. I can’t believe he didn’t give a shit that you were in danger. That he didn’t give a shit that his sister in law could have died. This isn’t the man for you. You have strong morals and you care about those around you. Your husband doesn’t give a fuck about your safety. 
"It sounds like your mother is in a place right now where it is “all about her” and her journey, and isn’t acknowledging the pain she put you through. I wonder if she’s even made the connection that the supportive, validating response she’s hoping for from other people (including from you!) is the very response that she denied you when you were in the same situation. Not only did she deny it to you herself, but she actively prevented you from getting that support from other people. And now your dad is her “best friend” and everybody in the family is rallying around her...where were they when you needed them to rally around you?

I wonder if it would be more feasible for you to forgive her if she—and other members of the family—acknowledged the hurt they put you through. But frankly, I wouldn’t hold my breath. Sometimes you never get the validation you need from the people you love.

Others have suggested therapy, and I agree with that recommendation, because it sounds like you need support that you are unlikely to get from your family. This is a really big thing. It’s not just being annoyed with your mother, it’s really accepting something incredibly hard to accept: that you can’t count on your family like you thought. Or, maybe they’ll see the light and apologize for what they put you through.

In any case, your being hurt and angry makes complete sense to me, and you have every right to focus on YOUR journey and healing here, and put that journey before your mother’s.

Good luck. I’m sorry they treated you that way."
"A childhood friend of mine’s parents had dogs Sophie and Gus. He now has kids including Sophie and Gus.

"I would also head over to r/legaladvice. This harassment started, presumably, when you were a minor...? Wouldn't sending porn, depending on your local laws be considered contributing to the delinquency of a minor?

You made a threat to go to the police or a lawyer so follow through on it. 

Don't post those pics or videos as some kind of revenge anywhere, that could get you in serious legal trouble. "

"He's your cat. 
This sounds more likely you feel guilt over her mental health issues than anything else.
You broke up 2 years ago she is not your responsibility.

She has concerns about having him in her new home.
Also she has no job therefore she is possibly not financially stable enough to afford unexpected vet costs. 

Keep your cat dude and tell her to get some help. "
"Borderline emotionally abusive/manipulative, yes.

Snooping is wrong and crossing boundaries, you shouldn't be doing it. 

How did you confront her? Was it out of anger? Did you confront her like an adult, in a healthy way, openly communicate with her vs accusing her of talking behind your back?

Maybe she doesn't feel comfortable telling you how she feels about your relationship/parenting out of fear of how you'll react and just needed to vent to a friend to let it out. 

I suggest you get into therapy ASAP. Work on yourself, work on this paranoia, your insecurities, learn how to change your thoughts and behavior and cope in a healthy way if you want to save this relationship. "
"You don't care more. You trust less. The second half of your post doesn't sound like you have your mental health under control. Please get professional help just to be on the safe side. As you said, you have a kid now. Your boy needs you to be healthy."
"Yeah I think in writing this, I am realizing I am still thinking from his perspective. Like, what can I do to make him less angry so he doesn't hurt her more, what can she do to make him not hit her, what can she do to calm him down. It's so fucked up :( It's just ingrained in me and it's automatic to think that way.

At this point, I don't think he would be hitting her on a regular basis (just based on what I remember in my own case) but this would be the start of it. It worries me a lot."
"I totally feel the dog-hating roomie here, I too have a strong dislike for dogs for a multiple of reasons - was bitten as a child; my sleep's very sensitive and I wake up from the tiniest sound; I can't concentrate when there isn't complete silence; I'm afraid and they sense my dislike and in turn, pretty much all growl at me, even though ""oh, my dog *never* does that!"" Yeah, I've heard that one before, dog owner #394...  I would never feel safe with a dog in my home and I think it would be terribly unfair to force that roomie to be in a house with a dog. 

I probably would also have lied about this with young 20, because in my experience, peer pressure about liking dog is very, very strong, and it's seen as very bad if you don't like dogs. For some people you are automatically a bad person if you don't like dogs, so that's perhaps why she lied.

Can the anxious roomie get some other support animal? Can you four get a cat together? I think if it may go into all the rooms, your apartment should be big enough to house one, and there'd probably always be someone to take care of it. Maybe mice or rats? They make nice and easy pets, with low effort (compared to other gerbil-sized animals) except for proofing the rooms. Or if she can go higher effort, a fish or a beginner reptile? Although there are some ""cuddly"" reptiles out there, fish would probably not be that good because no skin contact, I suppose... "
"Oh, OP, I am so, so, so, so *so* sorry.

Do you trust your parents? If so, tell them. Please.

It's a seller's market. It might be easiest to sell the house and split the money 50/50. That would help you get on your feet. You can push for that. 
If this is real... how did your aunt and uncle condition their entire workforce not to call police when seeing an 8 year old and diapered 5 year old getting drunk? 
"No man, she didn't abandon the cat she just couldn't afford to take care of it back then. Which is something understandable. However, its been 2 years and the ex is not doing too well at the moment either. We must remember that animals are not playthings and neither are they objects that we can easily displace as and when we 'need' them. Especially cats! That cat is gonna be bummed if its moved. It doesn't matter that the lady and OP co-owned it 2 years ago. Cats forget. Even if she's not forgotten the ex, the move would be traumatic for the cat. 

OP, please think of other ways to comfort your ex. You cannot give up your cat. "
"He already has, OP just hasn't realised yet."
Did you push him on this? Why does he think you won't be ok? What is he specifically worried about?
"Definitely get your kids of it, especially if they're eating at the daycare.  As I'm sure you know the keto diet is based around eating virtually no carbs and high amounts of fat in order to burn your own body fat for energy.  This is done by entering what's called ketosis, which is a metabolic state you get by eating very little carbs.  The problem here is that if your kids eat standard daycare food once a day, they're never going to enter ketosis.  So they're going to have bodies set up to burn carbs for energy while constantly eating a high fat low carb diet.  The end result will be weight gain while constantly feeling tired and hungry."
"Too many words. You already sound like a bad ass. Just say “It seems like you have a problem with my choices. Why don’t you call me back when you feel able to enjoy my company.” And then wait. Don’t be mad or pouty, just be calmly unapologetic. You don’t get involved in their relationship they need to stay out of yours"
"I'm not so sure this is petty, more like a red flag honestly.  Why does he need to ask her about her acting career?  Why is he digging to see if she has even MORE social media when he's already added her on several platforms?  Seems he wants to see as much of her as he can and is looking for excuses to talk to her.

I'd be bothered, and I think would ask more probing questions."
"Exactly. It makes sense to be bummed, to be frustrated, to groan loudly and say ""ugh, this suuuucckkks""... And then you get over it and move on. "
"I had the same while suffering with extreme complex PTSD.  Our minds have a way of blocking/stuffing down traumatic experiences as a method of self-protection, but they always come back up, with nightmares, flashbacks and other issues.  Such is life with PTSD.

I would suggest looking up EMDR therapy for her.  It's the only thing that has helped me - reassurances, meditation, mindfulness, planning out responses etc. haven't helped.  EMDR has really helped me, and I hope it can for her too.

Don't minimize her feelings or deny it.  She needs you to be understanding and supportive.  Ask her to Google ""PTSD self-test"" and see how she scores.  The results will be very eye-opening, guaranteed."
"Who said it was acceptable? I said it was a normal reaction.

Annoy the shit out of somebody for hours straight, everyday for as long as you can. Lets see how long they remain calm. Oh, they had a breaking point? No shit.

You'd be braindead to think they'd be able to keep their calm forever."
"Cons: He's unemployed and homeless. Not your problems to fix. I'm sure you can find someone who has a job and a place to stay.

Pros: After your dates you can drop him off anywhere."
"As someone with ADHD I have a hard time letting this one go. People who don’t need Adderall don’t respond well to it’s regular use. And, people who do this shit are the reason my drugs are so hard to get. Pharmacies lie to me about not having the pills until they call the doctor on the scrip and confirm I didn’t forge it. In a new town I have to bounce around three or four different pharmacies before I get one that doesn’t pretend they’re out. "
"It’s weird when things are so obvious, but: you’re the guy she thinks she should love, but doesn’t. I  mean your post is insanely analytical, almost like a legal document. You are the stability she wishes she wanted, when in reality she never got over (and never wanted to get over) her crazy ex and people like him.

You were her cover for a long time, her way of lying to herself and her way of keeping her ex at a certain distance while still having him in her life. That’s not working anymore, and her cover is finally blown.

You seem like a very smart and thoughtful guy — if divorce happens, you can find someone who appreciates that."
"Your sister has made so many bad choices that there is zero percent chance that anything you say to her will change her behavior.

The real issue is you and your conscience--how much will you respect yourself if you just let her behavior go. That's your own decision to make.  Don't make the decision based on what will make your sister happiest. Her unhappiness is of her own making, and you cannot and should not try to shield her from that. Make the decision based on what will be best for your nephew, your parents, and yourself. Help the people who can actually be helped."

"The moment someone says, ""don't make me..."" or ""you are forcing me"", they are refusing responsibility for their actions. They transfer the blame to you. 

The moment you heard that phrase. You were done reasoning with him.

I thought so too. I really needed some outside opinions. I have a tendency to overthink and wanted to make sure I was being rational before I bring this up. 
"It's not his brother that he's devoted to, it's definitely his mother. She just got off the phone with me and he is parroting what she's spewing out."
"So have you up brought up his sexuality? Do you really want to work on a marriage only to be constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop? I'd say therapy for him and for him alone, then couples if he takes to it. You don't want to waste anymore time than you already have only for him to tell you one day he's coming out and you should be happy for him. That's where I see this heading. 

Also, a 16yr old? Your friends suck."
"If you're at the end of your rope, you need to drop the rope.  Stop trying.  You aren't responsible for her emotions, stress, or anything else.  "
"&gt;Now I am afraid he will never come here again unless I don't let my sister come by! How can I solve this?

Sounds like you have 2 options- either invite them at different times and see them separately, or pick sides. 

Considering your sister is instigating all this crap, I can't really blame your son if you aren't willing to put your foot down."
"Wow. OP, this woman is a terrible person. She clearly only cares about herself. Please, don't stay married to someone like that, it'll just make you miserable."
"you weren't WRONG in this situation, but pro tip for the future: don't tell your friends about your fights with your GF. It gives them the wrong idea of your relationship and they're very likely to act unfriendly towards her, making your problems worse. "
"Explain that there was a miscommunication.  Apologize, and promise to always look at the roster.  It's hard, but I'd flat out say something like ""I really want to work here and I'm so sorry I screwed up right away.""

I might have just been burned too many times, but this is a bad sign.  It seems like there's not much communication between managers and the business doesn't lay out expectations.  If other things like this happen, start looking for another job."
"Is she still telling you to 'Lighten up babe'? Is she still saying you're unreasonable?? Is she telling you to get over it already? Or has she shown genuine remorse and an understanding of why this was truly hurtful...  your answer to this should determine your next steps.

That was a horrible joke to play and wasn't funny at all.  She was going to laugh at your shock and upset and hurt emotions. She was going to make a joke of your honesty and in a sense, your fidelity. What was so funny about this trick??

At 24 and 2 years in, I would say you should consider breaking up and finding someone more mature.  But that's me, I find pranks very unfunny.  

I would suggest that you both sit down and have a deep talk about this, see if there's any way for you to get  past this...

It's possible to be a good person and a shitty pet owner.  If this matters to you then you need to have a serious conversation with him about it. Like he is out of the dog business period and this one goes somewhere else.
"This whole thing has helped so much. 

He has always been a bit of a bulldozer. 

I will continue to make sure the puppy isn't neglected until I can get a solid plan, and then rehome him when I know all three of us are safe. 

Someone mentioned that the most dangerous day is the day I leave; but I think the second most dangerous day is the day I rehome the puppy. I will need to do it in unison to ensure everyone is safe. "
" **but she just came home in tears because they had another fight she says that I'm making her see him and that she doesn't want to**

Please do not force a relationship between your daughter and her dad. You may think it is the ""right"" thing to do, but she is old enough to know what relationships she wants in her life and ones that she doesn't. 

I'm so so sorry that you are going through all of this OP. Life has thrown you some major obstacles and you keep overcoming them! You sound like you have so much to offer and won't let anything stop you. Your ExSO sounds like a real piece of shit. You are not worthless, you are special, and you deserve to be loved and respected. I know it is very hard right now, but him leaving was a HUGE blessing in disguise. 

I wish I could offer more advice, just know an internet stranger is thinking of you and your family and wishing you well. &gt;hugs"
It's four days.  You are being needy.
I'm sorry but not initiating sex is such a small issue if you're frequently having sex anyway.  Your husband has no standing here.  Here's created an issue from nearly nothing and had a week long tantrum.  Now he's willing to divorce over it?  Wtf.
"Being the HIGH QUALITY man that you are, surely you realize what doing the same thing and expecting different results is?  As Einstein (another HIGH QUALITY man) put it, it is the definition of insanity.

Change the way you meet women.  Being HIGH QUALITY and owning $house, $car*2 and having ample spare monies due to no clubbing or drugs, perhaps you could avail yourself of one of those dating services that get professional, HIGH QUALITY, commitment-oriented men and women together for dates.  I know of several people in real life who have had good success there.

Research adult attachment styles to learn more about how you psychologically tend to relate to other people.  To me you seem like the textbook definition of dismissive-avoidant, but I am not an expert.  Do some reading, find out if anything resonates, then take steps to manage that behavior rather than have it manage you."
"You said yourself that you ""were/ am not"" interested in fixing the bond.  OK!  You got what you wanted!  Excellent!  What's the issue?"
"Tell his wife asap. I would also be rethinking my marriage. Your husband didn't just turn a blind eye to his friend cheating, he actively supported and helped him. That seems to indicate that he doesn't think cheating is a bad thing, and I'm sure his friend will have his back if he eventually decides to cheat. At the very least, you urgently need couples counseling."
"Your entire problem comes down to being so passive you only ever ""hint"" things and never just be direct.

Tell him you arent interested, never will be, and want him to leave you alone, then block him on facebook, block his number etc."
"She sounds fucking insane, dude. "
"I just wanted to offer my input, as I've been in this exact situation.

You are absolutely pushing your boundaries. If you are so sick you can't even move, you should be in emergency.

Someone has asked you to leave their house and you have straight up refused. You deny this, but your bickering and resistance is a refusal. You look desperate, clingy and you need to understand boundaries. Not everything is going to be about doting/accommodating you.

You should apologize to your boyfriend when he returns. He seems like a decent, patient guy... To be dealing with this behaviour only a few months in. 

Why are you even interested in protesting when he clearly doesn't want you there? Leave. "
"I know where you're coming from. These other commenters are assuming you just want to ruin your father's life, but what it really is, I am assuming, is you're an only child and you know you have siblings and most of your friends have siblings and you want to know what that's like. You also don't want to hurt your siblings that you've been robbed of, kinda.


When I was nineteen and pregnant, I somehow found out I had a half sister 11 years older than me. I also know some man married her mother and signed her birth certificate and she knows nothing about my father. I have not searched for her. I'm worried she had a wonderful life and I don't wanna be all ""Yeah the guy they said was your dad isn't, and my crappy dad is! Yay"" so I just don't look. Your situation is different, and you have to decide what you wanna do and the risks you're willing to take. I just wanted you to know that someone understands it's not about the sperm donor. It's about the possibility of siblings, or the curiosity of if y'all look alike or act alike. I wish you the best!"
"Honestly, I could see her going to a strip club as something that caused a fight, but I don't think most would consider this cheating.


Groping someone else, allowing someone else to grope her, and kissing someone else are cheating. It doesn't matter if this guy was a stripper, prostitute, or mailman.


I'd be annoyed if I had a partner who went to a strip club without first discussing it with me, but it would be pretty easy to work through and get past. Kissing, touching, and being touched by someone else? Absolutely a deal breaker in my book."
"Do you have anything in writing over text or anything? If so, you should go to the police, otherwise I would message her saying what he told you and emphasize that you're just afraid for her safety and thought you'd want to know in her situation. "
"I think you need to have a serious talk. I know it feels petty to do it over laughter, which is probably why you haven't been able to address it in a serious manner, but this is a serious lack of communication and potentially very hurtful. Just tell him what you told us here."
"Do not give these people your car. This kind of decision making will be behind the wheel of your car and you know they won't treat it differently just because it isnt theirs. They already feel the level of entitlement to it that they are confident they won't need to fix their car or get a new one because they have a back up now. The more you reveal about how they treat this kind of stuff, the more firmly my mind screams ""NO DONT DO IT"". We're getting to horror movie and the blonde wants to answer the door levels."
"Honestly: RUN. Run away! 
I was in a long-term serious relationship and my boyfriends family were horrible towards me. He never had the balls to stand up to them, they would sooner die than ever apologize, and if I wanted to suffer I could have stayed in that relationship forever. 
However, after breaking up with him, I have met my current boyfriend and his family are the most wonderful people. I feel so lucky now.
Really think hard if this is the dynamic you want to spend the rest of your life in. It will probably result in you resenting him..."
"Indeed, I was being figurative/exaggerated for effect! :-)"
"I think that's unfair. I'm a person that loves and needs a lot of physical attention from their partner. Perhaps not to the extent that OP is describing here, but snuggling, hugging, lots of physical affection.....those are all things I like lots of. He's probably pushing it because his needs are not being met, and he's (unwisely) doubling down on his efforts out of desperation. I don't think they're compatible, and I really hope OP doesn't marry this guy, because I don't see it ending well. At all. "
"Yeah, I would get out of there quick. If he's willing do do these things to a dog, imagine what he'll do to you and a kid. My dad actually did something similar, which may be where your husband is going to end up. My dad trapped my mom by taking control of the finances, not allowing friends over, and not allowing her to work in order to ""take care of the kids and the dogs"". He isolated her and used her to his own benefit "
"Your sister is a horrible person, sorry.

If you have proof absolutely show your future BIL before he makes a huge mistake. Did she also get pregnant on purpose to have a ""trap"" baby tonbe assured to collect child support? She sounds like a typical ""dependa"" - disgusting. 

Your sister saying you don't understand because your a lesbian is disgusting as well. Please don't let her disgusting comments effect you. "
Do *not* hint about needing money. They'll offer to loan you money and then you'll be expected to take the baby. You're backing yourself into into a corner with that one.
"In all honesty, I kind of think he is *more* guilty of endangering the kids than she is.

Yes, she's making absolutely shit-show choices, but she is, to some degree, not of sound mind. She's a bipolar drug addict.

He, however, is presumably sober &amp; sane when he *leaves his children alone with a bipolar meth addict for **days at a time***

How he can possibly justify that to himself is beyond me."
"Even if not the end of the marriage, any even polite or civil relationship with the daughter is now gone, kaput, FUBAR forever. As someone else said, she's the evil stepmother. So even if the husband maybe just about wants to work on things, the eternal seething resentment of his daughter towards his wife is going to cause serious damage to their fragile relationship. "
Can we see a picture?
"Bullshit. OP's husband can ""follow the bro code"" all the way out the door."
"Then maybe those people shouldn't be engaging in that kind of banter at all then? Better be able to take it if you're dishing it out.

The whole point of playful roasting is to allow people to indirectly confront vulnerabilities in themselves and others by making light of them. Highlighting them and lessening their importance. Humor is what allows us to the bridge the space between ourselves and others. 

There's a huuuuuge difference between cruel, cutting jabs and lighthearted ribbing. The friend's girlfriend's comment was so tame that I can't believe anyone would be offended by it...even if she was being serious. Sounds to me though like she was trying to fit in, but because she's not comfortable with the group her delivery was off. If it lacked the proper inflection and cadence required and it came across much less playful than I'm sure she intended. "
"If my sister doesn't apologize or acknowledge that what she did was wrong, then yeah I am ready to lose contact with her. What she accused my wife of is just not justified on any context"
"&gt; she sees me as a friend, not a romantic partner

&gt; I'm decent looking, make decent money, decent personality, decent at sex. Basically, I'm like 7.5/10, while she's definitely an 8.5/10.

So what is it about your relationship that makes you more than ""Roommates with benefits""?

&gt; She literally spent 3 months of her salary on my birthday surprise a month ago. 

Maybe that's what she's missing from the relationship? Big romantic gestures? I'm not saying spend all of your income on gifts for her, but maybe what she's missing is romance. You're not a mind reader, but maybe she can't quite identify the real issue."
"This is true.  Also, the visiting guy had other plans for his accommodation until today.  He can revert to whatever he was initially planning to do.  "
"Yikes. I can understand how you're feeling, definitely. This is just a really hard situation all around. film funding is so hit or miss that I can understand if she truly *had* to go; but at the same time, I *completely* understand that you **don't want to fucking hear about it right now**. 

Can you say something like this to her: ""I understand that you had to miss my mother's funeral or risk the documentary not getting made at all 

(I sincerely hope this is true by the way, otherwise her missing this is pretty horrible) 

but every time we talk about the film, I just feel angry that it took you away at such a difficult time. I also understand how big this project is for you and how much you want to talk about it, but it's really hard for me to hear about right now."""

"Be real with the kid.  Kids understand a lot more than you give them credit for.    

I'd go like this: ""I had a little seed in my tummy that could grow into a baby.  I am not ready to be a mommy right now, though, so I had to go to the doctor to get that seed taken out.  That's called an abortion.  It hurts a little bit when the doctor takes the seed out, so I'm not feeling very good right now, but I'll feel better soon.""

That's really all it takes; you don't need to get into more details than that.  "

"I’m not saying you’re not a good mother; I’m saying you should consider how you react to big news. Maybe it is an issue, maybe it’s not. 

Not trying to be snarky, but you’re clearly itching for a fight in how you’re deliberately misreading some comments, including mine. Journal, talk to a therapist, go to a kickboxing class ... get it out of your system in some way. But not many see your POV on this ... you do need to find some way to swallow whatever feelings of ickiness or anger you may have. I know a few people from broken households who dated (and even married) step siblings or cousins. It’s not uncommon. Again, this is a “you” problem. Good luck with things. "
"What if the coffee had been hot? Or fresh out of the pot? What is he has a weapon? Not a gun or anything, just a bottle or a knife or a belt. How good is your training? How wiling are you to inflict serious injury on another person? How willing are you to accept the possibility of serious injury or death yourself? Because that is what violence is. It is the willingness to inflict harm on another human being, often at terrible cost to yourself. 

I grew up watching my mum be beaten by her then partner. In fighting terms, she had reach, height, weight. In actual terms, she got multiple beatings from a short, fat, angry man. "
People have been giving you pretty solid advice so I'll just add this - does your husband know where you SIL is? Because if he does she is almost certainly not safe.  She will need to find a new place to live if he knows where she lives. 
"&gt;My husband has some anxiety, and I love him and respect him and would never throw that in his face during an argument. That alone would make me call it for OP's relationship.

This. So much.

When you truly respect each other, he would not cross this line of decency."
"Just say the first part to him

""To my parents, bringing you would mean we are essentially engaged. It's too soon"""
I’m very sorry for what your mom put your through. Have you considered seeing a therapist to talk these things out? This question seems above the pay grade of the average redditor honestly. 
"It is his body. It is his choice. He shares a life with you but you cannot force him to wait for something like this.

If you were looking at sterilization and he was telling you that you HAD to wait for his feelings I think it’d be different. Make your peace but stop trying to control his body."
"But it's not your house; it's an apartment that you are renting from your landlord, while knowingly breaking the rules of the landlord.  (Kind of ironic that you're hung on him breaking rules when you are doing the same thing.)  Sounds like he was in a tight position and was needing to find a solution asap, but now that he's living with you, those rules became reality and he's not agreeing with them now that he knows the full extent.  That shit happens.  It's easy to agree to something when you're desperate and not fully aware of how things can play out regarding rules.  Be adults, have a civil conversation about autonomy and financial obligations, and reach a mutual decision. "
"You can probably identify a few things in play. Among them are social awareness and impulse control. Social awareness as in picking up the cues when people become uncomfortable at the level of banter. Impulse control in that your default mode is to quip or crack a joke. You can have a sense of humor without that being a 24/7 thing. I'm ignorant as to the specific methods involved, but if you can train both that awareness and self control somewhat, you're off to a flying start."
"If a couple’s personal rule is that oral isn’t cheating as long as whatever boundaries there are have been well defined, there’s no reason to be rude and insult them. Their monogomy borders are just looser than yours. "
This marriage sounds like a massive dumpster fire. No offense. 
Reply with photos of the bald spots and scratches.
"&gt; then that's something they'll notice.

Not quite as memorable as OP talking about who she wouldn't fuck though, right? 

Not drinking is entirely acceptable. Anyone who says otherwise is asking you to approve of their drinking behavior and that isn't a good or professional work dynamic, is it?"
"You are making the right decision to end this ""friendship.""

She wasn't a good friend to you and didn't respect your choices.  She's a poor employee and it is a really good idea for you to sharply limit the time you spend with her at work.

First, quit texting and calling her altogether.  Never initiate contact.  If she contacts you, keep your responses light and brief.

You have to change the dynamic for the lunch break.  Rather than sit with her and get annoyed, spend ten minutes eating, then use the other twenty minutes to take a brisk walk.  Or eat at a different time.  Or begin using that time to put on headphones and learn a new language, listen to podcasts or music, or take an audio class.

It may help to think of this not as ""I'm getting away from Emma"" but ""I'm getting some exercise"" or ""I'm learning to speak Spanish.""

You don't have to explain yourself or justify your actions to Emma, but telling her you are using your lunchtime to improve yourself is fine. If she tries to undermine you or make fun of you, that's all the more reason to carry on with your self-improvement plan.

"His whole family is big drinkers, he grew up around it and his sisters currently lost her license and went to jail for repeatedly doing it. He just feels he wouldnt get caught. But to pacify me he made the alternative idea, that hed just stay at friends houses and drink there, still effectively getting some freedom and time away but with my worries in mind. "
My ex husband thought this was normal. It's pretty much a big part of why we got divorced.
"I don't like to be friends with idiots, so if I were you I'd just...ghost away."
Your bf is a big turd. 
"It sounds to me like, for whatever reason, while you were growing up, you got stuck in a ""rut"" being being funny (in your view) as a default response and you've probably never really learned how to have a serious conversation. 

Now, there may be some deeper reason for this. One of my sons used to be like this, because his role in his bio-mother's family was to be ""the funny one"" and he really didn't have a sense of his own identity, for a while there, without it. So if you feel uneasy in trying to be different, consider whether there might be some deeper reason like that and spend some time with a counsellor to work it through.

But it might be nothing as deep as that. We all have crutches for dealing with things we don't know how to handle, and maybe this is yours and it really doesn't go any deeper than that. In that case you can simply tackle it as a practical problem - a habit/tendency you need to write over.

The first thing is to make sure you *really* understand why this is a problem. You acknowledge that it is a problem, that your fiancee was right, and that you know that because many people you love and trust to have your best interests at heart have told you so in the aftermath. (You're to be commended for that, by the way. It is a difficult thing to give way on how you see things when people who care for you call you out). But you haven't really made clear whether you really understand why everyone has a problem with it.

To take the two examples - your fiancee and the bank officer - you need to look at discussions from their perspective. Someone telling their partner about a problem at work is generally looking for sympathy, emotional support, *possibly* advice (but not always), validation that they're right to feel crappy about this. If they get some or all of those things, they will feel supported, nurtured, and loved. Joking doesn't achieve this. It leaves your partner feeling alone. (It would sometimes be fine to make *one* wisecrack - that can create a sense of affinity. But you would need to then say, ""But seriously, it sounds like..."" and get back onto the main vein of the discussion. Same goes for the bank officer, who is just trying to write a loan, and possibly answer some quite technical questions for your fiancee. S/he probably also has to give legal disclosures and get them right. The purpose of the discussion is serious business - building a life, and probably the biggest debt you will ever take on. Again, joking isn't productive in achieving any of those things.

The biggest thing that will help you here is having a mental attitude of being, in a conversation, what the other person needs you to be. I mean, you don't want to be slavish about that - ultimately a conversation should be positive and productive for you both. But for the initial attitude shift, that's how I'd go about it. Then, once that feels normal, you can start to think about what you need in communication and start to introduce that.

As a practical matter, there will be difficulties. If you're not used to maintaining ""real"" conversations (I don't even mean deep and meaningful ones necessarily) there are skills to learn. One is learning how to answer when you don't know what to say, especially in the context of emotional content. You need a toolbox of get-out-of-paralysis phrases. You'll never go too far wrong saying, ""I'm sorry to hear that,"" or, ""I don't feel like I have anything very useful to say here, but that sounds really difficult. I hope it works out okay."" Another is learning to maintain a conversation by asking questions. You don't want to interrogate, but learning to ask gentle open questions that extend what a person is talking about helps them to feel listened to. Things like, ""How did you get interested in that?"" are helpful. Sometimes a conversation will be stalling and you need to shift topic. You can often do that without seeming to cut them off with something like, ""Hey, this is off topic a bit, but I thought of you the other day because I saw this thing online about [other thing they're interested in]."" But these are skills that can be learned. They may never feel 100% natural - I am quite introverted and have to work at this - but they can become part of how you operate."
"&gt; John mentioned to me a few weeks ago that there was an internship available next spring at the company he works for.

Was this the extent of it? If so, then he didn't offer you the position. He just mentioned it. Did you ever have an interview with them?

As to their relationship, even if there is some sort of crush on his end I don't think there's really anything to be done. Unless you think he's actually going to take advantage of her, you just need to trust her to set appropriate boundaries.

I think you need to resolve this within yourself. Making it Kate's problem when she hasn't done anything wrong isn't fair to her and will sour the start of her new job. I'm sure she's more attuned than you are to potentially inappropriate advances because that happens to women all the time, and you bringing it up isn't going to do anything but make you seem envious of her new position and jealous regarding his behavior, which again is not her fault or something she can control."

"I’m not sure it’s a good idea for you to broach the subject unless she comes to you first for advice or something.

"...Does she really not know how short modeling careers are? Has she never watched America's Next Top Model? They're always going on about the short career life and the importance of branching out, either by working on your brand or learning more behind the scenes stuff. It's superr unrealistic to think she'll continue to model for much longer. She might just not want to accept getting old."
"Well if you don’t see yourself getting back together with her and you’re trying to get over her, I’d suggest not talking to her anymore. I don’t know if you do or not. But in my experience it’s really hard to get over an ex while you’re still talking to them. But if you have her on any of your social media, delete her, unfollow her, block her, whatever you need to do. Cuz if you see her on social media with a new guy, then it’ll be hard for you to move on, still. And I know she cheated on you and it hurts and you feel betrayed, but eventually, you need to forgive her. You can’t hold a grudge for long. If she doesn’t say sorry, then forget about it. If she does, forgive her and move on. "
Why did you post to ask if you’re toxic or abusive if you’re already so hellbent on the answer being no?
"are you being too sensitive? No

are your parents being jerks? yes.

As to your brother - consider him a hot stove. Stop trying. Be polite but distant. He's never not going to be a selfish jerk who has decided you are not worthy of equal attention and love. call him out on his bullshit when it happens, but otherwise avoid and don't engage.

as to your parent, ""that's the way he is."" is such a bullshit line. The line of everyone who'd rather take abuse and expect everyone else to do the same. when they bring up anything regarding him, 'oh that's nice' and then change the subject. They complain you're not trying? ""This is how I am. Brother has made it clear he doesn't care about me and I will not continue to hold my hand out to be slapped away."""
"Have you talked to him about how overwhelmed you're feeling (vs. just telling him you don't want him to touch you or you don't want to have sex right now)?

Have you talked to your doctor about the possibility of PPD? Any change in feelings following a birth could be a sign of PPD. But I also think it is totally normal, rational and understandable that you would be feeling so overwhelmed with two children to take care of. ""I feel like I only exist to fulfill other people's needs, like they're all just waiting for a piece of me"" makes perfect sense to me.

I think you need some help -- and you should not feel ONE BIT GUILTY about it. You are under an enormous amount of pressure and demands right now. If you haven't already reached out for help, I recommend starting with your husband and your doctor. And family and friends if that is a reasonable option. Don't hold back from getting the help you need; anyone who judges you badly for this is an idiot and a jerk."

"If a girl was to meet someone and he followed her home, let himself in her apartment (?!) and then fucked her while she was stupid drunk that would be 100% rape all the way. Just because you are a guy doesn't suddenly make it a cute story. She made a grave error in judgement which is even more surprising considering she's been a victim herself. She is still repeating this mistake every time she tells the story. She was so, so wrong. You absolutely SHOULD expect someone to check in with you before fucking you, even if you were 100% sober. 

I'm not sure what your followup move should be though. I myself would not feel okay keeping this as a secret from my partner. But telling her could end the relationship. I'm really sorry this happened to you man."

Of course not, her sister's the golden child.

&gt;  My wife denies this, saying she's over any of that past stuff but simply doesn't want to talk to her mother much and views her as a negative impact on her life. 

Well, her reactions are actually saying otherwise..... you really should encourage her to go back to therapy. A month twice isn't a lot and clearly isn't enough. If you want therapy to work, it's exhausting, emotional and takes time. And yes, she'll hear stuff she won't like.

&gt;  If her mother were mine, I would have cut her out of my life completely years ago. My wife would have too, I think, but loves her sister too much for that and her sister won't allow her mother to be cut out.

You really need to make your wife aware that her issues have not also an impact on her, but also you, which isn't fair.

"Your kids are subsisting on snacks and you're trying to feed them a keto diet??? What??? That is absolutely not okay. The way I see it, two different meals need to be prepared either way- a balanced one for the children and a keto one for whoever (OF THE ADULTS) wants it. Your wife should be preparing the keto meal if you're not eating it as well.

Does she have any ""disposable"" income of her own that she can use on some of the food stuff that fits into her diet? There doesn't seem to be too much overlap between meals that are keto and ones that are nutritionally appropriate for growing children. Plus things like nuts and avocados are pricey and there's no reason they should make up a bulk of the shopping list when you're budgeting and feeding two small children.

And as for your edit....no. Your kids shouldn't be eating keto at any time. Please speak to their pediatrician about this. Your wife is a grown woman who can make her own food choices; your children's nutritional needs are infinitely more important. "
"You made that commitment out of a lack of options, not because you freely decided to share your life with someone you love. In the church *I* grew up in, that would be grounds for annulment. As far as I can see, it's not a valid marriage. 

The problems in your marriage are 1. You do not love your husband, and never did, and 2. Your husband is physically and emotionally abusive. The first problem is on your end, and *can't* be solved - you can't force yourself to love someone. The second problem is on *his* end, and can't be solved *by you* - HE has to do the heavy lifting for anything to change, and he's making it clear that he's not interested. This leaves you completely powerless for as long as you stay in this marriage. 

I think part of you knows this. It's why you started secular therapy, and why you're posting here, yes? You know something is very off here, and are searching for a way to put it into words and take control of your life. Unfortunately, I do not think you'll be able to complete the process while you're still married to this man. Abusers rarely change even when they *try*, and your husband is clearly not trying. And the more work you put into getting healthy, the more work *he'll* put into undermining your progress. You're already starting to see this. 

Be on your guard, and if you haven't already, go get some long-lasting birth control while you're deciding on a course of action. The last thing you need right now is an unexpected pregnancy. "

"Your parents will divorce because your dad doesn't want to be with someone so cruel and unaccepting as your mom. It's his choice. You coming out, or rather being forced to come out, and your moms reaction is simply a symptom of this issue. It might not hurt to reach out to her, perhaps write a letter and have someone (siblings, grandparents, dad) give it to her. But realize that her response to all of this is A. Not your fault and B. Not a reflection of the person you are. This is something SHE needs to work through. "
"The more you hedge and apologize, the less likely they are to actually listen because they are kids and what they are hearing is the hesitation.  Just walk outside and say, ""Hey, guys, not on the porch and not on the driveway"" wave, and go back inside.

"It’s not that anyone is trying to claim that doing laundry is actively knicker-droppingly sexy. It isn’t. It’s that doing All The Things around the house, especially if that includes picking up your partner’s dirty socks, folding and putting away their laundry, rescuing their dirty coffee mug from where they left it, picking up their muddy boots from beside the door, retrieving their dirty gym kit from the car, and so on and so forth, leaves you with absolutely no energy to feel sexy - or to feel anything much more than exasperated towards another adult who is somehow adding to your workload rather than detracting from it.

Men doing laundry is not sexy. But not having to do men’s laundry for them leaves much more brain space for feeling sexy. A partner who gives enough of a shit about you to pull their weight and be an actual contributing member of the household, rather than a drain, is definitely sexy.

So, fine, if you don’t want to do laundry then clean the bathroom or do the dishes instead; whatever. But going to the gym has nothing to do with this and will not help."

There are two whole months between now and Christmas... all that time and they can't work out a trade-off (morning for Brother, afternoon for OP) or carve out some time to meet OP at the local Chinese restaurant for lunch?  I can think of several ways off the top of my head that OP's parents could conceivably make time for both of their children without Brother and Baby crossing paths. The fact that they didn't even try is just a nasty bit of favoritism even IF the brother is legitimately struggling with his mental health. "

Try different positions, maybe clothed sex or something different, focus on pleasing her, focus on her face/breasts/whatever does it for you. Otherwise your plan is to not have sex for 6 months or whatever? Sex is an important part of a close relationship. Especially since she’s likely pretty self conscious about her changing body, and getting cut off from physical intimacy won’t help."
It’s possible that this woman discovered that men seem to like this approach from her and she gets bigger tips and in general gets more of what she wants out of life by being very flirty with them. That doesn’t excuse her behavior but it’s possible it’s not just your boyfriend.

Do not, DO NOT let this guy stay with you. You don't know him well enough, and you have no idea how long he expects to stay. In some jurisdictions you only need to stay somewhere for as little as 14 days before the courts will consider you a de-facto ""tenant"" whether you're paying rent or not, and you'd have to take him to court to evict him. This might sound like some crazy far-fetched scenario, but it comes up in r/legaladvice at least once a day. I mean, not the neighbor-dog-cancer treatment trifecta of weirdness you've got going on here, but the basic concept. It is shockingly difficult to get someone out of your house once you've let them stay there. I think there are more than enough red flags here to tell you this is a baaaad idea. "

"I think that’s changing, slowly but surely. Women “married up” in the past because it was basically the only way to change their economic status. Now we have access to education and earning our own incomes. I forget the outlet but someone had an article recently about this, and how men are nearly as likely to “marry up” as women these days. "
"I agree but, if it were me, it'd definitely cause feelings of resentment against the dog, even though it's not the dog's fault."
"I can understand both sides here. I think the way you're behaving would make anyone feel insecure, but you're dealing with a lot of figuring things out for yourself here. This is complicated to navigate.

As difficult as it's going to be, open communication is the only way you get through this. You need to be upfront with him about where you are right now and that you need time to navigate through that space. And for his side... You need to be prepared that an undefined relationship with someone who is closeted might, no matter how much he cares about you, turn out to be something he just can't handle.

Don't steam roller your own feelings, but don't think he'll be happy to wait around for you to figure it out forever. Loving someone who is unwilling to commit to you is a painful experience. 

So, yeah. Open communication, therapy if you can afford it- the great thing about a therapist is they have no horse in the race, and you can express your worst doubts without it hurting the people you care about. "

"I'm gonna be straight with you. You're 10 years older than this woman. You're supposed to be more mature than this.

If you want your relationship to succeed you need to step it up. "
"Deal breaker, and that's okay. He has no way of knowing if those women were forced into it. Gen if they weren't, it's okay to be repulsed by people who pay for sex. I absolutely am, and I don't give a shit if anyone finds that offensive. I find people who pay for sex in countries where it's illegal and many of the women are forced into it pretty fucking offensive. "
"Your daughter can also send summers with dad, so she still gets real, quality personal time with him."
"Has he asked you about these things and then you told him lies or half-truths (aka lies)? If you outright told him, oh I've never done any drugs and I haven't experimented sexually, prepare for him to either be upset or not want to talk to you. At 24, he likely doesn't want to keep at a relationship with someone who started off being dishonest.

If you are saying he's just made these assumptions without asking you if you have done x, y, z, then telling him the truth shouldn't be explosive. If he responds poorly, there's a good enough indicator that someone else who is less judgmental would be a better suitor for you, unless he's willing to move past it. If he makes these assumptions and you don't bother to correct him, it will almost definitely be perceived as you lying to him.

Many of the things you are concerned about are things I wouldn't just bring up to my partner... ""Hey, partner, did you know I've done stuff with women too?"" or ""hey, partner, you know I've slept with x number of guys"" just imo not a necessary thing to bring up *especially* out of the blue. If it comes up in conversation that's a good time to be honest with him."
"....you need to acknowledge it. Your cousin is trash. You will need time to grieve the loss of the relationship and everything but ultimately you will need to move on.

"Good for you!

I had a friend like that. When my husband and I first started dating she'd always talk mad smack, that he was going to cheat on me that I didn't need to be dating anyone. I got tired of her negativity and her issues with alcohol, and said buh bye. 

Surround yourself with positive people and you'll be much happier. "
"Oh yeah, I'm sure he was going to let her go down on him thinking ""Oh, what a martyr am I!""

"In regard to #6: OP may need to do an elimination diet to find out if she is passing something irritating along in her breastmilk. Many times dairy is a culprit. 

She also needs to make sure that the baby is getting enough hindmilk. She might be switching sides too soon, especially if nursing again seems to soothe the baby. Feeding from only one breast at each feeding and then alternating breasts each feed may help.

"Can you afford it without him? You have two roommates, right? 

Are you considering separating? I think it would be the right thing to do. If so, first you need to find someplace safe to take your dog for a month -- friends, parents, a sibling? Then google how much notice you have to give your husband (a tenant) in your state. Probably either 30 or 60 days. Then tell your husband you want a separation and give him written notice that he has to leave. You can usually find the basics in some thread on r/legaladvice 

Then take that poor puppy to a shelter.

"That was kind of a metaphorical statement to imply that he got a LOT of tips from women he slept with, I dont think she implied it like that happened on the regular.

You need to tell him this.  It's totally understandable that you're doubting your entire relationship.  I am SO sorry this happened.  It's really shitty and I can't imagine how you're feeling.  Talk to him.  Talk until you're blue in the face.  Get all the answers you need.  If you talk through it enough the hope is that you either reconcile your feelings or get to the point where you realize the relationship is dead.  Either way -- it's better than being in a relationship limbo.

"This is a great point—you cannot hold others accountable for the hurt feelings you have against this girl, but at the same time, you also should remember that when you chose to stay with Maya, you kept everything that goes along with it. And that isn’t even necessarily a bad thing! 

I think one of the most difficult things for people to remember when it comes to issues of cheating is that it isn’t something you should force yourself to get over or work through quickly—take all of these experiences and watch your own reactions AND hers. It sounds like you seeing this other woman really brought up a lot of feelings. Whether they are unresolved or not, perhaps you haven’t discussed the cheating in a while? Sometimes even just a “rehashing” of the past makes it more comfortable to talk about so that when these issues do come up, you two are stronger as a couple. 
Good luck! "

"If you’re a gold digger, marrying some guy who was working minimum wage when you met and is only expecting a million bucks at some far future date when his parents die, you’re not a good one. ‘Close to a million’ bucks is a nice inheritance, but not much more than a hope at this point - might be a nice addition to a retirement, but it’s not changing your life here and now. His parents could get sick and blow through it, one could outlive the other, remarry and redirect the inheritance, or just blow through it the old fashioned way.  Would a gold digger stick through a middle class life for a million bucks at age 50-60?

So I found a new roommate, who was fine with me having an ESA. An ESA may really help your roommate with her mental health, but in my opinion she needs to be the one to find acceptable housing. It's unfair to spring a pet on a roommate who doesn't want one (and let's not kid ourselves- dogs really affect everyone who lives in the household. This is not the same as taking a pill everyday) when that was never an agreement when signing the lease. I'd talk to your landlord to see where your roommate would fall with the FHA, but at the end of the day, I think she is responsible for finding a living situation where all involved agree to an ESA. "
"Hell even if you hadn't paid and booked everything, his request would be unreasonable. 

He sounds committed to making this about him, so he can feel like a victim. Don't play the game. You're getting married in December and he can either come or not. But whatever he says goes; no saying he isn't coming, only to turn up the day of (which I think is likely, he sounds like he'd really dig a scene like ""dad came!!!""). 

""Asking me to change my wedding date is obviously not fair or possible. Either you're coming or you aren't; but I expect to have your answer by tomorrow or lll assume you're not attending."" "
"It's healthy to have good friendships outside of a relationship. Right now you're in the honeymoon ""I only wanna hang out with you phase"" (even though you are long distance), but that won't last forever and you're going to want to have a life outside of your relationship (which is a good thing, within reason of course).

You're in college, this is the perfect time to meet friends without a huge amount of adult commitment yet. Making friends and maintaining friendships gets harder as a ""real"" adult (not impossible, just more difficult). 

You don't have to have a huge social circle. I have 3-5 friends I'd consider my closest friends (I've got more acquaintances though) and I'm perfectly happy that way. You don't need to have a crap ton of friends if you don't want. But definitely hang out with your friends."
"If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed if anyone told me my sister acted this way against someone much less my wife.

I know unless she genuinely is sorry, then I don't care what reason she had to behave that way"
"We do not have children yet and we aren't officially trying but we aren't preventing pregnancy either. I'll have to think about it but I kind of want to consider going back on birth control for awhile. 

&gt;What happens when you get older? What happens if you get injured and can't have sex for a while? If that is all you are for, your time is limited.

Exactly. I think this is fueling some of my anxiety. "
"It's a *good thing* that he was so upset about his outburst, it means that he's aware of his behavior. Someone who is a crappy father or partner would be finding ways to blame you or the baby for getting him so worked up.

And we hear about plenty of dads on here, who are lucky/lazy enough to be able to sleep through the squalling crying while Mom is the one feeling beserk with sleep deprivation, and while it is true that moms are extra attuned to the sound, it's wonderful that he wants to help instead of rolling over to ignore.

By the way OP, if it is reflux, you could see about getting a rocker that has the baby sleep tilted up at an angle. That's the only way I've been able to deal with my reflux, when i was a baby decades and decades ago, my father used to sleep in a chair holding me upright!"
"Yeah but this is her child. If it was anyone else I agree with you - but my parents are divorced and my mom has a rocky relationship with her mother (my grandmother) to the point we have ex-communicated her from the family. And whenever my momma would lock herself away - I’d give her an hour or so - and then go crawl in bed and hold hands and put on Gilmore Girls. 
For parents - their kids giving them love when the rest of the family is making them feel unloved - in my experience - helps. 
I dunno. I think it just depends on the person. And only OP knows what his mom would prefer. "
"This is good advice - I’ve been here and I had to really think about how much life I have left (50-60 years hopefully and you’re a decade younger than I am) and if I was really willing to say I’d had sex for the last time already. 

If you’re not having sex **at the bare minimum** on your birthdays and anniversary then he’s given up on even trying. Chalk this one up to a learning experience and be glad for the memories you two had and use it to find a better fit next time. I promise when you find someone who craves sex with you and you start having it regularly again you’ll see how right your decision was. "
"You need to rehome the puppy or accept 100% full-time care of it. Right now, you are BOTH abusing the puppy. I appreciate that you feed it (sometimes), but.... it lives in a crate/kennel and hardly ever eats. That is a horrible, abusive life. "
"Yikes. Yeah, I’d be seriously concerned, dude. "
I strongly suggest you see a therapist. 
"Normally I’d say stay out of this - it’s not your business. But OP’s sister is being heinous and there’s a kid involved here so I have some sympathy here. 

Maybe send an anonymous email to the BIL saying “I know your fiancée and she’s going to cheat with her ex as soon as he gets back from the military.” Keep it short, keep it simple, and if you’re worried about getting blamed make it seem like it’s the ex sending the note, not you. He deserves to be in the middle of this, not you. 

After you send the email you’ve done what you can - it’s up to them at this point and they can handle it how they want. "
It really *is* that simple.
"Shocker! A 32 year old dating a 22 year old is insecure, overbearing, and reluctant to let her escape her leash. "
"That's part of what scares me, even if nothing ever happens I'm still stressing about it"
"This is throwing up a lot of red flags. Put passwords on things and if she questions it, you'll have your answer.

She also has no business having access to your families finances. That's absolutely bizarre and I'd be extremely careful if I were you."
"I knew a guy who was like that, but with bad puns.  It was maddening.  

Seemed to be the only way he knew how to interact with people.  He was a weird socially awkward guy, and it seemed like he had gotten a laugh out of it at some point and then doubled down to the point of insanity."
Isn't it Australian law for pool gates to be self closing and self latching? Or maybe just in NSW. Either way deffo look into getting one that closes on its own. 
"You asked a question, and the majority of people are telling you you're wrong. Why are you still arguing?"
"&gt;I also have this irrational and ridiculous notion that if I have the abortion I won’t be able to get pregnant in a year or two. Like punishment 🙈

OK, that is a thing that could happen, but it would not be punishment or karma or anything like that, but I do understand your thought processes there.

I would say that if both of you are *certain* that abortion is the way to go right now, then that's what you should do. If either of you is on the fence, don't get the abortion. You were planning to try in two years anyway, it really won't make that big of a difference."
There is always a chance that Hubby and Ex talked about boy's names when they were together. 10 years is a long time.
What a rotten fucking old man. And what a doormat wife. Jesus they all three eat dinner every night. I mean if they've been doing that for this long you might as well just invite her. Either that or finally grow the spine to completely cut him and the other woman out of your life. I think those are the two reasonable options. 
Mine too. She sounds hideous. 
".... Then why do you even want him there if he's treating her like this?  By still talking to him, you guys are telling him this is OK. 

Like, I'm polyamorous, and this is really weird.   You guys don't get to demonize the side chick. She's not the person cheating. YOUR GRANDFATHER IS THE ONE CHEATING AND MANIPULATING HIS WIFE. WHY ARE YOU GUYS STILL TALKING TO HIM????"
"Wow, that awkward moment when you realise his friends are awful human beings with no respect for you. 

If you stay I wouldn't be ok with him going out with them again. "
"He sounds like a dream boat. Dump the girl, get with this guy. "
"It’s possible. Hard for me to say without actually knowing them, or you. "
just the fact that he WANTS to keep in touch with her is a problem. it's bizarre that he wouldn't immediately know on his own that it is no way to begin a reconciliation.
"Came to say this. The most concerning part of the whole story, to me, is the complete disregard OPs bf has regarding OPs privacy and safety. Like wtf.

OP, your bf doesnt sound like he has any respect for your relationship. You have been extremely cool about the whole friendship. I would have had a talk with him a long time ago. At some point, it becomes more about the mutual respect couples have for each other and preserving that than wanting to be the cool gf. You have to decide whether this is something you want to live with for the rest of your life: a spineless bf who is still harboring unhealthy feelings for his ex and his psycho ex who will always be in his life and make yours miserable."
"Your response here suggests that you have unusually low emotional intelligence -- you simply don't understand other people on the most basic level.

 If you're not familiar with the concept, emotional intelligence is an individual's ability to recognize his/her own emotions and those of other people, to use emotional information to guide thinking, behavior and communication, and to adjust or manage one's emotions to achieve's one's goals.

You should google an online emotional IQ test and take it. It's likely that your interactions with people, your friendships and relationships  suffer as a result of your dearth of emotional knowledge. "
"First, it's great that you've stepped up and keep contact with your cousin. She's 8 and she's starting to see right from wrong. 

The approach that I'd take is to focus on the child.  How did it make her feel? Validate her feelings... Make sure she's not blaming herself. Ask her what she wants to do and help guide it. It's a tough spot and likely she will shrug most things off like she did with the yellow dress. At 8 years old and living in a household like that, she's likely more resilient than an average 8 year old. It's heartbreaking that we can't protect all the kids in the world but... If a child has that one adult who cares and is a constant presence, they typically turn out ok. 

At some point, perhaps her parents may be okay with someone else taking her and keeping her ""during the week"" or ""during the school year"" to be closer to a better school (or whatever excuse/reason  they can accept). It's an idea for when things get violent for her.. it would keep peace in the family and help her parents save-face while protecting her. Good luck! "
"Stop trying for a baby until you have this handled.  Yes, he is involving you in his fetish against your will and that is unacceptable.  Porn addiction is treatable.  Insist he does so before you bring a child into this.  "
"You should seriously reevaluate what you think a relationship is because he is seemingly giving you the things you say you want: teaching you new skills, hard work and passion for what he does. You're unhappy and understandably so but it seems like you are mocking exactly what you want: aimless together time and shared trivial activities like cooking, exercising, eating, talking, etc. 

Chalk this up to a learning experience and move on. He's told you exactly who he is; you listened but didn't realize how bad a fit that was for you. This is what your mid 20s are for but don't stay too long in a relationship that clearly won't last.  "
"Here is my point of view why she was angry.

My ex boyfriend had some health issues he didn't want to address while we were together, also didn't want to move out of a family home because of his mom who he thought couldn't be alone. He was always like: you don't understand, it's hard. He made me feel guilty for wanting that and for ""pressuring"" him.

We had those conversations for months. Lo and behold, one month after our breakup, he visited a doctor and started looking for an apartment. Yeah, that was not a situation for me to congratulate him. 

I was furious and hurt because we had so much fights, he was making me feel like an ununderstanding, bad girlfriend and in the end it wasn't that hard for him to act. "
"You totally did the right thing.  I recognize that you were trying to be adult about how it was handled, but that was a boundary where you asked him repeatedly to stop talking about it and he went back to it.  If anything, you could have asked him to leave sooner.  

As for your roommate, say something like - Hey man, he kept pushing something that neighbor and I both weren't comfortable with, wouldn't stop, and I had to ask him to leave.  No hard feelings,  just needs to stop when asked so we don't have to kick him out. If there is an issue, maybe he doesn't need to be there without roommate there."
"Mine are the same ages, but I honestly think it's still pretty predatory for a 23yo to be having sex with a 16yo. "
"""Mother, we are a family. If you invite my daughter and me, you should damn well expect my husband to come. Either we all come, or none of us come. Make your choice."""
"Everyone else has given you the correct advice about siding with your husband, but I want to add one more thing: your mother doesn't control whether you see your older relatives! You're an adult, and she isn't the gatekeeper between you and your family.

If you want to see your relatives, especially your older relatives, call them up yourself. If you won't be attending Christmas at your mother's, tell them that and tell them why (adjust these lines according to your own circumstances): ""Mom has excluded Husband from the holiday, so Baby and I aren't attending. But we'd love to see you while you're in town. Would you be able to drop by our place while you're here?""

Especially since your mother has already started to poison your relatives against your husband, it's important that you begin to develop independent relationships with the relatives you care about. Call them, invite them over, share baby photos. Don't allow your mother's awful behavior to separate you from the rest of your family."
And get her to take the full blame for it failing.
"He could be off his medication and experiencing a manic swing. He could also be on drugs.

Unfortunately these things often seem to come together. But not always. 

I have known one person who could tolerate a manic swing and still stay sober, but this was a person who had about a decade of continuous sobriety from both alcohol and drugs. They got pretty far out before they started taking their medication again - shaved head, speaking about demons taking the form of human beings, screaming in public, ect - stone cold sober.

Most people with who have drug and alcohol problems but no support network, once they hit a manic swing, their judgment goes out the window and they start using again.

Have you ever known him when he was on a manic swing? Have you ever seen him when he was high on drugs? If your answer is no to both, it can be hard to know what's up.

If you desperately want to stay with him, I would ask if he's had a visit with his doctor recently, to check up on his medication doses, because you're feeling frightened and concerned by his unusual behavior.

Of course, your first priority should be protecting your kid, and getting a contingency plan set; a safe place to go if need be. Do you have a safe place to go right now?

"
"Yes, exactly! Never hide who you are. Strengthen that spine and teach your man how to grow one too.

""I won't have that in my family."" is a thing I've heard a lot from my SO's father (who is a pastor, btw.) He's a giant bully and when he said that to me over Christmas dinner in his home, I said, ""Then I guess we're not a part of your family and our [future] kids are down to one granddad."" That scared the shit out of him and while he hasn't patched it up with me or my SO yet, he hasn't stirred the pot either. So I'm going to give him some time for his ego to deflate.

At the time, it was the most hurtful thing he could have said, which was the point. So I took away something that he thought was a given, his future grandkids. It pushed the idea that I'm here to stay and that his son is MY fiance. He may be STUCK with a crappy father, but he CHOSE me, and that's something worth noting.

I also had a long think about if I wanted to deal with all this crap for the rest of my life. We talked about it in every way. (I mean I get it, they're white, Christian, and from the mid-west/bible belt. I'm a non-religious, opinionated, asian woman whose career is high stakes. They just can't wrap their heads around me.) My SO has no problem going no contact if his parents treat me poorly. He also doesn't give a rat's ass what they think about me, which gives me the confidence to be comfortable in my own skin any time I need to interact with his family."
"&gt;Showing the sole of your shoe has long been an insult in Arab culture To hit someone with that shoe – as Muntadar al-Zeidi tried with President George W Bush – is seen as even worse. The shoe is considered dirty because it is on the ground and associated with the foot, the lowest part of the body. Hitting someone with a shoe shows that the victim is regarded as even lower.

that family has told you exactly what they think of you "
"Fascism has been expansionist. Also, this ""causes more deaths"" claim is a bit misleading, as communism had more of a foothold in various countries for longer, whereas fascism historically didn't survive long where it was tried. 

I'm not defending communism or fascism, as I find both repugnant, but I don't think your point is fair. I'd also say fascism is an ideology that preaches violence, as was said above, and I only take comfort in most fascists being armchair bloggers hiding behind a computer screen."

"&gt;  He thinks it is natural to jump around jobs and thinks that employers should understand that their employees are looking out for themselves. 

Given his current situation, I hope you pointed out that he is hardly a good judge of what employers are looking for in an employee?

I helped a good friend get a job once, when she was desperate.

She used up all of her sick days, and her leave as soon as she earned it. She constantly came in late and complained about how much she hated her job. I told her that she was getting a bad work reputation but she said showing up on time wasn't important for a job like that.  When he contract came up for renewal they did not renew it. Then she complained about how horrible they were for letting her go.

In the long run, she didn't appreciate my favour, and it tarnished my reputation.  Shortly afterwards, another friend asked me to pass on her resume which I did, but of course my boss didn't trust my judgement and didn't give her the job.

I think you are right not to do this for your brother.  "
Chick had literally zero incentive to lie or tell the truth either way. Don't take her words for gospel. 
"So you can't have a discussion with him because that's the extent to which he touches you, always? From what you've written above, I wouldn't like it either. Most women don't like to be groped when sex is clearly off the table, like when you're in the middle of a chore. 

There's a lot of other stuff you're talking about in the post that may well be PPD but also may be the normal stress of a stay at home mom of two. That stuff aside, I feel like you should know it's totally normal not to want to be groped all the time, and I think it would be fine for you to tell him that you don't like being groped while you're in the middle of chores and breastfeeding, and that it's effecting your sex life. You're starting to see the effect of just taking it, which is you're starting to enjoy sex less. Sure, you're thinking of all the stuff you need to get done, but you're going there in the first place because you can't be there in the moment while having sex because you're already resentful. That's why it's so important for the behavior causing you resentment to stop."
Yeah that made me mad too
A guy who chews tobacco is telling you to whiten your teeth and shave your ankles? What a catch!

"It's time to be an adult. You're going to have a child in your arms in ~3 months, the era of ignoring your problems until they disappear is over.

Suck it up, tell them you're having a baby, deal with the fallout like an adult."

"Wowwww. Wtf. What a fucking asshole friend. No excuse when your boyfriend wakes up. The audacity his friends have to even tell you to chill out and message his phone fully knowing you would most likely see that message too... stumps me. 

You should be done. The fact that it doesn't sound like a one time thing out of the blue and a video was sent to the chat makes me think this has happened before. They see no wrong. If anything it's just a laugh for them. If it was a mistake I don't think a video would be shared to the chat and his friends would be saying it was a mistake blah blah. They're basically encouraging that behaviour with that ball and chain message too. 

I feel for you. *hugs* please come back with an update. 

Also, what kind of friends were they to even let him come home by himself in that state?"

"Susan has no money and would have no income.  She would become completely dependent upon you and your wife.  

Lets say that Susan moves in and watches the baby for ten years.   In ten years, though, you no longer need her to care for your child.  At that point, Susan would be in her mid-60s with no assets and most likely little in Social Security payments.  How would she live for the next 20-30 years?

Another thought... If Susan has a medical problem when she's living with you, how would she pay her medical bills?

If Susan moves in, you should realize that she may live with you for the remainder of her life and be completely dependent on your support (food, housing, medical).  This would NOT be cheaper than putting your child in daycare.

"
"Exactly, speak to management with your boyfriend. Explain the situation and how it is making you both uncomfortable. Ask for a new server. "
I couldn't agree more. The OP doesn't have a dog problem; he has a wife problem. 
"Sounds like your son is depressed and could benefit from professional therapy for a while to help him sort through what's going on in his head. Doesn't need to be a big dramatic thing, can be a straightforward decision like ""son, I see the signs of depression in your behavior and have arranged for you to see a therapist once a week for the next month. If you find it valuable, we can continue the appointments after that."" or something.  "
"&gt; He literally just wants the bills paid with the most relaxed dresscode and flexible schedule.

It's possible to have both of these things, but the flipside is that it means you need to work really hard at developing next-level skills in a career where those things are perks. At least in liberal areas of the U.S., many engineering jobs (not aerospace or certain other types of engineering that are in conservative industries, but plenty of other types) fall under this banner. I have a full-time engineering job where I work remotely (and therefore wear literally whatever I want...currently wearing my workout clothes so I can avoid changing later) and have a flexible schedule, but that happened after education, hard work, and a decade of experience."
"As a new mom who had a planned pregnancy, I can tell you it's not easy being a mom, it is the hardest thing I have ever done and likely ever will do. Parents always say that and say ""your life will never be the same!"" Of course, I intellectually knew that, but holy shit, the reality is like running into a concrete block. That said, my daughter is the best thing in the world and I would never wish for my life to be different.

It is your choice and if you are not ready, you do what is right for you. Do not feel guilty for choosing to get your crap in order first. It is very difficult to get things together with a young baby, so I completely understand your hesitation. Best of luck to you and your husband. And ugh, I wonder if we live in the same city/province because we can't afford the million dollar homes either! 😌"
"Holy fuck?  Do you really need a bunch of internet strangers to tell you what to do???

"Ok,  but you completely missed my point that assault isn't something you need to be forgiven for,  and the fact that you're so grateful that he's been, like, generous enough to look past it is extremely concerning for both of your attitudes towards the event and your supposed fault in it.  "

Look, it sucks for her, but it's not your fault that your friend is bad at managing money. 

If you keep loaning her money, you need to do so with the expectation that you are throwing it into a black hole where you will never see it again.

Also, if you keep loaning her money, she's going to keep asking for it.

"&gt; Why do you think this is? Is it because you've never actually met something you had a real connection with? Or do you simply not care about sex at all?

It's probably because he literally thinks of women as nothing but numbers. He would go out and hit on random women in public places until he reached a certain score in his head. And now that game isn't fun anymore because it feels like a chore and is a lot of work.

OP has some pretty messed up views on women. He is struggling to connect with them on a personal level because he doesn't actually think of women as people. Look at his questions:

&gt;What do normal people do? How many dates do couples go on per week? How do you hang out?

It's like he is asking us for tips on how to take care of his new pet lizard."
"&gt;I have tried to explain that I have felt guilty ever since and why I did it, but he doesn't care. 

Well of course he doesn't care. Your insecure, toxic jealousy means that his daughter has lost something precious and dear that can *never* be retrieved. 

You need to stop trying to explain. You need to stop being defensive. You need to accept that what you did was shit, that you destroyed things and then covered it up for two years, that you have taken away something from your husband and daughter that they can never get back. You need to apologize and give them space while they try to come to terms with this. 

And yeah, you need to sit with the idea that your husband might leave you over this. While you're at it, get your ass into therapy because it doesn't sound like you've actually ever dealt with these issues, you've just tried to pretend as though you could delete the fact that she existed. Offer to go to counseling with him too, if he wants to. "
"&gt;My wife says he is no longer welcome to stay in our house. How do I address this?

So if it were up to you, how many more times would he be allowed to harass your wife and violate her privacy? Five? Ten? As many as he wants?

Get your head on straight, OP. Your dad is exhibiting creepy, predatory behavior. If he were a stranger, you probably would have had him arrested for barging in on your wife in the shower *multiple times*. Stop making excuses for his gross, misogynistic attitude. How he feels should be the *last* thing you're worried about. Protecting your family and apologizing to your wife for the hell you've put her through should be your main priority. Stop acting like a scared son and start acting like a husband with his own family to consider."
"&gt; You will fuck your daughter up if you stay with a woman who hates her.

"No. From one pregnant woman to another, you would not be a monster at all. To raise a healthy child, emotionally and physically, the mother must be in a good spot. Being with a crazy animal abusing person who could escalate to abusing children is most definitely not a good spot. 

BabyBumps has plenty of stories where a woman thought her husband was wonderful, then she got pregnant and he became abusive because she was trapped. (Or at least he thought she was and she ran away to become a single mother). They're heartbreaking. 

You'll have to look up abortion restrictions where you live- it could be hard to get an appointment, there may be a waiting period, and/or the clinic may be far away because of laws designed to fuck with women who want to terminate a pregnancy. If you think you want to walk that path, you should look for the resources you'll need. Best of luck."
"And I think you are a mature 18 year old, so if you continue being you, consider how you'll be at 26. I don't think you'd even hang out with an 18 year old, let alone date one. (I know in our society girls don't usually date younger guys, but the point still kinda stands)"
This is fucked up. Wake-up sex is a thing but it's a thing people discuss beforehand. I'm sorry he violated your boundaries.
"If he spent Christmas with your family, but skipped on attending the church service, would anybody make a fuss?  If he could skip the church service without a fuss, he is really being unreasonable.  If it would be a Problem for him to skip the service, that might point to a reason he doesn’t want to spend equal time with your family, which might give you an avenue to address that issue.  

But in general, his stance is unreasonable.  He’s a grown man with two families now, he shouldn’t always give priority to his birth family.  Hours spent with his family are precious, but so are hours spent with yours.  "
"He doesn’t see you as “just a friend” and he never has. 

Platonic best friends don’t have physical intimacy “stopping just short of sex” - unless they are friends with benefits, which you don’t want, or actively working towards a relationship, which he doesn’t want. 
Platonic friends don’t make it a point to introduce you to their parents  and encourage you to have a relationship with them. 
Platonic friends don’t get upset and snippy and jealous at the thought of you dating someone else. 

He is using you as a placeholder until someone better comes along. For whatever reason he likes you enough that he wants to have all the feel good emotional parts and some of the physical parts of a real relationship, but he’s not interested enough to have a real committed relationship with you. What he wants is a pseudo-relationship where he gets the emotional intimacy and physical closeness he desires, while still being able to keep his options open to pursue other people. He also doesn’t want you to be able to date anyone else until he first finds a “real” relationship and has no more need of you. He has manipulated your “platonic” friendship into an emotional (and sort of physical too) friends with benefits situation to suit his needs. 

If you don’t want a friends with benefits set up- which is all you will get from him, he doesn’t want to he just friends or in a relationship with you- then you should block him and move on. You can find someone just as compatible as he was who is also interested in dating you as well as platonic friends who won’t try and twist things into a confusing pseudo-relationship. "
Your girlfriend gave about the best answer she could to your stupid question. Be grateful and forget about this one. Not everyone imagines a measuring tape beside every dick they see. Be secure about your own member.
"&gt; Am I wrong in being so pissed off? 

Yes. This is a silly thing to get worked up about and refer to as ""disrespectful."" 

&gt; Do I confront her?

No, the ensuing argument would be absurd. But it sounds like you don't much care for her, so keep in mind you don't have to be friends with her if you don't want to."
"My new SO (seeing each other since early this summer but we declared it ""official"" a month ago) told me he loved me for the first time last week and I have just been living on a cloud since! We have many shared interests and communicate incredibly well. I can't wait to spend many more months with him, introduce him to my family, plan a future... Guys, I really think this could be it! ❤️"
"I'm Indian and live in India - PM me, I'm happy to help. "
Potlucks are great for making thanksgiving feel like it's pulling the family together. How else would I know my cousin has a side hobby making fancy brownies? How else would I ever have tried my aunts amazing (spicy) cheesy potatoes and corn? How else would we end up with 10 pies. Fuck. 
"If you are going to play petty, cruel, nasty little games with your partner, it shouldn't really shock you if they sink to your level.

What she did is a breach of trust. A very similar breach of trust to the one you committed, purposely to frighten and hurt her. 

So sure, bring this up with her, but frankly, you need to do it with an appreciation for how deeply fucked up and scarry what you did to her was. That doesn't excuse her, but it certainly explains a hell of a lot that would have been going through her head at the time.

And maybe you both should go behave better with other people. "
"&gt; Say you'll have the basics but you'd love extra side dishes

That's basically how we do it. I still cook about half the food but people also bring casseroles, salads, desserts, etc. "
That line about making him feel like he lost her all over again... Man. I can't even begin to imagine.
"Yeah, gonna have to second this...."
"Tell your brother you don't want him there, not your dad."
"She lead her boyfriend to believe she only dated one guy before him and that he was her first or something.

The reality is she had around 4 boyfriends before him and slept with all of them, also used to drink alcohol and do drugs.

Nothing tragic, just that she convinced her boyfriend she was also leading the ""goody-goody"" lifestyle just like him."
"You don’t have to leave, but he doesn’t have to stay celibate until you do. You two are broken up so both of you can date if you choose. 

If you wanted to stay in the apartment then you could try to have him leave but you talked about wanting to move out so why not do it now? You’ll be happier, he’ll be happier, everybody wins."
"He's wrong for being pushy and being condescending, but he is right that knowing yourself and your own body is pretty pivotal. Him being pushy and criticizing you is only going to escalate the weirdness.

Obviously, it's your body and if you don't want to masturbate, you don't have to, but I would venture to say that you are missing out. As a woman, I'd advise you to try to explore what you're into and open your mind, but don't do it for him. Do it for yourself. (No pun intended.) 

If it feels too weird at first to use your hand, maybe try some toys. I have a Satisfyer Pro 2 and it is honestly the best thing ever invented. It's also nice to lie under the running faucet in the bath.  "
"I've tried going out of town (where L and my last ex came from), but if they want to come to my place, then we ultimately get screwed over."
"&gt; But seriously, at age 22 I have a feeling that she has no idea what she's in for. After 2-3 kids, she will probably be exhausted enough to say no more. 

very much my suspicion too - but it's a hell of a risk"
"Also you just said you'd pitch a tent in the hospital for your dad in this situation but note that John's family are nowhere to be seen. 

I know not all lonely old people have done anything wrong to end up like that. BUT as someone with toxic parents who therefore knows a lot of other people with toxic parents MORE lonely old people whose kids stay well away have outworn their welcome over the years than not.

This guy sounds like 'give him an inch and he'll take a mile' type. He doesn't ask upfront but guilts people into agreeing to plans he made to suit himself, he isn't good for debts, he assumes personal things belonging to other people are his like the dog, his kids aren't even disinterested but completely absent, he has no friends, he's evasive, he uses other people by proxy (such as the nurse to answer calls) and a host of other toxic dish of the day specials.

Tough as it sounds to say no to a man with cancer, that's exactly what you have to do because he's relying on you not saying no so that he can bleed your good nature dry. I had a friend like this who uses illness to manipulate people and she used a cancer diagnosis (which was genuinely tough for her) as an opportunity to guilt countless people into giving her money. 

She racked up about 20K in guilt cash before we caught on and refused to be played by the 'I have cancer and no family' card she kept playing. 

My toxic mother does the same to all the neighbours and  people who only know the cute sweet side she puts on about me 'abandoning' an old lady and they try to comfort her to help her 'cope' because they don't know she's a money grabbing old cow who tortured me emotionally as a kid and that her various ailments are made up.

Manipulative people get sick but it doesn't stop them being manipulators. And John here is showing too many signs of being a manipulator for my liking. Do not get sucked in no matter how sick and lonely he seems."
"You don't have to share your things with him just because you live together. There is nothing wrong with saying ""I would prefer if you didn't use my kitchen items."" If he presses just say ""I'm particular about keeping them in good condition and you aren't caring for them properly"". There is nothing passive-aggressive about that, it's being straightforward and setting boundaries that allow you to be comfortable in your own home. 

 Please don't feel obligated to buy a replacement for him or the household. He's a 30-something year old man, he can buy his own damn skillet. "
"To his comment on my pale-ness this morning I said ""you don't think I am beautiful just the way i am?"" And he immediately came back with ""yes of course you are!"" But he seemed irritated that I said that in the first place."
"""Go get cancer honey, you look pasty""

Nice guy there."
My mom plays that same card with my brother. “You have to be nice he’s your only brother” as if only having one boy sibling makes them more valuable???? But he has 3 sisters so I guess we’re worthless to him cause he has so many?????
"I'm very close to that conclusion, I saw that she started a quora asking the internet what she should do. Should I leave my husband (a good man, but we’re not extremely compatible together) now that I have a chance to be with the man I've loved for 20 years?"
"What’s your BFs thoughts on this?

I’m completely on your side, I’m just curious as to what he thinks."
"That's a fine idea in theory, nobody is going to argue that she *shouldn't* communicate major issues to you but maybe she wasn't ready to talk to you about it at that time, or just needed to talk through some stuff with someone else to end up at the conclusion that she doesn't actually feel that way or is overreacting to certain things.

You basically just have to accept that sometimes she will have thoughts or feelings about your relationship that maybe she won't clue you in on right away, and attempting to quell any of that communication with other people or make her feel guilty about it is absolutely toxic and isolating."
"as far as I can tell your *entire marriage* has been a dumpster fire. Cheating, separation, emotional abuse, dude. Did you guys ever go to counseling together?"
"&gt;""Given that I'm going to keep doing this, what do you need from me in order to be comfortable with it?""

This is really good. I think I'll be using this when we have a serious talk about it later tonight. I want him to know I take his feelings seriously and respect him. His well being and comfort are very important to me and I don't want him to feel like I'm putting my job or personal happiness before our marriage.

&gt;But also, so long as you feel it's safe to do so, call him on his shit. If you feel like you're being interrogated, tell him that - lovingly. ""I haven't done anything wrong, and it's not appropriate for you to treat me as if I have."" 

I like this too. I think I need to put more effort into learning how to communicate effectively. I want to be firm without being bitchy or dismissive of his feelings."
It's not a matter of opinion. Oral sex is considered sex as it involves genital contact with a person and fluids/stds can be exchanged.
"So as insults go, that's really not such a terrible one. Don't let the guilt keep you from taking his bad behavior seriously - that sounds like a serious escalating threat of violence.

Look up ""Love is respect"" and go through the checklist. Prioritize your safety."
"Staying entirely sober at work events doesn't always work, if everyone is drinking and you are the only one who isn't, then that's something they'll notice. Drink one or two drinks with a glass of water in between and with some food. Don't go overboard, but you are not really fixing your own problems with control if you avoid them entirely either. If it's a consistent pattern for you that you can't drink without getting pretty drunk, then staying sober might be the best idea for you, but keep in mind that it's something that might be noticed, and it might be a symptom of a different problem in your life. Best of luck OP."
"I guess the point here is you're assuming A LOT. And you think she's being passive aggressive but saying ""the ball is in her court now"" and avoiding and/or ignoring her is also passive aggressive? 

I just feel like this could be solved with a quick ""Hey, we cool?"" text. Then you know what's up and if she says ""Yeah, why?"" Then you drop it and forget all about these supposed slights. "
"Feeling fine and being fine are totally different things. You are not healthy and could possibly be doing very real damage to your body internally. Please see a doctor. Also, please dump the boyfriend. He WILL escalate. Your mom would probably prefer a happy daughter over one that’s constantly being abused by her partner, or worse, a dead daughter. "
"&gt; but only to me, and only over the phone

So they're still doing it.

So your wife is *entirely correct* that their behavior has not truly been corrected.

&gt; she knows they have changed

Per your own words, they have not changed. They are just choosing not to do what they think they should be able to do because they feel like your wife will punish them for it.

&gt; she has never given me a complain. She's fine when we go.

Dude, if she had no complaints about the holidays, she would not be against going."
"You were having an affair when your wife was dying, if you were my dad i would feel the same way. My parents split when I was young but I lost my mum back in 2013 and I can imagine how your children are feeling, add that to knowing there dad was having an affair just makes it even worse "
"I completely agree. Why on earth would a man who was 16 year old when you met his dad and who has never lived with you see you as his mum. He has a mum. You're his dad's wife, maybe a great step mum. But you are not his mother and don't get to project your idea of a perfect merged family onto a grown man."
"Yeah, your gf is cheating on you with this dude (or is cheating on the other dude with you). Either way, there's really no reason to trust your gf ever again and it's time to break up. "
"Talk to him and go to counselling who knows what else he did , he got away with cheating then...and was like a prostitute , having sex in exchange for money? Definitely talk to him "
"I apologize if this is poor timing, but can I get that mac and cheese recipe?"
"no it's not

it's pretty dumb to expect someone to tell you they get cold sores before they kiss you"
"Exactly right. In his academic position, is not like he hasn't been told of the consequences of pursuing this sort of thing before. 

He calculated the risk, and he was in a good position to get away with it. "
"Right-is the OP's wife going togged up at night when they start having nightmares?

Poor kids"
"You can help her but you shouldn't live with her. 

I went through a period with a very serious illness and my sister helped me get through it but didn't give her life up for me. Your sister is becoming co-depending. You're want to help your sister but this isn't helping her. She needs coping mechanisms. 

Therapy is super important when dealing with a disability/serious illness, especially when she is so young. Her life isn't over- but she isn't trying to explore her life as it is and is just relying on you. She needs hobbies, friends, maybe a boyfriend/girlfriend - all of which are doable but will take effort on her part. "
"That's exactly why these situations are so hard - the one person who needs to draw boundaries has essentially been trained from birth to not recognize appropriate boundaries, at least when it comes to his mother. OP can't fix this alone, and bf has no clue it's even a problem. OP, maybe point out things his mother does he wouldn't accept from anyone else? I don't know the answer, besides that he needs to recognize her behavior as inappropriate. And when he's been trained into accepting her behavior with no complaint for so long, it may be hard to get him to see it."
"Thanks. 

My main concern is that when they find out what we've been doing when we sneak away on Saturday's. They're going to be stricter with where BF and I can go together. I don't think any amount of trust is going to make them OK with boyfriend and I being alone again. "
"&gt;Why exactly do you think going to couples counseling with an abusive spouse is particularly bad?

Because one of the biggest things that abusers do is lie / gaslight / manipulate their partners to make the parters feel confused / guilty / mistrustful of their own judgment. 

When somebody's goal is to make you crazy and keep you trapped with them so they can continue to shit on you, they will just continue to do that exact same thing in counseling. Counseling becomes another place they can abuse you. 

A lot of abusers are such good manipulators that they'll even manage to get the counselors on their side."
"&gt;  The younger children act out when husband goes on these trips. 

This is affecting your family. You need a hard sit down conversation where you tell him that his family needs to be at least a as big a priority as his boss. "
"OK, it's really creepy that you took that photo in the first place. I'm glad you deleted it and didn't show it to anyone.

Plenty of 18-19 year old kids do dumb, regrettable things, so maybe it's a forgivable mistake if you've never done anything else like that. But it's really fucked that he keeps asking about it. 28 is WAY old enough to know better. Are you sure you want to date this guy? Does he have any good qualities?

Tell him you regret creeping on your sister, and you want him to stop creeping on your sister, too. And you should actually use the word ""creepy"", so hopefully it sinks in."
"&gt;But either way, I don’t like that she is talking to anyone sexually behind my back.

You have an entirely justified problem with what she's doing. This doesn't have to be the end of your relationship, but it does have to lead to a discussion. You can learn a lot from how she reacts. If she tries to deny it, or minimize it, or redirect and make you into the bad guy, you have a problem.

If, on the other hand, she admits everything, apologizes, and comes up with a plan to rebuild your trust in her, then you have hope that this can be repaired."
"Going to the exact same place she went and using the exact same name she is using isn’t making it a competition. He’s not living his own life with OP, he’s living the ex’s. I bet he still have this obsession/fantasy about her. And his overreaction is the biggest red flag ever. "
"Holy shit this sub.

All we can infer from this is that, yes, her brother is a terrible employee. This doesn’t make him a terrible person. He could be the greatest brother in the world and still a bad person to work with.

I agree OP shouldn’t help but god. It’s not like she needs to cut him off."
I lol’d too. Who the fuck doesn’t have anxiety anymore? Have you seen the news lately?
"How did you find out? 

No one should put a penny towards bailing her out this time, obviously. Or hiring a lawyer. Or let her borrow a car again. Or give her rides. She can sell her car and take the bus. And ps. she’s not just a “party girl” any more, she is a bonafide alcoholic if she admits it or not. In spite of the consequences she could not control herself. Both times she is lucky she *just* got pulled over instead of killing someone else and/or herself, which your family or any other does not need or deserve. That’s what I would tell her. 

Depending on your state laws and the judge she is looking at some combination of a long license suspension, jail time, big fines, an interlock device, treatment program and/or probation she has to pay for. If the last DUI was probation before judgement those charges will be triggered also. It will haunt her for years when she tries to get a job. What more can you say?"
"Funny, I've run into a similar situation before. There was an Armenian guy who gave everyone an Americanized version of his name but I knew it was wrong right away (I'm not Armenian, I grew up near Glendale). I called him by the correct pronunciation and it actually upset people a touch for a few days when they found out that he was letting them pronounce his name incorrectly (people asked why I was pronouncing his name wrong). People felt like he was walking them into a trap, I guess? Or thinking less of them for their inability to immediately pronounce his name correctly? And they felt bad, like they were mistreating him, and he was trying to be polite but it didn't help. In the end everyone learned to pronounce his name correctly.

Perhaps your boyfriend would like an opportunity to pronounce your real name correctly? So that not only a few limited people say it? You can say to him, ""He isn't special at all to me, he just knows how to say my name correctly. Anyone who can say it correctly can call me that, is that okay?"" And if he wants to learn, offer to teach him. Otherwise, perhaps he can give you a special nickname. At a certain point though, he should recognize this really has very little to do with him or this particular guy."
"I think that you are being very unfair. Beth is poly, just like you - yet you can have other girlfriend, and she can't date anyone else. I know that she initially wasn't going to seek out other people, but that was before she left her other relationship. I think you are being quite controlling by pressuring her to just date you and not anyone else (which could have led to her lie as well).

Overall, I think that you need to let Beth date other people or break up with her. You can't have your cake and eat it too - that's not fair to her."
"Well, you are 16. I don't mean any disrespect whatsoever, but that's not totally unreasonable. At least where I'm from (midwestern US), it's fairly common to have parents give 16 year olds *some* privacy, but pop in every once in a while to make sure things aren't getting too heated. 

I fully agree with the advice you've been given to tell both sets of parents about the relationship. It seems like you're good with that as well. 

As far as the brother aspect is concerned, what he's doing is NOT ok in any way. He needs to learn that this type of behavior is not acceptable. "
"It’s amazing how common this is. When my mom passed away, my dad grieved for a few months alone then started spending time with my moms best friend. It started out as them just reminiscing about my mom and talking about her. But feelings formed and they were honestly afraid of judgement for the LONGEST time. Hell, my moms best friend is still afraid of how my sister and I feel. 
She may not be my favorite person, but she never has been. Our personalities just clash some. But she’s great for my dad and I’m SO glad they’re happy. I’m sure OP’s family and friends will feel the same."
Your advice is horrible and clearly from a man. She just doesn't want her husband to grope her when she's in the middle of a chore. That's totally reasonable. She's not even mad at her husband. She's stressed because she can't get a moment where she doesn't have a kid latched onto her breast or another latched onto her leg or her husband latched onto her boob. It would overwhelm anyone.
"What's to apologize for? She's a mess and you told her the truth. It's about time someone did, and it's long overdue for her to look in the mirror and take some responsibility for her lousy choices. "
"&gt;I definitely believe being a stay at home parent is a full time job, but I don't think it's fair to expect me to work the job that I do and then do all the housework as well.

Being a stay at home parent is a full time job because they usually handle 80% of the housework and chores. 

If you're working more than 40 hours a week, you really need him to step up and stop complaining."
"I’m really disturbed and upset for you having to read all these people saying ‘don’t feel violated, he didn’t mean anything by it’.

Guuuurl, you feel however you want to feel about it. It’s your body and if him doing sexual stuff to your unconscious body makes you feel violated and dirty you are absolutely 100% in the realm of ‘no fucking shit!’ What anyone else thinks about how you should feel is irrelevant. It’s your body. Proceed in whatever way makes you feel the most peace. "
"Gross. OP, I think you need to tell her explicitly that you're furious over the abuse and secrecy you were forced into as a teenager and adult, and that she needs to apologize to you. "
"Compromise 1: you guys see it before you travel back, on opening day
Maybe a midnight showing (50th anniversary parties maybe don't rage until 2am). Maybe a matinee before you travel. Maybe you delay traveling a day to accommodate this. 

Compromise 2: you hustle back on the 15th and he goes out his with his friends that night. They would have to skip the midnight showing, which they might not be willing to do.

Tell him you are going to the party and it's important to you that he attend. And if he doesn't... Maybe dump him. "
"&gt; I guess I cannot make all sides happy

Life gets a whole lot easier when you realize and accept this. It is impossible to make everyone happy. Focus on your family, your wife and children. Extended family comes second. "
"&gt;I am only expecting them to support me for some time, to help me just a little, until I get on my feet. 

And they have rejected your request.

What now? Dad and Grandma have given you 3 days to get out.

* Where are you going to live for the next 6 months of your pregnancy?

* Who is going to buy you food? Provide transport to/from school and your doctor appointments? Provide clothing for you to wear during your pregnancy because you won't be able to fit your current clothes.

* Where are you and the baby going to live after it's born? Who is going to provide baby's items for diapers, bottles, formula, wipes, nursery furniture, changing pads, toys, baby bedding, crib, etc? All of costs *money*..

* Who is going to watch the baby while you take classes? Who is going to watch the baby while you work?

Your dad and grandma are unwilling. You say your mom has no space at her apartment either. Your baby's father ghosted you. What about his family, would they help or tell you to get lost?"
"Total accident, never meant to happen, she just went over to a guy's place she used to have sex with, tripped, and landed on his dick.

Poor girl was clearly addled by not having sex for a *whole week*.

Dump her."
"You should tell him.

I understand your desire to withhold this, but it's still a rather large lie by omission. It's not wise to keep something like this from your partner and it's not necessary you carry the burden of this on your own. 

His memories are his own. He gets to decide what he does with them. As you say above, his feelings are not within you control. The lie is within your control... And even if he never speaks to this woman's again, her aggression and judgement may still spill over and cause one or both of you confusion or harm. "
Why worry him if it was negative?? My sister even had me buy her a test so her husband wouldn't know anything unless it was positive. I took multiple tests before when I was with a FWB and said nothing since it was negative.
"&gt; You're aware male escorts is a pretty big industry right?

Yes. And most of them service male clientele. 

Again, some basic research into well-documented statistics would reveal this to be the case. You can even get some sense of the demographics of their clientele. "
"No it isn't. The vast majority of people with HSV-1 don't know it and the vast majority of people have HSV-1. Doctors don't generally test for it, and even if they do, it might result in a false negative."
"They were thrilled but were curious why my husband didn't mind and why he didn't visit.  Honestly, my mom doesn't like my husband that much, and I think my dad is trying to see the best in him, but it's getting hard for him.  She did not like how he treated me during the early months with my son and heard him criticize me on a number of occasions during that time.  They both are very polite and nice to my husband, so it's not that he couldn't have at least video chatted with my mom to see our son."
"It's normal in a lot of poc families that aren't very westernized to dislike their kid's partners if they date outside their race, especially if they're white. Idk about the whole physical assault thing though"
"Do you feel that you can stay strong?

Because trust me, he is going to wait until the last minute, and have nowhere to go, and then prey upon your guilt so that you will let him move in with you, because he thinks that you won't let him live out on the streets. And if that will work on you, then you have no cards to play here, because you will let him move in, and yet again, there will be no consequences to his actions.

You have to be willing to let him be homeless. Because he will be. He is going to be homeless, and it's going to be all his fault, and he's going to make it seem like your fault. And it's going to be okay. Trust me, he needs to be homeless. This happened to me, too, when I was taking advantage of my father, and expecting him to pay my rent, because I was too lazy to get a job. My father refused to pay my rent, and I called his bluff, and cried, and told him I'd be homeless. And my father (who was sick of me manipulating him) had to do the hardest thing in the world, and stop enabling me, and allow me to suffer the consequences for my actions. So, I was briefly homeless. And of course I blamed my father, instead of myself. But now, I know it was all my fault. Of course I got a job, and got out of the hole I was in. But I needed to fall hard first. You need to be able to let your boyfriend fall hard first. Can you do that?

Just watch the next few weeks. Watch. Your boyfriend will do absolutely nothing to get a new place. Even if you gently remind him, even if you make your own plans to move and make it crystal clear that he is not coming. He won't save money, he won't look at apartments, he won't lift a finger to move. He probably won't even pack his stuff. Why? Because at the last minute, he's going to cry and beg to move in with you. He's going to say that he tried EVERYTHING and just couldn't find a place ( but you'll know better, because you will have paid attention, because I'm telling you right now that this is exactly what's going to happen.) He is going to blame you for not being clear enough that he wasn't moving in with you. Even though you will be clear enough, because I'm telling you right now to be 100% crystal clear with him, so that he can't do this exact thing. Put it in writing. That way, the day before you move, he can't come back and say that he thought you were just kidding. Because he will.

You just have to walk away from this mess. I'm really sorry. It sounds like your boyfriend was perfect for you when you were in an earlier stage of your life, and you could be less responsible, and didn't have to think about the future as much. But now, no matter how much you love him, he's just not a great life partner to you."
"When I was diagnosed with cancer, my husband revealed his true character too - in that he dropped his guard and allowed himself to be vulnerable to tears with me. 
We became ""best friends"" again - reminiscing at the oddest of times about the silly things we would do as young love birds when we were teens.
There were times that when I was in the most pain, felt the loneliest and wasn't sure what I could take, my husband was the one who became my hero.
Our children would talk about how ""gross"" we were to be so lovey dovey. Those were the times I felt the most calm and peace with whatever was to come next - because my husband treated me like his ""hot new girlfriend"". When he knew that I looked like some old lady. 

I understand where your kids are coming from.

Some partners aren't as ""equipped"" to being true to their word when faced with the ultimate pledge of in sickness and in health. That would be you. 

Give your children some time and you yourself should consider therapy. You may feel like everything you did was kosher with treating it like a business transaction but do you wonder if you had some type of dissociative state as well?

Good luck to your children. "
"#Don't test your partner. 

It's rude, incredibly disrespectful, and just terrible behavior. 

She gave you a totally logical excuse, and she could literally just have said ""no"" and it would have been fine. "
PhD grad here. What you said.couldn't be.more.wrong
"Yeah, it might be possible to write off ""put the eggs in the fucking basket!x

Being inconsiderate to store employees and busriders is a red flag.

But the fact that she likes to belittle and humiliate her boyfriend is unacceptable."
"This. So many times this. 

A marriage counselor telling him that he’s wrong to his face will likely only make him more angry and more abusive. You’re asking an unreasonable person to see reason. Get out as soon as you can get out safely. "
"Well there it is. She's not crazy, she's just proud and clinging to what little she feels like she can still control in her life. It's actually an incredibly common reaction to well-meaning but overbearing families trying to get a loved one to leave a bad relationship. "
"This is actually ok behavior for now, but once you get married it should probably change.  You two will fully be a team then, and the best investment you will be able to make is to reduce any debts.  I'm not sure whether you need counseling, you may just need a financial planner.  Sometimes it's time to get over individualism and work as a team, and getting married is that time.  "
Divorce her. Get a DNA test on the kid. Clearly they had a physical relationship. What a rotten woman. How many times are you going to let her lie to you about this?
"You need to talk to your wife with two objectives in mind. The first is to find out why she acted the way she did. Maybe she had a rough day at work; really, it could be anything. Second, tell her that you aren't a mind reader, and that if she expects something from you, then YOU expect her to tell it to you in plain English. Obviously use a little more tact than that, but your point should be the same: communication is key."
"All of that costs money too, you know. "
"This. My dad has never worn his wedding ring in my memory - he and my mom just celebrated their 43rd anniversary. He just hates rings! Most guys aren't as used to wearing jewelry, so to suddenly going from never having worn a ring to being expected to wear one every day - it can be really uncomfortable!

But this definitely needs to be more of a conversation. It's clearly important to you, so I think he owes you some kind of explanation, and hopefully an attempt at compromise."
"It wasn't even about the jokes at that point- he refused to take her seriously and thought it was super funny that she got mad.

&gt; I tried to talk to him about it and his exact quote was ""i guess my barking up the wrong tree are frustrating you like the drop of a hat"" to which he laughed. **I actually was so mad that he wasn't taking me seriously** I tipped over our coffee table and threw pillows at him in serious anger. **He thought my anger was even funnier after I did that.**

I also see comments like ""She should've just left the room or something if it annoys her so much"" but the OP literally says

&gt; I'm so frustrated with them my head feels like it's going to screw of at my neck. I literally can't bear to hear another one. I find myself moving rooms in the evening just to be away from him.

She was avoiding her partner because the problem was so significant, but when she finally couldn't take it anymore and tried to talk to him about it, he threw her more of the same shit she's *just told him bothers her immensely*, and then laughed when she got even more frustrated. I'm not saying I condone the table-tipping, but I sure as fuck understand it."
"If you bought the clothes/items and can provide proof they're yours (receipts/bank records for proof of purchase) you can call the non emergency police line for an escort to get your stuff.

If your Mom paid for them and they're in her house, you really don't have any options but to accept you're not getting them back unless you give into your Mom's demands. "
"Your replies to all these comments is basically you stomping your foot and going, “But my mommy is *right*!” 

Why did you post when it’s clear you just wanted everyone to say your child’s mother is insane and wrong-headed and awful and your mom is a poor misjudged angel?"
"I have a suggestion (which I mentioned my parents used for me down the thread) - when I was little, or when I was sick as a kid, my mom put a mattress pad next to her side of the bed. That was I was close enough to not feel afraid or alone, but I wasn’t actually IN the bed with my parents. Could you suggest this to your SO? It would be much more gradual than making her sleep in a separate room, but would allow you to sleep with your SO and would also help establish boundaries and begin the process of independence."
This is probably the path I will need to go down in the next day or so. Should I get a mediator/counselor involved now to prevent a blame game from starting when emotions get heated?
"If she needs you, then you just stop and open the door. Learning to knock is a good skill for a 3 year old and you’d only be doing it whilst she’s asleep. 

You can just do it quietly. It seems like your best bet because I can’t see any way his anxiety won’t just get worse as she gets older."
"Trust is more important than anal sex for the sexual health of a relationship. This fucking weird power trip thing guys have for anal, I will never understand it."
"*We don't have any concerns with money.*

Maybe you don't, but it sounds like he does. It's a lot of pressure feeling like he has to support you and your two young children. 

It also sounds like you're overwhelmed. Maybe you two need to sit down together and come up with a plan to tackle the housework together? The two of you do a 'big clean' on the weekend for an hour or two, and you deal with the day to day? A chore chart so that it's easier for you to stay on-top of it? "
Then she's not taking your feelings seriously at all.
"Get therapy. You don't owe your family anything, they're horrible. Your girlfriend is amazing. Do not have her apologize."
"I probably should have explained that better, so ill give an example. We were in florida and I had to use the bathroom and I apparently took too long (maybe 10 minutes in total), so when I got back in the car he freaked out at me, saying I was definitely doing something different than using the bathroom, called me a stupid fucking cunt, then told me to get out of the car, I refused, then he just screamed at me until I finally got out, then he threw his iced coffee on me and told me hes not fucking driving me and I have to find my own way home. All because I took too long in the bathroom, and he didn't like the place I used the bathroom at. 

He has problems, this isn't a constant, but he gets like that very often, and other times hes sweet and kind. That doesn't erase the abuse parts. "
"Two different issues here:

1) Being worried about how white society views him is a real and valid concern, not an empty insecurity that you need to ""fix."" Black people often have to be conscious of how they talk, dress, and present themselves in order to advance in society. Thinking that he should just ignore this and ""be himself"" in a world full of people that WILL discriminate against him is naive. He doesn't have the privilege of acting like himself and being judged fairly. 

2) His experiences dating white women are probably valid too -- he's clearly been treated badly by white women in the past, and rather than recognizing them as racist, he's internalized that and is reflecting their racist views. 

But then going around and attacking black women as less than is just gross. That's just as bad as what those women did to him. It's shitty and racist, and is the part of all this I'd probably give him the most shit for."
As a farmer I'd just bring the live bird and make SIL help pluck it at her house lol
"You need to learn how to compromise. 

It’s cool that you grew up poor and turned out responsible and fine, but it’s not fair to take your issues from your childhood out on your wife. Why is her way of life and childhood less worthy than yours? There were good aspects of her raising just like there were good aspects of yours. 

Your son doesn’t have to be raised the way you were raised all the time. You have the money and resources to give him more than your parents gave you and that’s okay. It’s not spitting in your parents’ faces/crapping all over your childhood to indulge your son sometimes. 

You need to sit down with your wife and have a serious conversation about this. It was rude as hell for you to singlehandedly decide to return the iPad—that should’ve been a joint decision from you and your wife. You need to figure out what things you are adamant about regarding your son’s raising. Is it how many toys he gets? When he starts doing chores? How he manages an allowance? Then you need to discuss with your wife what she’s adamant about. Then you need to compromise on the other less important issues so that you are both happy. 

On a personal front, you need to learn to accept that your experiences can not define someone else’s experiences. It’s unfair to subject your son to social ostracism (which I guarantee will happen if he grows up in an affluent area but never has nice things) because you’re too rigid to give him his own childhood experience. "
"I'm sorry, but he's right. I'd break up with my partner if he went on a trip alone with another woman. It's one of the things that are perfectly reasonable relationship boundaries. He even told you his boundary but you didn't listen to it.  "
"&gt;  I feel like here people think it's not as sleazy as how it's perceived in my home country.

Oh they're definitely perceived as sleazy "
"Yea, you really need to break up with her. She's showing a pattern now, the fact that isn't a one off means she's not sorry for doing this. Just leave, she's not worth it."
"I think it sounds more like a case of catfishing than a married man, tbh."
"Oh for...seriously?

This jealousy is not your thing to fix. It's hers. Everything you give up for her is another affirmation that she can get whatever she wants from you just by being upset."
"Uh, no, it's not normal to flip a table and throw pillows when you're angry. There's a reason flipping tables is an internet meme and it's not because it's totes normal and acceptable. "
"I was in the same situation. I’m Albanian. I chose my boyfriend. I barely talk to my mom now. Even if my boyfriend was all the things she said, I’m not gonna side with racism even if she’s my fucking family. Fuck. That. Shit. And your friend is absolutely right to not speak to you because you are complicit in racism too if you don’t stand up to your mother. "
"Yes, it's worth letting your partner know that you have feelings that disturb you about an encounter. Have you allowed yourself to truly sit with these feelings and label them for yourself? Do you fully understand them yet? Make sure you do before you decide how to approach this conversation. I can't imagine a constructive conversation about this to be possible otherwise, you know? 

I'm sorry this happened and I hope things work out in the best possible way for you."
"Graduated what? High School? Trust me you're kids. I'm 24 and I'm still a kid. I look back at all of my decisions I made at 17 and want to punch myself in the face. You guys are rushing into tons of stuff without ANY knowledge of how the real world works. You don't even own a car. Her parents pay for her car. You have $3000 saved up? That wouldn't even cover a security deposit. You can love each other and be committed to each other without having to be engaged and married. My sister and her husband got together when you guys did. They didn't get married until 10 years into their relationship. Be smart. Try to have an outside view. You came here for a reason. Listen to us. Let's put it this way. If you're still together in 10 years you won't ever look back and say ""wow what a mistake it was to wait to get married and have kids."" BUT YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY look back and say ""wow what a mistake it was to get married and have a kid at 18."""
"My ex used to do this. 

Really think long and hard about if it's worth it to stay with a person who does this. They do it intentionally to keep you off balance and make you uncertain and insecure in the relationship. He has all the power if you're always worried about a break up; honestly I didn't realize until we broke up how fearful and stressed I was over it all the time. "
"And the crappy can hold it together long enormity he and string along a plausible story to make it seem not so bad. Often they are very experienced at downplaying their actions and blaming the kid for overreacting. People from good families buy it all. 

Happened so much with my wife’s family. Her mom is horrible, but people that meet her don’t understand because she is an amazing manipulator. "
"God, this is tough to read, but needed. I guess I feel...unconvinced of my version of things, if that makes sense? I wrote this post out trying to be transparent about my shortcomings, but rereading it I can't help but think about how upset my boyfriend would be if *he* read it, because he would see the situation so radically differently. I worry that I've created a narrative here in which I deliberately victimize myself in order to get sympathy, even though that wasn't my conscious intention."
"This is, somehow, even more majestic than your scale."
Then she needs therapy to unpack why her need for practical jokes is more important than your right to emotional safety in a relationship. If you can't even have a conversation with her (at 25!) without it ending in tears - and I'm guessing she's not open to text or email having this conversation - then there's just no way to tackle important issues and that's a death knell in the long run for any relationship.
"It isn't just the fascism it's the lying and deceit, as well as stating she hates OP's beliefs and while denigrated her online to others. This isn't remotely a stable emotionally together person. (I have a dim view of fascists are but soon to be ex gf has ratcheted it up a notch there) "
"Fair enough, I did trivialize that latter point. The trick is not to make it seem awkward or embarassing. Basically, fake it till it starts to  feel natural. 

Sit down and see if you can work out exactly what makes you uncomfortable (I don't presume to guess!).

Perhaps part of it is that each of you two parents clearly made an effort to make each child feel like your own, and this seems like an indicator that they dont, that  you somehow failed to make it work as a nuclear family. Maybe that's so, but the result is still good. Not a typical nuclear family, but one where everyone loves everyone else.

It will of course be utterly hellish for everyone if they have an ugly breakup...  :-("
Hm. Seems kinda awful to punish a kid who was injured as a result of improper supervision as well as you not properly kid-proofing your house.
"Seriously, when keeping the ""family"" happy means making at least half the family miserable, that's a pretty weird definition of family.  What she means is: make your brother happy, so he stops bugging me, and I don't care if it inconveniences you."
"My whole stance on it is that if she fostered communication and trust in the household, then nobody would feel the need to hide anything. She can be very quick to anger, and the whole atmosphere of the house can change on a dime if something upsets her. We both at times feel like we're walking on eggshells to avoid upsetting her over even mundane things (i.e. she screamed at the dog the other day because he didn't want to go outside). How can he come to her about anything if he is afraid?"
"Seriously, OP, put your plans for a baby on hold!"
" &gt; she expressed how disgusted she was with this unsolicited txt

You need to think about why digitized sexual harassment leads you to think about your perception of your girlfriend's ""honor.""

If she were posting instead of you, I would advise her not to give you a second chance, OP."
"this is a lovely post! and i too love my niece's and nephew's drawings and paintings that they make for me. i put them on my fridge and i'll save them because they made them for me. 

and really some of it approaches post-modern art. :D"
"I am not trying to be mean and I get that you're 20, but:

This is your close family friend who has been exceedingly charitable to you, after you dropped out of college, because he knew you needed help.

If you quit now because you don't like it (I wouldn't either), because its hard, and because you don't get to see your friends, your family friends and your family are going to perceive you as 3 things: ungrateful, immature, and short sighted.

You gotta recognize that quitting a job *you were gifted/don't deserve/didn't earn* after 2 months, without it being for a reason like a better job or school, is ungrateful. Especially because the work is hard and you wanna see friends. 

You gotta recognize that you dropped out and you need to work - sometimes you dont have the option to do what you want the most, but instead *should* do what is *best*. It would be immature to walk away from what is best for you because it's undesirable. 

Lastly, it is short sighted to turn down double what should be your income, plus what you're saving with $0 rent, after only 2 months. At the very least grind it out until you've got like 6 months pay saved.

TLDR: you're afraid of the awkwardness because they're gonna look at you unfavourably, because what you wanna do is rude and childish, and those are unfavorable characteristics."
"Precisely. OP, you told her the truth. She didn’t want to know/hear it and is now playing the victim. The only victims here are her kids. "
"First, I'm sorry for your loss.

If your friend missed the labor of the subject of her first documentary, would the documentary have suffered? 
"
"&gt; Even if he’s a good guy, I’m not obligated to give him a chance. I have my own life, and my own preferences that I look for in a partner.

Exactly. Stand your ground. Your so-called friends are being shitty about this."
"I'm so sorry that happened to you OP... you were being a good friend and a good person in general.

I hope you take pictures of your wounds and go to the police. Also consider going to the doctors too if you're able."
"One thing that really helps me is reminding myself that I still realize other people are attractive, and that I know that doesn't mean I want to run off with them. When I think about, ""*whoa,* that (random person/actor/whatever) is gorgeous,"" and then I realize that thinking that didn't mean I was in any way less attracted to my spouse, or that I wanted to cheat, I realize that I need to put *his* finding other people attractive in that same context.

Neither of you will ever stop finding other people attractive. There will be people who are physically attractive to you, people you just click with socially, all sorts of things. What matters is what you do when those people come along. Your boyfriend seems to be doing his best to be considerate of you."
I'd say getting the shit beat out of you for no real reason is a good reason to file a report. Then again maybe I'm a whiny little shit for expecting people to behave in a normal fucking manner or face the consequences of the law. 
"OP, in your place I would have no problem with the occasional night out drinking if my husband would agree to use Uber and not drive. That's the hill on which I would die. "
"Been with my wife for almost 30 years, god forbid this was me I would already be separated.  I’m an amateur photographer and pictures are so very important to me.  I would not be able to look at OP.  Pregnant or not.  I might even try and get custody.    My kids would never let it go either.    

I think this is beyond repair. "
"Look man I'm not arguing with you about what you should or should not want in your house, I'm just telling you that you have unrealistic expectations about what a houseshare situation looks like."
Are you sure it's because she's white or because she's 18?  Either way pretty cringe situation 
"The ""or else we need to break up"" ultimatum is one he has used repeatedly. He does tend to yell during arguments, which I realize isn't ""aggressive"" per se, but it really freaks me out and tends to cause me to shut down. (His family are yellers, mine are definitely not.) "
"The alcohol did *not* make him hit you.

It's easy to shove the blame onto a bottle to preserve your image of him as a caring guy.  The problem is that he chose to hit you.  He *chose* to insult you, endanger others, to push you and then to hit you.  At each and every moment he had a *choice* and those choices revealed who he really is.

Don't repeat the mistakes of every abused woman in history.  There was something I read on this subreddit that is painfully true;  Why allow your partner to treat you with less respect than you'd give a stranger.

What you would do if a stranger hit you?"
"&gt; I worry that I've created a narrative here in which I deliberately victimize myself in order to get sympathy, even though that wasn't my conscious intention.

Look, your SO threatened to break up with you unless you admitted your intentions were to hurt him. Clearly those were NOT your intention. Fact. Right? 

Even if those WERE your secret, subconscious reasons...why is it considered ""silent treatment"" to not continue a conversation when he hasn't asked a question? You weren't NOT responding to him. The conversation ended, he didn't want it to be over, and instead of actually engaging again he blamed you for not being a mind reader.

This is not healthy."
"Aw friend.  You seem like such a good person, willing to give him the benefit of the doubt but your kindness and empathy is being used as a weapon against you.  I just adopted a little shelty a few months ago, and I've changed my entire lifestyle to avoid leaving her at home more than a few hours.  I can't imagine the level of sociopath you'd have to be to literally let a small creature starve to death, dying of dehydration, covered in their own urine and feces and vomit.  I'm directing that at him, not you.  He's beaten you down to the point where you're complicit though.  Please, please do not let him continue to do this to both dogs.  Please get the fuck outta there and do not look back.  He's literally resorting to torture to keep you in line.  Imagine, god, what would he do to a small child.  I would really consider continuing a pregnancy that gave this man access to you for the next two decades.  You can start over.  You can give yourself and your dogs a happy life and one day this will all be a distant nightmare you look back on, so fucking proud of yourself and strong as shit for making it through this nightmare.  There's no way six months of this hasn't done a lot of damage to you.  Please seek help once you've escaped this insanely dangerous situation.

You are all those poor dogs have.  You are the difference.  Sending you lots and lots of love.  Please keep us updated, we care.   "
"&gt;So, how many committed relationships have you seen where the parents of both parties are married to each other? Since, this is so much of a similar situation?

Perhaps I wasn't clear: I'm not saying that *the parents of both parties are married to each other* is common, what I'm saying is that the fact that the parents of both parties are married to each other is *irrelevant* to their relationship, and that their relationship is not odd, it is a garden variety relationship. **Their** relationship is normal. The relationship between their *parents* is unusual, that's all. 

I know this is impossible for you to accept just yet - hopefully with time you'll start to see some truth in it - but honestly, truly their parentage is irrelevant. Yes, it truly is.

Their parents met after they were born. They had more or less grown up before their parents married. They are two separate people from  - sorry to keep digging the kinfe in - two separate families. 

"
"You might be a great candidate for an IUD. It's extremely effective, long-lasting, and requires almost no action on your part. Also, he probably won't even be able to tell you have one so you can skip the conversation with him altogether if necessary. "
"Yeahhhh no.


If he was staying for free or something I could see him abiding by your rules.

But if he is paying rent he needs autonomy like an adult.

If you do not want an equal partnership in living then do not rent rooms for cash.

It's totally fine to not be cut out for housemate lifestyle. You have supplied yourself with your own home. This is your castle. I don't think there's room in it for a housemate. "
"Do you never plan on having children? 

Have you ever done something super nice for someone else? How does it make you feel? "
"She only went on the ""break"" so she could fuck your friend guilt free and say ""we were on a break, it's not cheating I did nothing wrong.""  What a rotten woman. You did the right thing by dumping her. Now block her and completely remove her and your old friend from your life. "
"&gt; I just want a husband and partner

You may find him after you divorce the current one."
That is terrifying! I hope everyone was okay.
"I'm very sorry for your loss.

That being said, you're grieving right now, so you may not be in the best head space to talk to your friend calmly and rationally. You told her it was OK to miss the funeral. She also has a life and career outside you and your family. She had obligations that she has to attend to. Holding this against her when you explicitly her it was alright is just wrong. You need to let this resentment go or you risk poisoning your friendship. 

She's not wrong for working on her project, and neither are you for grieving. But focus on being through this yourself rather than how your friend may have slighted you. "
"If you plan on not having sex with her for the next four months, I can guarantee this will be an issue if you still want more kids. "
Seriously! It wouldn't make it better at all but I'm curious: does he at least offer to look after the baby while you have pamper days? Or get a nanny or a babysitter?
"This was really upsetting, as someone who lost her father (her best friend) at a young age. My dad was always the photographer, so there are very few photos of him. What I do have is scattered around the house I live in with my boyfriend, who came into my life 3 weeks before my dad died. If my boyfriend even thought about throwing any of it out, he would no longer have a girlfriend. 

I feel for OPs husband and stepdaughter. OP knew what she was doing, even with memories no longer in the house, people would still talk about the wife/mum, it will never stop regardless of how hard you tried to erase any physical memory. I'm heartbroken for OPs husband having to tell his daughter about this. "
"As both an extremely private person and someone who is wildly curious about people I feel like I can identify with both sides here. I grew up in a house where I wasn’t really allowed to have boundaries when it came to information about my life, so when I moved out and started to make my place in the world, I thought that was the norm. I felt *entitled* to certain information from people and was mad when they didn’t tell me. It took me awhile to learn that I’m not entitled to any information about anybody’s life. Rather, they get to choose what they share with me. 

Here, your friend said she found your Tumblr and kept following it because she was worried about your mental health. Maybe that’s true; if it is, I do not think it was the whole truth. The fact of the matter is she felt like she had a right to (was entitled to) this information and used deceptive means to get it. This isn’t ok, and it’s a serious breach of trust. She needs to understand that. I would recommend telling her that she violated your trust, and telling her you need to take a step back from the friendship. 

Do not make excuses for her. Her desire to know that you weren’t mad at her isn’t an excuse to do what she did. Moreover, it shows a *serious* lack of trust on her part; she clearly cannot take you at your word, not because of anything you’re doing but because she chooses not to. It’s fucking exhausting to have to constantly reassure someone. 

If you’re not sure how to bring it up with her (it’s not a convo that’d be easy to start), you can always wait until she brings up something you’ve posted about but haven’t told her. “I only posted about that on Tumblr. I suspected from other things you’ve said that you’ve been following me but I wasn’t sure and no that I am, we need to talk about it.” 

Good luck. "
"Yes, tag SIL in it so all the same people see it."
"At 32 it's far past time to be using your parents home as a home.  And getting let go during your probationary period isn't a good sign.  If I were you, I'd focus on improving work performance and hirability, and ignore the family."
I don’t have any advice unfortunately. Just want to say mad props to your SIL. 
"Adrenaline is a hell of a drug. He was just ATTACKED. 

Add that to a head-injury, he was not himself.

He should get that head checked at the ER ASAP.

TLDR: this is not him. Dont worry. "
"Yes, thank you, you are right. If I feel uncomfortable doing it and he forces me too then yeah, I don't think I would think of him the same way.

Well he has brought it up in a non-sexual environment. What I'm confused about is why he suddenly changed so much. Like all of a sudden he's thinking that I'm not having anal with him because I'm not attracted to him. When in fact, I MARRIED HIM because I'm attracted to him! 

When you are young you experiment, when you are old you know what you like. This seems obvious to me but he seems to think I'm not attracted to him therefore I won't do anal."
"Actually he makes it pretty clear that the practical and financial aspects were taken care of – but that he was emotionally distant. So she was lonely in dying. That's a horrible thing for him to have imposed on her, unfair and unnecessary. Human contact and human love are part of dying ""well"". "
"I'm legit confused by this comment. 

Why should she suffer to make HIM better when she so clearly made a huge legal decision to separate herself from him completely? He needs his own, personal therapy. And even then, it'd take moving a mountain for her to trust him again. 

Or maybe you missed the part where they're fully divorced?"
"Be angry. Be very angry. Because fuck your selfish asshole mother for putting you through hell while being a lesbian all along. And fuck your father for being so supportive of her while previously supporting the abuse of his child. It's one thing to be self-loathing, it's quite another to project that onto your child. Has either of those assholes even thought to apologise?"
"I love it, but I would say everyone finds peace in their own way instead of God. 

I know plenty of religious folk, some can handle a stern no. Many can't. Don't give wiggle room by implying you may find God someday. lol she may think she needs to try harder."
"Once in a lifetime opportunity to see this with my buddies! ... oh wait, they’re releasing a new one every 12-18 months now. 

Sure, the theater may have opening night collectible swag, but the red flag here is that it’s clear he values time with his buddies over time with your family celebrating a major milestone. "
You are breaking the rules and do something that not only harms yourself but others too. Yeah he has every right to be annoyed and you're lucky he doesn't report you.
"He had a boundary. It was made clear to you. You placed ""not being rude"" to this friend, above his comfort levels. In this case I don't think it was a red flag on his part; he didn't limit your relationships, but a 1:1 vacation with another guy is *a lot* to ask of a serious partner OP. 

You want different things and that's okay. But I do think you showed a level of...skewed priorities here. Chances are your friend would have understood you were now in a relationship. There are basic boundaries, and I don't think they were respected here. 

You'll need to move on and consider this another lesson in human relations lol. It's okay; I'm sorry it ended like this, but we all learn from these situations. "
"&gt; At first I blamed my behavior at the fact that ..... Then I blamed her family... Then I blamed the bad neighborhood and racist neighbors.... Then we got a nice apartment in a nice neighborhood but I blamed my behavior on...  Then I blamed on the fact that we got pregnant early...

Stop blaming other people for your life, and start taking responsibility.

&gt; Is there something wrong with me? What can/should I do? How can I change?

Easy.  Listen to your wife when she is like this:

&gt; My wife tells me how to talk to our daughter, tells me exactly what to say and how to treat them both so that everyone is happier yet I don't take her advice. 

Well, why the fuck don't you take this sort of advice?  Is it somehow easier and less stressful to cut yourself, hit yourself, stab yourself and drink cleaning solution than it is to listen to your wife giving you clear advice on how to speak to them with love and respect?"
"She has a *free pass to fuck other people* and she STILL can't help but be a sneaky shit! That means she *needs* it to be hurting you, OP. Fucking run."
"Yes, start at school, OP. It's most likely your college will have some counseling services you can use. Look into that.  Take some time to absorb this. Then you will probably want to talk to your aunt and parents about what you've found out. "
"I vacation with my lady. Not a lady friend. To me, vacation time is limited and should concentrate on my SO, my family and my friends in that order. He ranks higher than you in how she spends her time. 

Does that seem right to you?"
People are allowed to have hard dealbreakers. Sorry I don't want to be with someone that paid for sex. Sorry I find it nasty. 
"Playing games is always a dumb idea.

&gt;  Now I'm very introverted, don't have a lot of friends, pretty awkward, and don't go out a lot. 

Fix that, then you don't have to pretend and play games."
He sounds pretty amusing...but I could see it getting old after awhile.
We can't know. Probably she assumed her mother would be a reasonable person.
This is the exact thing OP should reply with. Its not mean it's just crystal clear. 
"This sounds like part of the story is missing. Who's this woman? Why is she messaging you? Why does she have 5 boyfriends? What did you post about her? Why did you text the friend and how did you know that persons info? What kind of advice are you actually looking for?

If you're scared, call the cops."
"Ok, that sounds like some twisted, sadistic game. I wonder what would happen if you completely ignore him any time he does it; just turn your attention to him off like a switch. If he's laughing at you, he doesn't exist. Walk away, go to another room and close the door, and don't let him pull you into a discussion about it.


If it's not an actual neurological or psychological problem, then he's getting off on it somehow. I honestly would go stay somewhere else for a while, if not just break up with him. I _definitely_ wouldn't have sex with him. 


If it's intentional, he's so beyond disrespectful and cruel that I don't know how you can ever trust him again..."
Break it off. You've only been with her a short while and all of that time she has been carrying her ex's baby. 
"That he opened the dress, looked at it despite all the traditions about it being a surprise, LEFT IT FLOPPED ON THE COUCH, and proceeded to bitch and moan about it yet again and try to make you feel terrible about it...

He really doesn't sound like a catch, OP. You're going to feel hated and stupid in that beautiful dress because of his actions leading up to your wedding. He has effectively ruined this for you. "
"I'm utterly disgusted. These poor dogs. You are abusing this dog. I say you meaning both of you. You *live* here. You are watching a dog spend its life in a cage in its own urine and you have done nothing. Who cares what he threatens, your home is a fucking hell hole for this poor creature. Your horrible human husband went and got a HEELER one of the most difficult and highest-surrendered breeds. He's not only an idiot, he's a dangerous idiot. 

This is your home. You are allowing him to neglect this animal, citing his threat as justification ?! Get your dog, get both dogs and LEAVE. Or take your dog and call Animal Services. I'm utterly astounded that you act like your hands are tied. 

You are having a CHILD with an ABUSER. Someone who WITHOLDS FOOD from an innocent and defenseless creature. He's disgusting and you know what OP?  If you don't leave and DO something, so are you. 

Step. Up. "
Dude.  No. She wasn't secretly sexually assaulted. She just doesn't find you sexually attractive anymore. It's over. 
"&gt;And yes, of course kids take naps! But honestly when a baby is sleeping most people use that time to get the chores done, it's not quality self care time, you know?

Not to mention she's got a 5 month old *and* a 3 year old. Not all 3 year olds take naps, and when they do it's usually just 1 nap. So that's *maybe* once during the day (assuming the 3 yo naps, and naps at the same time as the 5 mo) she doesn't have the 3 yo (whom she says is being very clingy lately) attached to her hip which makes getting things done more difficult.

&gt;The human body does not shut down after being at work for 8/10 hours.

Yep. OP says her husband gets free time to himself almost every day, goes out *at least once* per weekend, and gets to go into the garage to do his hobbies. If he's got enough energy for his hobbies and going out, he can watch the kids for an hour while mom takes a bath or goes to a coffee shop or does a hobby of her own or whatever."
"It kind of sounds like you're putting HSV-I into the same mental bin as rarer STI's. That's just the wrong way to look at it. The biological story can can complex, but I'm presuming he doesnt have a reason to think that he has a dangerous strain of it.   


If someone acted concerned about the fact that I have HPV, my first reaction may not be empathetic, as they're way off-base - and their error implies that there is something wrong with me when there is not.  I don't want to come down hard on you because I think your error is understandable - but it intrinsically involves some offensive thoughts about him that are unjustified, so it's not strange to react inappropriately to your concern."
"She's only remorseful because she got caught though. I would be more willing to buy the whole ""I felt guilty for so long/it was one bad mistake and I want to fix it"" if IMMEDIATELY after she tried to fix her humungous mistake. If I was in that situation, I would desperately be trying to recover the deleted pictures, rummage through the garbage and get the polaroids back, go to all the people I ""donated"" his late wife's things to and try to get them back. and I would tell my husband and his daughter everything. THIS is what he should have done if she was truly remorseful. She's only 'remorseful' now because she told her husband what she did, probably because she thought since she was pregnant he wouldn't leave her or hate her for it. "
"This isn't about how to deal with Kate and Mate.  You're doing fine on that front.  This is about how to convince your wife to let up on you and get her to understand and support your decision, even if she doesn't agree with it.  

The first point to make to her is that your motives are not punishment or revenge, they are to keep yourself safe from shitty people.  When your friends ditched you, they showed you that other people's opinions of you were more important than their own.  Whether they did it because they really thought you were capable of doing those things, or because they didn't want to have the social stigma of being a friend of someone accused of the thing...the end result was that they were willing to believe rumors over their friend.  They ditched you at a crucial moment in your life when you needed support.  It's 100% reasonable to not want those people in your life at all, in any respect.  You can't trust them.  

Your wife needs to understand that you're not saying no because you're trying to punish them, you're saying no because you legit don't need these kind of people in your life.   If you were to show up to their wedding and flaunt your ""I don't care about your shit"" attitude on their special day, THAT would be way more immature and revenge-y than just ignoring them and moving on with your life.  

Secondly, if they were really sorry and understood the impact of their actions, they would be showing a hell of a lot more respect for you.  Someone who understands how crappy their actions were also understands that they aren't entitled to your forgiveness, and would realize that they might never get it.   The fact that they keep hounding you about it means that they STILL don't see what they did as that bad, because they feel like you should be over it by now.   You not being over it makes them confront the fact that you might NEVER get ""over it"", and instead of being like ""wow, we really hurt him, maybe we should leave him alone"" they're trying to strong-arm you in to forgiveness so they can tell themselves they're not bad people anymore.  

Point out to your wife that their persistence has nothing to do with how contrite they are, and everything to do with how they feel about what happened.  It's still all about them, and not you.  Hopefully, she will understand why you are choosing to do what you're doing, and even if she doesn't agree with it, she'll respect and support your own choices with your own ex-friends.  

"
"She always feels guilty since she's the oldest. I told her it doesn't really matter when we're all adults. Unfortunately she has the ""but they're family"" mindset. Which I find to be very annoying."
"weirdo

the spelling ""wierdo"" bothers me unreasonably.

Otherwise, I agree"
"Excuse for what?

Firstly, how could I have known about your dyslexia? 

Also, does you having dyslexia mean that nobody is ever allowed to correct your spelling?

I mean, you did spell it incorrectly, originally. You have now corrected your spelling. Where's the harm in pointing out a mis-spelling which the person then corrects?

I called it out because it's one of the most common spelling mistakes in the English language, and it genuinely bothers me every time I see it. For most people, it's simple intellectual laziness. In your case, yes, you need to make extra effort to ensure stuff is spelled correctly. I acknowledge that.

I still think you should spell things correctly."
"That makes no sense how that puts you in a better position legally. Without a written agreement, you’re in a *worse* position. Doing all cash means an angry tenant could report you to the IRS or the city. Lease agreements are what protects the landlord just as much as the tenant. 


Don’t set yourself up ina situation where you could be on the hook for back taxes, penalties and interest to the taxman."
Lying to you was not a drunken mistake
"&gt;I'm guessing the advice here will amount to ""just focus on yourself and don't pay attention to her.""

No, the advice is going to be ""Your bosses are terrible and you should focus on finding another job ASAP."""
"When he sobers up you need to talk to him about this. 

If you decide to not leave him this situation will always be in the back of your mind and any trust you had is gone for a long time.

If this happened to me I would be gone for good before he wakes up with a hangover. "
"Yeah the two year old should be shown how to crawl backwards down the stairs.

But this guy is forgetting to close the gate to the POOL. "
"You can just talk to them. Tell them it isn't you and you don't care what they do. 

Unless they look like meth heads. Then don't even bother."
"That is a good point. The nice thing is that I do have more than one retirement account, unlike my wife. Her plan is that our daughter will take care of us in our old age. My response was that it was unfair of us to expect that."
Maybe you can confide your sister-in-law? She had her doubts so she might understand what you are doing through
You kick him back out.
"!!!!!!

Guy here, but I'm exactly like you and /u/hothouseorchid in this respect. A tense conversation with me will often have many pauses as I internally work through my feelings. It's important to me that I don't escalate the situation by using language that will only make things more emotionally charged-- my primary goals are always to communicate feelings and find resolutions, never ""inflict emotional distress"". 

My first long term girlfriend HATED this. She gave me the same reason: not losing my shit meant that I didn't care. Which seems silly to me since all of that measured response and introspection takes immense effort on my part. I'll never forget what she said: ""I just wish you would yell sometimes so that I knew you loved me"" ??????

But yeah OP, you aren't being manipulative. He is. Dump this prick and find someone else with good conflict resolution skills. "
"It is just as bad. Either he thinks you *can't* negotiate with your boss by yourself, or you *won't*, so he has the right to do it anyway, whether you want to or not. It's insulting no matter how you look at it. How does he justify that?

I mean, why didn't he suggest that *you* talk to your boss about your hours? I'm not saying you should have agreed, but that's what a respectful-but-concerned SO would have done. Even if it was your weekend softball coach he was talking to, it's so patronizing to go behind an adult's back like that."
No one's saying it isn't hard. But when you behave selfishly you have to deal with the consequences. His children don't have to interact with him. They're allowed to feel hurt. Their mother just died. He needs to give them space and time. He can't make this better. What's done is done. 
He said how the heck am I gonna take an uber over there and that I won't be okay. I mean even he refuses to give me a ride because it's 20 mins away soooo...uber it is.
"I think you are missing the point. The other commenters are starting from the premise that if you stay home, keeping the house is your responsibility, and earning the family income is his responsibility. 

Based on the fact that you have two children, one of whom is out of the house during the day, and you seem reluctant to explain what you do with your time, we are having a hard time understanding whether you are doing your job or mismanaging your time."
Good news! You now know that your friend is a creepy jerk!
"&gt; My [19F] boyfriend [22M] is breaking up with me

No, he isn't. YOU broke up with HIM.

When you decide to drink, you're responsible for what you do when drunk.

He is being a man and taking you at your word. You are done."
"Let him know that.

Your mother is being a raging piece of shit with the way that she is treating you. There is no doubt that she is having a load of emotional issues processing and accepting this news. Is/was she religious? Perhaps she is fearful that you won't give her grandchildren? Whatever her reason for lashing out at you the way she has been, *these are her issues and there is nothing you can do about them until/unless she decides to address them in a healthy way*.

The way she is treating you is NOT your fault. *This is all on her.* If your parents divorce, it will be because your father has decided that he doesn't want to live his life with a woman so hateful and close-minded that she can't show her daughter unconditional love and acceptance for simply being who she is. He knows you deserve better.

The good news is that you have a support system. Your father, your siblings, your grandparents. They have already demonstrated that they have your back. This is invaluable. Lean on them. Let them know how much it means to you that you have their support and love."
"I think your friends didn't like her and were looking for an excuse to shove her out. I've seen, and even been guilty of, this before- when you dislike someone, even minor infractions get treated as huge problems to try and win others over to your view. If everyone liked her, they would have been very uncomfortable but I think there would be a *lot* more benefit of the doubt.

So, you could and should tell your friends you didn't really mind it- but honestly I think she just doesn't fit in. If it's not this, it'll be the next thing that everyone jumps on her for. 

I would personally suggest you sit your friend down, the one who is dating her. Tell him that you didn't find it offensive, you know she didn't know your history, and you don't wnat him to break up with her for that.

But it may not be a bad idea for him to break up with her because it sounds like she does NOT fit in with you and your friends."
"your family sucks, and I wouldn't see them or speak to them again for a long time, if I were you. Evidently they are not that enamored of their grandchild or you!

Here's my advice: you need to build up your own support structure for you and your son, because your family is not that into you guys. They suck. I'm from a crappy nuclear family where my parents had pathological favoritism; I was the scapegoat and my sister was the golden child. I have my own family now. In your case, look to your friends. Look for other mom friends with a kid about your kid's age.  

I am so sorry your family are being like this. It completely sucks. I am sure you don't deserve it. But you can't change them. You're going to have to just go on being fabulous with your son &amp; building up a lovely life for yourself that isn't dependent on them."
"Hey OP, unfortunately relationships removes everything with the words 'sexual assault' in. I would repost using the word 'trauma' instead, and people will know what you mean."
Exactly my thought. I still have a bottle of those somewhere from mine.
"Go to the police. A Sargent will likely go with you to get the stuff.  


BTW -- she's not doing this ""to get to know every detail of your life"", she's doing it to control you. You could tell er every single thing about your life and she'd still do this. "

"As a guy, if a girl has a bf and decides to go on a trip with me and told her bf to stay at home, I'm thinking she wants to hook up. I can't see it any other way. Nothing else makes sense in my head.

"&gt; he hasn't kicked her out immediately

i'm guessing her pregnancy is the only thing keeping her in that home."
Can you get her a tv for her room?
"Rent isn't a waste of money when the choice is pay rent somewhere or live in a box on the side of the road. She can't just expect to mooch off people for the rest of her life, she can find an apartment with rent she can afford. "
"Agreed! I know I shouldn't be stunned and horrified by this; God knows there are a lot of posts on justnomil about SOs like OP. However, I can't help but be horrified by his apparent unwillingness to truly come to grips with his father's abusive and outright criminal behavior toward his wife. He used a key to invade his adult son and DIL's home in order to peep on the DIL, ffs! He peeped on her multiple times, to the point that they quickly moved out to avoid the issue!    

This is not a grandparent any child should be in contact with. This man is clearly predatory. (As an aside, I really hope he didn't have secret cameras in their old house, since he owned it.) If OP isn't willing to cut off all ties with him (which to me seems the best course of action), then his wife and children should be able to have no contact with OP's sexual predator father, and be 100% supported in doing so by OP himself: No throwing them under the bus; no putting the discomfort on his wife instead of voicing the decision as a joint one; no minimizing or downplaying predator dad's actions (i.e., ""my wife claims"" or ""he did not pull back the curtain""); no pushing them to get back in contact for the holidays or in a year or two, because predator dad is ""sorry"" or ""better now"" or because ""he's faaaaaamily"" and they ""should be able to forgive him.""    

If I were OP's wife, it would break me for my spouse to be willing to throw me (and possibly our children) to the wolves the way OP has. I hope he gets the therapy he clearly needs to reset his normal meter.    "
"Incredibly harsh and utterly dismissive of OP's viewpoint, but I'll be damned if it isn't 100% true.  This kid is going to change so much by the time he's 22 and I even think that's a little young to get engaged because there is STILL a lot of growing up to do from there."
Lol I love this! I might be annoyed enough to do this to him...
"Yeah she's not asking for an open relationship. She thinks that having sex with women isn't equal to her having sex with other men so she should be allowed to do that and not have it be considered cheating. That's not fair to this guy, nor to her hypothetical future female partners. 


They need to break up."
Everyone having their own space is a really healthy thing. My bf and I have separate bedroom and it works well for that purpose.
"&gt; I love my boyfriend and wouldn't break up with him over his kids,

The kids are 11 and 12. It's going to be a loooooong time before they move out. And what if you want to live with your boyfriend?

&gt; I find myself unable to have a conversation with my boyfriend on many outings, or even walk next to him. 

Welcome to life with kids. This is how it will be if you do want to move in with him at some point. If this is not the life you want right now, then he is not the boyfriend for you right now."
"There is a lot of great advice here, so I'm going to try not to repeat it. I just want to point one thing out.

He TELLS you that your own personal experiences are not real and that your feelings in these circumstances are not valid.

Your therapist is not telling you how to think or feel. Instead she LISTENS and ASKS questions that make you THINk about the things you experience and feel. 

His real problem is not that your therapist is biased. His problem is that she is making you open your eyes to the situation so that you can accept the things you know and feel. His problem is that she is allowing you to feel validated and believe in yourself instead of bending to his will and allowing him to control your perception.

So who do you think you should trust, yourself or someone known to be manipulative and abusive? Who gets something out of deceiving you? It isn't you and it certainly isn't your therapist."
Grandma AMA please.  She needs to share her wisdom!
That's... just really weird to me and I can't really understand what would motivate him to act/think like that. Maybe other people here have a better clue... maybe counselling would help with that aswell? I'm stumped.
"^this OP.

Call them out for being creepy, obsessed with your sex life, etc. If they try to change the subject, be like ""uh no, I asked you a question. Why do you keep bringing up my sex life?""

Looking someone in the eyes and saying ""Why would you say that?"" in a judgmental tone is probably my favorite way of stopping this kind of shit. It's extremely effective "
"Does his sister pay rent? Is her name on the lease? The answer to both of those questions is no, and she should absolutely ask before just coming in unannounced. I feel bad for your fiancé that you are putting him in that position. It’s not fair to him. And it’s not fair to OP. When you live with your SO by yourselves it is common knowledge that that’s their space and guests may be welcome but both parties should agree and it shouldn’t even be a question that the third party should get permission to come over. 

Family really doesn’t have anything to do with it, unless it’s an emergency or something. Which clearly isn’t the case here. "

This is creepy. They’re women, or girls. Also don’t go into anyone’s bedroom while they’re sleeping. And three times walking into someone in the bathroom? What’s that about?"

"&gt; My wife got to spend 90 stress free days with our daughter

&gt; my daughter screamed for 30 minutes straight and I could not console her so I called my wife to see what if any secrets she had

Starting to think you have lots of fault in this. A new born is not stress free. And you freaking now it since you couldn't even handle her for 30 minutes. You're her father, you should be able to handle a baby for one freaking night. You have internet, freaking use it and figure out yourself how to deal with the baby.

&gt; Sex with a stranger

Dude, you have a ton of problems, don't add a stranger to the list.

Honestly, get into couples therapy. Get therapy for yourselves. You two got such a long road to fix all of this resentment and weird priorities.

Have you actually saved up any money for the vacation?"
"So not only is he throwing his relationship with you out the window, he could also lose his career. Big Navy doesn't take kindly to drug use of any kind so he's be out if they found out (random drug tests are common). I know you've been together for a while but do you want to marry a man who possibly could screw over his entire life in one night? I have a harder stance on drugs than some so that couples with the cheating, I'd be done on the spot."
"I get being frustrated about not being able to make friends- it is tough as an adult. But, really, you're 30 years old and you can't go clothes shopping by yourself? I know it's not as fun without friends or someone to chat with, but you are a capable adult. You can walk into a store and pick something out, try it one, decide if it looks good, and buy it or put it back. If you're relying totally on other people to prop you up and make you happy- that's too much pressure on other people. You need to be able to function as a separate entity and carry out everyday errands by yourself. It's not terrible, it's actually very efficient. 

As for making friends- Meetup is a great way to meet people. Join and find groups with which you have similar interests. Book clubs, cycling, running, gaming, dogs, hiking, rock climbing, watching a fave show, nerdy girls, fashonistas, chatty girls, quiet girls, etc- they have groups for everything. 

The best way to make friends, though, is to be happy with who you are. Get into therapy to figure out why you're so unhappy being alone with yourself. Maybe your hubby will see your progress and it will inspire him to try it out for his anxiety."
"Your father has a heart condition, he's not a child that needs information filtered for him.  It's condescending to not tell him the truth.  He's still a man and a father.  He deserves to be told the truth in a calm factual way.

My father had very serious heart disease the last fifteen years of his life.  He would have been insulted if I hid something this important from him."
"If she dislikes the cat so much, she should give it up for adoption. What she’s doing now is cruel. "
"&gt; However, someone once told me that men rarely go out of their way to “save” a woman they wouldn’t fuck, so I’d keep a very close eye on this.

My ex-husband used to run around town ""helping"" female acquaintances of his with random things, lending them money, ""saving"" them from unfortunate situations, doing big favors for them (that he almost never did for me). For some reason he never did that with his male friends, and all the girls he ""saved"" happened to be pretty/his ""type.""

Everyone always told me that my husband was such a nice guy. He definitely was, but only when he believed he'd be getting something out of the situation. Whether that be ""white knight"" points or sex or status. When I needed him to fix something he'd groan and drag his feet, but when Damsel in Distress needed him to fix something he'd turn into friggin Superman."
"You have no proof or reason to believe he is currently cheating on you right now. But its clear that he doesn't think cheating is wrong, at all. So there's absolutely no reason to believe he wont do it in the future "
"Stop making your insecurities her problem. 

And why the hell are you waiting until marriage, that makes no sense. "
I suspected that. This means that this issue will keep coming up even if you change jobs.
"They did, thank god. I really had to beg though. The guy who contacted me via AirBNB first said I ""should've discussed it directly with the host"" and that I ""left due to personal feelings, so they can't guarantee whether they can get me a refund or not"". 

This mindset is rampant. That fucker should be in jail. Maybe not for what he did to me, but what he will and probably HAS done to other women as well."
"Revisit your beliefs as to why you want to keep the baby.

 The baby's life is not like anyone says it is. It is an entirely new paradigm of existence for yourself and another construct of creation that is your responsibility to nurture and take care of for another 18 years of your life. 

 The first few years may be the most toughest character building years of your life, but the rest may not be. And that will rest in your conscious for the rest of your life. Especially at he cost of your most prized relationships with your father, grandmother, and your friends.

 I've met old mothers that thought they were making a morally correct decision by keeping a baby. But it tore them apart into drug addiction and alcoholism for the rest of their lives because they simply couldn't handle that life of responsibility in the face of poverty. A choice they *willingly* made.

I don't know your character and life circumstances. It may be a great choice to make and you may make your world and the worlds od others greater in the process. But you need to understand the responsibility and risk before you choose it. Religion distorts it. You have to understand it for yourself. It's not all rainbows and glitter."
But do the grandparents deserve to raise children they never asked for? It's not very fair on them either. 
"Oh man, my parents did this, it worked great! My little brother used to have the worst nightmares but my parents just took a spray bottle of water and put a ""monster spray"" label on it, worked like a charm! Thanks for reminding me, I had totally forgotten about that."

"She can spend her money how she wants (unless her daughter is being neglected).

"Ditch him. You're not compatible and you clearly have his life together and he's still figuring it out. He's a 29 year old and still having issues paying rent? That's a huge red flag. Good thinking putting the loan for the house in your name. If you're the one buying the house, of course you get the final say. You did try to include him in the process, but considering he brushed it off, he lost that right to get a say. He's being unreasonable. Not you. "

"&gt; Thank you, it is terrifying thinking of the future and knowing I will likely lose most if not all of the relationships I care about if I divorce him.

You can make new friends and gain new relationships. Anyone who will cut ties with you because you got away from someone who is physically abusing you is not really a friend anyway.

&gt; But I just think of my boys and I will make any sacrifice for them.

Good!

&gt; I am young and I know deep down that I would be ok in the long run.

You will! You've come this far with huge cultural, family, and social pressures not to see the light. And yet you have."
"My GF has BPD, So it's basically Anxiety city. but my god I love her to death. Would deal with the bad 1000x over for her. She's so incredible. 

Dudes an asshole."
"So not only is your family expected to pay for their meal but also for her family's?  If she's ""hosting"" both families and demanding that your side bring the main parts of the meal then she is so far out of line she can't even see the line anymore.  You are in the right and she's being a jerk about you not adhering to her looking like the perfect hostess to her family. "
What will holidays look like when you get married? Why does this woman get to dictate YOUR family holidays??
"Tell him to knock it off. Seriously. Walk away. Let him know how it makes you feel. Btw, I ran through your comment history like another poster did...wow. I would not out up with your situation, especially with a man 10 years older than you. This just screams emotional abuse."
Why did you post here if you were just going to write off everyone's advice? Your being a real asshole to the people trying to help. 
"You can also use something like an iPad as an opportunity to teach a kid to be careful with and take good care of their more expensive belongings. Explaining that they won't get another one if they break it - maybe not too relevant to a 4 year old, but when the kid is older. ""This was expensive, and you have to take good care of it, because you won't get another one if you don't care for it and it breaks."" That's a good way to let your kid have nice stuff without them becoming super entitled."
"If your opinion mattered, he would have gotten it from you. He didn't. "
"I mean, this is who he is. 

Often our partners do little things that bug us, and we let them slide because they're not going to change, and they bring enough value into our lives in other ways that it's worth paying the price of admission. 

Dealing with this sounds like it's his price of admission. 

If you're not willing to pay it, don't ride the ride. "
"Totally this. It is bonkers to me that people aren't bringing food to contribute, although I'm sure the mere suggestion of that would send OP's ridiculous mom to the hospital. It's pretty standard that guests bring at least the wine, dessert (and in the case of a 50-person meal, all the sides!) so the host isn't killing themselves. 

OP I'm so sorry you're in this situation. Hoping you can wrestle it away from mom and involve the whole family in making some new traditions. Find a way to honor your late aunt while breathing new life into the way it's done. Everybody pick their favorite upbeat song to create a family playlist for a kitchen dishwashing dance party? "
"It has nothing to do with your husband. Your child needs to sleep in his own room and you should be doing that without your husband's insistence.

He isn't a security blanket. He isn't a sense of comfort. He is an entire human being, constantly growing up. 

You will learn to sleep without your baby. The longer you wait, the harder it will be. 

Grow up, you're raising a child. Act like it."
"Yeah, but she mentioned it's mostly her nicer work clothing, plus luggage.  If she needs this for work, she could be out a couple thousand of dollars (Blazers and shoes can be expensive).  I think she's either got to fake repentance to get her stuff, or consider involving the police to retrieve the things that she paid for."
"If your cousin is a minister, that sounds like a great reason to ask them to lead the prayer.

If your mom wants to call the elders and invite them, she's welcome to take that off of your plate.

You do not have to play social games around accepting money.  Hosting a 50 person event is expensive.  Unless your mother is paying for everything, you don't need to play by her rules here.  I might offer her this as a compromise, depending on her personality -- if she wants to pay for the cost of hosting the event, you're happy to turn down the rest of the family's money.  Otherwise, she doesn't care enough to have a say.  That said, I probably wouldn't offer this, because she already thinks she has too much of a say.

Traditions change over time.  The host decides how the party happens.  Your mother can deal."
"I agree so much. Hire a live-in nanny to look after them while you're away for work and kick her ass to the curb. You've told her already that she has to choose ice or the kids. She chose ice. She continues to choose ice. She's not sorry for putting the kids in danger. She's upset that she got caught. She should not be around children aside from supervised visits.

I am a nanny so I'm gonna say this: make absolutely sure that you tell the nanny in the interview not to let anyone in the house who doesn't have a key, don't open the door for anyone, and give him/her a picture of the mom. If she shows up, call the police. Make sure the nanny knows what they're getting into. Be rigorous in your selection. Background checks, references, etc. I know it seems like a lot of money, but your wife is probably spending tons of money on drugs right now so you probably have more money kicking around than you think.

Your children deserve to live in a safe home. They currently don't. Change that, now."
"So literally all animals were ""created by God"" and he ""saw they they were *good*"".  At least that is the consensus for most Abrahamic religions.  This is so absurd.  But logic aside--take a gander over at r/justnoMIL  and gaze into your future if you stay with this person.  I'm not saying to dump him over this, but he needs to be defending you.  If he doesn't have a spine, he needs to get one *quick* because his parents aren't going away, and their beliefs likely aren't going anywhere either.  And there's no reason you should be made to feel this way--ESPECIALLY second hand.  She can't even confront you about this to your face?  No.  The passive aggressiveness is so childish and unnecessary.  There's just so much wrong with this.  "
I will talk to her about how this came about- I'm hoping that there was a degree of random chance to it! 
"&gt; he said he wants to know nothing about it.

This is manipulative and gross as hell. He is essentially trying to punish you for going by insisting that you either pretend you never left, or silencing you when you do want to talk about your experiences.

No partner should be actively silencing you about your life. "
"If he didn't stomp right over her boundaries, chances are that she would be able to accommodate his needs a lot more. When he constantly forces his presence on her, she never gets the air she needs to be able to go back to him and also accommodate his need for contact. Think of it like this, if he gave her half an hour to be herself right when she needs it, she could come back after that time, recharged and *wanting* to be physical/have contact. But because she does not get that time, she also does not get the energy to be physical. 

So its an evil circle. "
"jesus fucking christ I had a tiny bit of sympathy for this guy because I thought maybe you were exaggerating

But nah. that is serious abusive shit. You should leave, not because taking his money is immoral, but because hes gonna do some fucked up shit. "
"You don't own her.

If you don't like what she's doing, then you should break up with her. "
"As a regular smoker, I really don't see what else he can do to be more considerate aside from finding a new spot entirely. If that's not an option, just make a spoof and smoke inside? Cheryl and Marty sound like they need to get a hobby, too."
"Ding, ding, ding!

The woman has not broken her addictions. She's simply shifted them back and forth between her current drug of choice.

My aunt is like this. In her forties now. Alcoholic druggie who's only sober period since her teenage years was when she was pregnant (and only thanks to a lot of family and medical intervention to ensure that).

She stopped drinking a few years back, but has never completely gotten off other drugs. Usually weed, but every now and again it escalates back to crack, heroin, meth or whatever she can get her hands on. Eventually, she'll tone it back down to just ""a little bit of pot"". 

The only way sobriety works is to completely remove the addictive substances. 

"
"Wow.. it's unreal how shameless your brother is.

I bet he is suffering. I don't know if anyone like that could truly be happy on the inside. It isn't on your family to fix him though.. He's reaping the consequences of his own actions. 

It's ok to cut ties with him completely.. In fact it seems the sensible thing to do at this stage. And if mom wants to take his side, (and make no mistake **SHE** is taking sides) that is heartbreaking but so be it.

Stay strong sisters.. Support each other."
"You saw so many red flags and ignored all of them. And you're still surprised? You read all the shit they talked about you and you still got married to one of the shit talkers.

Go look for a lawyer, see how you can get rid of this situation. Perhaps also invest some in counseling. Or sit around and enjoy more of this drama, because you think this is the best you can get ever. I just hope your kid doesn't get exposed to this, because it's bad enough that hers is seeing this as an example of an adult relationship. "
"Tonight is date night and I'm so excited! We are going to cook together, drink some wine and snuggle up on the couch while we watch Halloween movies. I love my husband so much :)"
"My girlfriend and I have officially been dating for 6 months on Sunday. We both are logical people, but the second it came to our relationship, suddenly we are celebrating all the small things. She's adorable, funny, smart and beautiful, and I can't get enough of her. I've never loved someone as much as I love her. Everything in my life is on fire (depression, cancer in family, etc) but every time I hear her voice, it's like a soothing calm wave washing over me. I actually, genuinely believe I won the the relationship lottery. The people who let her go before were fools. She's perfect in every way and I'm never letting her go for as long as she'll have me. I can't wait to learn more about her, she fascinates me, never ceasing to amaze and surprise! Guys, I'm a lovestruck fool.

Thanks for listening to me gush like a 15 year old. I've been needing to tell someone else for the longest time now. "
"For friend 2's wife  yeah I agree but with Friend 1's wife it really doesn't seem inappropriate. Going to raves and concerts with friends is normal. I do, however, feel there might be more here.

Also, if your friends hate you then they aren't your friends."
"Your baby is eight months old and probably not even sleeping through the night yet. The idea that your GF is cheating right now is *highly* unlikely, and it's frankly pretty fucked up that you suspect her of it with absolutely no reason. If she had been doing weird shit like being out at weird times? you might have call to be suspicious. you need therapy."
"It's fine you want to take that attitude, cause it is your house, but I can't think of one reasonable person who would want to live with you. Why even rent the room if you basically act worse than an overbearing parent. "
"I have been on the other side of this. I was told that the first time we had sex wan't consensual more than 2 years after it happened.  Everything up to sex was, but what I thought was a clear question of consent to go all the way wasn't for her. 

I am happy she told me, and wish we had the conversation earlier, it would have given the relationship more of a chance.

We have since broken up.  This was a factor. If we had resolved it earlier, maybe it would have had a better chance, more likely my actions doomed the relationship on that night.  Either way, keeping it inside for 2 years was not good for her mental health, and won't be for you either.

Seek some form of counselling to help you work through this, then you will have a better idea whether bringing it up is good for you. "
"Reddit is always wildly sex-positive (which isn't a bad thing by any means) but even given that I'm surprised how strongly skewed in the pro direction the comments have been.

As to actual advice, I think looking at it as a ""either I don't publish or I risk losing this great guy"" is the wrong way to consider things. Putting aside the relationship, once you write this book every single thing you put in it will be public knowledge and you should go forward with the expectation that everyone you ever have any sort of romantic or platonic relationship with will be fully aware of every detail. The assumption should be anything you put online will be around forever, let alone something specifically promoted with your name attached.

It's great you aren't embarrassed about that time in your life, and that you love telling stories about it when you're drinking with female friends. The problem is once it's written in a book and published you no longer have control over the contexts in which these stories come out and effect your life. It's no longer your adult friends who know these things about you. It's your boss while he's considering whether you get a promotion. It's your older neighbors across the street. It's all the other moms in your newborn group. It's your kid's teenage friends jerking off to it. It's your daughter's in laws bringing it up at thanksgiving. And so on, and so forth. 

Everyone has their own values, and maybe for you complete honesty is paramount and you don't think you'll ever be embarrassed about one of these stories coming up at an inopportune time. Personally, I'd have no problem telling the stories and having my significant other know, but I'd never publicly punish intimate details about my life for the world to know."
"I'm not even sure what you mean by ""go outside."" Are you not allowed to leave to go to class? "
"Your father is abusive. Tell the truth. If you’re unwilling to do that, maybe take the past of least resistance and apply to those schools as wells as some others. Also, the schools will never know if someone called the police on you about this. I’m truly sorry you’re in such a bad situation. The best thing to do will be to get our ASAP. "
"I know this isn't what you want to hear, but...

&gt; 1) because I want to be a good friend to my ex. I don't need to be an asshole regardless of how he's been to me

This right here is why you honestly shouldn't even tell him anything. Why do you want to be friends with someone who doesn't treat you nicely or in a respectful way? You said that he will likely get angry and disappointed when you tell him about you seeing someone new. Good friends don't do that, even if they are exes. If he's a good friend he would be happy that you've moved on and are dating a nice person who you like. Honestly, your ex just seems like he's using you as a friend with benefits. Ditch the guy and move on because his drama might possibly ruin your chances with the new guy. "
"This isn't because of you and the fact that he ""blames"" you is a problem.  What do you mean by that and exactly how does he blame you?

This is because he chose to date a 17 year old when he was 21.  He chose to be in a relationship that, at the time, had a creepy and problematic age gap (can you imagine dating a 16 year old at the age you are now?). He is the one with an unchecked drinking problem who knows he can't trust himself to go out with friends and not drink, say rude things, flirt with everyone, etc.  Regardless he is the one choosing not to go out and to stay home with you.

Moreover, he is the one who can't seem to maintain or make friendships with people unless he goes to bars with them. He is 24 and he really doesn't have friends he can do anything with aside from go out to 21+ places? I remember being 25 and having friends whose partners were 20 or so.  We went out to breweries that allowed minors, had drinks and cocktails with dinner, went to house parties, did other non-drinking centered activities (hiking, camping, beach trips, adult sports teams, game night at friends houses, etc.).  It is weird at his age that he can't find ways to socialize with his friends that aren't bar centered.  Given that he has a drinking problem it is going to be even more of a problem when you can go out to bars because it really sounds like his entire social life is drinking-centered.  Which is a problem for a person who has a drinking problem. 

His friends stopped texting him.  Did he ever text them to do anything that you could do or to do things with them without you?  What was he investing in those friendships.  By 24 most people have other things they like to do aside from just drink, it is his own damn fault that he hasn't put the work into forming friendships that aren't just based on needing to be at bars to be included. "
"&gt; each time I just forgive him for whatever bullshit he does

Until he goes too far and fucking kills you. (Google choking and domestic violence; it's a big indicator that the person will actually kill their victim eventually) You can love him and still recognize that he's dangerous and can't be in your life until he deals with his bullshit."
"&gt; Perhaps part of it is that each of you two parents clearly made an effort to make each child feel like your own, and this seems like an indicator that they dont, that you somehow failed to make it work as a nuclear family. 

THIS. Exactly what I'm trying to explain to other comments saying I should have just expected them to be attracted to each other. My husband and I have never doled out differential treatment to the kids. They've not been his or mine, they're OUR kids, and we've raised them together in the best way we could've. I'm proud of them as individuals, too, but when I was raising a nuclear family with two sibling-kids, I didn't see this coming, and I feel a little attacked by the ""just get over it, you should've expected"" bandwagon.

&gt;It will of course be utterly hellish for everyone if they have an ugly breakup.

That's also one of my concerns. I don't want to have two separate holiday dinners 5 years down the line, because my kids won't even be in the same room as each other.

"I've seriously never considered it from that angle. I've ran this through my head a billion times, and never once thought of it that way. Thank you. So so much."
"Seriously. I have obsessive anxiety, social anxiety, and obsessive anxiety. It's pretty debilitating, and yet my husband has been around for over a decade and isn't going anywhere. Your fear makes complete sense, at least to me (generalized anxiety means worrying about *eeeeeeverything* haaaayyy), but you'll absolutely 100% find someone better suited for you. "
That's hilarious. Some people seriously do think the whole world revolves around them. Clearly Jason is *only* her son's name! 
"What attracted her to you in the first place, why didn't she marry someone from her comfort zone? If there is a legitimate reason a solution may be found there."
"&gt; Do you think I'm obliged to invite him to my events? 

Absolutely not. He's made it clear how he feels. "
"He mentioned that it slipped once, so I'd assume at the very least he's using a size too big. "
"It'll happen if you don't tell him too, except it'll be later on when you're more invested and it'll feel a million times worse. Right now, at the very worst, he'll end the relationship because of his brother. If you wait, he'll end the relationship because of his brother, and because you're a liar. "
"So just say to him that you are so sorry things turned out this way and you appreciate him going to all this effort. Emphasize this:

&gt; I figured it was fine because I thought there was no way my sister would be engaged to a douchebag..

I'm sure you &amp; he will be fine. As for your sister, probably you can't fix things as long as she is with this guy. Sorry, that's not something we can fix for you. 

"
"I really hope u/notextorcalls sees your comment. This is SPOT ON and exactly how I read her post as well. 

Being in this type of relationship is so unfulfilling and breaks down your self-esteem. "
"Seriously! This is an obsession that is seriously getting worse and is past alarming territory, to straight up scary."
Im in a similar situation but shorter relationship. Sometimes you just cant/won't get closure and have to handle that as well
"I don't think it's a ""breakup competition"". Instead he wants to remain connected to his ex and this is the best way he knows how to do that. Basically he wants to be married to his ex and if he can't have his ex then he can replicate his ex with OP as close as possible."
"The lady sounds fucked in the head. Judging from a thousand miles away, I would venture to guess she has some mental issues. I'd try to convince your father to leave and say it's not healthy for him. He has to leave before she decides to leave, because I could totally see her staging a scene and saying he hit her, something she has already done, but she will make it far worse this time. I'd alert police of what you have seen so next time she calls them, maybe they won't believe her.

This is a potentially dangerous situation. Good luck"
"Rerdditors also love to over apply sunk cost theory to literally every long term relationship. There is a difference between not wanting to break up with someone because then all that time would have been ""wasted"" and not wanting to break up with them due to positive traits they like in their partner. We literally see less of these people's lives than a casual acquaintance yet people are willing to make massive character judgements about everyone involved."
"You told them that?! Are there any options here? Not anymore, you burned the bridges. I doubt you need to bother yourself anymore or that they would want to enjoy your company anymore."

If the internet is a separate bill from your rent I'd suggest cutting it if it's in your name. Along with any Netflix or anything of yours he has login credentials for.

Cut him off financially like a housemate would. "
"Is there anyone local who's heavily pregnant? That person is either related to the perpetrator, is the perpetrator, or is another victim. They're another key to the puzzle.

How is your wife taking it? It might be worth it to up the communication and transparency for a while, because even in the steadiest of relationships this could be disturbing."
"My uncle is in a wheelchair and has been in a wheelchair since before he met his wife. She is madly in love with him and carries him upstairs sometimes at family events. They're a pretty cute couple 

So yes, there are great people out there who will love you for you."
"Uh, I came in here thinking you just kept some meaningful letters from your ex that you got from when you were in a relationship with her as keepsakes from your past. 

But you're hoarding meaningless notes from her that she gave you *while you're in a relationship with someone else*. You very obviously still have feelings for her, otherwise you wouldn't ascribe so much importance to those worthless little pieces of paper. You're acting like a middle schooler with a crush, complete with being completely out of touch with your own feelings. Yeah, that flimsy excuse that your're just soooo glad you and her are in good place now is you lying to yourself. "
"OP she simply LOVES the attention from other guys and is afraid if they knew you were her BF she wouldn't get all the free attention. It really is that simple. 

And then she has to go and disrespect you to your face with the car. You aren't being jealous or controlling op - you are getting disrespected to your face. Explaining it to your girl with no consequences - after a year together, was fucking pointless. She knew it was wrong and simply didn't care, she didn't need you to explain. 

&gt;After that party, I find out that lots of her x-boyfriends were there. I wondered if that was a reason she really wasn't introducing me to much people.

No fucking shit. She's almost certainly slept with half these guys she hangs with and doesn't want her cover blown. That much is obvious. 

Stop being a fucking doormat. They are probably all laughing at how clueless you are. "
"My boss can be really nice but is also really involved in people's lives, some of my coworkers think that she secretly likes Andrew and is trying to live her life through me.

"Tipping a table and throwing pillows are not normal reactions, and I’m sorry that you’re in a situation where you think it is. There is NO reaction that justifies including physical violence and harm. "
"I agree with this option. I'd add that he needs to know that his friend's horrid response to this will be the make or break of the relationship. If he continues to hang out with these guys, knowing that they encourage cheating and hiding bad behavior, he'll have to make some hard decisions. 

Lots of young people haven't learned yet that it's entirely up to them to stand up to a friend group when it comes to defending the boundaries of their romantic relationship, and that it's expected of them as growing, maturing adults to do so. You don't have to lose friends, but you should be willing to if it means keeping a long term relationship when they rag on you or push you to do things that will hurt your SO."
"Ugh. Umm literally nothing because he's not behaving rationally? 

So you- a normal rational person cannot possibly follow his ""logic"" enough to intuit what would be something that sets him off. 

Also.. Yes he has these issues and that itself is not his fault. Choosing not to address them is his fault. Choosing to take them out on you is his fault. 

Get out of there &amp; show your children a better role model. Good luck!"
"oh, it's *absolutely* going to implode and it's going to be ugly. those poor kids. "
"But if I was trying to impress somebody, I wouldn't say, ""Hey, fifteen years ago I had sex with a casual acquaintance of yours! I swear, he was super popular, so I'm cool, right?""   It's weird. I mean it's possible but it seems far more likely they just actually had sex. 

Also, OP doesn't at all appear to doubt that they had sex."
"Ugh.  I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, but if your fiancé wants to gloss over racism, your wedding guest list is going to be just the first in a series of issues you're going to encounter.  I would very much put the wedding planning on hold.  "
"My bad, sorry then! But the rest of my point/comments still stand. Don't brush off everyone elses comments. I am not much older than you. Many of these commenters are adults with experience, and you should listen carefully."
"&gt; he doesn't mean any harm and does not have many acquaintances at work.

None of that is your problem. Your problem is that he makes you uncomfortable.

My way to address starers, when I have the bandwidth to be bothered, is to stare them down in return. Full eye contact as I/they walk by. Sometimes they realize they have been caught and turn away, but not always. Some people just think they are entitled to stare at other people.

When I was a kid, we used to say, ""Take a picture it'll last longer."" It's childish, but so is staring."
"I think you're overreacting somewhat. Yes it's uncomfortable, but that's life. Demonising this girl is quite wrong. Your partner decided to have the affair after all.

I know it seems harsh but maybe your friends thought that after a year it wouldn't be such a big deal especially as you and your partner are reconciled now. A bit thoughtless, maybe. 

If she's there to bartender just don't go up to the bar, and the sight of you happy with your partner will piss her off no end. Be dignified!"
"I mean, that's not the worst thing you could have said, but it's pretty sexist and I could see it sounding manipulative. "
"Yeah but you're dismissing a potentially 18 year long mistake. You dedicated the tldr and half a paragraph to your knowledge of your pre-cum, yet you're offended that someone called you out for how stupid it was. And then you dismiss it as ""typical Reddit."" I guess typical redditors are just smart than you, bud. "
"You're on the right path already - you've recognized that he made a deeply selfish and unloving choice and not an honest mistake.  So you have a solid view on what he really did.

You a walk away by having a new place to walk to as it where.  I don't mean another person but instead a new you, one involving the gym and exercise since that will help lift you spirits and it will help your body too, so double win.

You engage with friend socially and you explore new fun things like joining new local events and clubs.  

And when you are feeling like you want some adult company, you either accept an invite for a date, or you invite someone on a date.

 Notice none of the above either involved or required him to do or succeed?"
In what world do parents expect their grown child to stick around and pay for a mortgage? They should be encouraging your independence. They are being absurd. Run like the wind. NYC is amazing. Please go live your life. 
Right? I heard the title and it made me instantly think of my scumbag abusive ex
You are all over this thread going balls to the wall defending the husband and his friend for cheating. Would you care to share the story of the time (or times) where you cheated on a significant other and it was totally justified? Because it certainly sounds like you have some experience based on how far you are going to stick your neck out for them.
Maybe consider posting on one of their social media platforms complaining about your experience publicly if that's something you're comfortable with 
"I'm confused. He was too tired for sex but had a full time job and was healthy enough to go on dates etc.? Sex can be tiring but you can do it in ways that are less exhausting for him like girl on top. 

The whole idea of him being up for blow jobs but so tiring after that you didn't even want oral from him rubs me the wrong way. 

You just come across as exhausted. It's awful that he's been sick for so long but this has obviously taken a toll on you. Your needs haven't really been met in two years and now that he's finally getting healthier he isn't even up for listening to your wants in the bedroom? Has he always been a selfish lover? "
"What physical violence and harm? Are you a glass vase? Read the situation, stop seeing everything as black and white.

If your SO stomps their feet in anger and shouts into a pillow. Are those massive red flags? Or are they high-levels of frustration?

People aren't robots. Yes, there is **no situation** where violence is justified. Duh. But you push and push someone and they're going to boil-over. Throwing pillows is probably the *best* outcome."
"call the guy's mobile from another line and if you hear a ring in the background where your girl is, you know what's up"
"um, if dude needs a diaper because he can't stop pissing himself while drinking, it might be a good idea to just not drink anymore."
"So at the very best, he thinks little of you and thinks that is a bragworthy feat. I'm not sure there is anything worth saving here. He supports you, as in you stay home and he works? Do you guys have children? 

I couldn't spend my life with someone who didn't view me as an equal, let alone someone who readily brags about only needing me to screw and look attractive.  What happens when you get older? What happens if you get injured and can't have sex for a while? If that is all you are for, your time is limited. "
Become her friend as much as you're Joe's friend. That's how you show that you're not a threat.
That's like the perfect response.Did she have any response? 
"This is an absolutely enormous assumption. She says her anxiety is ""mostly controlled."" She never said he has to ""take her"" somewhere nor that it was every time she was in public. Sounded more like she goes to the bathroom and has a bit of a cry to calm down **occasionally**. He sounds emotionally abusive and like he is using her actual mental health issues as a reason to make her feel like a shitty partner who could never do any better."
"I'm poly, oral sex is still sex. "
I actually agree with this. But it’s probably still best that OP apologize and not bring this up because I imagine it will lead to a bigger fight...
"&gt; She actually asked to move to a one bed unit in our building so she does not worry there's a home invader living in the second bedroom. 

just a shot in the dark.. what is the pet policy where you live? it's no substitute for a therapist, but having a dog and knowing it's there watching everything while she's sleeping might help ease the paranoia and let her rest, with the bonus of a walking buddy. "
How is it suspicious that he's doing exactly what he says he was going to do? He wants a good night of sleep...
"At 27 this is a little concerning to me. I mean technically she isn't hurting anyone, but it may be a sign of either simple delusion and escapism, or serous mental illness that is ramping up with drug use. Or maybe she's just weird. If she starts putting herself, or others in danger you should say something to her family, but if not, well it's a free country."
"I didn’t read that comment as making the gf out to be a sociopath, I read it as her being thoughtless and not actually processing/thinking through what she’d really done.  Because what she’s really done is broken his trust forever. 

Where he once probably never seriously considered  his gf would cheat - he’s now experienced that moment of knowing it happened because he saw it. Never mind that it didn’t happen - he has now experienced the pain and devastation (albeit briefly) of knowing the woman he trusted has utterly betrayed him. And it’s probably not ameliorated much by knowing that she only emotionally rather than physically betrayed him. She’s broken something that might not be repairable. "
"Ugh, I love your dog and I haven't even met him. I wonder if you should drop off your dog at your parent's house tonight or tomorrow, just so he's safe until all of this blows over? "
"&gt; They don't know my age, but I have amazing chemistry with the one guy I will call Chris. 

Why don't they know your age? Seriously, be honest about how old you are. Furthermore, chatting is not the same as actual communication in real life. Chemistry is a lot more than a bit of messaging and voice chat.

&gt;  My friend [17F] was dating a 29 year old... it was a strong relationship and they got on really well.

There's even more wrong with this. When I was 17, I was working at a dance school and got to know lots of people at least a decade older than me. One of them became my bf afterwards (he was 9 years older). However, we only got together AFTER I've turned 18.  

&gt; I'm a mature 18 year old

You're still extremely immature, you simply don't realise it. And if a 26 years old wants to date you, when he knows how old you are, is a huge red flag."
"So. Lets just say you did say something and she got mad about it or confronted you about it. Would this start a fight do you think? Or would you apologize.

I am asking because I feel like if I said anything about it, he would say i am being too sensitive/critical again. I would like him to stop but idk how to talk about it."
It sounds like he treats you more like a parent than a partner. No all men act that way. It sounds like he is really immature and used to having his family enable the irresponsible behaviors. Nothing will change if you continue to enable him as well. 
"You were impulsive yes. But then also, you kept it from him for years. You lied to him for a very long time after your mistake."
"The problem with this approach is that she's emotionally charged and has personal connection to it and you do not. It's like a guy talking ""logically and rationally"" about the #MeToo thing, or a white person talking ""logically and rationally"" about systemic racism. Because you have the luxury of it not being as emotionally raw for you, you're able to talk about it in a detached, intellectual, academic way. She is not, and that's why she responds angrily. She has valid serious reasons for why this would be a very hard topic for her, you do not. That means you NEED to show her in that moment that you understand and appreciate how charged the topic is for her."
"Yeah I agree with you. I had a sort of similar experience with a chiropractor. I’d been seeing him for a while but just started getting a weird vibe, so I cancelled my next appointment. He sent me this crazy voicemail about how disrespectful I was being and so on. It only confirmed that I didn’t want to see him ever again! "
"&gt;She refuses to go to a home and honestly I don’t have the heart to push anyone out of the comfort of their homes, and I know my mom feels the same.

Well guess what? Your grandma doesn't get to choose. 

You have three options: your mother continues to care for her and get verbally abused, your mom pays for a full time caretaker, or she puts gma in a home."
"She was holding your property. I mean, PD would have just gone in politely to get it for you, but you would have been within your rights to request it."
"Thank you, this feedback was so good. I feel a little better, and plan on trying harder- I did plan on that from the beginning but I felt like in the end I was just going to get fired anyway."
"Honestly, this guy is a major headache. From the stories you shared, I get the vibe this guy is a control freak.

Please stay safe and know that you deserve better. "
"He's not going to go no contact with his friend. He likes him more then his wife. He's more likely to pretend he has to get his wife to stop nagging, but then see his friend behind her back. 

I've been married 22 years and if my husband did this, and went behind my back to sneak a cheating couple into my guest room while I was sleeping and then lied about it, I'd divorce him instantly."
"Lol @ ""he doesn't need a woman who gives him stress"". I'd dump him for that. The only thing worse would have been if he'd said *female* in that sentence.

Gross. The disrespect is gross."
"You should definitely tell him. If it were you, you'd want to know."
"I wonder why you didn't talk to her when you recognized her? You say she was stumbling and acting very much unlike herself, so I'm concerned you didn't check to see if she was ok?

If I were in the situation, I would tell him what you saw and that you two did not interact at the party."
"You are disillusioned into thinking ""trying hard"" will help you through starvation, unemployment, and housing. A significant portion of the world is homeless/starving and not from a lack of ""trying hard"". 
Your average company will not hire a pregnant woman because you will need a significant amount of time off for the pregnancy, appointments, sick days, stuff like that. No one looks for an employee who can't adhere to their schedule.

You also keep mentioning that your father couldn't throw you out because ""what father does that"". Well, plenty. Sounds like yours might be one who does. You're asking for them to financially accommodate a new baby, something they're clear in not wanting to do. ""Just sleeping and eating in their home"" is a huge thing to ask of them at this point based on their reaction of your pregnancy."
"&gt; The person you thought you were married to does not exist. It was a facade. 

Perfect"
"Use the joint bank account to pay for the classes. And don't think about ""paying him back"" for the lessons. 

Definitely keep working towards your goals, driving and gaining better employment. If he continues to say things like you don't need to work... remember this moment, how you felt when he had the audacity to yell at you over money because you wanted to better yourself. 

It's easier for him to have you at home, if you don't work and don't drive you're all his. But you don't have to live that way. You're not his subordinate. You're supposed to be partners. If he doesn't apologize and start treating you well, something's gotta change. "
Watch out for getting an infection from the scatches. Humans are nasty and carry some dangerous ass bacteria. 
"There's actually evidence to suggest it stunts their growth, if I recall correctly? Something about it inhibiting growth hormone around puberty. 

Even some of the biggest proponents of keto strongly recommend against children following it (unless they have epilepsy and need to). I eat keto myself and I'm pretty appalled at the idea of forcing it on a 2 yr old and 5 yr old, yikes. "
"My family, and more specifically my mother, had our lives “altered” by a serial killer. I don’t want to go into detail for obvious reasons, but it was enough for my mother to testify at his trial and the catalyst for the start of her addiction. 

1. Go to a therapist and discuss this situation. Discuss how best to approach your husband to shut this shit down.

2. Do not go on tv for the money. I know you already have your mind made up to not do that, but I wanted to support that decision. Years ago I made the mistake of answering some questions for an online blog. While my identity wasn’t revealed, they twisted my words, asked intrusive questions, blamed my mother, and was basically performing a witch hunt. It’s not worth it and it still fucks with me to this day. 

I’m sorry for what you are dealing with and I’m sure it’s ripping open new wounds to even have to have this conversation. Stay strong and don’t be pressured. "
"You only call me when you want something, but you don't do anything for me. I feel used. 

He can only use you if you let him. And tell your family he only calls when he wants a buddy pass, but he does nothing in return. "
"Dude, it's not interesting that her sister works for you, you were conned. It was calculated. Of course she works for you, that was their plan.

Oooooh man. Every comment is worse and worse.

Man, you are going to lose a ton of money. 

The heartbreak is inevitable. I'm so, so sorry. What this woman is doing to you is disgusting. She is an absolutely predatory gold digger. And you simply don't have the relationship experience to see it. Your family doesn't like her, you have to listen to them. They are able to see what you can't. Same with your Mentor at work. You need to listen to those people. They have your best interests at heart.

Your wife is an actress. She's been playing a role for money. I'm so so sorry.

I would try to get in to counseling if I were you. You're really going to need as much support as possible in the coming months."
"Definitely wouldn't disagree with you, but it might be difficult for a mother to say ""my son is a danger to you and my grandson"".  I doubt any parent would want to admit that, least of all to themselves."
"See if you can find a singlr mom group in the area that does christmas and thanksgiving together. I cannot suggest single moms enough, I know quite a few. They form tribes and are amazingly supportive of each other."
"I vote you’re blowing this out of proportion and making issues of nothing. If they ask you how much better married life is, smile and nod. It’s small talk. "
"You're letting him turn this around on you. 

*He's* the psycho who's grabbing you and throwing things--menacing behavior.

Then he deflects attention from his bad deeds by bringing up something pretty benign... I mean white trash is as white trash does. It's a fair comment when he's acting like white trash. "
You've only been dating for 10 months and you're barely an adult. You should hold off on getting married.
"&gt; And yes, we planing on having more kids

This is worth rethinking now that you know this is an issue. 

"
"If the note you leave is a straightforward apology about your mother's behavior I think you can avoid it being seen as flirty. Just be to the point and sincere. 

If I'm prying now just say so... how did she keep you out of school for 4 years and no one catch on?  No social services intervention?  Nothing?  She has put you at a tremendous disadvantage you now have to work your way out of. It is completely doable of you want, but you'll have to work hard to get there. "
"This is where.you ha e fucked up. You said your marriage was already shaky anyway. She clearly tried to make a big effort for you here and you didn't even  bother expressing appreciation for the thought and effort, misguided as it may have been. Now you're talking about ""leaving a note?"" 

What the actual fuck?"
"You aren't being unreasonable at all. At the same time, people show affection in different ways. 

Have you voiced your concern to your boyfriend?"
"Emotional infidelity is still a form of cheating. Just because he never physically cheated on you with Jessica doesn't mean that your husband isn't prioritizing his relationship with her over your marriage. If it's getting to the point where people felt like he may be cheating on you with her, then yes, he needs to distance himself from Jessica and if he can't do that, then there's more issues in your marriage than just Jessica IMO."
"Better yet talk to a lawyer. Find out what your options are.

**Tell your wife this is serious. The next time the dog nips at your kid you are call animal control.** It's best for her to rehome the dog now if she doesn't want it to come to that. You don't feel this dog is a good fit for your family and you're not longer go to acquiesce to her desire to keep it at any cost."
"&gt;Am I just being an A-hole?

Kinda, yeah. I mean, your wife can't eat any food and is constantly nauseous and you are complaining that you can't have fun conversations? Your attitude seems to be completely lacking in empathy, and out of touch with the reality of how becoming a parent is going to change your life. 

&gt; but I just want a normal conversation with her about anything and everything, but this constant talk of being sick is making me crazy.

Do you think she *wants* to constantly talk about being sick? Do you think wants to constantly feel sick? You're acting like this is a choice of hers. It's not. And it's only going to get worse, because all of your conversations are going to revolve around bottles and diapers and burping and sleep.

I would suggest if your wife's morning sickness is severe that she visit the doctor and get a Diclegis prescription. It will help with the nausea sensation and it will not hurt the baby.

But yeah, you need an attitude adjustment, and quick."
"Except it's not jumping to conclusions, it's discussing a realistic possibility. Incestual abuse is quite common and OP says elsewhere it didn't seem like it could be a joke given the contents of the video. "
"Honestly I would appreciate a guy owning that. I literally do not know a single woman who cannot say ""me too"". That means a fucking lot of men are doing this. 

Men who care more about saving face than helping women? Not a lot of respect. Men willing to own that they did something fucked up and talk about how theyre working to make the world bettet now? Respect.

12 years ago now I had a teenage boyfriend who sexually abused me. If I heard that he owned he did something wrong? I would have more respect for that. 


"
"Tell him it's not just this one guy who calls you that name, but an entire country. So it doesn't feel ""special"" to you, but normal. That him considering it ""special"" between you and this guy is weird, like denying the existence of a whole country.

Try to get him to understand its tied to the language... that you have gotten used to the idea that your name is _____ in your primary language, but ____ in your second language, so you are more comfortable if people just use the name than matches their language. this guy is using your primary language name because he uses all the other words in that language too. 

You BF is fixating on him because he's the only representative of that language he comes into regular contact with, but he shouldn't forget that that's just his personal context for it. 

"
"I was 38 when I got married and it was too late for me to get pregnant, even with ivf. We are adopting. The agency would not approve us if one of us had a hobby that took up that much time. 

You guys at the very least need pre marital counselling. They don't accept vague answers like ""some day"" when it comes to comparability topics such as children. You are right to not get engaged at this point in time. Do not get married if you think she either won't change or might only change temporarily to please you. I suggest couples counselling to make your voice heard and make her realise she has to get her head out of the clouds. 

Btw. My SIL is in a choral singing group. She has refused full time work and further education to dedicate to her hobby. She thinks that they can go professional but I can't see how. So I understand the type of person you are dealing with. "
"From what you've described, it sounds like your family was way overbearing and intrusive with their opinions on what your life should look like - basically, they were hugely disrespectful to your wife by thinking having their way should have priority over her having her way. And now you say you're better at enforcing boundaries, and that your family ""doesn't agree with them"" but understands they're there - if your family doesn't agree that they were acting and are continuing to try to act inappropriately, the problem is still there (realizing your wife is upset and agreeing that she is right to be upset are two different things). The boundaries saved your marriage, *not* the relationship between your wife and family. It sounds like the fundamental problem is still there.

I would highly suspect, and your wife probably does too, that if you were to bring you kids around without her, there would be a ton of either actively dismissive or passive-aggressive comments about her and/or your family will try to undermine your parenting/life decisions since they don't agree. And I'm sorry, but even if you're being better with boundaries now, your ""normal meter"" is probably still broken and you will likely let them get away with a lot because ""that's the way they are"" or just not realize when they've crossed the line again. Especially since the clash came to a head when the first child was born, and since the boundaries are being *enforced*, not *respected*, your wife is going to be sensitive to giving them opportunities to erode those boundaries. "
"I mean, why are you shaming him? ""Woe is me, I'm not the one who gets to finally give this sad, nerdy boy a taste of what the dark and lustful side is like! He's already experienced that without me. :( And with more sex partners, as well! :( :(""

And if that was ridiculous to read, well, that's exactly how you sound.

Obviously you couldn't tell anything had happened between them because the way he views sex is just different from your view. That doesn't mean one of you is wrong while the other is right; it just is what it is. This sounds like a seed of doubt has already been planted that will no doubt be allowed to grow into a giant tree and cast a shadow on the entire relationship, judging by how insecure it's making you now. You are just incompatible with him. Move on, you can find other people you click with."
So you are absolutely wrong in your thinking. By not having a written lease none of your “rules” are enforceable upon him at all. I actually did a bit of tenant work for my sister-in-law in Atwater Village a few years ago and the laws are super tenant-friendly. The signed lease in this situation would have protected you. 
"I don't think she *really* has a crush on you. I think she's just lonely and depressed and longs for a relationship and connection; and she's scared of the future because eventually you'll meet someone, date, etc and the arrangement will change. You'll move out, she can't live in the city w/out you, a gf will take up your time,etc. she sounds lonely and uncertain. So, I'd work on helping her with that. Look into what sort of social/disability services are available to her, things like aides, home health care visits,etc. maybe a support group where she can meet friends or share her feelings. Meetup groupsfor people with disabilities. Also, maybe a pet will help? Like a small dog to cuddle and watch tv with and to take for short strolls around the neighbor and the dog park. an outlet for her nurturing feelings and loneliness, gives her a sense of purpose and connection. Or even a cat if a dog is too much work for her. "
"Yeah, the whole ""I don't want to rent because I don't want to lose money, so can I please live with you for free?"" part is irritating."
"Not to mention cocaine, if anything makes you less drunk"
He works a ton without much of a social life i I think maybe he just doesn’t have a lot of other experiences to relate to. 
"I don't think you should get involved.  But I *think* that BF needs to know this conversation is happening.  As much as you're her ""friend"", her attempts to use you to get in the good graces of her boss after a screw up *is* a relevant work matter.  I think he needs to know about it.  "
"""Dad, your obsession with my appearance is my healthy. You are unhappy with my hair, makeup and clothes and need to make sure I know your opinion every time I see you, as well as online. For a man your age to be so concerned with my appearance is strange, to say the least. Beyond not appreciating the constant comments, I also worry about if there is anything going on in your life that makes you unhappy and leads you to overly obsess with something that has absolutely no impact on you. Did you ever consider talking to a therapist?""


Post this as an answer publicly next time he comments on your Instagram. "
"My boyfriend has a friend like this. They were close friends in college, ""fooled around a few times"" and that was that.

This came up in an odd way, but he was very direct, blunt and honest about it. We had been talking about her because they're still friends despite living several states apart and he was talking about old college stories. He said ""Yeah, people thought we were dating but she's not for me in that way."" Ends up mentioning sleeping with her. Awkward.

Either way, as the girlfriend, I'm glad that I know. I was able to make my own decision about it and how I feel about their boundaries. If... say, she came to visit and we were all hanging out talking and something slips that they did sleep together... and he didn't tell me? I would be furious. 

Anyway, as a girlfriend with a boyfriend that has the same sort of situation as you... I appreciated being told, I appreciated him being honest about it, and I appreciated the ability to voice how I feel/talk about boundaries with him.

I wouldn't walk up to her after a long day of work and shout ""I SLEPT WITH ASHLEY BEFORE I MET YOU"", haha. Make sure it's tactful. But she deserves to know and not be blindsided in the future... because somehow people always end up finding out weird things from the past. It's just better to be honest."
Someone of lesser constitution may have had a heart attack or stroke.
"&gt;After that, my parents called me, and said my sister had told them about the conversation, and that while they agreed with me, they said I should've been nicer as she was very upset.

Tell them that maybe if they hadn't been so nice all this could have been avoided."
"According to her own logic, she ruined your relationship with him by telling you he had a girlfriend."
"So why can't your parents spend some of Christmas Day with you and your son at your home, while your brother stays at his/theirs?

Why can't your parents come visit you for a few hours?"
"Look to be honest. things like that can get annoying, but so can blowing your nose loudly or snoring or mispronouncing certain words or dealing with someone who breathes through their mouth. If you're the only person who has a problem with him and you find him that annoying you are incompatible. It is time to move on. 

Your reaction was wrong. I hope you realise this and I hope for your sake it was a one off and won't be repeated. At some point in life you are going to have to deal with someone with an annoying habit. Maybe a future in law, maybe a member of a friend group, maybe someone you work with and are stuck in close proximity with for 8 hours a day, and when that happens you need to be able to handle it maturely. "
"Because at this point it's beyond silly jokes.  It's ""This is really really bothering me and it hurts me that you don't know how to be appropriate occasionally"".

I.e. when your GF is at the end of her rope about you using stupid, repetitive jokes - that is the *exact wrong time* to use one.  It's a clear sign that the jokes are more important to him that his GF is.  That he's not listening to her.  That perhaps he doesn't even care.

Flipping a table is overkill, of course, and wasn't warranted.  But starting to think that these sorts of expressions are so important to your BF that he'll use them to mock you and doesn't give a shit how you feel about it?  I'd be mad as well."
I think she doesn’t want you to see her search history or links visited.
"Stop inviting your mother around for a while. Let you and your GF get settled in the role of parents, just you two together.


I would be upset if my MIL insinuated that I couldn't take care of my new born child, which is what your mom is doing. "
This post seems VERY familiar. I feel like I read something like this a while back.  
I don't think you should condescend by deciding what she's allowed to remember of him for her own good. Be transparent and let her be an adult and decide what to do and how to feel.
"I get so mad that they even do this. They seem to think I owe them everything. I get my hair dyed and one of them asked ""do you waste money like that instead of giving back?"" "
Do the math on how much longer you hair is compared to hers and divide the vacuuming proportionally. Tell her if she wants to do no vacuuming she’ll have to shave her head and keep it that way.
"Oh my god I didn't even notice that.

6 kids. Unless some are multiples, she has spent a total of *4.5 years* out of the last 10 pregnant. And possibly breastfed as well. I knew a woman who literally spent 10 straight years non-stop either pregnant or breastfeeding. Coming out of that was pretty hard on her because she got so used to her body doing that. 

Yeah no fucking shit she's paranoid."
It doesn’t look like you came here for advice just validation for your personal perspective on your problem. You’ve told everyone here who’s had even a slight opposing position as you that they need to re read what you said as if they must have misunderstood you or they would be 100% on your side. What are you here for? 
"What's the point of bringing it up? Even if she was willing, what could she possibly do to satisfy your fetish? Get pregnant? Talk dirty about how round her belly is? Or just be aware and accepting that you think about baby bumps in a sexual way? But why? Why is it so important that she approve of your fetish instead of you just keeping it to yourself?"
Don't be racist. It's unattractive.
"I have a friend who has an issue with innapropriate laughing and an inability to stop. She calls them laughing seizures and was on a medication for it. When she wanted a baby she had to get off the meds, but she was scared she'd laugh herself down a flight of stairs. She told me she laughed all the way through an ultrasound.


If I hadn't seen this I wouldn't believe it. She just laughs and is crying in laughter, she just can't stop. No one else is laughing. The joke isn't funny anymore, and she just couldn't control it. 

She's back on the meds now, but it was funny until it wasn't. That's the only way to describe it."
"I think we should all form a club. Much like OP, I need to take a moment to process my feelings before I react. I often find myself saying something like ""I'm not ignoring you, I'm just thinking about this"". I'm sure it drives people crazy sometimes, but it's just the way I'm built. Different people deal with things in different ways, and it sounds like OP and her boyfriend just aren't compatible in this regaard."
"Yup this is a good tactic. If someone knows (at least one some level) that they are being manipulative, then making them spell it out keeps them from saying it and thus keeps them from gaining that upper hand. It typically doesn't stop their overall behavior, but it definitely kills their current situation."
"&gt;  6 weeks is not enough time for him to find another place to live

Wow, BF sounds like he's going to get a short sharp shock in the real world.  6 weeks is 2 weeks longer than realestate agents give you to vacate a property and find a new one to live in.

Anyway OP you're completely right in not wanting to get married or live with a person who hasn't worked out how to adult yet.  Much like not getting married before living with a person, you shouldn't move in with a person till they've lived by themselves and learned how to manage their own life as an adult.

Your question though isn't about whether what you did was right - it's if all this stress and pain and whinging (because that's what he's doing - whinging instead of taking responsibility and being pro-active in his own life) is worth this relationship.

And well - look, in your shoes I'd 100% be over having to parent my significant other (seriously, not having rent money in on time? WTF).  But that's me.  You're you. 

What I would say though is that you don't need permission to break up.  You don't even need a reason that other people will understand.  You can do it because you don't feel the relationship is going any further - or that the other person is no longer compatible with your goals and needs.

I will also add though that at 29, if he hasn't already worked out his shit, he's really unlikely to do it while he can get away with it.  It's part of his personality."
Keto is absolutely not appropriate for children. Glucose is fuel for the brain and is ESSENTIAL for brain development.
"&gt; model forever

lol forever"
Confess and tell her you saw it. The stress of knowing will eat at you and could cause problems later in the relationship. 
"My thought too. In the time it took her to to set these scenes and hide with the kids, wouldn't a healthy and emotionally-balanced person realize how massively they'd goofed?"
"Agreed.  That screams ""keep your mouth shut or else""."
She kicked him out after he said a movie was more important than celebrating her own parents anniversary. There's a big difference there. 
"I was going to say this. OP’s wife isn’t all together wrong about the reasons for hitting (frustration, tired, jealous, excited...) however, these are not excuses. At this age, explaining and redirecting those feelings would be appropriate. "
"He's 45 years old and has to take someone to him mom's house to screw? One day you'll laugh at this schmuck. For now, it's hard. "
All you really can do now is to warn your gf about how your family may behave. She deserves to know what your mom thinks of her. Just make sure to have your gf's back if your family starts treating her badly or insults her. 
"When people say their relationship is great because they never fight, it can mean several things: a) they don't ""fight"" because they instead have discussions about disagreements and try to come to a resolution, or b) they don't fight because they don't actually hash out disagreements, they instead bury them or just go with what one person says.

Not fighting because you discuss is healthy. Not fighting because you don't communicate issues in the first place is unhealthy, and when you actually address a problem you may not know how to do so properly, leading to a blow up.

You seem like you're fine, just something to keep in mind moving forward! "
"maybe talk to her and get her to start personal training or see a nutritionist. If she doesn’t want that, maybe consider buying her pre cooked meals online (plenty of them depending on what country &amp; money situation is)  "
"On the other hand, looking at OP's comments here, it's clear that his wife doesn't respect his contributions. She spends thousands of dollars on credit cards every month, refuses to go to counseling with him when he asks, and just prior to this he came home to a new thousand dollar rug and they'd agreed to discuss purchases over $500 beforehand. OP being upset about this is not the issue here. "
Don't make an innocent child pay for your mistake just because you feel like you have something to prove to everyone that's wronged you. 
These are the answers we need to find out. Roommates can't force others into things they didn't agree too. Unless legally declared necessity but I don't think emotional animals have the same legal protection as service animal. Which I would 100% be for allowing protected class assuming they have the same type of training that service animals do.
"Unless you think the brother actually doesn't remember you, I think you have to tell your boyfriend.

Telling him now is far better than him learning it from someone else or having you keep it a secret for a long time.  It also saves you from a tremendous amount of guilt over hiding something from him and worrying about him finding out.

That said, even though you didn't do anything wrong and were honest, it might just not be something he is alright with."
why not? especially when she actually committed assault and battery under the legal and criminal definitions?? Do you just let your friends do that???
"I think I can answer this (somewhat). My sister married a meth addict. They also have 2 children together, like this couple. Her husband was arrested a handful of times with paraphernalia. Like this man, she only threatened to leave but never really did anything about it. The very last time he was arrested she made the choice to not bail him out and let him sit there until his court date. At his court date, he requested rehab. He went to a very aggressive-type rehab for about 3 months. He's now one year sober and leads the local NA meetings. CPS was never involved. I'm not even sure they ever ""caught wind"" of the situation. If one parent is ""of sound mind"" and the other is out of the home, taking the steps to better themselves.. I don't believe CPS has much ground to stand on. "
"&gt;Honestly it sounds like the dog just acts as a symbol to you of your wife's lack of respect for your wishes.

Yup."
Oh no baby what is you doing?
"It could be something like stereotypical Tourette's where, yes if push comes to shove they can avoid speaking for 15 min, but it is like an itch you are dying to scratch. Only controllable in small segments."
"It’s a good thing the conversation *was* in text, in hindsight. He’s a manipulative jerk, and with manipulative jerks, it’s super helpful to get them in writing so you know you’re not going crazy when they say something different later. (And since they’re coworkers, and this is potentially a sexual harassment issue, documentation can’t hurt.)"
"This could very well be it and that would be devastating. But I will take your advice, thank you. "
"Okay, so this is pretty complicated to unpack.

First, toward the end:

&gt;feels very much like I don't get to have a say in a decision that will impact the rest of my life

No, no more than he gets to have a say in whether or not you have an abortion. This is HIS body.  You get to decide whether you can stay in a relationship that will have no more children, or not. You absolutely do not get a say in decisions about his body.

&gt;He seems to think I'm trying to convince him to have more kids

&gt;I feel sure I'd want to have another child.

&gt;He is 100% sure he doesn't want to have another.

&gt;I have brought it up to him a number of times.


Okay.

He doesn't want any more kids. You obviously do. He's got _every right_ to decide he will never have any more. It doesn't have to be about anything being ""wrong"" with your kids and your family.  He just doesn't want any more kids. 

And you do.


Definitely go to a therapist so that you can process this. Definitely don't bring it up to him more than one more time--and that one more time, be **very plain** about the fact that you really envision another child or even two in your life.  About the fact that you don't want to feel resentful, but you need to figure out what you're doing from here.  Don't hold your marriage hostage, don't accuse him of making unilateral decisions, but don't dance around the fact that the relationship he wants is not the relationship that you want."
"This. I have a foreign name that is difficult for anyone who isn't of my ethnicity to pronounce correctly. So, for the vast majority of people, I go by an westernized/anglicized pronunciation of my name. 

The exception is if I meet other people of my ethnicity, esp if I gather that they speak the native language. Then I generally reflexively introduce myself using the correct pronunciation and that's what they go by. I've dealt with the occasional white person who seems almost offended at being ""left out"" this way and they want to insist on pronouncing my name correctly because they want to be ~authentic. I always put my foot down with them because I hate hearing my name butchered that way. 

And I don't agree with people saying that it's just a little thing, so why not ask the friend to change to make the boyfriend happy? I mean, maybe to the OP it is a little thing, I don't know. But names mean a lot to many people. Especially if you're used to having your name butchered/mispronounced all the time, hearing someone actually say it the way it's meant to be said is wonderful. "
"Yeah, she should split her bf in two, perhaps with a table saw. Then his family can have half and she can have half. Everyone will be happy. 

There isn’t a lot of middle ground in situations like this. Anyone in a long term relationship with this guy is going to have to deal with his family. If OP no longer wants anything to do with his family then she doesn’t have a lot of options. It’s not like they’re just FWB or casually seeing each other."
"So he's controlling, irrational, and has anger issues.

Break up with him permanently. All he'll do is drag you down."
"^^^^ I wholeheartedly agree. Please find new friends, real friends don't do that. It's not cool. "
But it would have been illegal since the age of consent in their state is 18. 
"&gt; Good luck finding a guy who is willing to deal with a girl who has anxiety!

To a girl who loves healthy sex and giving blow jobs. I think you will be fine. "
This is the truest statement no one wants to hear or believe. Love is *never* enough to sustain a healthy relationship. Life isn’t a rom com.
"i cannot imagine what compelled you to do something so selfish and childish. i cannot express in typed words how terrible your actions were--one of the worst stories i've heard on this sub. 

i cannot give you advice, because you should have known. those pictures were the only way your husband's daughter could ever see her mom's face again. so many captured moments of a long meaningful life were destroyed in the blink of an eye at the hands of an insecure child. 

i'm gonna go back up all my pictures..."
"
&gt;He was a widow and had a daughter (now 17). 

I stopped reading. This is beyond reprehensible.

You destroyed his memories AND hers. She no longer has pictures to remember the live that her deceased mother had for her father. Instead of being honored to be invited into their home, you acted like a child. 

Fuck, the more I think about this the more enraged I get."
"&gt;We have a pretty active sex life. I keep track of how often we have it in my phone just to be sure and it's about 4 times a week right now. 

Do you want it that often? I don't understand your need for an app...

&gt;I try to be a good and considerate partner to him.

How about you look after *you* for once and stop thinking about everyone else's needs?"
"You're being ridiculous, to be frank. The vast majority of the population has herpes; most just happen to be asymptomatic. You're acting like you're 15."

"All of the anti-aging products in the world aren't going to be enough to stop the damage the tanning bed is doing, OP. Source: a woman who tanned throughout her 20s who just received some unwelcome news from my dermatologist last month.

PM me if you'd like. I was tanning to suit my former husband's preferred aesthetics. 😕"
"Ok, the histrionics at the end... come on. You're reacting very non-logically. You clearly knew that I didn't mean you can never talk about anything and that the only answer is war or manipulation. If that's how you debate people, you're cornering them based on semantics and it's obnoxious.

It's not that you can't talk about them. It's that when a topic affects someone else much more emotionally than you, that's when your empathy should kick in. That's when your sensitivity should ratchet up. That's when you need to recognize that your desire for rational discourse at any cost is self-serving and callous in that moment."
"Oh no, not opening night for a Star Wars movie!  They have one of those a year nowadays.  Are you sure he's 27 and not 7?"
"Creepy people who know they are being creepy often respond like this when called out. It's a mixture of them actually thinking it's the other person's fault, and being super manipulative because if you think it's your fault you are less likely to tell anyone.  It's a pretty good rule of thumb that a professional who sends angry tirades like this is not all that professional.   "
"Is your boyfriend capable of properly pronouncing your surname? If not, it should be pretty clear why you don't want him or most people calling you that."
"Getting stressed out at a dog is understandable, but to me it's like babies--getting frustrated is fine but getting mad isn't. "
My bf came home and apologised to me that he had to fire her. I told him about the texts and he was sorry I was put in that position. Also was sorry that I have now lost a friend but that's ok. None of this is fault. 
"Honestly, I think he clearly cares about you a lot.

If he didnt, he would have left when the attraction went away. Instead, he wants to be there with you as you better yourself.

I think he did the right thing by telling you, and you have to just know that he loves you and don't let it create resentment, because he didn't mean to hurt you.

"
"Haha, unfortunately I work with a lot of Math which is pretty universal (except damn imperial units!), so my extra languages are really just for fun. 

She does get quite jealous about a lot of things. Like if I mentioned having been to a restaurant before, she'll ask ""Did you go there on a date? Who did you go with?"" or something like that. "
"My fiance was in the Navy for five years, and he definitely had some ""I hate my life"" periods. It was before I met him, but I can guarantee that he never just mysteriously wandered into a brothel and got a prostitute, no matter how miserable he was. "

What exactly does this mean?"
"If your boyfriend is unable to even consider fixing such a huge problem, then maybe it's not a good boyfriend."
"You laugh, but the instant OP ambles downstairs starkers and asks the assembled guests ""who wants turkey breast?"" is the instant her religious mother flings OP's entire wardrobe into her arms."
"Yeah, seriously. People like that are obnoxious. She's so anxious she... makes a blog post calling people out? Sure, ok.

I am tempted to tell OP to reply to her blog post with a snarky ""I'm not a mind reader, but now that I know about your anxiety I'll be sure to treat you with kid gloves in the future since apparently 'No Means No' doesn't apply to you."""
"the thing about him is; he hates women. your SIL is bad and he disrespects her for being bossy and mouthy, right? and he ALSO disrespects you for NOT being those things. so what type of woman WOULD he speak about with respect? my guess is, none. he doesn't think being a nice person and a good wife is as valuable as... basically any thing a man could be. a nice woman versus a terrible jerk of a man, he would respect the jerk man more."
"This guy's reaction to a typo was a threat to shoot you in the face, and when you pointed out he was out of line, he said your behavior *forced* him to react that way. If that's not man-who's-going-to-be-on-the-news-in-three-years-for-murdering-his-wife material, I don't know what is. Get out of there, OP, and be really careful doing it. Move out when he's not home, it get a police escort, and go somewhere where he can't find you."
Why the fuck would you consider a serious relationship with someone who doesn't want to be a surrogate parent to your daughter? Stop thinking with your penis. You are a dad first. How exactly is having a relationship with this woman helpful for your daughter?
"It'll be OP's fault either way. Either she tries to help and it'll be all her fault, or Jane will run it into the ground which wouldn't have happened if OP just helped her in the first place. She can't win. If I was her I'd stay the hell away from it. "
"It's white-knightish. He probably thought he was doing her a favor. Chivalry is not dead, unfortunately. If this benign sexism is his worst offence, I might be able to live with it. But in my experience, it's rare for it not to show up in more malignant ideas/actions."

There are people out there who torture people for fun.

Slavery was an accepted practice for most of human history. 

75 years ago, Germany killed 11 million or so people in gas chambers for being the wrong ethnicity. 

Yes, people can be this cruel and calculating. "
"Pretty much.

Also indicates that he knows exactly what he's doing since he wasn't brought up inside a cult.  So he probably knows exactly how abusive he's being."
"I know exactly why actually; this is something my therapist has been helping me with, but we haven't made much progress. (triggers ahead if you need a warning) I was kidnapped for several days &amp; violently raped repeatedly in the process when I was in college. I never used to be sex-averse. I'm MUCH BETTER than I used to be. For several years, I couldn't even get undressed to bathe, and would go weeks without showering. It was disgusting, and distressing. It's kind of amazing that with ""only"" a decade of therapy, I'm able not only to enjoy a bubblebath while nude, but to do so with my naked girlfriend in the tub with me. That's a long way from having sex, though."
"I think foot-in-mouth comments tend to indicate that the person didn't mean to say it, or it came out wrong... the boyfriend held his ground and then yelled like an angsty teen as he left."
"As I read your story I put myself in Will's shoes, and have to say I would be unable to trust you after all this. I'm afraid you have to own your behavior here.

BUT -- I see you referring to ""mental health issues,"" a suicide attempt, and apparent major self-esteem problems (which led you to surrender to whatever guy wanted you sexually, although you were ambivalent).  I really, really urge you to see this episode as an incentive to get counseling / therapy / etc. in order to understand why you have acted the way you did, and that you can change to have better outcomes.

Sometimes people with low self-esteem unconsciously blow up their chances at happiness (e.g. Will + you) because they believe they don't deserve nice things. When you love yourself you can believe otherwise. Please get help. I wish you growth and peace."
Honestly it looks like ripping apart the family is the best thing for the little cousin. Even if OPs mom can get temp custody or something. Anything is better than this. A
"&gt; She wants me to learn how to sleep more deeply, if that's possible. 

So she wants you to change the way your brain works when you sleep, which is impossible. The way you've been sleeping for 27 years. But she refuses to stop cuddling her dog, which is very possible. The way she's been sleeping for 1 year. Hmm. 

&gt;We haven't come up with any real compromises because there really aren't any.

There are, she's just not willing to make any. "
"80% of this is you crowing ""I was RIGHT! He took MY advice and he is so much happier and healthier now! I am so glad I stooped down from my ivory tower to help my gross ass brother. No one else would! Not even our parents!""

You never once consider the fact that having the right answer does not negate the cruelty of your approach. You very obviously damaged your brother more than you helped him. You took on the role of abusive parent or bully and tried to forcefully browbeat the desired outcome out of him rather than putting in the time and effort to really connect and teach by example. 

It doesn't even occur to you that reflecting on your wrongs and apologizing is the best option here. Instead, you call *him* immature and expect him to fall all over himself to thank you for being ""right"".  

Hopefully you take a page from your brother's playbook and start working to improve yourself. It sounds like you've wasted a lot of time polishing your shell without enriching any of the important bits that go inside. "
"Agreed. Also, I don’t want to make Jessica sound like a home wrecker when I know nothing about her,  but she’s clearly vulnerable at the moment, and OPs husband is being her knight in shining armour, other people are getting the wrong idea, it’s only a matter of time before she gets the wrong idea. Much better to find a single man to get those ideas about."
Or work together and build a life together?
It's yours. Keep it and forget her. 
"&gt;I mean, I could see if I asked about cheating out of the blue...

You mean like you did when you confronted her with the pregnancy test? 

It's not that you ""have some questions"" it's that you jumped to cheating after she gave you a reasonable explanation. She said her appetite changed and she'd been nauseous (Which you dismiss since you apparently know how she feels in her body better than she does) which was what she experienced with previous pregnancies. 

You even say in your edit that you know vasectomies fail, so then why did you ask her ""how that could be possible considering the fact that I got snipped""? 
"
"Not even a reverse snob, just a snob. He thinks he's a martyr "
Oh still weird outta 2800 people none of them are friends and family of the husband and told him??? Anyways whatever the case is I’m curious what the conversations were like with ur ex before he went crazy and messaged everyone are you feeling guilty and trying to hide something else? You look very sketchy and dishonest I would tell your husband asap before you ruin your marriage with lying. You don’t have to even say the abuse stuff now you can just say he’s crazy af right now and show him the messages you exchanged with him and what he sent etc
"No bullying in private school? HAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

1. One of only 3 black girls in the school. My hairstyles were mocked CONSTANTLY.

2. I was first to get boobs in my class. I was accused of stuffing. 

3. The mean girl clic was made up of hispanic girls. They routine switched to spanish when talking shit about other people. Didn't do it with me as I was fluent in spanish at that age.

So yeah it does happen.

She wants your daughter to go so badly? SHE can pay for it out of her ACCOUNT. Do not write a single check to this school. 

Couples therapy MIGHT help but she's financially abusing you. This is beyond she's making unilateral decisions.

"
"No.  I thought about that actually, after the first class.

But the second class it was the same clothes. And the stank was definitely both from clothing and body. The skin oils on the doorknob tipped of some of that.

I've taught a few cancer patients, and there's a specific kind of chemo-smell that is clearly unpleasant, but it's not *offensive* in this same way. Cancer patients. for example, may have the scent on their bodies, but not permeating their clothing, if they've changed into fresh clothes that day. This is partly why I was willing to give the benefit of the doubt after the first class."
"I think this is really important. Saying ""I'm sorry"" over and over again means nothing if it isn't accompanied with a detailed explanation of *why*, both why it was wrong and why it happened, and specific steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. "
"Agreed on low contact. OP’s dad is an asshole and I’d stay far away. 

The only expectations parents should have from their son-in-law (or daughter-in-law) are to love and respect and treat their kid well. I know this life, and what I do with my parents is ask them to email me what they want to talk about before the meeting and then my partner and I decide whether to meet or not. G"
My husband and I have these and it’s the best. 
Preach! If I could just win the Powerball...
"Nurses came into our house every day for a year when my mom was sick with cancer. They wouldn't have answered our landline phone, or opened the front door if there was a knock, or even gone into a room that wasn't the bathroom or bedroom.. let alone pick up her cell phone and read messages and text someone back. So either that's one weird, awful nurse or he is definitely lying. Just wanted the money. "
I have a friend with a beloved old dog named Finn. The dog saved the husband's life. They had a son and named him Finn after the dog. Little Finn loves telling people about why he was named after big Finn. Lol. Your SIL is overreacting. Take the higher road but don't let them push you around. It sets a precedent.

This isn't up for negotiation in any way. I'm in the middle of some incredibly miserable health problems and I don't have the time or energy to put up with anything negative, so I don't want to hear any complaints or begging or arguing. I hope you can understand where I'm coming from."""
"You can find all of those things that you are compatible on (ethics, future plans, interests, etc) with someone else who you DO have that fiery chemistry with. Mismatched sex drives/needs are a common issue in relationships, as you'll see on this subreddit, but it doesn't have to be! Be with someone who makes you feel desired, who turns you on, who you're sexually compatible with. If you don't end it now, you'll likely be dealing with this issue for the rest of your life with this guy."
"He most likely had a manic episode, they usually start at his Age and with a trigger event (the death in his family), he most have done something outrageous like running naked or shouting on the streets"

"Most if not all of my colleagues know I'm not interested one of them have straight up told him you need to leave her alone, when a new girl started one of the first things he told her was that he liked me"

"Because you were scared and in shock. It's nothing to be ashamed of. 

Just tell the truth ""when 'bro' come home last night, I was asleep on the couch. He tried to tell me to move but I was half asleep. He stayed there for awhile and then started touching me, sexually. I was in shock and couldn't move so he must have thought I was asleep. I finally made a noise and I must have scared him. I don't know how to deal with this and I need your help."" "
For what conceivable purpose would the mother ruin the memory of the girls' father? The win-win here is the girls remembering their father without tarnish AND the mom starting to date in her new life with everyone moving on. The mother does not need to ruin the memory of the father in order to start her new life. I don't get it.
"Something similar happened to me with one of my best friends when we were around the same age (I’m now in my 30s).  The summarized version is that her drinking and driving and ridiculous alcohol fueled behavior was out of control. She didn’t assault me but ultimately I outed her to her family. Hardest thing I’ve ever done and while it’s been over 10 years and I still think about it often.  OP, I can’t make the call on whether or not you should report her - but it may make the difference between her changing her ways or continuing to decline/be at risk of hurting someone else.  Filing the report will likely kill any chance of you two remaining friends (granted her physically assaulting you should be the nail in that coffin anyways) but at least you know you tried to bring behavior to light that might force her to change for the better.  Good luck! "
"Lots of comments here subtly trying to cover for the girl.  

OP, I promise you that she's cheating. She has cheated before with this coworker, and that's why he was expecting revealing pictures of her without even having to ask. She is betraying you.  

Please don't fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy. Just because this is a 5-year relationship does not mean you deserve to lower your basic requirements and take back a cheater. She chose another guy over you. She chose him multiple times. She chose him. Now it's time for you to choose what's best for you -- rather than try to fight for a relationship that is already over. "
"You didn't screw up, you nuked your relationship.

If he was here asking what to do, I think most people would say you can't fix this, break up.

You destroyed something that didn't belong to you, to make yourself feel better, and by doing so you completely ignored the pain and suffering you would inflict on your husband and step daughter.

Learn a valuable lesson to take into your future relationships I guess. "
"DO NOT FEEL GUILTY!  At one point in our lives my husband lost his job.  We decided it would be a great time for him to start his own practice.  Not only did he start his practice from stractch but dinners were ready when I got home from work, the house was ""sorta"" clean, the kids and dogs  got to their appointments.  He was better at the mom thing than I was.  And he worked on his own business like a dog.  Your husband is delusional.  Get a reset!"
"Dang, after reading the first post I was really hoping the update would be - I'm no longer friends with M and dumped THE MASSIVE ASSHOLE J. Oh well :("
"I understand that no matter how much you practice, you cannot always get rid of an accent. I also have two names. It's nice going by my American name because no one mispronounces it and I never have to correct them. 
Hearing my foreign name from a non-native speaker just feels jarring to me. It makes me feel really awkward (like an outsider) and it isn't a matter of simply correcting them (it is very difficult to get the nuances right and it's just a lot better not to bother). 

I have gotten into arguments with people who insist on calling me by my ""real name"" (I'm mixed race so they're both my real name) and when I say ""it still sounds awkward to me. I'd just prefer if you used Jane"", they respond with ""No, I want to get it RIGHT!!"" which is then followed by several minutes of failed attempts and really I just want to get on with my day. 

My ex's mom was really really insistent and said she needed to feel closer to me and my culture by calling me by my foreign name constantly and practicing pronouncing it. I appreciate her wanting to feel closer to me but in the end she is insistent because it's HER desire, not mine. 

Maybe you and your SO can truncate your name to something more easily pronounced, or come up with a completely different pet name for each other only. I understand how it feels to have your name butchered and when non native speakers try it just floods me with terrible bullying memories from my childhood.

"That's great that he's got his big boy pants on.  Now he can tell her that she needs to get treatment for her suicidal thoughts, that her behavior and relationships are self-destructive, that it was inappropriate for her to climb into his tent at 3 am and even more inappropriate to joke about it, that he doesn't want to abandon a friend so she needs to do him a solid by not alienating his fiancee and owning up to the hurtful things she's said in the past.  Like a Big Boy.  "

"So 1 kid goes to school and you stay at home all day with a 1-year old and you can't clean the house?  

You're right, this isn't about the money.  

This is about a huge imbalance in labor. If you don't pick up the slack, he will begin resenting you for this. You need to figure out why you can't do a pretty basic thing like keeping the house tidy."

"I highly doubt it's ""all"" the household chores. Is loading the dishes or vacuuming the living room to give your partner a break that difficult? I would say the same thing if the woman was the working partner as well. The human body does not shut down after being at work for 8/10 hours. It simply just takes a lot of little annoying tasks to keep a house running and clean and I think every adult living there should pitch in. And yes, of course kids take naps! But honestly when a baby is sleeping most people use that time to get the chores done, it's not quality self care time, you know?"
Also remember that CPS won't jump to take the child away and won't rip the family apart. Their first priority is to provide resources and advice.

"If it were me, I'd sit down with my fiance and tell him the whole situation. I'd bring up the texts and show him myself, explaining where I was then and that I've since gotten over that. Add in some reassurances that I actually do find him very attractive and was just scared.  Then, do what you want with your relationship with your father.

I mean, this is one time. How many other situations will you find yourself in where your father uses those texts to force you what to Do? Talking to your fiance may be hard, but it will be easier now. It will hurt more years from now."
"Nah I’d be upset and you are right if the rolls were reversed and You got in a car with a girl and drove off she’d be pissed haha I agree I don’t think anything happened, but super rude... have u straight up asked her why she doesn’t introduce you as her bf in front of men? A little concerning , maybe they are her ex’s and she feels weird but she needs to get over that if she wants it to work "
how about whenever you choose to eat fast food you stuff the bags into another bag so she won't see them? i would imagine alot of her anger comes from the fact that she's frustrated that she can't eat that crap and so seeing the food wrappers just sets her off.

You're not that important that hundreds of people on social media are nitpicking your costume from hundreds of miles away. We tend to think everyone else is like us and it sounds like you're a bit fixated of social media appearances."
"&gt; For example, last night we had a tiny quarrel about him saying that he doesn't want me to wear any clothing that reveals a bit of cleavage. His reasons: -doesn't want me to be taken advantage of -doesn't think it's special if other guys see what I have -doesn't want me to accidentally ""lead guys on"" -doesn't see why I'd want to dress sexy if I already have him. I do respect his opinion and only wear t-shirts/sweatshirts

Controlling behavior. His reasons are borderline gashlighting and borderline emotionally abusive. 

&gt;I know people are going to say that I have to break up with him but I'm not going to do that anytime soon. I just want to know if I'm being too insensitive?

No, you're not being insensitive. Your boyfriend's behavior is alarming. 

&gt; I can't wear low cut shirts because my boyfriend doesn't want me to. How do I come to a compromise ?

You don't. This is controlling behavior on your boyfriend's part. I'll say it, leave now before his behavior escalates. This is not a healthy relationship."
"It might cause short term discomfort for your finance and for you, but being a true partner means being able to overcome discomfort for greater good. If he can't rely on you to bring him important bad news, who can he trust? Do it with care, of course, reserve judgment and conjure up serious grace in the delivery, but any hurt feelings that result from this would come from her, not you, and waiting just exacerbates the potential future harm. It is more important that he knows who had his back and who doesn't. You do. This virtual-stranger does not."
"&gt;I kind of want to consider going back on birth control for awhile.

Please, *please* do. Having kids with this guy will mean you're linked to him for life. It also means he'll get influence and control over your children. Imagine having kids with him and them thinking his behavior toward you is OK. Imagine having sons who think this is how they should view women. Imagine having daughters who expect to be demeaned and put down by the men in their lives. And what if you two get a divorce after having kids? If he's comfortable being so hateful toward you now while you're in a supposedly happy marriage, what will he say to your kids about you once he's an embittered divorced dad?"
"Are we reading the same post? She states more than once that she needs time to wind down and then will snuggle with him. She even points out that by delaying her wind down time he is actually delaying snuggle time. So she is aware of his needs and offering a compromise. He just appears unwilling to give it a try. Maybe they're not a great match. Perhaps emotionally he is not capable of giving her her space. Either way, it sounds like if he doesn't try to compromise she is only going to resent giving him any affection at all. Which is only going to make things worse for them both. "
"You are absolutely right. I am going to save all of the conversations I have regarding him and the puppy if I need it in court, and starting now I will start taking care of the puppy until I can figure this shit out, get myself correct backing, and then rehome the dog. I will make sure he is not neglected in the meantime, and then I will rehome him last day. I know the day I rehome him puts me and Shadow in immediate danger. So we will do this when I have a good place to go. 

So I will take care of him, see a doctor about the baby this weekend, come up with a plan, find Hooey an amazing home, and run quickly. 

Thank you. "
"&gt;(I get that you're trying to take a stand)

I agree with you, but not this part. Who ""takes a stand"" by stepping back and allowing a creature dependant on you to be neglected? Like hello? To the point where the dog was ""all bone""??

This entire story made me so mad. OP's husband is the sort of person who should be banned for life from keeping animals, and OP isn't doing what's right."
"Ask him - ""Are we boyfriend/girlfriend?"" You've gone too long without having that conversation anyway. But it seems bad that he clearly says you aren't to people other than you. "
"*Dear family, my brother came tgo my home and assaulted me. It is unreasonable of you to expect an apology from my girlfriend for defending me from my brother, who as you are aware has been involved in a number of incidents. Until such time as you withdraw the request for an apology and accept that my girlfriends actions were sensible, I will no longer be having any contact with you.*"
" &gt;is this immoral? Am I terrible human being as well?

on the whole, staying with someone because they finance your life says more about your lack of self-respect. i mean, you are a rich-mans wife-pillow, basically. is it really worth making your friends jealous about your lifestyle? at some point hes going to totally own you, and it won't be ice coffees thrown, it'll be fists. 

&gt; I have become so good at acting like I love him still,

this, this is immoral. i mean he seems like a bad guy but lets face it - you are easily replaceable to him. i'm sure both of you know it. why devalue yourself, why degrade your future ability to love by doing this?

you need to move out, yesterday. become a functioning adult for awhile. take some of that savings, take a trip somewhere far away, and plan what youre going to do with the rest of your life. 

do not accept anything from him when you do this. block him from everything. if he pursues you itll just be to exercise power - he probably has 4 girlfriends around town already...

TLDR: you either stay and admit you think you are a person devoid of worth or value, or you move on and try to figure out why you think trading your soul for cash was worth it"
"&gt; We don't live in an era where employers feel loyalty to their employees, so it's not fair to ask employees to sacrifice for their employers.

Sure, it isn't fair, but that doesn't mean they still don't look for at least some loyalty. There's nothing wrong with looking out for yourself first, but OP's brother is doing it to an extreme that's actually devaluing his hireability. He's worked 7 jobs in 4 years. That's about 6 months at each place. He's job hopping so much he's seen as unreliable and a bad prospect, and from a business perspective, he *is* a bad prospect. "
"100 people? She sounds spoiled. Your mom should talk to your brother about getting her to “remember” her manners. Otherwise she’s going to cause problems in your family for years to come. 

I have so much more to say about dogs! But Soph and I are playing ball at the park:)"
"Vasectomies can fail.

Also you say that she should have mentioned it to you first, but be honest with yourself, that wouldn't have changed anything. You would have still been angry at her and would have thought she was cheating. She took the test on her own just as a check to make sure she didn't get pregnant despite your vasectomy, which is possible. 

This ""oh she should have told me"" thing is a post hoc justification for your reaction. If she actually told you before she took the test, you'd still be uneducated about how vasectomies work and would still have been upset. Just let it go dude"
"Does your boyfriend have any identifying birthmarks or tattoos you could ask her about? If she's been sleeping with him, she'll have a pretty good idea of his body."
"Not really. Open adoptions are open for as long as the adoptive parents want them open.

There is no legal standing for open adoptions."
"He was the opposite of manipulative. He didn't try to talk her out of the trip. He just broke up when she broke a boundary he did talk about, albeit subtly. Which is really the complete opposite of manipulation."
"I thought the same thing. Like, come on, OP.

&gt; The budgeting thing is a separate issue that will have to wait.

Wait until when? After the wedding when you're going to be a financial unit? Nah

"
"Agreed, what a dumb thing to say.

I'm sure he was just trying to cover his ass, but did he do background checks on all the women? Follow them home to see what their life is like? Have a therapy session with them about whether or not this was *really* their choice?

I don't have a comment on what OP should do, but if he's going to be honest about his sexual past, just be honest about it. This whole ""I only slept with the *good* kind"" is a load of horseshit. "
"This is exactly what I think. I think Anna is getting it on the side and is now concerned that the girlfriend will pull in the reigns, keeping Anna from being able to see John."
"It's worth noting that in a comment in the first post, OP clarified that he choked her. They need to separate for both their health."
"Actually...

Atheism is about belief  Atheist=Do you belief in a god? No. (Yes=Theist)
and
Agnosticism is about knowledge. Agnostic=Do you know if there's a god? No. (Yes=Gnostic)

So you can have _agnostic_ Theists and Atheists. They both don't know if there's a god, but the theist does belief in one any way. 

And then there're quite a lot of agnostics who refuse to answer the belief question. 

I'd also refute that being an atheist is definite. If someone could actually demonstrate that there's one or more than one god, I'd start to belief. 
But I most probably would still refuse to worship that entity for a myriad of reasons. 
Also I second that: don't lie to your wife. "
"I felt the same way when reading it. All these people gave them gifts, which she was happy to take, but when they *dare* to ask how married life is, she wants nothing to do with them.

"&gt;I want to change my behavior but I don't even know how to start.

Therapy?   Maybe talk about why you feel an incessant need to make jokes?   Why do you feel like you can't just stop making stupid jokes and comments?"
"How many more months until she delivers?

Also, do you plan to have more kids? She may be reluctant to get pregnant again if she knows you’ll withhold sex once she starts showing. 

It might help to realize most men do have sex with their pregnant wives, oftentimes up  to the day of delivery. So if you have any thoughts that it’s “abnormal”, dispense with them. 

As to what to say to her...anything you say is going to be hurtful. You’re saying it’s not her, but this is her body at the moment and no woman wants to feel her mate isn’t attracted to her. Especially when she’s carrying his child. 

I think you should try very hard to get past this or your marriage might suffer. There are lots of things you can do. Stimulate yourself first. Do positions where you’re not looking at her stomach. (Not ideal because she’s still probably going to feel less confident in herself, but it’s better than no sex at all). You can also do many sex acts to stimulate her that don’t require your arousal. "
Yeah that would probably be a good idea. I think that long term visit will also turn into the same thing though; I really don’t think she’s going back once she comes in. But I could give it a shot
"Send him to a temporary agency and be done with it. You already know he's going to mess up. If he stays mad at you oh well, let him be mad with his mad ass. He should be willing to do whatever it takes to get a job including getting his own job and working multiple temp jobs if necessary. "
"Idk if someone already mentioned this to you or if you've done it alreadg, but if I were you I would also send that video to myself, just in case. "
"^ this, especially because she was TRYING to show you.  I wouldn't jump to some of the other Redditor's conclusions that she's clearly an incestual freak.  It could be she's been dealing with her brother molesting her for so long that she can't even understand what's normal anymore.  Take it from someone who suffered sexual abuse as a child - sorting out those emotions is complicated *at best* and nervous laughter is not the strangest reaction to that sort of thing.  But therapy might be needed for both parties and you are going to have to have a serious, supportive conversation, at least until this scenario has been ruled out. "
You aren't owed a gift.  He wants to give it to you in January so he can enjoy your reaction.  You are coming across really spoiled here.  Maybe kick in some maturity and be patient.

No contact is the only way. Start communicating more with your husband. 
"How did this never come up? I thought you were ""strong friends""?"
"She can do that, sure, but it will probably those around her more unhappy than it makes her.

I'm like a less severe version of OP.  When my parents insisted on nice Christmas gifts, I insisted otherwise. Eventually we learned to compromise; they'd get something of a cost that didn't make me feel guilty/like a mooch, and they'd still get to feel good about giving me something.

Ultimately, I think it made us both feel better since it relieved the tension.  OP can try having them do thin vs her way, but if it clearly makes them unhappy she's probably better off figuring out a middle ground where she can compromise (e.g, homemade gifts)."
"""What you have to understand is that hubby and I were committed to each other and happy long before the wedding. We didn't need marriage to prove to each other our life bond or commitment to each other.

I get that this may not fit your world view, but it is what it is. So please, for the love of all that you hold sacred and for my sanity's sake, stop forcing your world view onto me."""
"Yeah, there are multiple people in this thread who are coming at this just so wrong-headed. If OP honestly thinks her husband and uncle destroyed a note like this maliciously, then she probably shouldn't be married to him.

My BF talks to me, and his parents for socializing and it drives me nuts. I just wanted him to have friends with similar interests he could do things with, but it's a lost cause.

"From the way you describe it, he is controlling, emotionally manipulative, and physically abusive.  Furthermore, as you point out, you don't trust him.  I mean, I don't think we need to analyze this for you, you've already done it.

You see this a lot in here: you can't cut them off their your family and they love you. What a load of tripe. Just because they are related to you does not mean you have to like them.
"Of course not. If you stay, you risk years or a lifetime of abuse for yourself and a child.

If they continue to disrespect your boundaries, make use of the greatest resource you have: continued access to you and their grandchild. Next time they ignore your boundaries and say something about your ex, they don't see or hear from you for a week. Then two weeks. Then a month.

All parents want to give their kids the best that they can afford. If you and your wife have the money to give your child the best possible education and materials, why *not* do so? What else are you going to spend your money on? You shouldn't deny your child the best schooling just because you assume other children there will be snobs.

&gt; I didn't get a cell phone or a car until I could afford to pay for them on my own

Times have changed. When you were young, cell phones weren't common. Nowadays, it's the norm for everyone to have them. Granted, 4 years is a bit young for the super fancy gadgets, but you can't hold your kid to the same standard that you grew up with.

"r/MaladaptiveDreaming/ and your boyfriend is an asshole.

When I confided in my closest friend about my intensive daydreaming, their reactions were mostly of curiosity since they wanted to understand better how I thought things or passed my time.

"I think an important detail missing is the reason she called so many times in a short span of time. I don't see how in your head you thought ""well, three phone calls in two minutes isn't an emergency, but four -- that definitely is!"" If it was something important [like she was in an accident or was too drunk to get home and needed you to come and get her], I think she has reason to be upset with you. If it wasn't something important, I don't think she has a reason to be upset. That being said, the way she reacted is not appropriate and it sounds like she may need some anger management classes if this is normal behavior for her. "
"&gt; My son's potential education choices are kind of a big deal.

Your son is an infant. If you sacrifice your boyfriend's happiness because of what your son might potentially want to do with his education in seventeen+ years, I don't blame your boyfriend for being upset. That sounds absolutely ridiculous to me. 

You are acting as if your boyfriend doesn't know what it's like to live there, when the exact opposite is true. YOU haven't lived there. He's lived in both places. If anything, he's got more perspective on the differences than you do. 

Look, I get it that where you live works for you. I happen to really like where I live even though it's expensive. But if my husband was so miserable living here that he was willing to move away without me, I'd be listening to him pretty seriously (especially if he's been saying for YEARS that he isn't happy there) and coming up with a compromise instead of just telling him he's not thinking it through.

Her trading her fun university experiences NOW in return for you making a vague promise about partying LATER is not fair, and again, insulting. She doesn't need you to be 5 minutes away at all times any more than you need your mommy to be 5 minutes away from you. Because she gets to be responsible for herself, she is an adult. I think you should stay broke up, lighten up about relationships, hang out with your friends. A relationship is not all there is and shouldn't be the centre of your existence at the expense of everything else."
"Yeah... minus the drunk driving, that describes my college experience pretty perfectly lol"
"&gt; As someone with diagnosed social anxiety, someone with social anxiety wouldn't have even posted that.

Forgive me for asking you to answer on behalf of all the socially anxious - but - isn't the way OP did things basically ideal for someone with social anxiety?  No person in your face demanding an answer.  Instead a thoughtful letter that you can answer at your own pace when you're ready and when you're confident about your decision.

To me, the fact she called a letter out as pressure (vs something that demands an on-the-spot answer, like phone/in person) would be way easier for the socially anxious."
"&gt; I'm usually too emotional to be logical.

Is this the way you would describe yourself, or have other people (ie, your boyfriend) described you this way? Do you ever feel like you can't trust your own emotions or recollections of events?"
"You are so exactly right. By talking big about his fantastic plans he gets the ""achievement high"" of doing the things, without actually having to do the things. It's super-common. And super annoying."
"Don't tell people! 

I am probably messing this up, but if I understand correctly, when we tell people things like that, we sort of get the ""hit"" we'd feel as if we actually achieved the thing - like, our friends praise us, and we get attention and positivity and feel proud and accomplished. But we didn't have to do anything for it. So when it comes time to do the actual WORK, our subconscious says ""Why bother? You already achieved it."" Because you FELT that achievement already. You already sort of feel as if you READ the book, so there's not as much incentive to finish it. 

They say this about things like making a healthy lifestyle change, applying for jobs, training for any kind of competition, etc. - do it for you, keep it on the down-low, or tell only people who will support you AND also keep on you to stay on track. 

Just a thought! You can search around, I read about this kind of thing online but as you can tell it's pretty fuzzy in my memory. :) "
"Who in that household manages the household duties? Is it possible that she is like my mother in that she doesn't want people over unless the house and the people in it are totally ""presentable""? After having each of us My mom refused to see anyone until after the house was back to it's pre-birth and pregnancy neatness.(this time got shorter after each birth as she got better at balancing her time)

Also I wouldn't worry about it too much it's only been two months, when it's been 4 or 5 i'd get concerned. "
"&gt; and she deleted his texts and left it at that

She just destroyed any tangible evidence that she had. This will now become a ""he said she said"" and will do absolutely no good if you say anything. Leave it alone and have her go to another tattoo artist from now on. Also, stay out of it, it's not your business and just puts your mom in the uncomfortable position she didn't want to be in, don't break her trust. 

*While this is a lot less severe than sexual assault* there was a thread just recently about that and how it's almost worse when you tell someone and then are *forced* to go to the police. This is her telling you, don't *force* her to go to the police, if you get what I mean. I get that it's frustrating and upsetting, but at this point the best thing to do is just move on and avoid him."
"&gt;I told her I would be OK with her seeing other women, as long as she's open to sharing me with them.

&gt;GF told me she wants to explore her bisexual side. I told her I want to fullfill my fantasy/curiousity for a threesome in return. Shit blows up, and i'm being told i'm a bad boyfriend.

You're misaligning your fantasy with her curiosity. Realistically, it's not going to be easy to find a woman that's into both her AND you. What if your girlfriend is into a woman and the woman is into her, but not into you? Does that mena your girlfriend can't explore? And you're making her curiosity about you AND turning your relationship into a transaction.

Basically, you're being silly.

Here's the important bit:

&gt; To me, I don't care if it's a male or female - the act of her being with someone else actually makes me feel uncomfortable. 

Here's the salient bit. You're not comfortable with her having sex with other people. You're more interested in monogamy. So, either she puts her curiosity aside, or she exits your relationships and sews some oats.

If you MUST maintain this relationship, here's what you do:

If she can see other people, you can too. Gender doesn't matter. She can have sex with women or men, and so can you. Full stop.

That's basically an open relationship. This gives her the latitude to explore and gives you the opportunity to have a threesome.

Problem solved.

"It's *my* job. I would never interfere with his job. 

Honestly I don't think it was malicious, either. I just can't even begin to comprehend a mindset where one would feel it's okay to go to their spouse's boss and ask them to ease up. 

That's so not okay on so many levels. I'm not going to be thankful that my fiancé thinks so little of me he feels he has to take care of my issues and speak on my behalf."
"the bare minimum , Icily polite "
"I think there's a difference between ""look for a potential third"" and ""drunk text about the girl you're about to share a bed with that you've made out with and would've pursued if she'd been local and then call to drunk talk about how excited you are to possibly sleep with her"""
"Hi! Social worker here- aka “support-worker”. This situation does not sound right. A support staff should never be encouraging a client to spend funds they do not have, much less for a payday loan. My suggestion would be that your mom has a right to the services provided to her, so I would talk to her &amp; have her ask the Agency/company she gets support from to place her with a different support staff. Then I would sit down with the new staff, Mom, and sister upon one of their first visits and discuss boundaries and expectation. You are a family member and loved one of the client in services (your mom) so you ALSO have a right to check over services &amp; discuss anything weird/odd you see. Hope this helps! "
"&gt; Well none of the jokes were aimed at us at all thankfully. 

""It's okay if they say terrible things about innocent people as long as I'm not personally the target of things they are saying!"""
"No. When I first met him, he was earning below minimum wage, I was working but we didn't have any assets. Now we have a mortgaged house with quite a bit of equity in it, some shares and two cars paid off, so we are doing what I consider quite well and I am more than happy with what we have. "
"Are you saying you respect a guy with these views?
Why would you want to be friends with a guy like this?  He's deep down, not a good guy. "
"I come from a different culture so my advice is pretty much irrelevant but just for argument sake - around here your reaction would be considered perfectly normal and even required. What I'm trying to say is that I wouldn't label you with any type of disorder. There are people out there, a lot of them, for whom this type of reaction is the norm. 

I'm a woman and non-violent. If anyone came into my home and started shouting at me or my husband I would consider my family under attack and defend with any means possible. Why should I wait for them to strike first?"
"Yeah, but that Tucker Max guy also doesn't seem like a model for successful relationships."
"Well, she'd rather avoid talking about it and then will keep forcing her opinions and discomfort on them, and 6 months from now she'll wonder why she never sees her daughter and stepson. She's willfully ignorant at this point as no one is diminishing her contributions and effort she put into the family dynamic, but are saying the stepson may not see her the same way. 

Her views are very skewed as she thinks everything should be the way she thinks it should, and if she truly is trying to be a good parent she would listen to all of the advice in this thread instead of getting mad and leaving the conversation because she doesn't like what she's being told because people aren't agreeing with her."
"No, her reasoning is she's immature and stupid.

I had to check your ages. OP you're in your 30's, how do you have patience for this? "
"Honestly you are currently her enabler and letting your children down.

You need to gather the courage and leave.  ANY situation is better than this.

Start looking for a new job that allows you to juggle childcare appopriately and get a lawyer."
I mean it's obvious she is being bat shit insane.  Finn is more of a dog name than human name also.  To me life is way to short to cater to insane people and I personally would not give them the time of day unless they want to apologize and make things right.  I would also keep the name Finn.  You offered to change it which is more generosity than this girl deserves many times over.  You're brother is the biggest douche of all here for not having any balls in this situation.
Yesssss. Ugh. He actually managed to say ‘women’ twice so we know he has it in him.
