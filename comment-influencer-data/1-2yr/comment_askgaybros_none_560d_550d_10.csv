Ooo girl keep that shit over there on that side of the ocean.
"You realize that PReP is only for the prevention of HIV, right?"
"Most guys here are gonna tell you not to date closeted boys. Just be patient with him, it sounds like he's a nice guy and could be one of the ones on his way out. 

Boys you want around after you're done fucking them are usually the ones worth dating. "
"They know, they just don't care."
"Having been there, you're playing with fire.  If they are in a serious relationship how are you going to feel being out in a group with her, knowing what you guys are doing?  I know, because I was at that table (except it was him blowing me).  

Do you know the expression  ""Don't shit where you eat?"" It's just a dick. Find another one."
"**Open minded**: I make 50 Shades look like Sesame Street

"Years ago. Straight married with kids. Buddy I worked with. Beers after work. One day we talking about sex, and it led into him admitting he had thoughts....leads into questions..,leads into him squealing my name while I bone him. He got all nervous after, and I just took him on a drive and told him straight up, it isn‚Äôt like girls, I don‚Äôt own you, I don‚Äôt want to tell anyone, it isn‚Äôt a thing unless you and I both want it to be. You tell me what you want. He told me he was scared because he liked it, and he wanted to go back to being straight guy. I told him, bro, you can‚Äôt go back if you never left, sex is sex, and I also told him I would never expect him to face that fear alone after we did sex together. 

He never did it again, although he talked about ups and downs about his marriage, he respects me, asks my opinion on things, he hit it and quit it. He told me on the phone one day, (we no longer live near each other) that he felt like he grew up a lot after our thing. He said thanks for how I treated him, and thanks for being supportive and not douchey. He now has a gay son. He shared with me that he feels like he knows what to do because of our moment. That he can stand up for his gay kid. So win win. "
have we?  *cries in virgin*
Bro he‚Äôs looking to get off and you‚Äôre gonna catch feelings and he‚Äôs just gonna be using your mouth as a flesh light. We‚Äôve all been there 
"&gt;I also feel like I'm not worthy of his innocent feelings

You baked him a *pie.* I think you're pretty worthy, OP."
"Honestly after all you said the only reasonable thing to be done here is:

Record all of it and post it. And keep doing it. And keep recording it and posting.

But really, seems really cool. Keep doing it, with time you'll probably get more used to it and last longer."
"My buddy and I served together in the military and hung out a lot. I was in an open relationship at the time. We would go out to bars and the casino pretty often, get drunk and generally just go back to his place and chill. We did that for years before anything sexual happened. One day we had just got back to his place after hitting the bars and casinos and he started bitching about women and how long it had been since he got laid. Several conversations and a few more beers later, he brought me into his bedroom and fucked my brains out. It happened a few times after that as well but eventually tapered off when he found a girlfriend. Still friends to this day."
Counterpoint: suck the dick and don‚Äôt feel bad about it. 
When will people realize we're all bottoms and life just shoves it in the butt. No lube.
**Looking for a workout buddy**: I want somebody muscular
"That's a beautiful positive attitude to have about that situation. Most gays I know, when they realize their crush is straight, spiral into a ridiculous depression and even lash out and never recover and spend the next many years being hostile and treating everyone like dirt all cuz they couldn't get that D that one time. 

(glares at various Gaybros here)"
This asian kid in high school who just wanted to know what a bj felt like. That‚Äôs where ya boi came in... üòè
"I hate it more when I want to pee but I'm hard and I know I will make a mess.

Especially since it's an every morning thing..."
"Yes, it's normal to not be hard whilst getting plowed. That just happens to some guys.

An anus is way tighter than a vagina. You're going to need to use more lube.

And yes, it's quite the workout. Do you have a fitbit? Mine shows me just how much of a workout it is! "
"The best thing you can do is block the profile and him on all social media. Looking at his profiles is going to only hurt you more. My ex left me for another guy and told me while cuddled up to me while I cried that he‚Äôs taking the guy to a place we were going to go for vacation (and he wanted ME to babysit our dogs while he was with this guy).

 It sucks when a guy leaves you and moves on so quick but the best way to move on is not to try to find out what they‚Äôre doing or who they‚Äôre with. Focus on things YOU can control...Workout, eat healthy, apply for (in my case) internships, just improve yourself. Doing things that I can control has greatly helped me move on, I can‚Äôt control my ex but I can control my life and where I‚Äôm going. "
Right in front of her salad!?
"He was straight to the point where he realized and came out as bi afterwards, because of experience with me.
We met at the gym, he was working there as instructor. 
Took us quite of time to make a move, and he did first, asked me out and on second date we ended up in bed. :)"
"You lucked out, getting away from that. Sounds like a shitheel. 

My advice? Keep running with the ""he's a douchebag"" line. Seems accurate. "
Not sure if broken English or awesome English.

"You‚Äôre good, buddy."
No need to even think of unknown new diseases. Just look at antibiotic resistant versions of well known STDs.
You're vitamin D deficient.
"I become hard, as a fucking rock. I should've gone into porn"
I mean they don't care about curable STDs ho
Never thought anal penetration could be a gentle and tender experience that lasted for hours of passion.
"I open it in public, people shouldn‚Äôt be looking on my private phone, if they are they are paying the price of what they see. 

I‚Äôm also unapologetically a hoe. "
"Next time he starts spouting that shit: ""Remember when I asked you to be extremely judgemental about my life, despite the fact that I'm independent with a partner and full time job while your life is mostly a mess right now?"" ""Yeah, me neither.""

This is not a situation calling for tact."
"If you really want advice here is what you do:

Arrange a safe place to talk with no interruptions. 

Tell him you respect him and love him like a cousin. 

Explain you don't want to kiss him. 

Tell him it is nobody's business how he feels about kissing boys. 

Explain that you don't want to tell anyone. 

Explain that you accept him just the way he is, that he doesn't have to pretend to be someone he isn't. 

Tell him that you don't really know how to respond because you never thought that he was into other guys, but that if he will be respectful, you will be respectful. 

Tell him it doesn't change a damn thing. "
It's nearly impossible to remain hard while getting fucked for most guys. 
"Maybe the title should be, DO NOT BAREBACK, EVER!*

*Terms and conditions apply"
"Yepperoni. I've been saying on here for ages that prep only covers HIV, does nothing to stop literally any other STD and folks should still be using  condoms and having people argue and downvoted me. It's silly and worrying that that's the state of sex education in the Gay community of all places.

Anyways, that was more of a rant than I intended and I hope you dont take it the wrong way. Hope this doesn't last too long and you get better OP. "
"&gt;He's not dumb. While he is lazy he's not an idiot

You are wrong."
Reading this gave me joy. I can‚Äôt give relationship advice for crap but um keep us updated.
"&gt; There was a part of my brain that was screaming at me to just hold him down and fuck him

Well um definitely do **NOT** rape him if you want him to get *over* his hangup about sex. Sounds like you‚Äôre going to have to sit him down and explain your frustration and see if he‚Äôll either open up to you about his apprehension or agree to see a therapist."
This almost made me spit out my tea at work

"1: Delete Grindr

"My friend in college. He quietly identified as pansexual but had never been with a guy before and I'm almost certain he hasn't since then. We were friends for about a year before he brought up that he was interested in experimenting with me. I had always found him attractive but since he was dating a girl when we met I didn't see him as a possibility.

We fooled around about six or seven times. It started off slow with making out then moved to handjobs and head. One night he came over and he asked me to fuck him. When I stuck it in and gave the first few pumps his eyes rolled back and he exclaimed loudly, ""Oh Dylan, I love this!"" He was so lost in pleasure and it was wonderful being able to take his anal virginity with such a positive reaction from him."
Don't give him any money.

I figure most sane people don't take this sub too seriously 
Yeah I've learned throughout the years that misery loves company in gay subreddits. Some guys here totally sound like incels but somehow the gay version is more socially acceptable.
"Benefit of doubt or not some threads deserve some cold, rude, harsh responses. 

And also im fed up on how US-Centric this sub is sometimes. Everything seems to be about race or liking average white dudes due to it. Stop.

Can confirm. Chlamydia in the ass has to be one of the worst things I've ever physically experienced. Giving birth would seem to be less painful. I had it almost 5 weeks ago and it was horrendous. I'm only just starting to get over it now and still can't bottom efficiently. I had all of the same symptoms with my doctor telling me I had anal fissures. Even going to the bathroom is a challenge. Everything is just shut down and non operational for a good week or two.

"Just as prevalent as it is anywhere else, yeah. Just because we as LGBT folk are a minority doesn‚Äôt absolve us from all racist tendencies."

They JUST changed it to one year. It used to be a total lifetime ban if you had m2m sex! 
"Stop viewing it as something to break, first of all. Being shy isn't a flaw and pushing him isn't going to help. The only person that can really tell you what he needs is him - is he worried it's going to hurt? Maybe starting with toys will help. Is he self conscious about his ass (lots of guys are!)? Maybe getting some of those flushable wipes will help him feel confident. But I can only offer suggestions - sounds like you need to have a conversation about it. You can spend forever doing things you think will help and I could spend all day offering suggestions, but if he can't tell you what to do neither can I. "

"""Deleting soon"" on a dating site is the Facebook equivalent of passive aggressive ""I'm clearing out all the Friends who don't Like all my posts because please love me please."""
"Quit it with all this whining about dating apps. The apps aren't the problem. **We** are. Every guy you never responded to, every dude you ghosted because you got bored, all the secret preferences you have but don't state; there's a reason dating is the way it is. It's plainly a case of if you can't handle the heat stay out of the kitchen. Part of being human is learning to deal with rejection and *no one* is immune. So cute Brandon half a block away didn't respond to your ""Heyyyyy ;)"". So the fuck what?? You didn't even *know* this dude and you have no idea why he didn't respond. Most of the time it's just because you *aren't their type* and there's nothing you can do about it. It's not remotely worth any emotion. There's always a group of guys out there into whatever you are.

The bottom line is if it gets to you it's because you're insecure and you don't like yourself. I'm a Bodybuilder. I have dudes flake out, ghost, or not respond plenty. But does it bother me? Fuck no, I'm gorgeous and they're dumbasses for missing out so hard. I know I'm awesome. Figure out what it takes to love yourself and you're bulletproof.

Besides, consider for a moment how impossible it was to find other guys before the internet and dating apps? Not all of us have the fortune to live in the gay village in the city. They're a neat tool for straight people but a lifeline if you're gay. We have more opportunities to meet each other now than ever before and apps are fucking awesome for making that possible."
Christ you need to go outside more. Anyone I know over 30 doesn't have fond memories of their 20s for the reasons you talk about. Maybe once you get a little older you stop giving a fuck about getting a little older and start living? I'm 25 so IDK. 
"You are absolutely right, and I'm glad you posted this.  When the big STDs of the past became treatable/curable in the 60s and 70s, people started acting like STDs in general were no longer a danger.  That opened the way to the spread of HIV.  People's attitudes toward PrEP just the past repeating itself, as you said.  That's why I always tell people to ALWAYS use a condom, no matter what, at the very least.  Not that a condom will stop everything, but it will help a lot if people go back to using them more consistently."
You'd need to ask a female who is also a gay male I think?
OP please post pics so I can decide whether to listen to you or not kthx.
I find making posts deriding others for their personal dress choices more trashy
"I am with you, I have nothing personal against it, I have a few friends who do drag, or at least occasional shows at some of the local gay bars around here.  

I don't understand it, I have never once wanted to try it my self, I have gone to a couple to support my friends, but they are not for me. "
"piano, guitar and drum. I'm very masculine but love cocks in my ass. 

That guy is a moron. Your luck, his loss."
I feel like I need more of this story
"This is really nerdy, but it happened on a LARP weekend. I showed up late on the first day cause I had to work, so when I got there my friends had already given away the tent spot I thought they would have for me. Someone pipes up that ‚ÄúStan (not real name) has a spot‚Äù and they all laugh. Stan is this giant guy that laughs with them and says something about not being to help what he does in his sleep. They make more jokes about how he has a reputation for getting handsy in his sleep and do that straight guy thing where they think this is even more funny when the guy is big and hairy. He was like the nerd that always plays the barbarian cause he‚Äôs the only one that is tall with muscles and some padding.

They stop joking and he says he actually doesn‚Äôt mind sharing his tent if I don‚Äôt get mad about him moving around in his sleep. It‚Äôs also the only free spot they can think of. I feel like I won the lottery but play it cool like ‚Äúhaha I guess I can try to deal with that.‚Äù

So it happened over a few nights. He was big and got hot easy and didn‚Äôt sleep in much or use his sleeping bag. I woke up the first night with him fully spooning me. I decided to not use my sleeping bag the second night to see if he would do it again. This time I felt his boner against me half the time and it felt like he knew what he was doing. The third night we both got drunk on home brew mead and when we went to bed I joked about sleeping naked since it was so hot out to kind of test the waters. He jumped on that idea and was like I don‚Äôt mind if you don‚Äôt. He said it was dark anyway and wouldn‚Äôt matter. 

This time when he spooned me, his hand went really low around my stomach like as low as it can go without touching the dick and it felt like he knew what he was doing. So I moved so my bone would touch his hand. He tried to keep acting like he was sleeping but then moved around so his hand was just resting on my package. I could feel he was hard so I reached behind me and grabbed him and started stroking. He got into it fast after that and we ended up making out some and doing hands and mouth stuff. 

"
I wouldn‚Äôt want to date somebody who‚Äôs already planning to make their problems my problems before we‚Äôve even met.
"Honestly, just find another dick. There are many guys that will never say no to a blow job. You'll just end up feeling like shit."
üíÄ 
That big dicks were automatically more pleasurable to have sex with.
"Class mate in high school. He was basketball team star of our class. Hot fucker. My crush. I had P.E. with him (and the rest of the basketball team) last class of the day, so coach didn't care what us non team guys did, so I'd dress out and sit next to the bleachers and read.  The bleachers close into a little alcove with a brick level above them so there's a hidden space that you can't see into.

One day I was reading in the little gap between the bleachers and the side wall and I heard something from behind me... which is odd, because there's a wall there. Walk behind the bleachers and there's my high school crush rubbing one out, his eyes closed, tugging for all he's worth. I enjoy the view for a minute before my hornyness takes over and I basically say something like, ""dang, sure would suck for coach to know you were back doing this instead of practicing....""

he freaked out but within a few minutes I was sucking that hard, sweaty cock for all I was worth. It became our PE routine. He was straight but was a horny jock who didn't care about dropping a load in my mouth. Suddenly I discovered I liked P.E."

"well, here is a story: my first boyfriend had a gay brother too. his brother came out because he was going to move in with his boyfriend for 2 years and his parents were shocked

his father, trying to lighten the mood, joked: well, we still have you and you can give us grandchild, you are not gay.

my ex just went: well...

they were in shock but accepted it pretty fast"
Maybe the whole road is gay...
"That escalated real fast, how does a conversation even shift from watching thor to having sex with a girl in the first place?? "
I mean I kind of went through that transformation. (https://imgur.com/a/6kEzu)
"I suffered from delayed ejaculation where I basically couldn‚Äôt cum during sex. It‚Äôs not the same but similar sort of anxiety inducing thing. 

I ended up paying for this online course from this sex therapy dude about it. Kinda funny. But it worked. 

He had these exercises designed to help release the stress from sex to help ED and delayed ejaculation. His main theory is that many men suffer from anxiety during sex because they‚Äôve tied sex to fantasy (via porn/masterbation). He encourages you to disconnect from fantasy and uses a couple exercises to help train you and your body to focus on the sensations. 

The truth is your dick can do all of the work on its own if you just let it go and don‚Äôt try to will it. Just enjoy the ride. 

1) Jerking off exercise. Lay down in bed. And just jerk off with your eyes closed. Don‚Äôt fantasize about anything. Focus on the feeling of it. Bring yourself close and then stop and go completely flaccid. Do that three times and on the third time you can cum. 

This may be difficult. It wasn‚Äôt easy at first. But it is absolutely possible. 

Genuinely. It helped me a lot. I had never really realized that my dick can do everything all on its own without fantasy. It also helped me realize my erection isn‚Äôt a one way road to orgasm, you can lose it and get it back. Don‚Äôt panic. 

2) Meditation with partner. This may not work if you don‚Äôt have a boyfriend. But there was an exercise where you spoon for 5 minutes in bed before sex and just meditate silently. Focus on breathing together at the exact same time. Half way through flip who is holding who. 

This helps relieve any pressure from sex you may feel about wanting intimacy. It‚Äôs a very intimate exercise. It relieves another layer of stress before sex. It reminds you that there is intimacy outside of penetrative sex. 

If you have a partner you really like or love, this exercise is truly a joy. And if you walk away with nothing else from a night, know that the man you‚Äôre with is awesome enough to just hold you and meditate with you. 

3) Stimulation sex game. One partner puts a blindfold on and just lays down naked. The other can grab some random objects around the house. Think feather, metal object, and a piece of fabric. They play with the other partners body. Touching different parts of it with different objects. Every time they touch something, the partner laying down describes how it feels. Does it feel good? What do you think the object is? Is it hard, soft, cold, hot? 

If you the touching partner, listen to how he likes different spots touched. Try to find a new sensitive area to play with during sex. 

Start far away from the crotch and get closer. Have fun. Play around. Then switch roles. 

If you want, have sex after. 

The goal is to focus on feeling not fantasy. Train your brain to pay attention to how your body actually feels. Sex isn‚Äôt about some fantasy. 
It‚Äôs about living in the moment and truly feeling pleasure in your body. 

The final thing I would add is communicate. If you‚Äôre feeling anxiety about your erection, talk about it with your partner. I know that‚Äôs very vulnerable, but that‚Äôs what sex is. If they are a good partner, they will understand. 

My boyfriend and I occasionally have a bout of getting in our heads and losing our erection, but we always talk about it. If it happens we just tell each other ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm having fun regardless. Let‚Äôs just keep going and see what happens. There‚Äôs no goal. Just sex. Are you having fun?‚Äù

And the truth is you can have fun with a boy just naked even if your orgasm or boner doesn‚Äôt decide to join. But if you do, your boners likely to get FOMO and show up the party. "
Still don‚Äôt get how anyone can bottom and I‚Äôm so confused when everyone talks about how pleasurable it is. I feel like I‚Äôm missing something great

Relationships are about helping eachother be better people. If you think you can be happy together give it a shot! The only way to fall in love with someone is to try!

"1. Get on PrEP. You won't get HIV.
2. Fuck around with guys who are taking PrEP, or are HIV-positive and getting effective treatment so that their viral levels are undetectable. They can't give you HIV.
3. Use condoms, every time, especially if the guy tells you ""It's OK, I'm clean!""
4. Don't mix getting wasted with having sex. It's hard enough to make good decisions about sex when you're horny and sober, but when you're drunk and/or high you *will* make bad decisions about who and how you're fucking.
5. Oops, you let him stick it in without a condom and now you don't want to stop. Don't let him come in your ass. There's some HIV in pre-cum but a lot more in a load of semen.
6. Topping is less risky than bottoming.
7. Oral is basically zero-risk for HIV. So are handjobs and humping, and basically any kink that doesn't involve a dick or seminal fluid going into a butthole. Learn about all the fun ways to get off without fucking.
6. Remember that there are other STIs besides HIV: gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis (bad news if left untreated), hepatitis A &amp; B, or critters like crabs or intestinal parasites. Get tested often. Take care of yourself."

"Statistically, most HIV infections are actually between primary partners, with one partner having HIV and not knowing it. Cheating is sometimes but not always involved.

I can't stress this enough. Some guys dont even realize they're doing it, be mindful. Tickle his balls, rub his lower belly/inner thighs. 

Have a towel/wet wipes on hand. They can be used for a quick cleanup or if, God forbid, someone has an accident. 

Use a condom. Make sure you have some on hand in case he doesn't bring his own. Prep is also something to look into.

Gay guys are generally attracted towards guys the same way straight guys are attracted to women.
"I hope you can stay in Kentucky.  You know more than anybody that politics or worldview does not mold one's sexual orientation.

Forget about killing yourself.  Think of it this way: if you're willing to do that, then you might as well come out and boldly be yourself.  There is no man more powerful than he who has nothing to lose.   If being gay is your rock bottom, then start there.  You close the door on a straight life that was never going to happen anyway, and you open the window to the opportunities you didn't know existed.   Resist the urge to fit the label:  continue to be yourself.  You're just bringing honesty back to your story.

As far as your girl goes -- you have to tell her, too.  She may already know something has been up.  

You're not alone, even in your county.  There are allies and resources.  

You coming out will reveal to you a few people already in your political circles who are not quite out yet.  Think about it:  the cities and the coasts do not need any more heartland gays.   We need more gays in the heartland.   You are more politically valuable where you are than where gays are concentrated. 

I hope this helps.  Please stay strong.   Sleep on it.  "

"It seems to be a trend that gay dudes want to solidify the lines. ""gay sex -- you gay"". 

At the same time, straight guys, who crave attention, and get tired of always having the responsibility of conquest, enjoy being pursued and don't have any interest in the lines being solid, like them to be very gray and easily crossed without loosing their ""straight"" identity. 

Result....thirsty gays hit on straight dudes and when successful want to proclaim they are ""turning them"" when in reality straight guys are just more fucking flexible these days.

"The age difference between a 13-year-old and a 16-year-old is pretty big. It doesn't matter what the law says. There's a maturity gap that would make me uncomfortable.

Age gaps in and of themselves aren't necessarily the problem. A 23-year-old and a 26-year-old *might* have a slight maturity issue at play. A 43-year-old and a 46-year-old wouldn't be any big deal."

"&gt;Sorry if my post goes in circles a little. I wrote this in an info-dump way rather than a planner essay. Hope it all makes sense

You‚Äôre good dude. Maybe for some context you can tell us how old you are?

&gt;Where do I meet nice people?

Lots of places but you will for sure meet more people the more often you leave your house.

&gt;What can I do to manage how lonely I feel? 

You can get a job (if you are old enough) preferably one with a friendly work environment. A service-oriented job (like a food place) will force you to interact with customers daily and will help you develop basic social skills. And on top of that you‚Äôll earn some extra cash.

&gt;What can I do to help myself? Especially with overcoming social anxiety

You can start exercising. Even going for a run around your neighborhood releases dopamine which makes your brain feel good (physical and mental health is correlated.) Swimming and going to the gym are good too.

And more importantly, just tell your parents you feel lonely. If they are good parents...they will try to make you feel better and point you in the right direction."

Pending y'all's personality types one or both of you might seek more alone time as opposed to mostly spending time with each other like when the other would visit.

**Still have date nights**

And finally, talk about a ""will"".  If y'all break up, who's keeping the place?  This may be more relevant to me since I make more than my fiance, but when we moved in together he got rid of his couch, his coffee table, his bed, his towels, and most of his dishes.  I promised my man that no matter the circumstance of our breakup, if that happens I will throw a small check his way so he can recoup his lost things and go on with his life, and not feel ""trapped"" by staying with me because of financial circumstance."

You however comforted that person and talked with him about the fear he felt and supported. You're a good person I guess. 

Edit: This doesn't sound like a win win situation. It sounds more like a Win Win Win situation. You, your friend and importantly your friend's son won.

"former mormon and gay here: it is a heavy burden to carry as you figure out who you are, what is important to you, and how to best merge these two very opposing forces in your life.  I decided after my mission and a few years of trying to date women that I would explore dating men.  I struggled to actually get to that point, but once I did I began to be much happier and more fulfilled.  Hope you can find how to balance these two parts of your life without causing any self-harm.  Both sexuality and mormonism shouldn't drive anyone to the point of suicide.

My gay mormon friend sat down with his Bishop a few years ago and told the bishop that he wants to kill himself because he is gay and going to church they only talk about marriage and families.  The bishop told him to take some time off.  God would prefer a happy and living you than a sad and suicidal you no matter the cost.  Life isn't as black and white as the church makes it seem, there is a lot of wiggle room and gray area.  Explore it and feel free to make the decision best for YOU."

I would also love to not have to worry about my work finding out I'm gay and getting fired over it, or discriminated by it.
