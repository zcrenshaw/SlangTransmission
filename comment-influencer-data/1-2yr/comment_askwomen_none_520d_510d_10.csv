"I laugh with my best cycle-synced girlfriends while eating micro greens and chopped kale topped with seasonal fruits and veggies and a freshly made vinaigrette.  

Laughing is great for your core. Beware those laugh lines though. "
"I'm pretty over all the ""red flags"" and ""green flags"" in a relationship posts"
Women who are 23 what advice do you have for women who are 22?  Do these people actually think someone who is 1-5 years older than them has that much more knowledge than them? You‚Äôre in the same age group. 
I broke up with a guy once bc he was a bad tattoo artist. I just couldn‚Äôt be associated with that level of bad art.
"Oh boy. Here goes.

Flag #1: He wouldn't change his facebook relationship status to ""In a relationship."" He said that that sorta thing was just too personal for social media. Didn't want his family calling him up and asking him questions about his new girlfriend they had heard about from facebook. He'd rather have the opportunity to tell them in person! I believed him.

Flag #2: I noticed that he'd blocked me from seeing any of his friends on facebook. I asked him about it. He said he must have accidentally just changed some privacy setting. He didn't seem too concerned about it, so I wasn't too concerned about it. I believed him. 

Flag #3: I noticed that he had been untagging himself in every picture that I posted of the two of us together on social media. When I questioned this, he said that I just looked so pretty in every picture that I automatically made him look like a slob. He said that sooner or later we'd have to make a date to take some good couple pictures that could go on facebook. This never wound up happening, but I still believed him. 

Flag #4: Several of my friends told me that they had friend-requested him and he had denied their requests. I asked him why. He said he must've just not recognized their photos. Honest mistake. No big deal. I believed him.

Finally, two years into the relationship, I discovered the folder on his computer that was full of screenshots of sexually-charged conversations that he had been having with women on tinder throughout the entire length of our relationship. He was saving these conversations (dozens of them), along with photos of the women who sent them, as if they were trophies. It was bizarre. I couldn't believe I had missed the signs. 

I asked him about it. He told me he was a deeply depressed wreck of a man who needed to constantly have his self-worth validated by attractive younger women in order to make it through each day. 

I believed him, and ended things immediately."
"Adverts for Nair or razors where a woman is shown sliding a razor down (/applying cream to) *an already silky smooth leg*. For god's sake, people, you can show women's leg hair. The television won't burst into flames. Imagine how ridiculous it would be if men's shaving adverts showed men working a razor across their completely hairless chin."
"I'm married to my bed. lol
I definitely miss it more than I miss people when I travel."
"Yep.  I had a lot of jealousy and envy.  There's a lot of messages in our culture about how being jealous/insecure is one of the worst things you can be, and it was really hard to confront and deal with.

Working on my depression and self esteem issues made my jealousy and envy pretty much go away."
"Wear sunscreen daily. I‚Äôve been doing this since I was about 18, at now at 33, I have significantly fewer wrinkles than my peers. 

Start eating healthy and exercising regularly now. It‚Äôll catch up with you later, and bad habits are so hard to break. 

Take care of your health. Mental and physical. If something seems weird, go to the doctor. 

Figure out how to start saving money. Even just a little. 

Understand that your mid twenties are tumultuous, and things get better when you start to approach 30. For me, it was like something just clicked around 28/29, and my self confidence got waaaaay better. 

Learn to love spending time with yourself. Downtime is important, and solo downtime is something I now value immensely. You should never feel guilty for taking a break from partying, working, etc. It‚Äôs okay to not do anything. 

You will grow apart from friends you thought you‚Äôd have forever. That‚Äôs okay. Let them go. Don‚Äôt force friendships, especially toxic ones. 

I could probably go on forever, but I‚Äôm almost 34 and I‚Äôm old and tired haha. 

Edit: To all the questions about sunscreen: Yes, wear it everyday, no matter how much you‚Äôre outside, and no matter where you‚Äôre you live. Besides wrinkles, skin cancer is a very real thing that can happen to anyone. I use Cetaphil daily moisturizer with SPF 50 in the morning + I have some SPF 30 powdered sunscreen I use throughout the day. If you‚Äôre gonna be outside more just normal commuting, use something stronger. I have multiple face sunscreens that I like, but you really have to figure out which one works best for you. It‚Äôs worth the investment. Also don‚Äôt forget your lips, neck and chest! 

I‚Äôm not a dermatologist, so I cannot speak with authority on this, only experience. "
"I clicked on this thread intending to say that my butts are too low compared to my hips (like the upper part of my butts is a good 2 inches lower than my hips), but everybody else is missing a rib or a toe or a uterus. I can't compete."
His affinity for thick gold chains or pinkie rings. Can't do it. Can't take it seriously.
Mascara ads where the model is wearing false or CG lashes. Seriously? Do they think we don't notice?
The endless variations of ‚ÄúWhat do you like about your SO?‚Äù 
It wouldn't be an issue if EVERY ad didn't do the same; anti-aging anything. Are women the only ones who age or would like to delay the signs of aging? 
"""Ngaaaw. You're so cute when you think you have a choice in this"".

He seemed playful at the time. Not so much now that I think back."
"If I'm not compatible with his scent, if that makes sense. This isn't often a problem, but for example I very often bury my face into my SOs chest and we hug and cuddle a lot, and his smell is very comforting to me. It's not necessarily hygiene, but his natural scent that matters to me. "
"He said something to the tune of ‚Äòno one will ever understand you like I do.‚Äô 

I thought that meant he was the kind of guy who would really get to know me. What that actually meant was that he had already decided that he knew me. 

For the entirety of that relationship I was at odds with the girl he thought I was, or maybe the girl he wanted me to be. I‚Äôm still not sure, but it was exhausting. "
"In my thirties, some friends commented about my rather eventful love life. I seemed to attract every ratbag in a 500 mile radius. They used to challenge me to write a book about it, so I did. Now I‚Äôm on book four and loving my new career. It‚Äôs so cathartic. Even better, my first novel became a UK Kindle bestseller, so although I think I‚Äôm pretty useless at it, there are many that seem to disagree. 
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ever too old to learn new skills.  What are you thinking of doing OP? "
"Poor hygiene. No matter how much a man makes me laugh, makes me feel loved and cared for, or how patient he is and quick to forgive my moodiness, I CANNOT be with him if he doesnt shower or brush his teeth on a regular basis. I have found this to be more common than one would think. It is an absolute turn-off. I want to make out but i cant bring myself to do it if he didnt brush today. I cant go down on him if he's wearing yesterday's boxer briefs and obviously hasnt showered recently. I cant spend the night if his pillows smell like greasy hair. ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ From experience, I have found out about these bad habits once the honeymoon stage in a relationship is over and the guy gets comfortable."
"The same places. I found mine on Bumble.

Also, this may be a controversial opinion, but I do think your profile sends a message. I purposely did not include any suggestive photos in mine to ward off the wrong idea. My SO later confirmed that had been what attracted him to me because he interpreted it to mean my motivations weren‚Äôt just sexual. "
I often see which people are they following in instagram. Too much porn actresses and escorts or girls that work in sex industry and i'm out.
"I really liked (like?) dating. I love the feeling of meeting someone new and thinking ‚Äúwow, something might come of this!!‚Äù I like first kisses. I like going on dates. I like waiting for their text the next day. 

But I guess when it comes down to it, I like my boyfriend more. I have fond memories of dating, and it will just be that. "
"Anything Dove. Commercials sort of go like, ""Do you feel like you're not beautiful? You're actually beautiful. Everyone is beautiful. But try our product to actually feel beautiful, because, you're a fucking idiot who needs our product to feel beautiful you piece of literal shit, we love you."""
"If he is not educated. I'm Latina and the Latino men I've dated who didn't go to school are predominantly put-off by me having career ambitions, and they have wanted me to take more of a domestic role in the relationship. 

The ones who have gone to school are more understanding and more supportive of my career ambitions because they've gone through the school process as well. 

"
Same places. My SO found me on OKCupid. I put on my profile that I wasn't into casual stuff. Neither was he. It worked.
"We were in university, and I found myself so embarrassed and ashamed of my boyfriend that I lied for him. All the time. To everyone. I think the fact that I felt I had to lie was the first red flag, and the behaviour that prompted it were the rest. But I was just....I don't know, convinced that this was my *forever* relationship. 

Because I know you want details: He had absolutely no work ethic whatsoever. He was failing, everything. He failed tests, he failed assignments and he failed courses, all because he didn't do them or didn't study. He would come home from class and play video games until he fell asleep - easily 8 hours a day of video games. On Fridays, he'd come home, spend the entire weekend doing nothing but playing video games, head to school on Monday and study for the exam in the ten minutes between arriving and the exam starting. That was it. But when he got the grade back and had his regular freakout about his grades, and I would suggest he maybe cut back on the video games, and he'd bite my head off about how he didn't have time to study/do work and that he *needed* his games and that cutting back an hour or two per day wouldn't make any difference. 

It was embarrassing because he told everyone - all our family, friends, - about how he was struggling to get higher than 20% on assignments, how he'd never gotten higher than a 55% on exams. Because, of course, he didn't see any of it as within his control. It was because the program was too hard/they were asking too much/the program was designed for people who already had a degree etc. So I bought into it. I played it up. I told everyone the program was unreasonable, that it was so hard, that no one was passing, that everyone was struggling. I lied that this was why he was sulky and whiny all the time, this was why he couldn't be arsed to come to anything important to me. Wild.

Edited to add, because I forgot lol: He was also regularly fucking up at his jobs. Not doing the work, not paying attention and making mistakes. Again, he'd freak out about it being unfair, about how it was hard, but if I suggested he *maybe* should stop playing games on his phone instead of doing his actual job, I got my head bitten off - even after he cost his company $10,000."
Instead of one functioning uterus I have two separate essentially useless halves.
"I mean, kind of? I wouldn't call it longing, but a definite wish, like a wish for some chocolate ice cream. Being in a committed relationship is very different than being single, even an amazing relationship. I come home to my husband, I wake up with my husband, I talk to my husband, *every day*. You can't just fuck off and do *whatever*. You wanna buy a car, it's a discussion with another person. You want to buy new furniture, it's a discussion. Yes, you're still your own person, but you're not independent, every life event is a team effort. 

It brings so much awesomeness and comfort to have another player on your team. But as an introvert and loner, the urge to sometimes not have any ties to anything happens. 

My relationship has a kind of ""fuck off and do whatever"" clause. We both take a separate vacation once a year, usually around two weeks to a month, when we pretend we're single and don't contact each other at all. In theory. We always end up missing each other early. Hah."
"""Would you rather date a man with Characteristic 1 or Characteristic 2?""  Especially where it's either ""looks"" or ""money""."
"Had a notoriously hard time orgasming. Bought a really powerful hitachi wand from a sex shop. Don‚Äôt anymore.

I already have plenty of sex with it. Might as well marry it (*something something buy the cow*)"
"Lol, absolutely.

The biggest/worst one is that I have an [anxious-avoidant attachment pattern](http://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-freedom-change/201505/come-here-go-away-the-dynamics-fearful-attachment%3famp). In other words, I fall into a push/pull dynamic when I start to get close to people ‚Äî I deeply crave love in theory, but once things begin to get real with a romantic partner, I become hypervigilant for threat cues and have strong urges to either run or sabotage things at the slightest sign of indifference or incompatibility. I learned to relate to people in this way because my childhood was highly abusive, and so were most of the romantic relationships I‚Äôve had. It‚Äôs a sort of post-traumatic stress reaction.

Dating me is no picnic, and I‚Äôm completely cognizant of this. I understand that not everyone will be able to deal with this long enough for me to begin to trust them and calm down a bit. So I guess in the name of informed consent, I put my cards on the table pretty early on. I try to be open with potential long-term partners about my background, my attachment pattern, and what it means and will look like. In turn, I face the fear head-on. Sometimes I feel urges to behave manipulatively or be mean to partners just so they‚Äôll *go away* and I can feel safe again, but this goes against my values so I try to power through the negative feelings and explain that even though I know it doesn‚Äôt match the facts of the current situation, I‚Äôm just feeling really scared at the moment. 

I have an SO; he‚Äôs wonderful, and the pattern is already starting to subside. He understands my issue pretty well and tries his best to support me while maintaining boundaries that work for both of us. I‚Äôm growing to trust him ‚Äî he‚Äôs validating and kind and soothing when I panic, he knows I‚Äôm not choosing to be so frightened just to be a pain in the ass. "
"Regarding marriage: You should be more excited about the person you‚Äôre marrying than you are about the wedding itself. Yes it‚Äôs fun to dress up, celebrate, and have all eyes on you, but the very next day, you‚Äôll just be someone‚Äôs wife. Nothing special. If that doesn‚Äôt make you excited, don‚Äôt get married. Waiting to find someone you‚Äôre truly excited about is SO WORTH IT. "
I literally avoid thinking about it entirely. 
"Idk. I find Victoria's Secret irritating and wouldn't shop there if they didn't have this one type of everyday bra I like with a buy one get one half deal. 

They generally just rub me the wrong way. They basically advertise to women by really advertising to men, in an attempt to say to women ""men like Victoria's Secret models, wear our stuff and they'll like you too""."
"He said ""my hairdresser can't get over how soft my hair is"".  

His hair felt like pubes.  Can't deal with that little self-awareness."
The track between my olfactory bulb and my nasal cavity or the nerves therein is broken. I have no sense of smell. 
"What I find most offensive is tampon/pad and cleaning product ads. 

Thin women running around sunny cities or doing yoga with frozen, demented smiles on their faces whilst in pursuit of ""it all"" and blue liquid are not how most people experience their periods. Nor does cleaning (and I like cleaning!) make me practically orgasm when something's finally gleaming, and it isn't my sole purpose in life to do battle with germs every second of every day either."
"Either ""how old were you when you left home"" or ""how do you know when to get married/move in with a SO"". Why? Because they're asked all the time and should probably be added to the FAQ."
"Whilst I was in the womb (and my mum was in labour) my right foot somehow managed to get stuck in her rib cage (I have no idea how) and so my pinky toenail had to be totally removed as it turned all black. It wasn‚Äôt supposed to grow back but it did, so now I have a weird thick toenail that shouldn‚Äôt exist. "
Getting into bed and the few seconds until my husband gets in beside me. I get kinda giddy waiting to cuddle and enjoying the cold sheets. Sometimes I'll say how nice it is to sleep together every night and how its like a sleepover and he'll say yeah well we are married with our own house and every night is a sleepover. 
"Before giving birth, I preferred a woman.  After giving birth, everyone had been up there, so I no longer cared about the gender and just wanted a good doctor who listened to me."
"I lie fairly often in a relationship; small lies to get my way. Often I do it unconsciously, and upon reflection, later on, I finally see what I was doing. I also tend to detach during sex even in serious intimate relationships, and I can be a bit callous with my partner's money.  I think I found out by noticing a pattern in my relationships and also if I got called out by past partners. "
"Finished grad school, divorced my ex, found a good job, and my kids got old enough to leave them with the awesome next door high school kid for a few hours now and then. Realized that just because my ex-husband was uninterested in being either a husband to me or a father to our three children, not everybody in the world would find me boring and unattractive. Discovered meetup and online dating. Boom, life improved 1000x."
"Idk if it translates in other countries, but in the U.K. betting sites and online bingo sites are marketed towards women in a very predatory and sexist way. Always revolves around getting a break from your husband/kids or the housework. Almost exclusively advertised towards bored housewives."
If he's a picky eater. I know it's a real thing sometimes but I just can't deal with that.
I have a rare intersex condition (born without ovaries and with xy chromosomes). So that's pretty weird.
"I‚Äôm gay but tried to convince myself I could be bi when I was younger, like middle school aged. The only boy I‚Äôve ever had a crush on was a friend of mine in 7th grade. I thought he was cute and wanted to hang out with him. My crush ended when my friends told me they wanted to hold hands and kiss their crushes and I realized I had no interest in that, turns out I just really wanted to be friends with this dude "
"I got out of a long-term relationship about 2 years ago. During that relationship, my SO constantly diminished my accomplishments or hobbies and made them seem unimportant. When I ran my first 5K, he was sure to boast, ""I could do that right now if I wanted to."" If I took my camera out to take a photo of something (as photography is a big hobby of mine), he'd get impatient. Whenever I cooked for him, he never liked what I made. If I claimed to someone that I was a big cinephile, he'd be sure to point out all the movies I hadn't seen (and he had). On and on and on this went. Over the years, he wore me down to the point where I had no hobbies anymore and I was always doubting myself. My confidence was lower than low.

When we broke up, it was like a lightbulb went off over my head. I realized how negative he had been to me and how badly he had affected my self-worth. I'm slowly building myself back up again and getting into the hobbies that he criticized me for (which many people have said I'm actually amazing at). I still have a lot of confidence issues and I'm not ready to date yet, but with time, things will heal."
"Look up the major histocompatibility complex! Basically, our natural ""scent"" tells potential mates about our immune system compatibility (compatibility being as different as possible). The more different you are (in regards to those genes), the better. 

If someone doesn't smell right to you, that's evolution telling you not to mate with them. "
"Decided I was tired of not liking myself. Lost a lot of weight, became involved in new and more active hobbies, met some new people. Got a new job that eliminated my daily 2+ hour commute, which left me with the time and energy to actually go out with my new friends. Started online dating. "
"I would say the most shallow one (in my own opinion) would be if the guy has a bad breath. It has happened, the guy had a great personality, but I just couldn't."
"I had my left Fallopian tube removed as it developed an infection and grew to a fist sized mass before twisting over and cutting off blood flow to my ovary (very painful.) 

Ovary is still there... just haaaanging around all alone and not connected to my uterus. Still functions normally as there‚Äôs no trauma to it. As far as I understand it still Sparta-kicks an egg into the void every other month."
I am almost never attracted to blondes.
"There was one the other day that asked ""would you rather date a doctor, an owner of a large company, or a rogue""

a fucking rogue


dude was asking questions about dnd characters "
"I'm a feminist, but I really struggle with negative thoughts about other women, and it's hard to see femininity as value neutral."
"""Why do women &lt;do something I have seen some women do&gt;""

One that springs to mind is ""Why do women with brown hair dye their hair blonde?"" - or something to that effect. Why does anyone do anything to their appearance? Those people like that thing."
"1 - He [38m] had a string of ex girlfriends, and said he dumped nearly all of them

2 - He never wanted to have sex, I always had to initiate, he didn't always reciprocate, he only knew missionary, and never once in the relationship made-out with me. Only on-the-lip kisses

3 - He corrected me all the time. My pronunciation, my grammar. Even if I was saying something serious. Even if I had just accidentally garbled my words because I was tired but it was still obvious what I was saying.

4 - I asked him if I could stay at his one night because I was too tired to drive home and thought I'd crash. 'Your house is only a 10 minute drive away,' he responded. I drove home.

5 - He told me he was never excited to see me

6 - He told me not to expect affirmations and if I gave them to him they would be meaningless because words are easy to say and I was probably just fishing for compliments

7 - Would invite me to his family and friend events so I thought he wanted to be with me and saw a future. But in private would belittle and correct me and tell me he was unsure about me.

8 - Wouldn't attend things I invited him to even though I went to all of his family and friend gatherings that I was invited to

9 - Was tedious, pednatic and a stickler for rules. He lectured me. Once, he gave me a lecture about how to use cruise-control during a road-trip - he kept lecturing me on it  for the entire three hours.

10 - He noticed and pointed out every flaw in me. A shirt not tucked in right, a mark on my shirt, a hair out of place.

11 - He snapped at me all the time.

12 - He would treat me like a child, leaning across me to straighten the knife and fork on my plate when I finished a meal 

13- I'd do things for him like help his family set up for a party or help him prepare to host Christmas or spend all day helping him cook for a dinner party he was throwing for his friends and he'd 'thank' me by saying noone forced me to do those things [even though he asked me], pointing out things i'd done wrong, and making me fetch us coffee. He also wouldn't offer to pay me back for ingredients I bought for a dinner party for his friends, even though he earns twice [at least] as much

14 - he spoke to and treated his female friends better than he treated me

15 - he said he was a feminist and said sexist things as a 'joke' and said people were wrong to be offended because it should be 'obvious' to anyone that 'knows him' that it was a joke. He blamed missing out on getting into an improv team on 'quotas for women'. No, he was just terrible.

16 - Said he couldn't promise not to say things that hurt or offended me as it was just who he was. Did not try to change

17 - Once i was up all night in a hotel room with him with an agonising UTI and i had to call the emergency doctor. He didn't get up once and didn't text me until the next night. Did not check into see if I was ok before then.

18 - From very early on brought up exes, pointed out their houses when we'd drive past, and tell me he had a lot of exes, so that combined with him not letting me stay the night if I was tired and the lack of sex made me someone I'm not - insecure and jealous

19 - I'd invite him to things then he'd deny I invited him or tell me my invitation was 'vague'. I began to question myself and my sanity.

20 - He thought he had a sense of humour and was funny. In reality he was just sarcastic, arrogant and tedious.

21 - I bought a weekend getaway for us to celebrate the end of his exams. He wouldn't get in the spa with me and scrolled through his phone instead, was 2hours late picking me up to go on the trip, since i booked it believed I should have planned everything [I'd planned us a beautiful dinner which I'd prepaid for and a hike but he would say 'so what are we doing now? this is your trip, you planned this'] and he was moody the whole time. Then didn't have sex with me and when I brought it up, he just ignored me and didn't answer. so I slept on the couch one night, and yet he brought this up as an example of my bad behaviour and making him feel bad. Even though he was the unenthusiastic one ignoring my attempts to communicate.


Should I stop now? I overlooked these behaviours because he was kind to his friends, had a great career, was smart, had a variety of interests and did things with me like go to theatre shows and movies. I thought I'd be crazy to walk away from someone so good with such similar interests. He also *told* me he was a thoughtful and kind person. 

In reality he was tedious, pedantic, selfish and emotionally abusive. Glad I dumped him, felt instant relief. I did love him but I fell in love with the version of himself he presented at the beginning."

"It's funny, I actually just heard this phrase for the first time today. But anyway. 
I was 18 I think and I met this guy online. I was just trying to get laid at the time as my ex and I had just split up and honestly I was a bit of a mess. It was meant to be a once off but he'd show up or text or call constantly. I felt pressured into a relationship with him but at the time it was ""cute"" to be getting the attention. I lost my job a couple of months later and my lease was running up and he lost his mind at the thought of me moving in with some friends. So I moved in with him. Thus began 2 years of emotional and sexual abuse and isolation. I finally got out when I caught him cheating on me with god knows how many other girls and left despite his threats of suicide etc. A year later he killed himself. "
"I can eat anything. I will try anything once.

It basically means the only ""flavors"" I can taste are: sweet, salty, spicy, sour, bitter, and a generalized ""savory"" or umami flavor.

The way I explain it to people is that if every food were condensed into ice cream form with the same texture, I would never be able to tell things apart. I have no idea what different herbs or spices taste like other than salt and the spicy ones. Even then, ancho chiles and cayenne pepper and adobo are all just ""spicy."" There's no nuance at all. Similarly, rosemary is the same as thyme is the same as parsley is the same as oregano. They all taste like nothing to me. Cheeses, other than swiss, are all just salty and kind of savory.

My enjoyment of food is 90% texture."
I've already lost both of my parents. 10 yrs ago my dad died in a plane crash (age 54) and the following year my mom died of rapidly bad kidney cancer (age 52). You just live with it. It is sad. It'll be sad for a long while. Then it won't be the all consuming sadness. You'll still have your days though. 
I wear the same uniform that they do. But I have rainbow suspenders because I'm secretly the coolest person in the warehouse. 
Spotify.
I'm a feminist but I never talk about it because for some reason everyone IRL wants to get in arguments about it and I cannot even muster up that kind of energy.
"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2‚Äù and won‚Äôt date anyone ***over*** 6‚Äô . Honesty 5‚Äô10‚Äù is pushing it. It‚Äôs a personal attraction thing. I like short(er) guys 

Also, if they ‚Äúhate‚Äù reading. That‚Äôs an automatic no go. You don‚Äôt have to be a bookworm, but people who ‚Äúhate‚Äù to read will never click with me. "
My mother used to say that men get interesting and women get old. 
"Slytherin bed sheets - obviously this was a specific guy but it lead to a ‚Äúno character sheets‚Äù rule 

Edit: spelling"
"Yes, all the time. I am incredibly overly sensitive and tend to believe the worst outcome possible of situations/people. My boyfriend often has to remind me that just because my friend didn't respond to my text doesn't mean she hates me, and just because we had an argument, doesn't mean I should always react with tears. 

Now that I wrote that out, I think my problem is self-esteem."
"I'm a programmer. We can't wear shorts at my job, so I usually wear pants inside(the A/C is intense so it is rather cold) but shorts when I leave. I also wear dresses. I am rather conservative so I wear girly things but you see no cleavage. "
I used to prefer a female and would only see a female but after some issues I was referred to a male gyno specialist and he's by far the best I've had. Just a great doctor and yes he always has female nurses in the room for exams. 
I have a permanent hole in my right hand. It's about 18gauge size and I was born with it. It goes about an inch down and when I was little I used to hide pencil lead in it. 
My IUD.
A well rinsed Romain cracks me up every time. 
"Cheesemaking. 

Picked it up when I was 26 (I'm 29 this year) and found myself involved with a dairy farmer who produced all this delicious milk from very happy cows and mostly sold it raw, which I thought was a waste of an excellent product. I made some easy cheeses right off the bat with a combination of old cookbooks, youtube tutorials and my poor now-husband taste testing the results. 

Eventually took a course with Teagasc (the Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority), got a book on cheese science, bought some more professional equipment and now it's kind of my job."
"He constantly asked me to go to the gym. I always thought ""oh it's because he wants me to be healthy"" Nope that comment was later followed by ""why don't you wear more dresses like other girls?"" And ""why don't you keep your hair long instead of short?"" He was REALLY attractive so I became super insecure and thought all the changes he was suggesting where actually genuine. Turns out he was just a shallow douche."
Maybe even simultaneously!
"Not sure if this is a red flag or more of a dark pink one, but...

I find myself passively trying to manipulate people's behavior by doing things for them that I would like them to do for me, and then expecting them to reciprocate, out of kindness, or guilt, or a sudden dawning realization that this is how they should be treating ME, by following MY example.

Inevitably, I get butthurt because they didn't do what I very clearly demonstrated they should be doing, and I am the put-upon suffering martyr by throwing myself out there and doing all of these awesome things for them and being such a fantastic partner in the relationship. Then, because they didn't ""perform"" at the same level or intensity in our relationship, I am justified to dump them.... or continue to be a martyr and complain about it... whichever suits my needs at the moment.

TL;DR: therapy rocks."
"Put down the booze. Drinking all night and showing up to work trying not to be a hot mess isn't cute. You've got a ladder to climb. Show up, dress up, make it happen. 

Pick up a liter of water and drink. Then drink some more. 

Stop doubting yourself and what you know. Go for it, show up and see what happens. If you fail, learn all you can from it and turn it into a success next time.

Be on time, be consistent. Be present.

And keep your standards up. I know you want to lower them sometimes when you're lonely or sad. But know your worth, don't apologize for it and make everyone who wants to date you rise to it. The right guy will without hesitation. He'll be honored to.... and he is, when you meet him. And because you never settled, it feels that much better when you meet him.

Call your Dad more. He loves you so much with every beat of his heart and the solid foundation you build with him as an adult woman will be invaluable as a tool for help or comfort. And when he tells you to get out of your own way in looking for love, listen to him. He's right. It comes packaged completely different than you expected.

Be early. Ask questions. Bring snacks. Be confident. Be helpful. Say what you think. Stop worrying. 

And when a man undresses you with his eyes and tells you you look good, tell him to kindly fuck off. Don't be afraid to do so. You owe the world nothing for being a female. "

Well ok this was not as fun as expected. It's also not Tampax Pearl, I was mistaken. Just regular Tampax in the cardboard applicator.

When I finally asked, he said he just took time to get comfortable expressing his feelings.  Five years later, and I was sobbing in marriage counseling (I know, that's how much I ignored this - I married him, ugh) asking him to say it or show it in a way I could feel.  He never did."

"I am 30 years old. Although 5 years don't seem like a lot, it feels like 25 was many moons ago. I am an entirely different person now, than I was then. Here's a bit of what I'd tell myself: 

""Don't ever believe for a second that a man should just be 'good enough.' Don't spend countless days and weeks crying for a man makes you feel like you're worthless. You will find a man who will make you feel like you're a queen that you are. And you'll think to yourself, 'how could I have thought I deserved less?'

You are smart. You are beautiful. You are hardworking. Quit comparing yourself to others. You may not have been afforded the opportunities that others have been able to get, but you have the fire in you. 

You will become a successful business woman. You will turn your meek persona and become a woman who stands her ground. You will stop putting yourself down and start realizing how fucking brilliant you are. You will learn to sit in an interview and sell your achievements. You will stand in a meeting room and lead a discussion. You will negotiate for what you deserve. 

You hate the situation that you're in right now, but man, you're working hard. Keep working hard. You're thinking that this is probably not worth it, but it is. You're C+ student and still dragging your feet in college? Oh, I have news for you! School ain't the be all end all - you'll figure out a way to make things work. And you'll make it work real good! 

You're experiencing with depression, but you'll find the power to cope. It won't be perfect, but you'll make strides. You'll stop drinking. You'll stop self-harm. You'll stop the obsession with body image and food. It'll be hard, but you're doing what you can...one day at a time. 

You're pretty rad - and don't ever forget that."" "
Women that dislike other women.
"I'm a feminist and woman in STEM and I think instead of getting more women into STEM we ought to focus on getting female dominated jobs such as nursing, teaching, and social work higher pay. It's great if women want to go into STEM, and they should not be discouraged or told they can't do it because of their gender but it's not going to solve the pay gap between men and women when women are still more likely to choose female dominated professions.

"I‚Äôm a lesbian, I think there were two different things I mistook for attraction to men, for the most part, when a guy would hit on me I‚Äôd get nervous, which in reality was discomfort with someone hitting on me but I just automatically assumed nervous=romance. I also felt obligated to reciprocate feelings, and didn‚Äôt realize I was only tempted to flirt back because I felt guilty saying no. "

"I'm a feminist but I still crave a man who works hard and can take care of me. Especially after becoming a mother, I feel that there are times (pregnancy and post-partum for instance) when I'm vulnerable and would love to be taken care of. 

As of now, I can't have another baby because I have no real support and my partner won't step it up. I'm the breadwinner and I resent it fully. 

It could be argued that all I'm after is equality. As in, someone who puts in and equal amount of effort as I do. So it may not be a gender issue at all. 

I do like a strong capable man but I am a strong capable woman. "
If they believe they aren't successful in dating because they are too nice. People that are actually nice/good people rarely go around tooting their own horn about their niceness and complaining about the rewards it hasn't got them.

"Obstacle courses.  I had no interest in them until about 29 or so.  Then, I got into amazing shape and did Spartans and Battlefrog and some others and it was just so much fun.  And I was good at it.  My first Spartan I actually placed in the top 10% of women that day.

But, I could not keep it up and go to work and be a mom.  So, I gave it up because I want to love my kids and feed them."
I'm getting better at letting things go until there's a better or more appropriate time to have a discussion.  Basically tabling things instead of hastily rushing into things to soothe my anxiety.

"I paid for eHarmony because I thought ‚Äúhey, if a guy is willing to pay for a dating app maybe he‚Äôs serious about finding a mate‚Äù. A couple of my guy friends joked about his being okay to pay money to get attention from girls, but that wasn‚Äôt even the issue. 

I live in LA and there are so few men I get matched with, and then the matches are so far off. I‚Äôm a 6 foot tall, blonde, curvy, atheist, liberal 30 year old female with a grad degree, a fantastic job that pays really well, that loves dogs and nature and doesn‚Äôt drink or go out to clubs or bars. I want to get married and have kids

One of my last ‚Äúmatches‚Äô was literally the opposite in every way. I took a picture of it and sent it to the company because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was more upset or humored. Anyway, the guy was 5‚Äô4‚Äù, skinny as a stick, somewhat religious and severely conservative, with no degree and a retail job, who loves alcohol and going out to bars to play pool, didn‚Äôt like animals, and didn‚Äôt like kids. Oh and he‚Äôs 9 years older than me.

EHarmony responded with ‚Äúyou are only looking for matches within 50 miles of you, why don‚Äôt you open it up to all of America‚Äù. I gave up after that."
"I am usually the first to say it. I also know that love in the beginning is different from love at 3 years in or 30 years in. But that's ok. For me, love means I appreciate this person, I care about their life, and I want to see where it goes. The longest I've waited to say love in a romantic relationship was maybe 4 months. The shortest was two weeks. Did all of those relationships last forever and ever? No. But I did love all of those people, and in a way, I still do."
"BTW, OP, this was a great post!  Loving reading all the stories here and seeing the encouragement from everyone.  :D"
I just hate how many questions are centred on SOs in general. It really plays into stereotypes that all women talk about is their partners. I never believed that was true because my real life experience with my friends is nothing like that but r/AskWomen makes me think maybe there is truth in the stereotype.
"Calligraphy and hand lettering. I picked it up in anticipation of my wedding, because it wasn't really in my budget to pay someone $4+ per invitation to write pretty on the envelopes. I found it really relaxing to come home at the end of my stressful day job (lawyer) and throw on a few episodes of a TV show I know and just write and calculate mindlessly. I started by reading a few blogs (shoutout to The Postman's Knock, my fave), and buying the recommended supplies and a few lettering practice sheets. 

When my invites went out, EVERYONE commented on how pretty they looked. Then a friend asked if I could address her baby shower invitations, and then another friend asked me to help with her wedding invitations. Then another friend recommended me to HER friend, who turned around and posted about me on Instagram. Everyone suggested to me that I open an etsy store (which I did), but most of my business now comes from word of mouth and instagram.

I've just been hired to do the wedding signage for a pretty popular local blogger (300K+ YouTube and insta followers), and she's been really pleased with my work so far, so that's great, and it's in my contract that she needs to credit me publicly, so hopefully that leads to a few more jobs. 

Calligraphy isn't my career or anything, but it's definitely a fun hobby that I'm turning a little bit of a profit in, and I didn't start it until I was 30!"
"This is something my wife and I have talked about. That longing for the single life and going out with friends and not having responsibilities of kids and so on and so on. There is nothing exactly wrong with what we have now, but sometimes we think it would be great to be single again.

We've come to a conclusion though. We don't really want to be single. We want to be single and in our early 20s again. We want to go back and live the highlights. We want to be younger and with our whole life ahead of us. It's not being single we want. It's being who we were when we were single."

"I would say any time a man asks a question hoping for a specific answer and when he doesn't get that answer, lectures everyone about how wrong they are instead of actually listening to what they're saying. An example off the top of my head is a few months ago, a guy asked a question about age gap relationships. A lot of women said age gap relationships were not something they were interested in, and instead of the guy saying ""different strokes for different folks"" and moving on with his life, he proceeded to lecture all the women about how wrong they were and age gap relationships are always awesome and never problematic."
"There's one yogurt commercial that I kept seeing for a while that seemed to be strictly for men. They kept saying ""it's got protein!!"" every 2 seconds, cause everyone knows guys can't eat shit like that without it."
"Sewing. I became interested because I'm so unhappy with most clothes these days. Seems like everything is too low cut or too sheer (especially in the plus size area). I felt like most clothes I was finding (tops in particular) only needed a slight alteration to be exactly what I wanted them to be. For instance, I can make a top less low-cut by making alterations to the back or I can sew another layer under something that's too sheer. I happened across a friend who had a sewing machine she didn't want anymore. She gave it to me. From there I started with some really simple patterns. I ended up making some beachy maxi dresses for a few of my family members for their vacation. I haven't gotten to the point where I make my own clothes yet, but I'm definitely comfortable making small alterations. Just yesterday I sewed some extra fabric onto my bra where the clasps are (because the material they used under the clasps is just too rough on my skin)."

I grind coffee and boil water for my French press, then do the dishes before making my son breakfast while listening to a podcast or some relaxed music. It‚Äôs the best part of my day. "
"There's something about spinach, strawberries, walnuts, and feta that has me rolling on the floor."
"I picked up a lot of small but unhealthy behaviors from my ex boyfriend. He was a narcissistic emotional abuser, and I started hearing his words coming out of my mouth. 
Whenever I didn't get my way, the next words out of my mouth were ""You hate me, you don't love me at all do you?"". And I didn't mean it, in my head it was a funny joke. But it was the same emotional manipulation my ex used and had the same effect on my SO. 

My ex used to wear me down with gaslighting and arguments until I would finally say, ""Ok, you're right. I'm sorry"". He'd respond with ""I know you're sorry. Now apologize."" This was devastating to hear every time. If I ever hear myself say this I'm finding the nearest cliff and jumping."

"A friend of mine who is a psychotherapist told me that the people who grieve the longest when a parent dies is a person who had a mixed relationship with the parent.  Bad things, good things, unresolved issues ( which now can't be resolved ).

The people who grieve the shortest are people who became completely estranged from the parent ( they were ""done"" a long time ago ) and people who were very close.  

"
"Inability to hold a conversation, by which I mean never really contributing, only answering questions with yes/no responses, and generally forcing me to do all of the work. This is especially bad if they're the one who started the conversation in the first place. Why talk to me if you're not going to make an effort?

Also, if someone messages me the word ""hey"" and nothing else, I just assume whatever exchange we're about to have is gonna be boring as shit. "

"Dungeons and Dragons. I've always been spotlight shy and while I had a small stint in drama class as a teen, I couldn't really act outside of the improv games we played. So I thought I would play Dungeons and Dragons at the age of 28 moreso for the game play and not so much the character development.

It's turned me into a pretty great role player, and I'm more imaginative than ever, feeling like a kid again. As a bonus, I'm also bringing some of those role playing skills into the bedroom as of recent, which is huge for someone like me who feels awkward just trying to take her socks off."
My major red flag is that I mask my low self esteem with nonchalance. I have a hard time accepting praise. I react with complete disinterest when I feel hurt and slighted. I take things personally but say things don‚Äôt matter or I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs bad but I‚Äôm working on it.

"Female software engineer here. I wear whatever I want because no one gives a crap - the guys are going around in t-shirts and cargo shorts (ew).

My usual summer wear is a modest-cut summer dress, either maxi or knee length. I also wear a lot of comfortable lightweight stretch pants (the kind with pockets and other details to make them look like regular pants). Long story short, anything casual but office-modest - I avoid leggings-as-pants, revealing cuts, exposed shoulders, short skirts etc because I'm surrounded by men. It's not against the *rules* but just makes me feel self-conscious. 

Note that while the weather is warm, the office might be super air conditioned, because men like it colder than women. Definitely bring a cardigan or something. I just keep one at my desk year round. "
"Besides all of the good answers already posted: the ones about feeling empowered. What is this ""empowered"" and why should I feel like that just because I'm a woman?"
"So, I had just gotten over a long, toxic relationship with a narcissist. I was looking for the exact opposite of my ex and boy did I find it! This guy was studying to become a pastor, he was one of my friends from high school, and I knew he would treat me right. 

Then the flags...oh, the flags. 

First flag. He told me what a perfect match we were since I was studying a profession notorious for making money, insinuating that my salary would support his pastors salary were we to get married. My mom also had coffee with his mom, who talked about how her son was leeching off of them and they were supporting all of his adventures and inconsistency and she was hoping his new focused girlfriend would settle him down a bit.

Second flag. When my ex‚Äôs best friend (who is a girl) added him on Facebook and I had a conversation with him saying that I think my ex is trying to spy on me since I have the ex and his best friend blocked on Facebook. He gave me a blank stare and said ‚Äúoh, interesting‚Äù. And accepted her request anyway. He was more concerned about his Facebook friend count.

Third flag. I realized I dreaded hanging out with him and would procrastinate and arrive late to things to shorten the amount of time we spent together. 

Fourth flag. He told me that he struggled because he is ‚Äúnaturally attracted to Size Two girls‚Äù and at the time I was a size 6 or 8. He also tried to push me into being more creative and artistic, because he is a creative type, even though he had known me for a very long time and knew that I am more of an analytical, logical person and don‚Äôt have an ounce of artistic creativity.

I thought that that a person more egocentric and arrogant than my ex couldn‚Äôt exist. Turns out I found him. Just because people present on paper as what you are looking for or as nice, doesn‚Äôt mean they also aren‚Äôt a raging narcissist.

Edit: I just want to point out that I don‚Äôt mean any condescension toward artsy types. I love you people and wish I was moreso. I‚Äôm just not and didn‚Äôt appreciate someone trying to make me be someone I‚Äôm not. 

Also, this guy is still single and hasn‚Äôt dated anyone since me."
You didn't want to slither in those sheets? 
"I honestly don't like to date people who are tinier than me. I'm not tall and I'm very skinny, and I like people who are taller and stronger than me -- not a huge feat. But I have gone out with two people, a guy and a woman, that were so so tiny that I just... couldn't. I like my girls amazonian, thank you."

I can‚Äôt ‚Äújust buy men‚Äôs!‚Äù because they are longer and weighted differently.

"Exactly.  And for many people, the end goal of dating around is to find someone special who can be a long term partner.

"I don't know if this counts as specifically marketed towards women, but pretty much every healthy food commercial. It always shows a young, pretty woman (who is way too young to be a mother to two children, the oldest of which is at the least twelve) making dinner or breakfast for her family. As if it's every woman's responsibility to show her family the path to healthy food and that it can be just as tasty as chocolate. Ugh."
"See...I'm almost to the point that anyone who is an active participant in *any* religion is a deal-breaker. I agree that Scientology is worse than many, but am really rather against most religions. 

When guys put anything related to God, Jesus, or anything along those lines on their OLD profiles, esp if they're marking it as an important part of their life, I automatically skip.

I prefer atheists, agnostics, or a variety of other not-religious nomers."
"The fact that you‚Äôre aware of those thoughts is what makes the difference. Someone once told me that the first thought you have in any situation is how society has conditioned you to think‚Äîit reflects your innate biases. The *second* thought you have reflects who you are as a person. 

So if you see a woman in like super high heels and a tiny miniskirt and think ‚Äúwow, what a slut‚Äù that‚Äôs an innate bias that you have no control over. But if your next thought is ‚Äúwhat a shitty sexist thing to think; she can dress however she wants and it doesn‚Äôt devalue her as a person,‚Äù then you‚Äôre on the right track. We can‚Äôt change our innate biases. We pick them up as children and carry them with us all our lives. What we *can* do  is be aware of them, and challenge the them whenever they‚Äôre brought up. "
"I left my ex-fiance for someone I thought was super hot and pretty interesting. I was cool with it being a fling/rebound and wasn't looking for anything serious. I was pretty depressed (as one gets when they throw out all life plans), impulsive, and down to get my heart broken one more time for good measure because there was no way this dude was interested in me long-term. 

Turns out he was serious, and also the most amazing human. I have never been so systematically, deliberately and whimsically seduced. I spent the first six months just being like ""Hmm wonder when this rebound will blow up in my face."" We became exclusive, we said I love you, I don't think I really believed he was serious until we moved in together at six months (and internally I was still like ""This is going to blow up in your face, girl,"" because I never move that fast). 

Now we've lived together for a little over two years, he stood by me through three‚Äîcount 'em THREE‚Äîmedical catastrophes, we just got the best little puppy, he went back to school, and he's looking at rings. It's pretty good grass. "

Math. I only became good at math when I really had to try at 21. Started from the pathetic addition and multiplication section on Khan academy and worked my way up to Calculus 2. Then I got the grades I worked for. Now I do math all the time in my major that I'd normally leave for someone else. It feels good being able to tackle something that I had genuine anxiety over before.
Teenage girls. Anything related to them or their interests in unfairly deemed shallow/vapid/unimportant. 
"I have found the red flag ones to be quite helpful.

More in retrospect than as a guide. Those posts helped solidify my beliefs about the manipulation I went through dating my ex. Kind of in a ""yeah, okay so I wasn't crazy thinking that behavior was fucked up."" (He made me believe that I was crazy a lot, or at least tried). "
Crocheting. I learned really young from my grandma but never had the patience for it. Picked it up again about 4 years ago at the age of 26 by watching YouTube videos. 
"I guess this most recently happened with a guy I'd had a crush on for a while, then we dated for a few months and I saw a lot of things I didn't like about him but just kept ignoring them because I wanted to like him. Maybe I just didn't want to be alone.

The red flags weren't that terrible, just stuff I personally don't like. He's addicted to porn, not very good at spelling, is kind of immature. Once I took off those rose-colored glasses, honestly I realized being with someone I have to constantly ignore parts of to like them isn't worth it."
"You're depressed, go to the doctor. I know you don't think you are, but you are."
"Same here, and I don't think it's a shallow reason at all. I dealt with this shit with an ex last year and I see posts about it on the relationship subs all the time too. On the surface it seems like kind of a silly thing to be bothered by and lots of people will tell you it's just porn and you're just being insecure. It's NOT just porn though, it's real people who your partner can message and interact with if they choose to. To me it's on the same level as cam girls, it's too personal and it's basically sexual interaction with other people. It really fucks with your self-esteem &amp; security after a while, plus it's just gross &amp; tacky. It's like keeping your Hustlers on the coffee table or something. I don't want my friends &amp; family going to check out my new SO's profile only to see his fap material on public display. Nowadays if I'm getting to know a guy I'll take a look at his friend/follow list and if there's a bunch of porn girls, ""models"", or just too many random girls I won't date him. My current guy earned major points for having a low friend count and for not having instagram or snapchat."

"My periods are all over the place. Sometimes I'll go a year or more without getting one (though the average seems to be every three or four months). Sometimes it'll be super heavy and I have to empty my menstrual cup every couple hours. Other times I'm fine with just wearing panty liners the whole period. Sometimes they  only last three or four days. Other times they'll last two weeks or more (right now I'm on day 16 of my latest period).

I never know what I'm going to get or when I'm going to get it. I've been to doctors, had all sorts of tests done, and everything in there is healthy. My uterus just does what it wants!"

Basically, my bladder is more sensitive and feels full quicker than a normal person. I pee once every 1-2 hours on my medication.

"Yo yo yo, dog trainer here, what do you want to know?

Here's some general wisdom in the meantime:

Dogs repeat behaviours that are reinforcing for them. Getting into trash is reinforcing. So, you have to be more reinforcing than the other things your dog wants. And if you can't, you need to manage the environment so your dog can't practice behaviours you don't like. 

Train in small increments, like minutes a session. 

Research enrichment activities so your dog has a lot of positive mental outlets. 

Not all trainers are equal. It's an unregulated industry and anyone can profess to being a trainer (like me ;)). Research trainers who use LIMA, positive reinforcement, and aversive free trainer. Dominance theory is garbage. If a trainer or class discomforts you, don't spend your money. 

Treat walks as a chance to offer your dog an outlet for sniffing and exploring. Don't worry about x number of hours walking a day. Let your dog use her nose. 

Be consistent in your training and boundaries. Confusion kills. 

Respect your dog's levels of comfort and look up recognizing stress signals. 

And enjoy your new dog!"
Menstrual products should not be taxed as a luxury.

"In first or second grade, there was this girl who I really hit it off with due to our shared interest in Bratz dolls. We would talk every day, and she was sometimes a big highlight to my day.

The last time I spoke to her, I commented, ""I'm so glad we're friends!""

She said, ""We're not friends. I just talked to you because you like Bratz.""

The aftermath is that I never talked to her again. I can't remember her face, nor her name, she moved about a month after and I have no clue where she is now, but I still feel a pang of sadness when I think about it. It's silly, but this happened way too often with me over the years. Considering that this was the first time something like that happened, it's bound to stick with me for life."

And, I think that ties into a great idea - people who think others are obligated to do something in relation to their appearance, whether it's shave their legs, not shave their legs, wear make-up, not wear make-up, etc., are the worst. It's OK to have preferences (or even deal breakers) for people you date, but people who believes others are obligated to look a certain way just *to exist* are the worst."

Why do they always use depression as an excuse to be shady? I briefly dated a guy last year that kept up dating profiles while we were together and told me he was trying to find female friends because his current friend group was making his depression worse when I found out. 
They're worse because it's just a chance for everyone to talk about how amazing their boyfriends are and how they could tell from the beginning how amazing they were...ugh
I've found modcloth to be mixed quality. I bought one of their drapey sweaters which had a magnetic closure and the magnet fell out the first day I wore it. That was before they were bought by Walmart. I have less faith in their quality now. 
"Teenagers. Like 7 of them ate Tide Pods, so their entire demographic must be completely brainless, don‚Äôt deserve respect, and shouldn‚Äôt have a say in anything.

"I‚Äôve argued this before but the tools with pink handles doesn‚Äôt bother me. I don‚Äôt like that they are marketed specifically to women, but I like that stereotypically male products are being made in more feminine colors. I feel the same way about the controversial pink LEGO-I just wish the traditional and the pink ones would be marketed to both boys and girls. I think there‚Äôs this movement of ‚Äúgirls can like dinosaurs and science and boy things‚Äù which is great, but I‚Äôd also like a movement for ‚Äúyou can love pink and unicorns and still be awesome at STEM‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have to be a tomboy to be an engineer. "
"Bars or pubs, and other spaces that are designed to be social. Like a gala or a concert or something. That said, and I‚Äôve said this before, my vote is still that the best way to handle it is for a guy to give me his number with a simple conversation like ‚Äúhey, you seem really cool. Would love to take you for coffee sometime. Here‚Äôs my number, shoot me a text anytime.‚Äù "
"Some people act so contrarian and they think that means society has less control over them.

"Well, because then the 5'10"" woman would be excluding a very large portion of the male population whereas the 5'2"" woman is only excluding men on the extreme end of the scale. No matter what height you are, a 5'1"" guy is objectively unusually short whereas a 5'9"" guy is exactly average height.

Not being attracted to people on the extreme ends of any scale is widely acceptable and common, but calling someone firmly in the middle of the bell curve ""too ___ for me"" just seems petty/unfair.

Your intention (having a bigger partner than you) may be the same as the super short girl, but context changes the effect."

"No creative hobbies. Yeah it's a mega shit reason, but a large amount of my life is art, music, writing, and just learning how to make cool shit. I need someone who understands that (and that I'm a weirdo artist type), and who might even inspire me with their own skills."
"More men might get ""interesting"" if it means things like career success. We can thank sexism for that.

"Hmm. It's less about specific textures and more about combinations of textures.

I like smooth textures. I don't like lumpy mashed potatoes, for instance. I like mashed potatoes that are completely whipped and uniform. 

But I also like it when textures are combined in a nice way. I love pad thai, because it's got crunchy and soft and crispy-ish and all sorts of things.

I imagine my taste in texture is not terribly different from most people; I just value it more. You may be able to look past a weird texture if something has really great flavor. I can't. If a texture is unpleasant for me, it will ruin the thing itself. I hate bananas for that reason. "

"I worked for a medical group that included many different physicians, including male gynecologists. The doctors felt quite free to talk amongst themselves in front of the admins and staff as though we weren't there, including both detailed discussions about their patients and sexual thoughts/feelings/situations about those patients and their personal disgust at those that they didn't find attractive. I heard quite enough to make me uncomfortable on more than one occasion. My own first gynecologist was one that participated in those discussions. When I decided to give another male gynecologist a chance later in the future, he made very inappropriate remarks about my body and how it matched his preferences. Since then, I've stayed with female gynecologists."
"Spoilers.  Lily from 'How I Met Your Mother' is a terrible friend to Ted.  I had to quit watching the show after it's revealed that she broke up his relationships because she couldn't picture them as elderly friends sipping iced tea together on a porch.  (She did extremely underhanded things like leave jewelry out to make it look like Ted was cheating.)

Ted, instead of being furious like any rational person, agrees that Lily's 'future vision' makes sense, and that she was right to break up his relationships!

What the fuck guys?!  Lily can't just, you know, talk to Ted?  Ted still wants to be friends with someone so manipulative, especially when his goal in life is getting married?  They don't even fight for a whole episode?

"My ""bis-cas"" wardrobe is pretty much wrap dresses of varying degrees of formality and summery-ness, and black culottes that I wear with different tops of varying degrees of formality and summery-ness, but this also works with neutral skirts or trousers, depending on your style.

For a super casual day I'll wear black culottes with white trainers and a white teeshirt, on a smart day I'll wear with dress shoes, a blouse and a blazer. Casual dresses are just above the knee, short-sleeved, patterned or coloured and worn with ballet flats and a cardigan, smarter ones are black/navy, knee length, work with heels and jacket. "

"I feel the same way and it makes me conflicted. Like with the Golden Globes, on the one hand it was great to see the issue of sexual assault talked about so openly in mainstream media. But on the other hand I was annoyed that all these rich, successful, mainly white women were all patting each other on the back and making it seem like their struggle in Hollywood was representative of what all women struggle with.

"One of the big problems with Golden Rule types is that they often forget that others might not appreciate the same things as them.  It gets tiresome having an SO do things ""for you"" that you never wanted done in the first place, then they put extra pressure on you to reciprocate for a gesture that was never about you in the first place.  The huge suprise birthday party not getting response in kind could very well be both partners following the mantra of do unto others, but it results in each partner getting what the other would have wanted.

It's great that you recognised that in yourself.  It can be tough to acknowledge that you're the root of the problem when you're the one doing the ""nice"" thing.  Good for you!"

"I have always felt, and for as long as it remains true will always feel, like I do not properly 'qualify' as bisexual for having never had sex with, dated, or been in a relationship with a woman. I totally understand the argument for having things easier being straight-passing, I don't question that at all. But I know I'm attracted to women, and yet still feel almost guilty about owning the label of bi. 

I feel like I will always wonder what being with women would be like. I will always feel a little incomplete, like I've not been able to explore that side of myself. It is important to understand that this is an individual personality thing, and not something that should just be expected in all bisexual people. 

Statistically, the chances of me meeting a guy who I find attractive, who likes girls and who is compatible with me is far more likely than meeting a woman I find attractive, who likes girls and who is compatible with me. The one time I seriously tried to date women it failed miserably. And I'm currently in a monogamous relationship with the best guy ever. So yeah, it's a very real possibility that I will never feel fully 'valid'. Which makes me feel bad, like he isn't enough or something, when he is. It's just how I feel."

"I‚Äôm queer and married to a woman. I used to worry more about when I got a crush on a man‚Äîhad internalized the messaging about bi/pan people being more likely to cheat, and thought it about myself. 

But then I started thinking of monogamy as a spectrum, not a binary, because I knew I had these crushes and also knew I wouldn‚Äôt cheat? I just don‚Äôt have THAT urge, even with a powerful attraction. My partner doesn‚Äôt even get crushes, other people cheat, other people are poly‚Äîa spectrum. 

My partner is okay with my crushes and pointed out my type, and then we both had a good laugh about it. If she weren‚Äôt okay with it, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd be a good fit anyway. 

I get WAY FEWER crushes on women now that I‚Äôm married. My brain is like, well we have our wife forever, so we can shut that piece off! 

Um anyway, I used to be kind of vaguely upset by my crushes. Now I am amused by them. There‚Äôs one guy who I barely even like and wouldn‚Äôt want to date if I were single, but the chemistry is intense. I‚Äôm currently avoiding him because I think he‚Äôs maybe got more feelings or less inhibition, and I trust myself with the chemistry, but I don‚Äôt trust him, if that makes sense?

This is exactly why my husband and I have separate bedrooms. We‚Äôve been together almost 20 years. We found that having our own space has made us much happier individually and as a couple. We respect each other‚Äôs privacy and know that a closed door is ‚ÄúI just need space right now‚Äù not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to shut you out‚Äù. It was difficult at first but we quickly adjusted and love that little bit of freedom. It all started because he snores and I get bouts of insomnia.

Hold out for people that don't suck an treat you right, including partners, friends, coworkers, or folks that you share a hobby with.

Be awesome at being alone. If you can't stand being alone with yourself for extended periods of time figure out why. Learn to not rely on other people to entertain you, listen to your complaining, or to accompany you to new restaurants. Validate yourself."

I started dating my husband in my teens. A lot of people didn't really understand being in a serious relationship and were out partying and being single.

I was super confused by it and when it continued, I clarified that I only saw him as a platonic friend.

He went nuts (very r/niceguys worthy). Turns out he thought we were in some kind of online relationship, even though he knows I have a partner. It was very bizarre because never was there ever any flirting, any hint of anything romantic or sexual, yet somehow he thought I was going to say I was in love with him? He claimed that I was just using him, called me a bunch of awful names and blocked me. It was shitty because I really valued that friendship and I didn't see it coming. "

While I understand and agree that having a post-pregnancy body (or any body type) is nothing to be ashamed of, I don't agree that you have to, *need to,* ***must*** be in love with your post-pregnancy body. To me, cosmetic surgery is a lot like getting a piercing, a tattoo, or dying your hair in the sense that it's not necessarily about doing it to please anyone else but yourself. I'd probably punch someone if they told me I wasn't allowed to dye my hair or get a piercing because it means I don't love myself or whatever. I mean, surgery is definitely a bigger deal and more invasive than other forms of body modification, but if you really want it just for yourself, who is anybody to say you can't do it? Fuck that."

I mean, it‚Äôs great that advertisers realize that women are a significant force in the consumer market, that don‚Äôt want to be insulted by products they use (DUH) but so far those advertisements do nothing more than pander to women‚Äôs insecurities and offer their product as a fix.

"Citizenship for American Samoans who want citizenship. 

It is quite frankly outrageous that an American territory that was singled out due to being populated by ""alien races"" is still singled out in 2018, and that Americans, born in America, have to bear the title ""American National"" instead of ""Citizen"". It makes one question if all men are truly created equal when Guam gets citizenship and American Samoa does not. 

So let's say, you are a Samoan, born in the American territory. You study, go to school, and now you have a teaching credential. How great! You move to the mainland to teach at inner city schools where teachers are desperately needed. Wow, you seem like a great person. 

Except you can't teach at that school, because many schools have citizenship as a requirement to teach. 

Maybe you want to be a police officer? ... nope. That's not going to happen in a lot of jurisdictions because you're not a citizen. 

And here's the one that really twists up my knickers: You're Samoan. Your husband is also Samoan and he joins the Army. Good for him, A LOT OF SAMOANS SERVE. So he gets his citizenship and damn straight he should. But you don't. So now you're living at Fort Bragg and your daughter goes to public school there and you just want to be able to vote for someone on the school board. You're not allowed to. Because despite the fact that you were born in America, your husband is currently serving America, your daughter is a natural born citizen, and you have never lived anywhere BUT AMERICA, you can't vote for school board. Because you're not American enough.
