"Well I had similar situation. Only 1 hour drive between us but He actually every week drove to me and picked me up. After years of doing this he started saying I should be visiting him on my own and come by train (be weary I were 10 back then). When I went by the train he failed to show up, when after hour long wait and hitching a ride I arrive at his place to find out he was not at home because there was no car before his house. Waited like a stupid person on his doorstep for 6 hours before he showed up, stinking of booze and was suprised that today is sunday not saturday. He let me in house only to find out he had invited a new drunkard thot today so he just gave me 10$ to go home. What an asshole. 

Skip few years later. He Got sober he started his own company and we were seeing each other more frequently. Then when I started the talk about me moving in to his house because they had better job offers in his city he completly cut contact with my Mothers side of family, told his side that I am psycho and drug addict and wanted to borrow a money from him all the time and I am in debt for the all the kilometers that he drove to get me when I was a kid. 

Later I found out that he had a massive drug trafficking operaton in his basement with small tunnels and carts with a line on them to drag them from both sides. It was even featured in local newspaper. I was so smug after this that I bought out entire supply of the newspaper from a corner store just to send it out to every family member from his side. 

Never quite gotten over him but his behavior shaped me into being an asshole to stupid people."
