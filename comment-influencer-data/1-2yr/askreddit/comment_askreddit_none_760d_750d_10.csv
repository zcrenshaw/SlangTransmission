"Man this happened to me in Seattle. There's a couple of guys that hang out by a theatre downtown. One of them is always on a hover board and will circle you/move very randomly as soon as the other gets your attention so you feel like you can't walk away without colliding. Their story is they are raising money to teach children music. 

I had to take a lesson from my wife and learn to do the NY powerwalk. "

"&gt; Undercover cop hires a prostitute = not entrapment.

I've always wondered: if the undercover cop has to offer some ridiculous incentive before the suspect will go along with the crime, is it entrapment? Like, say the cop propositions a lady for sex for $200, and she declines—but then he offers her ***one meeeeellion dollars***, and she says yes. Is she ""a prostitute"", or is she just any normal person who would obviously make a one-time exception for a million dollars?"
"I'm a smoker. I know it's a bad habit, but what I don't get is how it's so common to just throw cigarette butts wherever. Even when I was a teenager I still made it a point to fully extinguish my cigarette and then throw it in a waste bin. There's usually a trash can within a block if you're in a city and if there isn't one around, just wait until you're near one. It's not that hard. I just flick off the cherry and excess tobacco and throw it away when I can. I carry it in my cigarette pack or pocket or purse or an improvised ashtray in my car or whatever. Yeah, butts don't smell good, and doing things like keeping them in my car instead of throwing them out the window makes it smell worse, but that's my problem to deal with. I choose to smoke, so I need to own the consequences. It's really not even much of an inconvenience to not be an asshole. "
"Yep, that's it. Just like every other light (flashlights, light bulbs), they're all switching over to LED. So there's gonna be a day some time soon where every single car has these bright ass LED bulbs. Right now, you'll (at least me) be driving and it'll be ""fuck... bright ass lights. Fuck... bright ass lights. Oh thank god this next car only has normal bulbs so my eyes get an additional few seconds to adjust before I inevitably pass another dick head with supernovas on the front of their car."" Once they're all LED, its gonna be ""fuck bright ass lights, fuck another pair, fuck even more, fuck again... fuck I'm blind because I've had brights shining in my face continuously for the last 5 minutes""

They even advertise during NFL games now. There's a commercial with a dad outside installing LEDs in his daughters car (at everyone else on the roads expense) while everyone else is inside watching the game. I hate that fucking commercial so much. If someone was to start a kickstarter to make a parody of those commercials where everyone else is swerving off the road and smashing into trees... I'd actually donate to that.

I was gonna buy a pair of them yellow tinted glasses that allegedly negate the brights/glare, but I hav3nylt gotten around to it because I rarely ever drive at night. Buying one of those high powered green lasers would be a lot more fun, but nowadays someone will shoot your ass"

I had a coworker swing around and fist pump one time when I was walking by. She managed to land her fist right in my asshole with such force and accuracy that I'm pretty sure she could have high fived my prostate. I literally lifted off of the floor as my coworker shoved her hand inside me like a sweaty Kermit the Frog.
"Isn't that the point of us? We're trying to make purpose in an otherwise meaningless universe. Life IS purpose. There's no greater purpose than just to simply live. Look at evolution. The whole point is to live and keep living via reproduction. 

My whole theory on the universe is that it's an evolutionary system in itself. Gravity allows planets to gravitate towards heat sources (stars), and why is heat needed? To create life. Our planet is an example of the universe trying to create life, whether it be the first and only, or one of many. 

The universe wants to live and reproduce, just like everything else that we know of. "

Not me but a close friend was hiking the Appalachian trail. He said he was in the longest section of wilderness and ran across another through hiker and spent the night with him.

After confirming that the other guy saw the shoes too they packed up and camped far into the woods that night.

"Washington

The state is fucking gorgeous.

Seriously I moved here from the east coast and I remember when I hit Oregon thinking holy crap the state is amazing.  The rolling hills and fields... The sunsets... Just all of it was fantastic.

I was just about at the point of regretting my planned move to Washington.  The next day we drove through the Cascades... Holy fucking shit.  Watching clouds grow out of the sides of mountains covered in an endless forest was just breathtaking.  I was floored with how beautiful Oregon was, and then Washington crushed it.  

On top of that it's everything else... I absolutely love the weather here.  Most of the state doesn't even have an air conditioner because it only really gets hot enough to need one for about 2 or 3 weeks of the year.  It's almost always that just right temperature out where you can go for a walk without feeling too hot or too cold.  Even during the winter most of the time of light jackets all you need.

And the trees. Holy crap the trees.  An endless ocean of them.  Even in the cities a lot of the times they will leave a good number of them up which gives kind of a fake rural feel.  Even though the line of trees is only five or six thick, it feels like you're driving through the woods.  I love that.  And they Tower over you... The trees are incredibly tall as compared to any other place I've ever lived.  

And despite all of the memes, damn near every person I've met here has been extremely friendly.  It's a city, so of course most of the time people just act indifferent because we're all living our lives, but anybody that you need to interact with is always friendly.  

And mt Rainer is huge.

I love it here.

"I do not agree with this. If my employees are supposed to be in at 9am, any time between 8:55am and 9:05am is considered on time. I can see how in some professions it's important to be early, but in a regular office environment, being a few minutes early or late on a normal day (not a day that you have a meeting, have to meet a client, etc.) is not a big deal. Again, there's obviously exceptions for certain things when other people are clearly waiting on you, but in our office, most people just sit at their desks and check their emails/phone messages at the beginning of the day, and then go on to do other work on our computers and I really don't care if my employees are a couple minutes late or early for that."

"1) He has admitted in another comment that the paternity test revealed that the child is his for sure

2) The mother didn't demand him not be involved in the child's life, she demanded he be there completely, or not there at all. I think this is an incredibly fair demand to make. You have a child, and you have a duty to take care of him/her. The burden should be shared across the parents and she's demanding he put in his 50%. Not 15%, not 30%. Not whenever he wants to waltz into the child's life on a birthday or holiday or when he decides he wants to see her. He should be there on the rainy days when the going gets tough.

3) How you've made the mother out to be the bad guy, I have no idea. Maybe the fact that she was talking to her ex put you on edge? Based on the information we have she has gone above and beyond for her age. She is raising a child alone and taking responsibility for their actions, while the father is shirking them. She is one feeding, clothing, providing the child with family and love.

4) Your belief that one can only provide a child with a good and happy life if one neglects his/her child to invest in a career for more economic stability is doing a disservice to all the families that made it through without either parent having attained higher education, or worked hard jobs or sacrificed individual wants and needs for family.

5) He didn't want the child (i.e. was willing to put the kid up for adoption and also walk out), and that is what it is. But he is not a saint and don't paint him like one. His advocacy work is disturbing because his story seems to be drawing pity points. His want for the child now is also very selfish. He just needs to be honest with himself. Maybe he can learn a thing or two from the guy who said ""didn't care and never will"". "
"Lol, I live in Honolulu. The tourists aren't bad, in fact most are quite pleasant.

The thing about where I live that I hate most is the safety. Honolulu is one of the safest places in the world, except for the hospitals. 

It's unfortunate and counterintuitive but likely the most dangerous place in Hawaii is the hospitals. 

Locals are fond of saying that they don't get any major healthcare done on the island, and instead go to the 'mainland'. The tourists on the other hand, have no idea. 

I had minor surgery last year and it insidiously went from a single small surgical procedure to a major surgery involving amputation of multiple healthy organs.

This was so scary, because I did all the research and planned everything out meticulously, and the surgeon agreed to the specific small surgical procedure I requested. He even shook my hand.

Then, once I was sedated he and the hospitals medical team cut a bunch of unrelated organs out of me and kind of shrugged and wrote this letter: 
  
http://m.imgur.com/NRUyIbP

Then when I told the hospital, they said it was 'medically necessary', and acted like they have the legal right to surgically operate on patients against their will if they deem it 'medically necessary'. 

So, despite the local maxim of not getting any major medical care on the island, it should probably be factored in to not let yourself be sedated at all, because theoretically they can do anything they want to your sedated body, and it's not like you can just wake up and stop them either.

My g-uncles would hear the reports coming over the radio and know everyone that was involved in whatever car crash, fire, theft etc. and would tell me stories about them.

"I had a former student who just never fit in. He wasn't athletic to fit in with the jocks, wasn't part of the intellectual crowd, and was just socially awkward. I had lunch duty and everyday I saw him buy 5 or 6 sodas and give them to a group of boys who would sit with him at a lunch table. Most days, they would open the cans, and get up and walk away only to leave him by himself. I asked him about it, ""Why do you do that?"" and his response was, ""I only do it so they will talk to me."" I tried to help the kid out and make friends, but he didn't have a father in his life and I don't know if that played a role, but he never really took any advice I gave him. Another factor that probably didn't help was that his mom treated him like he was still a toddler. A lot of his school items were for kids younger than his age of 13.  
  
One day he used a gun on himself. The sheriff's report called in an accident, but our group of teachers knew what really happened.   

The funeral was at a local church, and most of the middle school was there. There were people crying, mostly groups of girls that never really knew him. The boys that he bought sodas for never really showed much emotion. I can't recall if anyone spoke to the counselors on hand for the next week. To me it was all surreal. This situation could have been easily avoided. "

Sometimes my mom would surprise me with something nice (like a video game or new shoes) only to turn around and use that as a way to guilt me into doing something for her. It took a long time for me to get it sorted out that that is not the way a child should be treated. I never complained about pitching in or doing things around the house; but they still used guilt and material goods to act like I owed them for being born.

"Finally something for me!

I work in a subway at a six flag Park. Our six flag park gives out a bunch of coupons and rebates when u buy a gold season pass or something, but there's one coupon for subway but it doesn't work in the subways inside the park. 

Everyday we have to tell ~50 people that the coupon doesn't work here, most of them take it pretty good (from ""That's fkng stupid wtf"" to ""oh ok no worries"") but there's one woman, lord save me, she threw a huge fit. And I mean she was screaming at me in front of her kids and other kids. Of course I tried to say I can't do anything about it, she wasn't getting it. It went on for 3 minutes, by the end my coworkers were laughing and I also had a little grin on my face, she got mad again because obviously I was making fun of her.

But thats not even the end, when she finally says ""alright I'll order wtv"", she tries to order a panini, we dont Make those, she says ""so you dont take coupons AND u dont have paninies?"" I'm like no sorry. She orders a foot long steak and cheese on Italian fine herbs with swiss cheese grilled, but the thing is we dont have a oven and we only have cheddar cheese(We Also dont have spinach or green peppers. ). So she gets mad again, but this time she went full on ""call the manager I wanna speak with him, this service is shit, this subway is shit, I'm going to sue you all"". She didnt order a sandwich because my manager threw her out of the subway lmao, he heard her from upstairs and she woke him up(he always sleeps from like 3-5 pm in his office cuz there aren't a lot of people )

Dont even get me going on the coupons that do work.

Tl;Dr : women with kids got really mad because her coupon didnt work

"My wife is a photojournalist, we're in regular touch with a few victims families (and just ran down to one in the middle of the night last week because it's not just police attention the stories draw, it's also creeper westerners to the poor daughter but that's another story) there's definitely less petty crime in poor areas, there's also definitely **not** a significant drop in drug use or drug supply, there's also definitely over 10,000 killed by police and/or vigilantes (it's a little unclear), a lot of these people probably were drug users, and probably did commit petty crimes. The most common victims of these killings are usually the jeepney touts, and the tricycle drivers, people well known in their communities (because these communities mostly know each other anyway) for whatever down and dirty hood type shit happens just like in most poor neighborhoods around the world, including america.   And no, police aren't walking around with guns drawn just popping dudes in broad daylight.  That's not at all how it goes down.  It's not like I'm crawling over dead bodies as I walk to work in the morning.

There's also definitely a rampant atmosphere of increased impunity from police.  A police force that *wasn't trustworthy to begin with*.  Seriously nobody fucking trusts the PNP and for damn good reason, and that was before this shit happened.  This is also happening to the poorest, most vulnerable segment of society, with the least ability to protect themselves from injustice, which only encourages the police, a force already prone to corruption, who are not paid terribly well, and **already** pretty immune to oversight or prosecution, to further cement their ability to run things.  A nationwide carte blanche to these fuckers is exactly that, a blank check to run whatever dirty shit they want, put whoever they want that's powerlessness enough to not fight back on a 'drug' list, or hang a cardboard sign around their neck after they've popped the dude that says ""pusher ako"" and enforce their wills with guns and violence with no oversight, or chance of punishment.  If you can't see that's a recipe for social disaster I don't know what to tell you.  If you also can't see that offing a bunch of low level users and pushers **even if the police got every single one exactly right and never abused their power over life and death** would never ever stop the flow of drugs, stop the drug addicts, or stop crime.  Then I don't know what to tell you either.  It's a stupid strategy and it was [never](http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2016/09/18/1625144/duterte-drug-war-extension-6-months) ever, [going](http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/29/16/duterte-6-month-deadline-to-solve-drugs-a-miscalculation) to [work](http://www.journal.com.ph/news/top-stories/impossible-to-control-drugs-du30).  

For further looks see how his son has been named with smoke around him on authorizing meth to pass through customs, or how the police chief who was in charge when a **mayor in his jail cell was killed by police for 'shooting at them'** suddenly was reassigned and another mayor's family was killed at close range in another slaughter.  

If the Philippines, its government, and its police force were the most upright, competent, cohesive organizations in the world that only meant the best for us, its citizens, I would **still** think this was a dumb strategy that was unlikely to work with an unacceptable cost in human life for the intended effects.  As it is, it is none of those things, and never has been, and we will all be paying the price for this in the years to come.  Empowering uniformed forces with guns to act with impunity, without oversight, little control, and the power of life and death is not something that ever ever goes well in the long run."

"Stop expecting men to pay for your movie, your dinner, your drinks, and all that other shit on the first damn date. At least be prepared to pay for your half. Women keep whining that men hold them back (unless it requires them to pay for something). 

Yea I know not all women are like that. Luckily I am married I don't have this problem. But nothing pissed me off more when I was still single then when a girl just assumes I am picking up the tab and racks up like $200 in food and drinks. Left a bitch at a bar once because of that. "

I was an unplanned pregnancy,  as was my partner. That alone has life long effects on you. Especially my spouse, who was left in hospital for almost two months til adopted. Sad.

It's dark and raining and my friend cant really see whats going on outside the car. he heard a thud and half an hour later a stranger opens the door and finds him there. Someone hit and killed his dad and never stopped. He became my roommate shortly after I met him in our mid 20s. The first fathers day he lived with me I remember him coming out of his room crying. This strong grown man just weeping over what was taken from him almost 20 years ago. That guy that stopped for you is some of the best people humanity has to offer.

"My husband and I had a rough year last year, financially. He was injured and out of work for 3 months. He started a new job right when he was able to work again and then he was laid off 1.5 months later. This is after a previous 7 years of constant shit like this. Super stressful and last year just about finished us both off. Not in a marital way, but emotionally.

The holidays came rolling around and the LDS members in our neighborhood collected a bunch of money and gave it to us for Christmas. We were in shock. I felt embarrassed and blessed and thankful all at the same time. 

Then Christmas Eve we had a knock on the door. I opened it and there was a massive pile of secret Santa gifts on the porch with our daughter's name on them. We have a 3 year old daughter and had nothing to give her that year. We brought it all in and put it under the empty tree. Our daughter was so excited! She was jumping up and down, rolling all over, chattering about Santa and the chimney and every other Christmas thing she could think of and wanted to touch every gift. 

10 minutes later we got another knock on the door. We opened it and there was another huge pile of gifts with me and my husbands names on it.There were hand made hats and scarfs sitting there in baskets. Gift cards and wool socks, parfum, you name it.

At this point I just started bawling. It was so overwhelming. Our daughter squealed with excitement as we carried more stuff inside. She tried on her new hat and gloves and played with all the scarfs and wanted to go outside and try them out.

We were literally speechless. My husband's eye were welled up. I hadn't seen him cry since the moment I was walking down the aisle on our wedding day, 10 years prior. We just sat there staring at all of this stuff in silence for a good 5 minutes whike our daughter was bouncing off the walls. 

We live in a great community. We're surrounded with amazing people. I already knew that, but this was the icing. I don't ever want to move

I have so many questions 
The call of duty franchise.
"When I get a book from a Yard Sale or Thrift shop (or the rare donation) I have to put the title in the circulation software and see if anyone in the county has the book.  Then I can click 'Add a Copy' to my schools collection and you always have to fix the call number on Fiction, just 3 key strokes.

If the book does not exist in the county already (rare on kids books) I have to either a) find a book that it is close to and sneak it in as that title (20 Pokemon Chapter books all went in as one Pokemon book...) or b) ask the county to add it to the collection (takes a week and I rarely do this, lots of a).

Then you have to print a bar code and spine label and attach them and cover them with clear covers to protect them.  If it is a paper back I will cover it with clear contact paper so that it will last 6-7 check outs.

Then a kid checks it out.  I only buy stuff I know a kid will check out the day I put it out.  All the Hardy Boys books in the world won't do you any good if NO KID will check them out (I moved my collection to lower shelves (like a kid can get to the 6th shelf) and ALL the Hardy Boy books came off the shelf stuck to each other because NO ONE had ever checked them out.)

I keep a set of shelves at the front of the room that have all the 'popular' books like Wimpy Kid and Katie Woo that the kids can get 1 book from, and that is where most of the books I buy go.  They can get another book from anywhere else in the library, but if they all got 2 from the front the 4th class coming to the library would not have any popular books to check out from.

It is interesting to see what kids will check out.  The Ripley's Believe it or Not and World Record books never leave the shelving cart because kids will grab those FAST.  There is one boy that ONLY checks out Biographies.  Another kid in the 5th grade now has only ever checked out Picture books and easy readers to make his Accelerated Reader goals the easy way (his mom tells him to).

I just had my first book that a parent demanded I remove from the library (Graphic Novel where the main character's brother has a pot/booze problem).  I just sent it to another library.  No reason for controversy in Elementary School.  If I tried to stand up for a book that really isn't that good anyway then the parent would have started a witch hunt through all the books and I don't want that.

My experience is that kids that read books on their own (not class assigned) have the most success in life.   When I was a kid I didn't read fiction (still don't) and the newspaper and magazines I would read didn't 'count' as reading, but there was not another 4th grader who was more up to date on the recession of the 70's or the Iran/Contra investigation than me."

"Back when I was 16. I was skateboarding home and some dude who was in his mid 20's stopped me and saw my deck (the actual board part of the skateboard) in bad condition. Now anyone who has ever been super into skating knows that a deck is a precious commodity. They run about 40-60 bucks for a nice one and they break a lot especially if you try jumping down stairs and ledges.  Well being a 16 year old and with no job. I had to make my decks last as long as possible. IF they broke I would have t o go months before I could convince my parents to let me get a new one or I would have to trade video games or something to a friend for one. Needless to say, my current deck was in pretty bad shape. It was wore down and had a small crack in it.   This guy saw my board, stopped me and asked if he could see it.  I was a little bit sketched out by this and made up a  lie about how I had to get going so I could get to work and this dude goes ""hang on just a second bro"" walks over to his car and pulls out a brand new Toy Machine deck (one of the Ed Templeton models) still in the plastic. hands it  to me and says ""Merry Christmas"" I couldn't believe it.  

I was the happiest kid ever that day. And it's also one of the reasons I refuse to be cynical about the human race. "

"My favourite thing about it was absolutely no constraints when racing.

Most ""open world"" driving games really only let you drive around freely between races, and the actual races are on fixed, closed circuits like every other game. In Burnout Paradise races are simply point-to-point and you're free to choose whichever path through the city you want - including discovering shortcuts. 

As you played more and more you'd begin to learn the best way to get through the city and to any of the destinations. I enjoyed 100%ing that game (and I think it's the only game I've ever done that with).

Plus, that DLC island was really amazing - the stunt trials there were wickedly fun.

The next ""open world"" driving game I played (NFS: Hot Pursuit) massively disappointed me for that reason and I don't think I played more than a couple of hours. At least Forza Horizon 2 &amp; 3 give you plenty to do besides straight up races!

Customer: I saw a really nice gray color in a magazine, could you make this one area Foggy Gray color?
Me: No it can't be that color after metal treatment. It's impossible because (physics).
Customer: do it anyway. Remember, not regular gray...Foggy Gray. Should I leave the magazine?"

"Stayed with a married couple that only knew each other for 4 months, they decided to go shroom picking, when they got back they went straight to their room and I hung out with my best friend in the living room, suddenly the wife comes running down stairs screaming and crying that her husband has lost his mind and is trying to kill her, he is a little guy about 5 feet tall. He soon follows behind her in his boxers with a giant machete in in his hands, thats when I noticed he had a giant scar down his chest, according to his wife he had to have open heart surgery for heart problems earlier that year and after they ate the shrooms they split an 8 ball of coke. He chased me and his wife out of the house and my best friend who is about 6'4 with a long beard picks him up by the shoulders and whispers in his ear. The husband drops the knife and asks him "" are you Jesus?"" then passed out.

we soon went back to living on park benches"

"My thoughts are similar. Wind Waker is often panned in retrospect because the people playing it in retrospect are adults with responsibilities and more important things they could be investing their time in. It's very difficult to replicate the Wind Waker experience as an adult because as a kid, your entire life was literally just you and the game as you played it. You had nothing else to think about, like that essay you're supposed to be writing or the jobs you could be applying to or the shifts you could have picked up, etc. As an adult, wasting time sailing around or exploring the many watch towers, submarines, and miscellaneous islands just makes you feel guilt for the time you're wasting.

Since I'm still a college student, my summers are still relatively obligation free, so I recently had the opportunity to replay Wind Waker under the correct circumstances. I would recommend the game to anyone to anyone, but only if they ever find themselves with at least a solid week where they can genuinely sit down and enjoy it without having to think about work, school, or anything else."

Because of this, anecdotes are considered unreliable to extrapolate data from - for scientific studies.

Both extremes are full of idiots and both extremes need to be treated as such by the moderates on their side. Instead, both sides of the media use fear to make moderates side with the extremes on their side instead of the moderates on the other side. The division needs to be drawn between moderates and extremes, not between the left and the right. I suspect that isn't as profitable for news agencies though. "

"A woman had been in hospital in a coma for five years. The woman's husband, John, distraught and ready to give up, asked the doctor if there was anything else that the doc thought could be done, since traditional treatments were clearly not working. 

""Well"" said the doctor, ""there is something that just might work. I have heard of some cases where patients have woken up from their comas after receiving oral sex. The sexual stimulations can fire up the neurons in the brain, causing the patient to wake up"".

""At this point, I'm ready to try anything"" said John, and he went into his wife's hospital room to test out the doctor's advice. Sure enough, a few minutes later John comes running back out into the hospital corridor. ""It worked! She's out of the coma!"" he shouted. 

Another man, Dave, who was getting a drink from the vending machine in the same corridor overheard the commotion caused by John's frenzied excitement. Dave also had a wife who had been in a coma for years. Dave asks the doctor ""what worked? Has that man's wife woken up? How did he do it?"" 

""Simple,"" said the doctor ""oral sex"". 

Somewhat surprised at the doctor's answer, Dave went into his own wife's hospital room to try out the theory for himself. After five minutes Dave comes back out and says ""it's not working, doc, she's choking"" "

Only ppl u know who get tickets, unless your just a really bad driver or i have stopped you before for same issue.

I should also say the reasons for this is most admins agree tickets are too high, only 5 bucks go to our dept. The rest goes to state and county. If tickets were 80, we would write tix, but 120 for 10 over is too high."

- yeah I like Starbucks. I also get a free drink/sandwich for every $62.50 I spend ($6 value for me), even less including double points days, star challenges, and a free item on my birthday. 
- I have a punch card at the feed store for my dog's food. 1 free every 12 bags. Also punch card at hot wings restaurant so I get free hot wings every 10th entree. (Buying dinner for 2 is 2 punches.) 
- gas station rewards (when I don't save at Costco) can be 10 cents/gallon for keeping an RFID tag in your center console. Use it if/when you buy something inside too. 
- gift cards at Costco are 20-25% off. Good use: Flemings. I can get $100 gift card for $80 and use for $35 prime rib special that's normally $50. They also have rewards, so it's a triple play. 
- no fee credit cards that give cash back. 
- hotels.com rewards with 10th night free is like 10% discount. Also brand specific memberships to collect points. 
etc etc etc

Finally, just ask for a discount when buying from any sales person. You'd be surprised how often a sales person will conjure a discount/coupon just because I asked. They get more credit for the sale than the value of it. 

Most of these have 8-10% returns for a very modest effort. Easy money. Guaranteed returns for stuff you're going to spend money on anyway.

"I've been a Law Enforcement Officer for three years, I work in a village of 4,500 people. And honestly I just do my job. My brother passed away two years ago from drugs and alcohol.

The cop who charged him I've never seen eye to eye with and just last year he was terminated for setting up a drug buy that was botched. But to the point of the question is simple. There are assholes in every single profession and the difference with Law enforcement is you can ruin someone's life by not doing your job properly. We have a good crew working for this department and our every move is documented by body's cams. Sure this profession attracts some crooked people who don't want to help and love the power, but if I find those people ever working in our department i will do everything in my power to make sure they get dealt with according to the law."

"Start small. Don't worry too much about your diet at first. Just make sure you go to a gym or jog *every single day* and do something. Don't overexert yourself too much to begin with. Just do some basic cardio, but make you do *something* every single day. After two weeks or so, it'll become habit. It'll feel wrong if you don't at least go for a walk every day. This is the first major step. After that, slowly ramp it up every other day. 

So on Monday you run and push your limits just a little bit. Tuesday, you take a long walk or jog and take it a little easier, but still do something. This wont do a ton of good for your body at first, but for your psyche it'll be a gamechanger. You'll find yourself more confident, less stressed overall, and you'll sleep better. Cardio, especially if done regularly, does wonders for your mental state, and, more importantly for weight loss, your metabolism. 

Next, cut out soda. I know, I know. But drink water instead, and drink way more of it than you did before. Hit at least a gallon or two a day. One of the biggest causes of fatigue and general lack of energy is dehydration. In any given room, chances are most people in there aren't drinking enough water. Cutting out soda and any super sugary drinks will see you losing weight right away. I cut out soda and lost almost 15 pounds on that alone.

Keep exercising every day. Keep that routine up. You don't have to go to a gym every day, but take a walk, jog somewhere, do pushups or crunches in your living room. Do *something*. The hardest part is getting into that routine. Once you've done it for a month, missing a day makes you feel wrong. Lazing around for a whole afternoon without a jog or a trip to the gym/rec center feels like you're forgetting something. 

One you get off sodas, drink more water, and get into the routine of working out in some way or another every single day, the whole thing gets easy. At that point, figure out how many calories a day you burn just running your body. Then figure out about how many calories you eat every meal. Don't worry at all about exact numbers. Don't calorie count, just try to get a general idea for each meal. Get a pedometer, either a fitbit type deal or something on your phone. Shoot for eating about 300 calories less than you burn a day, and then shoot for burning an additional 200-300 calories for your workouts early. Adjust these numbers if you start feeling faint between workouts. Try to eat more fiber, since it'll help keep you feeling full. Lastly, limit meals to 3 a day, one small, one medium, and one large. Try to replace that second bacon strip with a banana. Forgo the French fries for a small salad. You don't have to turn into a health nut. You can still enjoy a hamburger at a cookout or eggs and bacon for breakfast. Just find something unhealthy in every meal and replace it with something healthy. You still get to enjoy your meals, and there isn't that pressure of ""Oh, I'm at your barbecue, but if I have some ribs, I'll relapse and eat bad again"". Have those ribs, man. But have a light salad with dinner that night. It's all about balance. Some people will tell you you need to cut out everything bad, but really, just balance it out. Enjoy yourself in moderation.

The biggest hurdle by far with weight loss is the mental one. It sounds hard, and people will tell you that you need to spend four hours a day every day at the gym, and you need to eat nothing but kale for the rest of your life. You just need to convince yourself that it's not as hard as people make it sound. Once you've done that, it's just keeping up a routine, which isn't as difficult as it sounds.

Being told ""make it snappy"" just got under my skin, so I took as loooong as I could on it. The entire time he was watching his parents (not paying attention to him) walking away, leaving him there. Of course, he was stuck with me unless he wanted to lose his money. By the time I was done, the parents were long gone. Enjoy that snow-cone while you cry about being lost, you snappy little bastard.

We're always told to trust mainstream medicine and shit and think of doctors as these altruistic demigods that can do no wrong and always know best when that just simply isn't true. Look at how bad chronic diseases are in this country. A big reason is that we are so poorly taught proper nutrition, and most doctors don't even receive any nutrition instruction in Med School! Think about that. So we trust the system when they give us a pill for blood pressure, a pill for back pain, a pill for feeling tired, a pill for the side effects of the pill, etc. When very often lifestyle changes are more effective and healthier than medication. I'm not saying all medication is bad but look at the rates of prescription, the lobbying those companies do, and you realize there is a market for that stuff. Especially in as obese of a country (read: unhealthy of a country) as the US. Again, I'm not saying ""wholistic healing"" works and I think thats bullshit too, but I am a little more understanding of how a person can find it alluring."

I've come to hate the fact that we (men) pressure girls into anal so much that now girls have to state they don't do it in their profile. I'm like Jesus Christ perhaps save that request for later in a relationship? I like the idea of anal sex but also mindful not all women like it and not all women need to be proselytized, so to speak.

"1)	Parents who have favorite children are defensive regarding their treatment of the favored, overlooked or unfavored child. When spouses, friends, teachers, or strangers point out attitudes or behaviors reflecting unfair treatment of one child over another, these parents have many explanations and justifications for their behaviors. For example, when confronted by observers, the mother on ""What Would You Do?"" insisted that one child was prettier than the other so clothes looked better on her, or that the other child didn't need any new clothes.

2)	One child works hard to get parental affirmation and does not succeed. These children, either passively or aggressively, direct their energies at accomplishing this goal. For example, on the show, the overlooked child kept selecting clothes to show her mother, thinking she would like them, or explaining that she had outgrown the clothes in her closet. Her mother continued to dismiss her.

3)	The other child, the favorite child, doing nothing in particular, receives abundant affirmation and privileges that appear undeserved. On the show, viewers witnessed this child standing around as her mother inundated her with clothes to try on.

4)	One child grows up feeling powerful, believing they can do or accomplish anything while the other child grows up feeling defeated with low expectations of getting what they want.

5)	A parent excessively praises one child while ignoring, criticizing, or saying little positive about other children. These parents have difficulty acknowledging one child's shortcomings (often the favorite) or appreciating other children's strengths (often the overlooked or unfavorite).

"Destroying someone's personal property (even if it's abandoned for over 1 year) is also a crime in most States. You can either leave it abandoned in the way they left it, or you can actually use it for yourself as it is intended to be used, but you can't destroy it and throw it away without being financially liable. Unless of course you're a property manager with a lease agreement stating otherwise as most apartment complexes do... but still, they usually evict and displace, not destroy.      "

"I have a few from working in the childrens area of a park as a ride operator. 

I was working on a real small roller coaster ride (13') when a kid pushed through another kid and got his head stuck in the gate as it was closing. I ran to the gate and started pulling it so his neck wouldn't get crushed while i yelled at the operator to release the gate. The dad then comes up yelling at me why his kid got stuck in the gate. I just told him ""look man your kid ran through other kids and got his head stuck while we were focused on the ride"". He then procceeded to yell at me until my manager came and eventually got escorted out. 

Another time I was working on a rocking boat ride. You can't bring loose articles on the ride (bags, hats, cups, etc.). A lady and her daughter come through the gate and I inform them that she needs to either leave her bag upfront or leave it with someone off the ride. She then yells at me saying it has her military ID in the bag and you cant take my bag thats illegal. Called my manager and they told her the same thing, to which she then stormed off.

Last one is I was working a small ferris wheel type ride that has six pods and 3 seats in each pod. After the ridd was loaded and started, these kids started to take their seat belts up and shake the ride. They almost tipped out while we were bringing them down. They were kicked out foe the huge headache and heart attack they caused."

"No where in that story did Rowling try and say he was a good person, or that what he did absolved him of his crimes. He was who he was. He did good things, and he did bad things. Regardless of whether you feel his love for Lily was an obsession, or unhealthy, the fact of the matter was that when he found out what was going on he decided he didn't want any part of Voldemort anymore. Yes, he selfishly asked Voldemort to spare Lily, but when that didn't work he told Dumbledore. He put the whole thing in motion to protect them all. And then, when it didn't work he stayed to fight the good fight. After she died Snape's part was one of revenge.

And yes, he was a bully. He bullied children, and that's fucked up. But after GoF he went back to Lord fucking Voldemort every day and had to convince him that he was on the his side. The greatest dark wizard in history, and an accomplished Legilimens. How do you think that cat knew every time someone was lying to him? And what happened to them? Usually they died.

So bitter old man or not, he risked life and limb to make sure that Voldemort was finished. He was bitter. He was abusive and cruel. But he was a hero nonetheless. Without him Harry probably wouldn't have made it to the end. All heroes aren't good, gallant people with hearts of gold who always make the right decisions. "

"As cartitledallas said, VSCO is pretty much a photo-editing platform. Concept behind it is that the photos on VSCO are ""artsy"". What that means is girls will post sexually provocative photos of themselves, such as pics of them in their underwear or bikini, closeups of their boobs or hips, pics of their nipples through clothes, pics of them teasing by covering just enough of themselves up so you cant see anything and sometimes even flat out nudity. Or otherwise they just post erotic pics or phrases they find online. I'm pretty sure most of the girls in my grade were underage when they started (grade 11) and if I remember correctly the grade 10's were doing it too.

Of course not all the girls (and guys) were/are doing it, and some more and worse than others."

"This is not only ingrained in our psyche, but also our political process. The primary process is fundamentally structured to achieve division in politics. 

Consider this, the general population can be (roughly) plotted on a normal bell curve. Most people are somewhere towards the middle, and the extreme hardliners are actually a small portion of the population. In a primary, the people most likely to vote are the ones that lie on an inverted bell curve. The more extreme your views, the more likely you are to appeal to those that identify strictly with either party. This means that the candidates in the general election do not accurately represent the population, but the general population is forced to choose between them. 

If a candidate said that they were ideoligically​ opposed to abortion and don't believe that it should be legal in a civilized society, but that every parent who has a child should be entitled to sufficient basic income to care for that child, they would get eaten alive in the primary for either party.  That view is much more conducive to discussion and lawmaking than what we have today. 

The ability to recognize the give and take of these complex social issues is key to solving them. For now though, we have party dictatorship on both sides. It's how we got the ACA (for it's good and bad, but it was forced upon the people with minimal compromise or public comment) with complete Democratic support and none from the other side, and it's how the Republicans want to reverse it and screw millions of people again. As long as looking good to your base is how you get on a ballot, nothing is likely to change. "

"It's not about whether you might do something.  Maintaining romantic love over a lifetime is hard, hard work.  Part of that is understanding that you will both develop little crushes and infatuations with other people here and there, but that what you have is ultimately much more fulfilling and healthy.  When that happens, mature adults put extra effort into loving the one they're with, and part of that is actively resisting the urge to think about another person that way. Because you would never want your person to feel the pain of suspecting you were thinking about someone else that way."

As someone who majored in mathematics and has a masters, getting over the boredom was half the battle, you start to realize how cool the concepts can be. Calculus is well within the reach of a lot of people, just isn't being taught well. Limits for example, can be easily demonstrated to people if taught correctly, e.g. using polygons to fill a circle with infinitely many sides. Most people understand that but teachers don't teach it that way. They do it with functions etc. A lot of the problem is mathematics is communicated badly and by people that are gifted in mathematics e.g they get concepts easily but ignore the fact that others don't  (doesn't mean that they are bad at math, just not professors).

She was at least an 8 and very enthusiastic about hooking up with me, but I could tell she was going to stalk the fuck out of me if I ever brought her back to my place. The amount of personal questions that would give her a detailed picture of my life made me feel uneasy. Decided ""fuck it"" and ghosted her one day. She sent me at least 4 messages a day for about two weeks afterwards, most of which made me realize I dodged a fucking cannonball.

"I was at my ex's (gf at the time) house one night. This house is the only house at the top of a hill, pretty far away from other houses or a town. Gets pretty dark at night. She starts telling me about an encounter she had when she was a kid. She had woken up in the middle of the night, and saw a person outside her bedroom window. This person appeared to be completely dark. Like, darker than shadow. But somehow, she said, she could see it was a man and he was smiling. This man reached in and tried to grab her through the window. The window was right above her bed, so he could've grabbed her by the throat. She was so scared, she passed out. When she woke up the next morning, nothing had happened. 

Now, I don't believe it was anything supernatural. Maybe it was sleep paralysis, maybe it was a very realistic nightmare. But right as she finished the story, the power went out in her house. It was pretty spooky."

It's not generally something a normal, mentally healthy child does. But agaaaain, that's what therapy is for. Neither of the parents caught these red flags. Christ. Like I said below, I hope this woman gets herself some help in her adult life provided she realizes where any depression or anxiety may be coming from.

"Man. I wanted to like this movie so bad. 

And I did like a lot of it - I never could have imagined that a big-budget dieselpunk blockbuster would get greenlit, so it was an absolute delight to see such a niche genre get time on the big screen. Jude Law is flawless as always. The plot isn't groundbreaking or memorable, but it's serviceable for an engaging action romp. Great visuals, and I honestly really dig the over-the-top filtering. All around, definitely a worthy cult classic.

But I absolute cannot ever watch it again because my blood pressure was through the roof the entire time, and whenever Gwyneth Paltrow appeared on screen I wanted to stab a pencil through my skull. I usually like Paltrow, but holy fucking shit, this has got to be the most nails-on-chalkboard infuriating performance that has ever been memorialized on film. It drives me completely *berserk*.

"When I was little I used to be exceedingly paranoid, to the point where I would bathe with the door open. I personally blame it on my brother who loved to freak me out. He would constantly bullshit 10 year old me with stories about dreaming of people at the window looking in. I know now that most of this was fake but at the time, I didn't. I was bathing with the door open per usual, soaking up the warmth around me and enjoying myself. What happened next I don't expect the majority of you to believe, maybe I was getting tired or something, but as I looked out into the hallway that my bathroom lead out into, I shit you not I saw a Greyson white figure hobble past the door. Naturally, I started crying and when my parents called out to see what was wrong I told them what happened and that I wasn't leaving until one of them got me. 

Cut to 5 years later. I'm living a normal life, nothing weird has happened since then (save for the onset of some very mild clinical depression). I'm staying at my friends summer home in Palm Springs for a night. I dose of surprisingly quick for sleeping on a futon, and that's when I have that dream. I wake up in my own bed at home, except everything is off. The only way I can describe it is as the dark blue light filling the room having its own viscosity. It's like it was coating the room as opposed to filling it. Then things get weird. I see from the hallway that my room is connected, a grayish figure hobble into my room. 

Lanky or gangly doesn't even begin to describe this thing. It looked like someone with the build of a basketball player had been starved to death, brought back and starved again. I couldn't see it's face from where I was, and frankly, I didn't want to. It waddle its way over to my bookshelf, opposite of where I was facing, and just sorta crawled up it and clung there. It looked down at me and asked me with a voice that sounded more like it was coming from across a street than across a room, ""what are you doing?"". The voice was concerned, and at the time I didn't think about responding,(I'm used to just viewing my dreams as opposed to taking part in them). For some reason I didn't feel scared, and it proceeded to tell me it's job was to watch me. I opened my eyes and saw it was about 4am. I was relieved to be back in my friends bed and clung to the pillow because it was nice to feel something soft in my arms after that. Only now have I connected the possibility that that thing was the same as the one I saw when I was little. It doesn't end there.

I'm not a very superstitious person, so I'm sure you all can understand how confused and worried I was by this. I had a chat with one of my friends who was more educated in the occult about it and they couldn't give me an answer. But did offer to perform a banishment ritual which I politely refused. A few days later, I was drifting off to sleep when I heard what I can only describe as either trilling or really weird laughter (think turkey noises). I immediately recognized the far off voice, but again did nothing. I felt myself being grabbed by the upper arms and lifted up, but being dropped onto my bed. I then felt it happen again, but this time I was dropped onto the floor. I assumed I was dreaming and went back to sleep. I woke up the next morning next to my bed on the hardwood. I hadn't sleep walked in about 3 years. But assumed it was that. I went into the restroom to freshen up for the day and found red marks around my shoulder areas, where I remembered being picked up by.

I don't claim this story to be 100% PrOF GOSTS ARE REEL. All this could easily be me just having some strange dreams, but that didn't make it any less scary to go through.


Tldr: I saw some spooky dream stuff.

"That was my last job. Between my first interview and my hiring, i saw about 20 employees coming and going. After my hire, i only saw 8 of them regularly.

Working with records also showed proof of even more people who had been ""purged"" from office conversation, some having been fired the week before i joined, including my predecessor. The core 4 employees had been around for anywhere from 10 to 30 years, and everyone else had only been there less than a year.

"That's not the explanation though. No scientist is saying, there was nothing, then there was something. That's religions claim. There was nothing, then god made everything. You simply don't understand the science behind ""nothing"". Which is fine because there is no proven theory on what proceeded the big bang... yet. What is nothing though? Everything in our universe was contained within an extremely small point, but is everything in our universe *everything*? Is our universe the only universe? Could two universes have collided? If there are multiple universes then what is out side of those universes? These are the questions that science asks, when they reach a point where they don't have an answer... they say ""i dont know"" Then they go about trying to find the answer. When religion reaches a question without an answer, they say ""god did it"" and rest their case.

As for your ideas about abiogenesis, again this is a question without an answer... yet. ""But even in the most controlled, contrived conditions, we can't figure out how... that might happen"" You could say this about lightning before we knew the science behind that, or about microscopic organisms or any manner of things before science advanced to a point of figuring out the answer to problems that had stumped us for quite some time. As humans we have, if we're really lucky, 100 years time. The Earth has been around for 4 and a half billion. Some things just aren't easy to understand with tests we can run. Do you have 300 million years to run an experiment in the lab? To see what happens to chemical reactions over that time span that may cause replication? Is the answer we're looking for in physics or biology? Is it a result of entropy or counter to it? Questions that don't have answers doesn't therefore imply god. That'd be like seeing a UFO, Unidentified you have no idea what it is... therefore it's an alien spaceship from another galaxy. If you don't know what something is, you don't know what something is. The very nature of not understanding something means nothing other then you don't understand that thing. Trying to then apply an answer because of your lack of knowledge is not logical in the least.

There's nothing wrong if your hypothesis for the creation of life and the cause of the bigbang is a god. Now you just have to prove it. That's how science works. You can surmise string theory is an explanation for quantum mechanics and there are 11 dimensions, but no one is going to say it's a fact until it is rigorously proven. God isn't the only theory that is held to a standard."

"This one is a bit niche, but there's a shitty little movie out there called The Secret Village.

It actually had some promise. The movie was building up to have an interesting twist, with a cult, paranormal stuff.

The movie is about a reporter who investigates a small that had repeated plagues of Ergot poisoning over the years. Ergot is a fungus that lives on grain and when consumed can cause psychosis and mania in a person. So, this reporter uncovers a cult, then there's some paranormal shit that happens and the movie builds up to OH SHIT A CULT THIS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT!

A really good movie... Until the last 10 fucking minutes happened.

It turns out, NONE OF THE CULT SHIT, NONE OF THE PARANORMAL SHIT, ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOTHING HAPPENED DURING THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE BECAUSE THE MAIN CHARACTER WAS SUFFERING FROM FUCKING ERGOT POISONING.

It has been almost 4 years since I seen that movie. AND I'M STILL FUCKING ANGRY ABOUT IT."
"...I'm probably not the best person to use as an example because I am mentally not much of an adult ._. 

I love Disneyworld primarily for 2 reasons: because the people there are universally kind, understanding, and patient with everybody from all walks of life, and because every single image, scene, and character there has been familiar to me since I came out of the womb. I was born knowing Disney. I've been watching Disney movies since I was 2. Maybe before that. My earliest memories involve sitting on the floor in the living room watching Snow White, Cinderella, the Lion King, and Aladdin. The world itself is unpredictable, unnerving, and I don't know a damn thing about it. But I know about the world of Disney. I know all its people. I know how to navigate it perfectly. I grew up knowing that. And if Disneyworld is made to be a perfect representation of the world of Disney in real life, then on my Disney trips, navigating around it just seems like second nature to me. I know the people--I grew up knowing the princesses, and Buzz Lightyear, and Lilo and Stitch, and Mickey and Minnie. If I approach someone dressed as Mickey or Minnie and start talking to them, I know how they're going to respond, because I know how they respond in the Mickey and Minnie cartoons I've been watching for 24 and a half years, and their job is to respond like the real characters in the cartoons would respond. I can talk to Aladdin and Jasmine freely without feeling awkward or without feeling like one of them is going to be weirded out by something I say, because I grew up ""knowing"" Aladdin and Jasmine, and how they act and how they would respond to someone like me, through the movies the actors are being paid to ""make real."" There's no awkwardness, no stumbling over words, no getting nervous and looking away from them because I ""said something stupid."" There is no ""saying something stupid."" 

Nobody has ever been as kind or patient with me and my eccentricities as they have been at Disneyworld. I do have trouble with things like standing in long lines, but I'm not considered handicapped enough to get a line-skip pass. This does lead to spazzy behavior in long, crowded, hot lines waiting for Space Ranger Spin or whatever. What ALWAYS happens is that a cast member sees me behaving erratically, approaches me, doesn't even ASK me why I'm flapping my hands or bouncing up and down or darting my eyes all over the place. Just goes, ""Don't worry, just a little while longer!"" and engages me in some conversation, about the ride or about the movie the ride is on, and then we just stand there talking about Toy Story and all the cool shit Buzz Lightyear has ever done and I sort of forget about the line entirely. One time when we were taking the boat over to Magic Kingdom from Fort Wilderness, I got a little scared because boats weren't my thing back then and I was worried it was going to break down. The attendant came over to me, told me exactly what the boat was going to do, exactly how fast we would go, and what would happen if it DID break down. Then, when our boat stalled (because it was passing another boat), of course the first thing out of my mouth was ""OHMYGODDIDITBREAKDOWN?!"" She assured me, ""No, it's not breaking down. We're just waiting for another boat to pass by. It's going to take about 5 to 10 minutes. Are you okay now?"" You don't GET that anywhere else. I've been to other theme parks and other resorts. You just don't GET that kind of patience, personal attention, and care anywhere else. 

Disneyworld is not my home away from home. It IS my home. Unfortunately, I haven't been there in a while and don't know when I'll be back. "

"On one of our trips to WDW pre-kid, Hubs and I were seated about 4-5 seats down from a family of 4 (Mom, Dad, 2 boys about 6-8 yrs old).

I think I watched them more than I paid attention to the actual attraction.

Because as soon as the lights went off and stuff started happening, the kids flipped their shit. Mom is yelling at Dad, one kid is crying, the other screaming.

Somehow, both of the boys managed to wriggle out of the safety harness things they had that sat on your shoulders and were running back and forth between Mom and Dad (they had been seated Dad, boy 1, boy 2, Mom) screaming and freaking out. Mom's STILL yelling at Dad and somehow manages to wriggle out from the shoulder harness. They walk towards the exit and leave. Dad leaves when the show is over and they stood in the gift shop  afterwards screaming at each other.

"I have dated several women, many of which wanted to have sex. My recent ex was very open about wanting to have sex and told me several times. They offered and each time I said no. I have pursued relationships that I wanted to last. Many of my exes broke up with me because I refused to have sex with them. And the reason I said no is because I want my first time to be with someone I can share everything with. I want it to be with that one person that I don't feel like I have to hold back any thing from. 

When I look back at all the times I held back and didn't have sex i am greatful, because each of those women showed me something, they showed me that they couldn't respect my wishes enough to wait till I was comfortable. To wait till I was ready. I am grateful because I wasn't blinded by lust and their faults that would of caused us to separate shown themselves very quickly.

Eh Eragon went to hell after the 2nd book. They could have done 3 movies but the other 2 would have dragged and led to a very unsatisfying ending. A faithful adaptation of the first book would have been an amazing movie and the other movies would have sold tickets based on the hype from the first movie alone but I think fans would be just as disappointed in the end either way. At least they didn't spend 6 years and 4 movies on a story that ultimately didn't deserve it.

"I can only answer from my personal experience wrestling in the Houston, TX area. In Texas, competition is separated in to girls and boys wrestling, but practices were together. Partners for practice sometimes mixed for drilling but mostly did not. For ""live"" wrestling, groups in the lower weights frequently mixed. Our school had about 30 wrestlers on the mat for practice, around 8-12 of which were girls. Wrestling girls in practice was not awkward, especially after your first time. If you were good enough at wrestling, then, in my experience, anything that could become weird was subconsciously avoided; any action that did become weird was ignored by both parties or followed by a quick ""sorry"" or ""my bad"" and action carried on. Positions like [this](https://photos.smugmug.com/Front-Range-Wrestling/i-hLzvph5/0/51fb31bc/XL/wrestling34-XL.jpg) are a part of wresting and just that, especially with the rise of funk wrestling."

A life is a goddamn life and if you can't respect it, don't bother interacting with it. Cause city or country, if you can't treat lives with respect and just shrug and move on with it because ""It's just an animal"", you have a lack of empathy not some magical super power coping skills. And empathy is NOT a bad thing to have.      

I know for a fact it's one of the major things missing in many people. Rural communities,  in my experience,  seem to be really bad about it. Oh they have empathy, for their own. If you're not part of their family, they don't give two shits about you. ""Why should i...."" I hear that sooooooo much.

Meanwhile the kid is still starving cause his parents suck and the why should I crowd won't help him either.

"I grew up in a gently haunted house. Built in the 1870s. I went home by myself, which was a cross-country trip. My parents were no longer living full-time in my childhood home, instead traveling during the summer and winter. So, I was in the house alone, probably to go through stuff to bring back with me.

The wooden floors creaked anywhere you walked. I was standing in the den (just a room off the living room) downstairs, looking through a book I was trying to decide if I wanted to keep. At the same time I was passively enjoying the comforting sounds of footsteps overhead. 

I stopped and realized what was happening. I was alone. I remember looking up at the ceiling, listening to the footsteps peacefully pad around, and smiling. Normally this sort of thing would have had me booking a hotel room, but it had the opposite effect: it was such a familiar sound to me, it was so peaceful and made me feel like someone was happy I was back."

"As someone who has experience working with different color models and graphics software, setting the Red channel in an RGB picture to zero will get you nothing close to what a dog (or a red-green colorblind person) would see. By your reasoning, if an animal does not have any color receptors at all, they would see black instead of in grayscale. Instead, a crude representation of what a dog sees is to take the Red and Green channels, take their average, then put that average back into the Red and Green channels. The resulting picture will have yellow-blue hues only along with (distorted) brightness or luminosity information.

Here's proof: http://dog-vision.com/ has an example of what a human would see versus what a dog would see. I took the original image from there and did it your way and my way. Here's what I got:

* The [original image](https://dog-vision.com/images/RagVag.jpg).
* [Image](http://i.imgur.com/idHlXPJ.jpg) with Red set to 0.
* [Image](http://i.imgur.com/SDZ6Wgv.jpg) with Red and Green averaged.^(*Not an exact average since I did this quick 'n' dirty but something close to it.)

As you can see, the second image still has green (which dogs can't see!) and it is considerably darkened. The third image has only yellow and blue hues, retains the original's brightness, and is a close match for the dog vision image from the aforelinked website.

That's two 1""x1"" pieces of plastic having plastic caps over the positive lug and starter wire. But they probably just eliminated it in later production.That motor was 15 years old at the time. 

I figured this out because they had the same part number on the fiche and I found it cheaper at a tractor supplier than the marine dealer.

"I just *love* how everybody's equating letting a child touch a tablet with kids who have no idea how to self-entertain.  My toddler loves her tablet, and she spends time on it, but she also spends time sticking duplos together, or running around in circles until she falls over, or unloading the contents of every drawer in the house (that's her current favorite hobby. Thankfully sometimes she loads them back in again.) She plays ""normally"" a lot, and loves the park, and loves camping, and does all that shit too.  It's not like handing a kid a tablet destroys their ability to do anything else."

What happens when your friendship doesn't override what they want?

"OK, so, I took this class called African politics.  The class had like maybe fifteen kids, POSSIBLY twenty, but I doubt it.  I go to a small college but it was a tiny class.  Most of the kids were from Africa and so was the professor, go figure.

He was REALLY hard to understand, first off.  He talked really, really, really fast, he mumbled, and then when you add in his accent, I could barely understand what he was saying--and I wasn't the only one.

He NEVER followed the syllabus.  Ever.  One time I missed one (1) class, and when I arrived the next time (it was MWF) we had a presentation.  What was on the syllabus was DISCUSSION, or something like that.  For a week straight of classes all we did was watch Hotel Rwanda, which I ought to be angry about but it filled me with relief because I didn't have to dread showing up.  He would make us do ""discussions"" randomly (again, off-syllabus) where we'd get in a circle and he'd just point at someone and have them talk about the textbook but, like, AS we were actively reading it aloud.  How??

He would assign essays without warning and give us very little time to research and do them.  Like I could come in on Monday and find out that Friday I had a twelve page paper due on some random topic.  And he did that SEVERAL times.  It was so frustrating.

I had a friend who took his class and in the syllabus it says that you don't get penalised for not showing up, and my friend never showed up because the class was terrible like mine and a morning one, and he ended up getting a C because his attendance was low, HAHA.

He was also batshit crazy??  No, seriously.  He would take chalk and throw it into the air as he talked and then it would just escalate until he rubbed chalk on his hands and then all over his face and the top of his head and he'd eat it, too.  THIS SOUNDS LIKE I'M MAKING IT UP--I'M NOT.

To cap it off, I had a twenty page paper due in lieu of a final exam, and I got a C or C- on it for a variety of frustrating reasons, one of which stands out to me.  He had marked BBC News as a ""not credible"" source.  I was just happy to pass and NEVER EVER  EVER have to deal with him again.  I usually leave positive feedbacks for professors at the end of term, even if I hated them or their class or both, but I rated him negatively.  And his rate my professor page is abysmal, full of complaints just like what I experienced.

I was beyond furious with my advisor for warning me that this guy's class was ""challenging"".  There's a difference between ""challenging"" and ""motherfucking insane""."

It's also probably a lower volume item, which increases the per unit cost. It could even be that the more expensive item is essentially subsidizing the less expensive one, i.e. the ones that fail certification get remanufactured or relabeled for sale in less demanding environments.

"It is very difficult to beat any addiction with willpower alone. Addiction is generally caused by an underlying problem, with overeating a common issue for people is low self-esteem. Your attitude of believing all people with a weight issue are simply lacking willpower and need to 'just eat less' is pretty reductionist and a bit ignorant honestly. 

To properly treat addiction, the underlying cause needs to be treated rather than the actions of the addiction. Think of it like taking pain killers to stop a stomach ache when the pain is actually being caused by a stomach ulcer - you're only making it worse by treating the symptom.

I personally find that people who struggle with maintaining a healthy weight often need supportive counselling and mental health therapy alongside traditional weight-loss techniques of exercise and calorie-counting. Without tackling the cause, many people will struggle immensely and have more severe relapses. People with weight issues deserve to be treated with a bit more compassion.

"I wrote a parody of horrible fan fiction, where Harry realized he was in a fan fiction and things weren't how they should be and he was constantly fighting to fix it. The ending (which I never wrote) involved them annoying the author (who was a teenaged girl) into self inserting into the story to try make things be the way she wanted, then they beat her to death and the entire story stopped existing once they killed her. It was also strongly suggested the person writing this fanfiction was Tara, the author of My Immortal. I referred to the author as a ""troll from Dubai"" at one point.

In retrospect, it doesn't actually make much sense, but it wasn't supposed to. People who saw it liked it, even if I had a problem with using references no actual 15 year old fanfiction writer would have used. (References to St. Elsewhere and cough drop commercials from the 80s, for instance.)

there is not much difference in quality between cheap and slightly more expensive.

And there might a a quality difference for high priced brand stuff.. but in my experience not as much as you have to pay more for it.

My best example are shoes.
I can buy Nike for around 100€ or imitated nikes (legal imitated.. so they look a bit like nikes but not enough to be a legal issue ;)) for 25€.

Those shoes must at least live 4 times as long as the cheap shoes, which they don't in my experience. And if the fashion change your are stuck with your high priced shoes ;)"

"How to fight. 

Nothing will ever give you a greater sense of confidence than knowing that you can do what you were made to do. 

It'll help you for the obvious reason of should you ever need to fuck someone up in self-defense, but also helps you develop a level of gameness in your character. That grit applies to all things in life. You'll notice that when you learn to fight you're all of a sudden a lot less tense when you go out in public because you know you can handle yourself. You're not afraid of the opinions of those around you. 

Knowing how to fight has saved my ass, and helped me save many other people in shitty situations before. 

Although some would argue to the practicality of certain styles, I'd say Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Muay Thai is the great go-to combination, but if you want you can take up boxing since it's the least expensive yet you'll still learn to use your hands to fuck another dude up and get toughened up by learning to take a hit and hit back.

"I spent some time in Sudan about 20 years ago. One day I was outdoors in a very poor town on a hot day (especially for a European from a temperate climate). It was 45C and I was suffering, standing waiting for two Sudanese people I was working with to finish discussing something. A poorly dressed man noticed and decided I needed a cold drink. (Even in very poor places Coke is surprisingly available but is a luxury). I was mortified when he paid for one and insisted I take it. It would have cost a significant amount of money for him and I, shamefully, may well have had the equivalent of his annual income in dollars in my wallet. I knew enough about the tradition of hospitality to travelers and strangers in muslim countries to accept gratefully (he beamed).

A kind stranger is one thing. A very poor stranger making such a sacrifice was touching, humbling and a reminder I've never forgotten of how much more generous we could be. 

I have traveled in many muslim countries and encountered kindness, hospitality and graciousness in all of them, but that man stays with me."

Well, the first two times I wore it out of my apartment, I was scrutinized like a new animal in a zoo. People staring at me, from head-to-toe, as they walked past. Mutters and glances on the trains. I felt like an alien. No one smiling at me, no acknowledgement of a foreigner trying to assimilate or at least get in touch with their culture...nothing.

He was in The Gap looking at clothes when a woman walked in with her bachelorette party. This guy was going through a time where he wanted to just open himself up to others through good deeds. He decided to pull a random act of kindness. He talked with them and told the lucky lady, ""I'm so happy for you. I want to do something nice for you. Pick any one item in the store. It's on me. Congratulations!"" At that moment, she broke down into tears. He didn't know this, but she fell on really hard times. ""Well, I thought I could bring a little light into your life."" ""What did you say?"" ""What, I thought I would just bring a little light into your life."" ""You said light... Last night I was by my bed and I was praying to God for just something good to happen.

 And in my family most of the women (my mom, aunts, grandmothers) focused on families and not careers. Some entered the workforce when their kids were older, but many did not. No one ever said to me, ""you have to have kids,"" but when I was younger it just seemed like something that was expected. Grow up, go to college, get married, have kids.

"Yep. Irish here and you only really take your shoes off here if they are wet or dirty, or if you are going onto nice carpet. Sure it rains a lot, but unless you were splashing around in mud or puddles, most people would be happy if you just wiped your shoes on the mat. Most houses are designed with the downstairs being wood/tile or other easy-to-clean waterproof surfaces, with the possible exception of ""the good room"".

The houses that demand you take off your shoes are usually the ones with bossy or overly-clean people. Most people don't care so long as you stay off the carpet, which most people do. Taking your shoes off without an excuse (They're wet/dirty) is pretty unusual. People in the countryside are probably more likely to ask, but you're also more likely to be walking in mud.

This comes up a lot, but the only person I know that cares is my aunt, and she's the ""clean freak"" of the family. When I grew up my Dad was constantly working and he or the dogs are tracking in dirt so he doesn't care. People wear shoes everywhere. He just cleans up the dirt."

It's a lot of feeling trapped, feeling like you're not doing enough, feeling under appreciated for the things that you know you put work into.

It of course isn't all bad. You get to see their happiness and it makes you happy. You see that they genuinely need you and it makes you feel like you have worth. They love you unconditionally and when you fuck up, they forgive you long before you learn to forgive yourself. It's a love that you can't experience unless you have kids and it's a love that will both keep you going when your life is falling apart while also maybe being the reason your life is falling apart.

It's a lot of things, but it isn't glamorous."

"&gt; Mormons being nice

In Southeast Idaho if you were not a Mormon your kids were not allowed to play with the Mormon kids.    

They made it so you couldn't sell hard liquor at the bars (Beer only bars) and then proceeded to have cops sit outside and bust everyone leaving until they all went out of business except one.  

While they seem nice enough the constant talk of killing Obama got old fast.  

They seem friendly enough until you realize they have a stranglehold on the schools and local government and if you were not with them you were against them.  

They seem smart enough until your daughter comes home to explain they had an anti-masturbation rally at the high school and told all the kids if they look at porn they will become mass murderers.  

They seem spiritual enough until you see how some bishops are total assholes and do things like ask your daughters if they masturbate, how often, and what do they think about while they do it.  

They seem almost normal until you study their religion and realize they believe that God came down and had physical sex with Mary to produce Jesus (sorry no immaculate conception) which according to their own theology is his daughter.  This is important because they have some of the highest molestation rates of any religion.

I am sure why I just ranted about Mormons is because I just lived 5 years in hell with them and saw first hand how destructive their monoculture is.  

My father was born and raised Mormon and so was my wife and her family so I know the difference between a SE Idaho Mormon and a NW Mormon from Washington.  

When they run the show like they did in SE Idaho it really is no different than sharia law where everyone is always looking over their shoulder and trying to hide their lives from everyone else for fear they will be turned in to the church authority.  

Their thin smiles are just a show and the masks they wear and fake high pitched voices the women talk in as their husbands abuse them every night was a little too much for me.  So glad to be away from them.

I still can't tell the difference between what that rapist is doing and when someone is just trying to make friends with you.  From the scenario he set up, it seems vastly more likely to me that he just wanted to get to know her better and was looking for an excuse to talk to her and interact with her.  Which is to say, I would have fallen for it too.  I don't see what's inherently untrustworthy about it.  I guess there might be something that's a red flag but I don't know what it is?"

"I'm a liberal and I absolutely reject Trump's policy but I have come to a conclusion: Trump will most likely win in 2020.

Why? Incumbent US Presidents very rarely don't get (re)elected. Remember Bush in '04? He was seen as incompetent and dishonest, while John Kerry was seen as a experienced, well educated, smart politician - but he lost. Why did he lose? Because people get used to the policy of a president in four years. By 2020 people will say ""Well, Trump's not great but, I don't know, why should we elect another guy? Meh, I'm gonna vote for Trump."". The other thing is that the democrats have big problems in finding a suitable candidate for 2020. They need a POPULAR and not an experienced politician. After all, why did Clinton lose last year? Because she had the charm of an angry king cobra. Many of you may think that Bernie Sanders should run in 2020. I really like Sanders but there is one big problem: Sanders can't make a good and modern campaign. He is just a too good person to fight Donald Trump in a debate. Remember Mike Dukakis in 1988? He was very popular and competent but lost by a huge margin against Bush because he didn't know what to do when the other side is attacking him. I think the same thing would happen to Bernie.

The other thing is the democratic party itself. They don't seem to have a vision for the US, they don't seem to care about worker's wages but rather about pronouns and transgender bullshit. Try to explain a young family with a baby where the parents work on minimum wage how important a third bathroom for transsexual people in a restaurant is. Blue wave in 2018? No, they will win seats but they are not going to have the majority in the house and senate.

And finally a third thing: democrats have forgotten that they can win the presidency without Ohio and Florida. Trump is 100% going to win Ohio and Florida in 2020 but the democrats don't need those two states to win the election. If you would ask me how to beat Trump in 2020, I would say:""Beat him with his own method"". Instead of focusing on Ohio / Florida, democrats should heavily campaign in Virginia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Do the math: with all the other safe blue states the democrats have 279 electoral votes. The times when Virginia, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico guaranteed voted for GOP are over. If Clinton did what I just wrote down, she would have won the election but no, let's spend a shitload of money into two states that we don't need to win and where the polls have suggested, that Trump is going to win.

The only way how the democrats can make Trump a one-term president is another Ross Perot. A strong, third party candidate in 2020 who can get around 5-10% of republican's votes would crash Trump's campaign in 2020. "

"12 years a slave. One of the most engrossing movies I've ever seen, down to the sounds of insects in the fields. Steve McQueen is a brilliant director.

I think it also highlights a really missed point about slavery; how complicated it was. Slavery is evil, so it's easy to have the mindset that everyone who had slaves was evil, but this wasn't the case. Solomon actually praises his first master, master Ford, in his book. There were some nice, moral people who owned saves and did so because they thought god allowed them to. "

It's pretty dumb but at the time I felt bizarrely like shit because of it. Like dude, boundaries. 

EDIT: And also somebody punched me hard in the gut with a running start while I was at a zombie run on the zombie side of things. For whatever reason that came to mind last even though that was a much more unpleasant experience being as how it was crazy hot and we were all covered in this disgusting chocolate syrup fake blood and then somebody fucking sucker punched me.

His reasoning? He hasn't found a partner that matches him. To some your first kiss can be a big deal, to others...""meh"". But focus on finding someone you like, develop a nurturing relationship, then you can get all the kisses you want. So basically, find a girlfriend (or boyfriend...whichever gender or however you swing) and develop a relationship with them. But don't rush into that relationship. I'm only trying to make sure you do right where I did wrong. Your first kiss should come naturally with a partner you love and cherish. Cheers and the best of luck!

You will learn about the worst parts of who you are as a person. You will feel terrible about losing your cool and yelling at your child is the worst thing ever!

* Crowdfund is hugely successful, he is able to be taken to the U.S.
* At this point, the condition is too far spread for any form of treatment, well developed or in infancy, to have any effect.
* Now, with Charlie not being able to be treated, he is held at a U.K. hospital against the will of the parents due to some U.K. laws.

My white makeup was also Halloween makeup topped with baby powder.

It also ignores that some relationships are burning piles of garbage, and people use 'they cheated!' as a get out of jail free card for anything and everything wrong. It's a free pass to lay 100% of the blame for everything wrong on the other person.

You shouldn't do it, obviously. You should never deceive, lie to, and hurt someone with whom you are supposed to have a profound trust and honesty, but there's a lot more reasons that it happens than every single person that does it has is just 100% a bad person and will always cheat on everyone always.

"I know that I am wayyyy too late to this thread, but here it goes...

I worked at a small amusement park in Northwest Georgia. 

I was a purveyor of a frozen treat called Dippin' Dots (""The Ice Cream of the Future™!). 

Our most popular flavor was Rainbow Ice. It, unlike the other flavors, was non-dairy. Consequently, it thawed at a different rate than the other dairy-based flavors.

We stored our Dippin' Dots in a storage room at the front of the park, and my stand was about a five minute walk from it. In the hot Georgia summers, especially if we had to re-stock midday, sometimes the product would thaw just a little prior to being re-frozen when we put it back into the freezers in the stand.

Rainbow Ice thawed the most. 

The more thawed bags of Rainbow Ice took a LOT of time and effort to break up properly-- when it re-froze, it wasn't all in little frozen balls, but more in 'clumps'. It could sometimes take a full minute just to break it up and pour enough for a single cup.

Enter angry, overheated parent, on the Fourth of July (our busiest day).

&gt; ""Hello, we would like seven large Rainbow Ices, please""

&gt; Absolutely! Just so you know, it'll take a few extra minutes to pour-- would you mind stepping to the side? 

&gt; ""No, we'll wait-- we've been in this line forever! I never would have though it would take this long just to pour some frozen dots in a cup.""

&gt; Okay, that's fine! 

It the takes a while to pour the first seven, probably closer to five minutes. I apologize a few times, try to make light of the situation, and she sees us just _struggling_ to break up the chunks into nice little frozen sherbert pellets. After filling up six 8 oz. cups... 

&gt; Ma'am, we actually can only make you six cups, is there any other flavor you might be interested in? 

The woman explodes. Like, knocks the napkin dispenser on the ground, screams, pushes our drink cart towards the lake behind us...

If you want to have an expensive wedding - pay for it! Don't make your wedding party pay for stuff. 
"I wanted him to go to sleep at the same time as me every night so we could cuddle, talk as we fell asleep, etc. For some reason when I got married this was my parents' marriage advice to us, ""always go to sleep together"". 

However, I work first shift and he works second shift. So my thinking was, we both sleep from like 12-8, we both wake up, I go to work, he does whatever he needs to (errands etc), then he goes to work and I come home and do whatever I need to, then we have dinner together and go to sleep and it starts over. 

But he just doesn't wake up until he needs to. He just doesn't. He is incapable of waking up when I wake up and staying awake. So inevitably this led to him sleeping until he needed to get up for work, then staying up a little later that night, sleeping a little more the next day, staying up a little later, etc...

In our first year or two of marriage I took it as an offense. Like, ""why don't you love me enough to just wake up?"" Then ultimately I came to my senses and realized it had nothing to do with him loving me or not and everything to do with whether he was sleepy in the 2 seconds after his alarm went off and he snoozed it. Like, it wasn't a conscious decision. Could he probably decide to get up, if he really wanted to, yeah, but I can't change him, I can only change me.  

Now we intentionally go snuggle and talk and stuff before I have to go to bed, and then if he wants to get back up and go out of our bedroom and stay up later then that's fine with me. Or, I stay up later, sleep like 3-8, do work, and then take a big nap in the afternoon. I'm cool with either one depending on the day/workload. 

Anyway, sorry that's not exactly a big dramatic fight! We never really yelled about it or whatever but we just kinda had like 10 calm discussions about it until I was like ""alright this works for us and that's fine"". "

"The abridged series actually has character development, some pretty damn deep one at that. They stick to the rules of their universe and make a good effort at integrating the game aspect of SAO to the world. 
They completely rehash otherwise cliche characters and minor side pieces into actually people/and or more believable tropes within the confines of the universe. I think it's hard to compare the two to be completely honest.

"There are a handful of people in mky life who's personality have changed, me included but the more drastic ones I can list are the ff:

* Guy I dated after his dad died, pretty much almost overnight became and started acting like his dad...even his dad's eccentricities and crazy beliefs that he used to opposed he now follows.

* Ex friend of mine in college.  Maybe this was her real personality all along but she became an extreme social climber, dropping friends who arent pretty enough or not in the IT or celebrity crowd.  I worry she may push these values now on her young daughter. 

* A friend of mine the year he turned 30. He was a huge EDM, Rave and Coachella person. Had all the passes to the coolest music festivals and such. The year he turned 30 within a few weeks he was out of it, physically. H e couldnt keep up any longer.  He also used to hate...absolutely HATE cats, now he watches cat videos online for fun and has started taking care of 3."

I find it very helpful to compartmentalize my life like this.  I dunno if it's super healthy or what but I definitely leave work problems at work, and home problems at home, I keep my life with my parents/siblings/aunts/uncles/cousins separate from my life with my  bowling friends, separate from my life with my gaming friends, etc.

I like that after a stressful day at work, I can go out and see my friends and they don't care what's going on and we can just talk about baseball or how terrible we are at games or Game of Thrones or whatever and just pretend that my friend isn't going through a rough divorce or I didn't have some guy calling me a liar pretty much all week at work or whatever.

It used to drive my girlfriend insane though because I flat out refuse to talk or think about work when I'm at home and she wants to talk to me about my day.  We compromise by talking about what I had for lunch and what I talked about with my coworkers.  I understand that she wants to be included in all aspects of my life, but I don't want to have to relive the stress of work when I'm at home.  

So I guess I deal with stress by staying busy with a bunch of different activities and leaving the stress of each in it's respective corner.  "

Yeah it totally sucks that our legal system works better for people who have the money for great lawyers. We need to change that. But that's a seperate issue from if our patent system should be changed. Do you have a well thought out response on how we could change the patent system so that we never had to get to the point where challenging in court was necessary, that wouldn't balloon the cost of how much it takes to patent something? And if we do find that fix, we've only got another thousand fields where the way our legal system works is a problem that needs to be fixed regardless."

She's married w/ kids now, but rocky relationship. We both confess we've spied on each other for years being FB friends, imagining what could've been.

"  For our first dives following training, my wife and I went to Grand Cayman. They showed us a map of the reef area, turn around spot and said they would stay by my wife since she was nervous. They also said at the halfway pint, they'd check everyone's air.  We were on a boat that was rocking due to waves and my wife was getting motion sickness as we waited for all of the other divers to get in (they were all retiree aged and we were trying to be nice). The divemaster told her to go on in and wait for me below.


She goes in and I wait for all others to get in and follow. As soon as I swim down about 30ft to her she is all alone, totally panicked and not using ANY of the hand signals she was taught and we reviewed RIGHT before getting onto the boat. She was just wide-eyed and waving hands frantically. I gave her my spare regulator and she calmed down. I took her main regulator and cleared it. She had vomited into it from the motion sickness and in her panic, forgot how to clear it or to use her spare regulator. Thankfully, a friend had recently told us his story of vomiting into his regulator and how he'd panicked and gone straight to the surface, so she knew at least to try to breathe and not to surface quickly. 


We went on with the dive, never saw the dive master until the end of the dive and nobody's dive computer was checked for remaining air. This was with a highly recommended shop that advertised as a ""we cater to whatever needs you have"". Fuck that, you are on your own and better get good training from the start.


Also, fish love vomit."

"If someone says, in regards to privacy, ""if you have nothing to hide, why are you so scared?"" I usually respond with something like:

Then give me the passwords to your computer, social media accounts, email, etc... heck just give me the key to your house. I'll stop by and browse through all of it. I may even publish anything interesting I find, because you said it yourself, if you have nothing to hide what are you so afraid of? Surely if privacy isn't important then it's ok for the internet to know about the skid marks on your dirty underwear, right?

Privacy is important EVEN IF you have nothing to hide. People need to have space where they can work stuff out, think through things, have conversations and feel free to refine ideas without the overbearing fear of someone else discovering it and being critical. 

How many people would take the time to practice singing in the shower, or dancing in their bedroom, or learn how to play the piano, or learn how to draw if they knew someone was always going to be watching or recording. Perhaps they'll mock you or criticize you, tell you you're stupid, make you want to quit because maybe you aren't good enough... you act differently when you're alone and having this time/place to work through stuff honestly without fear of embarrassment is imperative to individual growth."

I grew out my hair, and then had this thought in middle School, ""if I'm attracted to guys... Shouldn't I act like a guy to attract guys that are into guys?""

That lead to me being more masculine, and by the time I reached high school I was in the closet and trying to get girls with my friends. This made me realize the girls body being kinda sexy, if they're like the supermodels you see online.

So I grew up thinking I was gay, turned out to be bi."

"My friend just left investment banking at a Fortune 500 to pursue another dream on another end of his industry. He sent me the following, and I hope that it's applicable. I don't know anything about that environment, so I'll just give you what I was told:

Don't wear a watch with a metal band at an interview for a corporate job. It shows that you don't need the money, because you're already wearing something expensive. Otherwise, it shows that you like expensive things, so you're likely to gun for the job of the person interviewing you. Wear a leather band, and it will be assumed that there's a story behind why you're wearing it. It also is a good conversation starter in an interview.

"My family had dial up until I was at least 15 years old -- it was the only thing we could get for a long while, as we lived a quarter mile too far out to get anything else at the time. My dad ran a business out of our home, and since he often had to be online and on the phone, we had two phone lines, a landline and a line dedicated to being for Internet and only Internet. That number was never given out to anyone or able to really be looked up -- it was basically forgotten about and no one even knew the number.

A few months before we were able to upgrade our net, my dad got this older rotary style phone from a relative. He wanted to test it out, so he plugged the Internet line into it and called the other home phone for giggles. He forgot to unplug the phone, it was already late and the computers were already off. A little while later, as he and I were sitting on the couch finishing up a movie, the rotary phone starts ringing. We're kinda creeped out, but my dad decides that he'll answer the phone in an old man voice to be goofy because it's probably a telemarketer. The person on the line asks specifically if I was home -- by my nickname (shortened form of my name, but no one would know I went by that unless they knew me). My dad told them no one by that name lived here and hung up. It didn't sound like any of my friends (and no idea how they'd even get that number, the only number I ever gave out to friends was my cell), but also didn't sound like a telemarketer. The phone rung again and my dad decided to just unplug it and a few weeks later he handed it off to a different relative.

Maybe not the creepiest to others, but I have no explanation for it whatsoever and it still creeps me out thinking about that... "

"One time I was sitting at a bus stop. One of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen started talking to me. We hit it off pretty well and just before my stop I barely got enough courage to ask if she'd like to get coffee at the shop near the stop the next day. She responds ""it's a date"". I was so excited I could hardly sleep. The next day I go to the coffee shop early to see her already there with a guy friend. I figured she brought him just in case I was creep or something. I sit down introduce myself and almost right away she says ""do you have a moment to talk about Jesus?"". I responded confused ""but I thought this was a date?"". She apologized but justified it by saying something about saving my soul. I said something about ""Jesus shouldn't need to resort to lies"" and left before they could see me break out in tears.  "

Some shops will have clearance sections for damaged items or items about to expire. My local korger regularly marks canned goods down 50 - 75% for minor dents and dings. 

Use coupons! Just make sure you understand your store's couponing policy. 

Some places will take back and recyle used plastic shopping bags. 

Make friends with the cashier's, sometimes they'll let you in on upcoming sales or coupons you may have missed. Some places will even allow cashiers to add small discounts to items on a case by case basis. 

Store brands are usually cheaper than name brands, just make sure you compare them to make sure you're still getting the same amount of product. 

Off brand drugs are EXACTLY the same as name brand drugs. Just compare the prices and ingredients. 

Check to see if your preferred store has some sort of loyalty program. It can vary from chain to chain, but some of them offer good benefits.  

The busiest days for shopping are Monday, Friday, and Saturday. Mornings, 5 - 6, and before storms. 

If you're a fan of Arizona's famous 99¢ ice tea, or Santita's $2 bags if chips, and you see them being sold for more, you can call the company and they'll force the store to sell them at the correct price."

"My best microwave story is from a while ago. I had what felt like a very painful ear infection and didn't have any way to get any ear drops or anything for it. I looked up some home remedies online as my ear was in a large amount of pain and one website said to heat salt up in a sock and place it on your ear to suck out the moisture. I put the sock and salt in the microwave for about 30 seconds and it didn't feel hot at all so I put it in for another 2 minutes. Two minutes later I open the microwave to a cloud of smoke. Sock was burned, salt was all over and the microwave was permanently stained piss yellow inside for a few years until we bought a new one."

How much I love them
"I think some confusion comes from what we think of as rape - being kidnapped and tied up or roofied- versus what we may actually experience. 

I had a boyfriend who raped me a lot over the period of a few years. It started as him coming to bed at 3am and waking me up for sex. If I said no, he would just calmly keep shaking me and waking me up. If I moved, he would follow me. If I got angry, I was being a child and an irrational and emotional woman and I therefore ""lost"" the argument because I was no longer rational. I was also accused of withholding sex to punish him because I was mad = being a bad person. If I refused, he would keep me up until I had to go to work at 7am (a 12.5 hour shift), asking every few minutes to make sure I wouldn't fall back asleep.

So I would offer sex before I went to bed to avoid this. He would decline every time, and wake me up every time around 3am. Eventually I stopped getting mad and saying no, I just laid there and existed outside of my own head, completely emotionless. It was the only way I would be allowed to sleep. I lived with him and he played a lot of mind games with me so I didn't trust my own instincts on his behavior. Because he didn't yell or get mad, I sincerely didn't think it was rape at the time. "

I tried to remedy this, but occasionally I'd forget and pull all the way in. I'm sorry, but if it's any consolation the fear that would go through me when I didn't immediately see my car and thought someone may have stolen it was punishment enough to keep me from doing it to often."

"I don't know about cars in particular, but lack of ash trays has definitely affected it. When I started smoking there was an ashtray or the like outside of every business. By the time I quit a couple years back they were hard to find. So onto the road they went.

Not like I felt proud about the fact that I was littering, nor did I think it was particularly acceptable that I was doing it, but it didn't bug me enough to carry around foul smelling grody butts in my pocket. And I'd never put out a butt in my car. Even if you smoked in the car you could keep the smell from becoming overpowering by just holding the cig up to the window, directing your exhales up there and flicking the butt out the window instead of keeping them around.

Again, before anyone jumps down my dick- I know that's not acceptable. Not trying to excuse what I did, merely explain. Immediate personal comfort often trumps greater good in the mind of many. "

"I draw my fives in such a way that they take up as much time as possible.

I used to work in a factory where peaches were canned, and one of my jobs was a data collector. Every hour I'd go from belt to belt, picking up a test fruit on each one, then bringing them back to this little office where I'd count how many full pits and pit fragments got through. If too many were getting through, one of the machines was broken or someone wasn't doing their job correctly and the problem would have to be fixed.

The thing is, doing this took about 10 minutes tops. After that I'd have to fill out the hour doing other things like cleaning behind the machines or helping with picking fruit off the belt, among other things. Not stuff I'd want to do, you understand.

As a result, when I was writing up my paperwork, I'd write my numbers as slowly as possible to stretch out my time in the office, and I found that if I drew the number ""5"" in two pieces (bottom bit first, then the line on top) I could draw out the paper work by a few milliseconds.

Every since then, that's how I've drawn my ""5""s."

"FADE IN:

EXT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

*A nine-year-old boy approaches a dark, foreboding house. He is clad in a long coat and a wide-brimmed hat. This is FATHER MERRIN, a priest. He knocks on the door.*

**CHRIS:** (*O.S.*) Who is it?    
**MERRIN:** It's me!    
**CHRIS:** (*O.S.*) ... What?    
**MERRIN:** It's me, the exorcist! I'm, um... I'm here to do the exorcism!

*The house's front door swings open revealing a nine-year-old girl. This is CHRIS MACNEIL.*

**CHRIS:** Oh, okay. I thought you were a ghost.    
**MERRIN:** Demon.    
**CHRIS:** What?    
**MERRIN:** I'm a demon, not a ghost.    
**REGAN:** (*O.S.*) No, you guys! I'm the demon!

*A girl in a stained nightgown appears behind Chris. This is REGAN, who is possessed.*

**REGAN:** (*CONT'D*) You're supposed to cure me!    
**MERRIN:** I'm not a doctor! I'm an exorcist!    
**CHRIS:** I thought you said you were a demon?    
**MERRIN:** Oh, right! Yeah, I'm a demon!    
**REGAN:** No, that's *me!*    
**CHRIS:** How come you get to be a demon? What if I want to be a demon?    
**MERRIN:** Okay, wait, what if... what if we're all demons, but...    
**REGAN:** (*Interrupting*) *No!* You're the exorcist!    
**MERRIN:** What if we're *all* exorcists, and...

*Regan interrupts Merrin by vomiting all over him.*

**CHRIS:** Gross!    
**MERRIN:** Ew! Why did you do that?!    
**REGAN:** You're making me so mad! I always...

*Regan throws up again. Chris screams and runs out of sight.*

**MERRIN:** I'm not playing anymore!

*Merrin runs away, leaving Regan on her own.*

**REGAN:** What an excellent day for an exorcism...

"If you throw out metabolisms and cultural implications of a walk-first culture:

Typically the rice is whole grain and they are not including other forms of high carb foods like bread or other starches on top of this. Also, look at portions. At the end of the day, complex carbs are fine for you in moderation and can help if you are active. We have an increasingly sedentary culture. Exercise for 30 minutes a day isnt enough to counteract the amount of bleached carbs in a lot of Americans' diets, and it absolutely fucks with your insulin sensitivity. This leads to a body predisposed to fat storage. "

"As a counter to that, they made a male hormonal birth control pill that works like the ones out for women right now. The side effects made it so it didn't pass through testing, even though those effects were the same as the effects that females deal with right now. When the pill first came into the market it was not tested like they are now, and the side effects can be rather intense. And the other options aren't much better. We really need something different that works with minimal side effects. "

"I think calling people ""wrong"" for wanting more solid evidence than there current exists is a bit presumptuous. It is restrictive: 20-50 grams of carbohydrate per day is restrictive on carbs. I don't know how much plainer that can get. 50 g/d of CHO is 10% of a 2,000 kcal diet. Most healthy diets are comprised of 50% CHO. That is carb restrictive, period. 

But it's your body- keto away if you like it. Just don't say it has been proven to be healthy. The science is still conflicted on the subject. "

"As a 22 year old, who smoked dabs every day for 2 years in college, I can say that this is true. 

Smoking weed is better than cigarettes. That is not to say smoking weed is GOOD for you because, as the original commentor said, smoking is smoking, period. Introducing smoke and other byproducts into your lungs can't be good. And yes, weed really does kill a lot of motivation and motor skills and other things. I've quit for 6 months and I'm still feeling some withdrawal, but I have felt my head has been clearer. My drug counselor says that the withdrawal from marijuana is less severe but longer in duration compared to cigarettes.

Sure, there are some people who are fine if they smoke it. It's all about the individual whether they can keep weed from taking over their lives. I was someone who couldn't. As I once read, ""Don't smoke weed to make yourself feel good when you are feeling bad, smoke weed to make yourself feel even better when you are feeling good."" I used weed as an escape mechanism and I was nothing more than an addict. I fully support the legalization of it and that people have the right to choose if they want to do it, but it still shouldn't be glorified."

"For me, it finally became clear this weekend. I always thought my college buddies and I were life-long friends. One of the guys I wasn't as close to got married a few months ago, I wasn't invited, I figured it was a limited guest list. 

Then another friend (who I'm closer to) is getting married this weekend. He said he had a limited guest list, pretty muach only family.  Totally understandable. Turns out, the other guys are all there. One was invited from across the country even though we never see him. I live in the same city as the rest of them. I thought we were a group of life-long friends. Turns out *they* are.

"I think Lord of the Rings from Gollum's perspective would be fascinating.

He told me the university books were meant to be sold as a set. Okay... I guess. How much is one set? ""$200 (relatively)"". What the hell? 

Then he explained to me that if I buy 4 sets, I would pay $400. The price was good this time. But one more catch! No credit card.

It was one of the ""transfer money to us every month"" kinda thing. I knew I want buying anything at this moment. 

But he continued. Said that he is a student like me and he gets commission etc. He seemed like a nice guy.

After a long time chatting, I said I had to think and will come back tomorrow. He quickly replied that this is the last hours and they will move to next city. And this chance will never be available.

After another long time of arguing I finally left. The next day I was taking my sis to a movie and there it is. He was still there trying to sell the books.

Then I realized he wasnt a cool student trying to pay his rent, but a greedy salesman."

I was surprised at how nice they were to tourists.

If 10 years down the line, your eyes start to get worse, then yea, Lasik won't stop that from happening. This is why they only recommend doing it if your eye sight has been stable for a certain period of time. I don't think they'll do it if your eye sight is still changing.

Also it won't stop people from needing reading glasses, again, that's your eyes changing AFTER lasik. But they tell you all this before you get it.

Anyways, 10 years since my surgery (2007! The cowboy age!) and my eyes are perfect. Even if they get worse in the future, I'm still so happy that I did this."

"A few things:

1. He admitted to having made out with ""more women than he would like to admit"" the year prior. He needed to clear his conscience, he said.  Turns out some friends of ours saw him and threatened to tell me if he didn't. 

2. I wanted to keep my last name legally and use his last name socially. He fought me tooth and nail on that one. I found out who my real father was a little late in life and have developed a very strong sense of identity with that name. It means a lot to me. 

3. He put a lot of pressure on me to make more money.  He reduced me to tears on several digferent occasions. He is an officer in the Army. I am a baker. We lived well within our means and were comfortable. I love my job. He also expected me to quit my job once he was ready to start having kids. 

4. I try to be honest about everything,  because that's what I do. We would tell each other when we found others to be sexually attractive.  One day, I told him about a recent friend whom I found attractive and all the sudden he got super jealous. He said to me ""you need to tell me that I'm the only person you will ever love"". I told him that was unrealistic. 

5. He was a mean drunk. 

When I told him I thought we should split up, he agreed with me. He didn't try fighting it. 

4.5 years with him and it was over in a 5 minute discussion. He proposed in January of this year and I left him in March. Since then, all of my anxiety induced health issues have gone away. I am dating soneone new who gratifies me very much sexually and emotionally, and I got a promotion at work!

The last thing he said to me before I left the house was, ""I thought loving you would be enough.""

I walk through our shared apartments common areas some 6-8 times per day and he is hanging there ~90% of the time and he asks me EVERY single time ""whassup?"". This drives me nuts. I know he just wants to be polite, but for me, it seems so odd to ask someone how are they doing, if the asker does not expect an answer or care about an answer at all.

"The odd thing is that isn't really how it's used, as far as I can tell.  The modern swinger scene is very heavily biased towards couples playing with other couples, with everyone present.  You do see single folks in that scene but it's overwhelmingly a married couple activity.  

As part of that, the vast majority of swingers, especially newer ones have pretty big hangups about one partner playing without the other present.  You do see some experienced couples having 'hall passes' from their partner to play solo but that's the exception more than the rule from what I could see.

As far as I can tell, the association of swingers with the military has less to do with being a way to deal with deployment but more that aggressive and extrovert types tend to be the sort of people who become swingers.  

My oversimplification is that nerds become kinksters (BDSM play, etc) and jocks become swingers.  Swinger parties tend to be full of former football players and their creepily identical looking blond wives, salesmen, business managers - that type.  Nice folks, but definitely not the sort of people I would normally hang with in my spare time.

Not that the nerd/kinksters are any less weird.  Nothing like checking out a night at one of those clubs just to see a super intricate suspension bondage scene where a bunch of the audience spends the whole time talking about what their favorite Linux distro is.

"We were travelling on a short flight between Brisbane and Sydney while visiting family friends who live in Aus. It was a very busy flight so we didn't all manage to get seated together. Our friends youngest daughter was only 5 and got seated in a window seat beside a middle aged couple who we didn't know. Most of the flight went fine and our friends child is very well behaved so there were no problems up until about 20mins before we are due to land.
The little girl shouted across to us and her family that she needed out to use the toilet but the man beside her would not let her past. Her dad then went up and politely asked him to let his daughter out to go to the toilet before we were due to land. I have no idea what came over the guy who was refusing to move but he absolutely lost it! Calling everyone C***s and and swearing at the little girl who was now in tears. Also have to mention that this guys wife was just sitting there pretending that nothing at all was happening. The guy then starts throwing punches and has to be restrained by us and the other passengers. Long story short 20 minutes later we have landed and both family's were escorted off the plane by the police. Our friend (the dad) was questioned for two hours in the airport and then released. It just so happens that when he was coming out the psychopath from the plane was waiting for him and had to be restrained again and was dragged away shouting... ""I'll kill you! I'll kill you all"" So yea that was pretty dumb in my opinion!  "

He was also very trustworthy, we could let him outside, and most of the time we would watch just in case, but he would do his business in our yard and promptly come back without even thinking about going far. This time I had left him outside ever so slightly longer than usual, which he usually wouldn't mind since he loves to sun bathe and play in grass, but this time he must have been done early paired with me coming to get him late. When I went out he was gone. 

Turns out he had gone to our back door to see if I would let him in there, I could see the freshly wet paw prints on our deck. Well the only problem was by the time I had gotten to the back door he had already given up on the back door. This is when I start to panic. How long has he been waiting? Where could he be?

The map is far more *realistic* than anything Bethesda could make. But ""realistic"" does not necessarily mean ""better"" for different people.

"My sisters. She is a Type A personality (ie: everything must be perfect). She converted to a Catholic to marry her hubby, but that's not the main point. I had blonde streaks in my brunette hair at the time (nicely incorporated into my natural light brunette) but apparently not good enough. She told me I had to go back to the hairdresser and get more (luckily the hairdresser was our first cousin).

Got more streaks, sister says they are 'too blonde'. Go back to my cousin, she puts some light brunette through my hair. My sister says too brunette (she can be the only brunette). Go back to my cousin, more blonde. Sister says too blonde, get a toner over it. Go back to hairdresser cousin who looses her shit (hahaha). So toner goes on, sister finally happy.

Sister then advises me a spray tan is required (WTF? I have too much menalin in my skin and I go brown by sitting in the shade, but whatever). Get the spray tan, all good. 

Sister specifies any silver shoes, buy three until she is happy with one (starting to loose my shit).

As the sister it's up to me to organise her Bacherlorette party, rules, no strippers, nothing cheap and invites to reflect her blue and silver theme and be hand made....

At this point I'd like to advise I'd always said to my sister my colours would be blue and silver as blue is my favourite colour...Anywho...

Organise dinner at a Greek restaurant on Gouger St in Adelaide (home town) and follow it up with cocktails and private cocktail bar and room at Budda Bar. Unfortunately, most of her guests come but fail to pay...so I, just out of Uni, foot most of the bill (PayPal, etc were not mainstream at this time). Awesome.

Get to dress time and she orders spaghetti strap blue and silver dresses from America. I was size 12 Aus, she got me size 22 American. So the dress cost $200 and I spent $300 getting the dress pulled apart and re-made.

Day comes around, isle walk is fine. Halfway through, groom swoons and has a nose bleed, no worries, got a box of tissues in my clutch and first aid training, plus a bottle of water, bring him around, finish up.

Photos, in fields of canola, pretty, but I have chronic sinusitis...awesome. After make up repair, continue photos and then head to reception.

My Type A sister decides to save some money and just have cocktail nibbles with an open bar....half my Dad's side are alcoholics (I'm only semi alcoholic). So that turned out well until a cousin took out three high top tables in spectacular fashion.

As a bridesmaid, and only sister, I was also expected to take my sister to the toilet in her dress...fuck me, I will never be a bridesmaid again...do you know if they have a big heavy dress they can't ""help themselves"" yeah, that was awesome.

Suffice to say my fiancée and I left asap and left with the younger cousins (including my hairdresser) to the local pub for a meal and more drinks. A little out of place in the Barossa Valkey, but eminently more relaxing.

Left the bridesmaid dress at my parents, haven't seen it since 2007.

Second Story:

My wedding. All booked and planned under a rotunda in the Botanic Gardens. My family threatened to boycott if Aunts, Uncles and kids were not invited.

But you also need to understand how badly the paparazzi treats him and his family.  They hide outside his homes, they try to sneak pictures of anything and everything, and they shove cameras, literally, into the face of his newborn baby while in the carriage.  He is a very nice guy otherwise, he just **loathes** the paparazzi.  I've never seen him be anything but respectful and polite to everyone I've seen him interact with.  They hound him especially because they know they're going to get a reaction from him.  Given those circumstances, I think most of us would react similarly."

"I can't believe I tried justifying that shit when it came out. I legitimately enjoyed it for awhile, and I didn't see why people were tearing it apart. I felt I was getting my money's worth. Then, a couple weeks later, it suddenly dawned on me as I was thinking about picking it up one day. ""Why would I go shoot rocks for hours when there's no real gain from any of it?"" I weighed the options realistically and I came to a quick decision: literally the only progressive thing I can do in that game is shoot rocks and get a better ship. That's it. Why the fuck did I pay $60 for that?

Edit: Not to mention the ending! Or whatever you wanna call it. Personally I never made it close but one day I got curious and looked it up.

So it went from friendly co-worker to legit friendship and eventually my best friend and husband. "

"""Cute"" is lady-speak for ""sexy"" or ""handsome"" when used to describe a guy. We don't mean cute like a puppy. It's a pretty high compliment and not meant to diminish your masculinity at all.

""Hot"" means ""hot."" You can take that at face-value. Enjoy your hotness responsibly. "
"That was practically perfect in every way. 

If you take a very close look at the second sentence of the second paragraph, there's a point at which a decision could be made about whether it ends after the ellipses.

"Oh shit yes shart story time!

So, I was dating this girl back in 2012 right? We were just out of high school hanging out at her house. She lived with her parents. They were super protective and we always had to hang out in the family room with one of her parents in the room. So, because of this, I had never seen another room in the house. Had never seen the kitchen, a bedroom, not even the bathroom. 

Well, one night we were hanging out, I was 18 and nervous and had to pee. No big deal. But I was just afraid to go to their bathroom. So I said ""hey, I gotta go grab something from my car"" so I get up and head outside to find a viable tree just to do my business on. They lived kind of in the country (I'm from north Alabama) and I picked a tree. Started to pee. Pushed a little too hard on a fart. Shit myself. I panicked and gathered my bearings trying to figure out what to do, so I finished up my wiz, sipped up and headed inside like nothing happened. Then I go back to the family room, and casually say ""hey! Mind if I use your restroom?"" They say yea and point me to it. I'm sweating. I sit down. I assess the damage. Turns out it never hit my boxers and I cleaned up and walked back in there like nothing happened. They still don't know it happened

"The other thing I find with forza is people build terrible cars for the classes they are racing in. Start with something purpose built for that class, add the widest racing tires first, then reduce weight. Power and top speed is the last priority. Handling and braking should be first. 

Too many times I've had friends try and hang in A or S class in AWD swapped civics and weird franken-cars. Yes, they are fun to build, but you will never even come close to a podium finish. Cars like the Alfa 4C, lotus exige, BAC Mono, Caterham 7 and TVR Sagaris get overlooked because they lack the horsepower that other cars in the class have, but then they can weigh 1,000-3,000 lbs less than the cars they are competing against.

"Because even when used as an insult, and meant as an insult, and delivered with heartfelt intent to insult, ""skinny"" just doesn't carry any kind of weight as an insult, because 99 percent of society views it as something positive. 

I mean, if you overheard ""Fuck you, you generous piece of shit"", it just wouldn't matter. 

On the other hand, calling somebody fat, even if not meant to be insulting, is a serious social faux pas, because even with as many fat people as our culture has, it's seen as something extremely negative. Commenting on a negative attribute of another person is generally never a positive thing. Even the most constructive of criticism still has to be managed carefully. "

I know way more educated, well-spoken addicts than I do gutter junkies (though I do know a few of those, too).  To me, that's a big part of what makes pain pills et. al so scary. If your dentist gives you a scrip of Percs and your life, work performance, and social skills drastically increase for the duration of having them, chances are a seed's going to be planted. 

And more than that, pain pills feel fucking *good*. All these factors are why you see soccer moms and other respectable taxpayers in the paper, dying of heroin overdoses. The underworld - not hell, but the places you can score shit heavier than vicodin - isn't as out of reach as you think, and by the time the pills have altered your decisionmaking capacity snorting a bump of heroin isn't *that* different from swallowing a couple pills. Especially if the pills aren't available and the sweats are kicking in. 

I see a lot of people blaming Big Pharma for the mess. And I suppose if you're going to cut the head off the snake, that's where it is. But I honestly think it's symptomatic of a larger social sickness, and that a lot of people would be turning to other avenues if the crisis had never come about. People are miserably unhappy, like at an existential level, and look: Here's a pill that makes your life not suck as bad for three to six hours! Doing the laundry is fun! You can look your boss in the eye and tell yourself you like letting customers shit on you all day! etc. 

In that sense it's going to be a very hard problem to fix. Indeed, I often think it's not really fixable, save for getting awareness shit out and preventing people from falling down the same awful path. You hear promising things about medications and treatments that can rewire a brain to pre-addiction states, but it seems like it's something new every month on that front and nothing ever materializes past tech-blog ""They can make mice not addicted now! The opioid crisis is over!"" clickbait bullshit. 

I'm rambling now, so I'm going to put the important part in bold: **If you take opioids outside of prescribed dosages - and maybe even then - and you're just at the like-the-way-they-feel level, knock it off.  No matter how you think it's helping you it will fuck your life up and you will hate yourself for it.**

And that's assuming you get out alive. Coming from someone who has buried two friends who didn't crack 30 years, it's certainly no guarantee.

I was also very jealous and obsessed over people I liked, and didn't understand boundaries and such. I would show too much affection for people right away, and it scared them off, leading to me blowing up on them after getting rejected.

It's taken some time, but I'm finally learning how to be more assertive, and when it's appropriate to show affection for people. I was unfortunately very cold and distant in my first relationship because I feared what getting attached to someone would make me do. But choking and stuff... I don't think I could ever do that again. I got that out of my system when I bullied my brothers as a kid, and to this day, I am filled with regret for how I treated them. "

"The problem is that the fringes have enough passion for their respective causes to go out and vote. They make damn sure their voices are heard and therefore they are valuable capital to a politician.

The middle is a sucking, gaping maw of apathetic non-political folk who couldn't care less. No matter how much you target your campaign and pander to them and beg for their attention, they'll signal their agreement with a brief nod and then go about their day. They won't vote. They won't sign petitions. They won't do anything to further your and their opinions. This is why Kasich, Clinton, Bush and McCain sunk. They saddled their carts to a ginormous herd of horses that was too busy grazing at the fields, going about their own lives, to move one step. 

Meanwhile ""niche"" politicians like Sanders and Obama who campaigned to the far left, and Trump and Romney who campaigned to the far right, zoomed past, pulled by their tiny but dedicated as all hell voter base.

Any politician who wants real actual political capital and any sort of reliable voter base NEEDS to appeal to passionate people who show up at the voter booths."

If I grew up and didn't want piercings, I would just not wear earrings and let the hole close up. "

"I agree with you. Am Spanish. In here, most baby girls get their ears pierced, so did I. And I prefer that, rather than having to do it later in life, fully knowing about the ordeal. 

Babies heal much faster, and qualified professionals do the holes, not some unwashed acquaintance in an alley. Also, the earrings used are super small, barely noticeable, made of materials that don't cause allergies. Of course no one's going to put on hoops in a baby's ear unless they're trashy.

Some parents don't get their babies pierced, and I respect that. To each their own.

I mean, I consider unnecessary baby circumcision way more questionable, but nobody in America bats an eye about that, right? Guess it's better and easier to bash Latinos and Spaniards."

"Roll over, get stuck, suffocate. Vomit, choke, suffocate. A six month old might be crawling or climbing. Fall out of crib -- broken bones or concussion. Play with extension cords. Plus what about fire? Pets? Dogs and cats both have harmed babies. Hell, what about burglars?  All of these things are unlikely but can happen. Kids have even been inadvertently abducted during carjackings. On the grosser end -- poop blowout, then play with/eat the poop. Best case scenario you have a huge mess, worst case scenario your kid gets sick. As a parent it's your job to think of the possibilities and prevent what you can.I've got two kids and the furthest I'd go without them is into the yard for a few minutes with a door or window open. I'm not a helicopter parent -- my kid plays and climbs and takes risks and gets banged up, but I'm always THERE in case the worst happens. These idiots are just asking for the worst.

It's a joke... why is this thread devoid of humour?
Also their failure to understand that people who dislike a religion or other group do not hate the people in that group and are not racists. I know nice muslim people and nasty mulim people but in my eyes all of them hold the wrong views as their religion is not liberal in the traditional sense (not the american word for left wing). If they however are happy in a liberal democracy and are respectful of the rights of others then I have no problem with them as people.  This thinking applies to people who hold racist viewpoints in my mind as well. If they agree with liberalism and other people's rights as humans then I cannot say that they're bad people. Just in my opinion misguided which I'm sure I am in theirs.

"I definitely don't claim that this is the universal experience, but here's how it's been for me:

The worst dates I've ever been on are with guys who were really smooth. It didn't feel like they really wanted to know me as a person- it was more like a game, where the prize was going out with ""a girl"" and not *me*. I found that they mostly saw me as an object, something to be won over instead of someone to know more about. Really smooth guys actually make me pretty suspicious, because it makes me feel like they've *practiced*, in essence. 

In contrast, I had a guy ask me out like this: ""So I hope this isn't weird, but you're one of the wittiest people I've ever met. And I... really like that you can be funny without being mean. Not everyone can do that. You're funny and kind and I'd really, if it's okay with you, would you maybe want to get hot chocolate? I know that's lame, but you said you liked chocolate milk, and hot chocolate is just the hot version, and it's really cold right now..."" etc etc. It was just this really awkward babble in which he literally said that hot chocolate is the hot version of chocolate milk. And I was *in love*. It was so genuine and heartfelt, and the little awkward moments just made it more endearing. That, to me, showed that this wasn't someone trying to get with ""a girl""- it was someone who wanted to get to know *me* specifically. And that's a good feeling.

Anyway, sorry for the novel. Like I said, this is definitely not universal, and a lot of great guys are smooth too, I'm sure. But there's something extremely charming about someone who is a little nervous."

"Not an employee, but another guest.

This happened just the other week. We were waiting in line for a ride that requires people with bags/purses to leave them on the ground, or at least not in the ride car with you. This older lady, probably 50s or 60s, had purchased one of those giant turkey drumsticks and was refusing to put it down so the ride had to be put on hold until the situation resolved. The ride operator ran and grabbed a bunch of paper towels for her so she could wrap the drumstick and put it on the ground. She refused. She was NOT going to put that drumstick down. She was also refusing to get out of the ride car so everyone else could go. The ride operator had to call security to remove her."

"Misconception with Trek. They moved away from everyone having to labor to live on earth, but that doesnt mean an economy doesnt exist, people could still buy/acquire luxury items. The Trek shows are showing basically military like ship crews - and mainly their officer class - so things look more uniform than they are... outside of that theres still more traditional economy going on. DS9 was on a port station instead of ship and there was definitely money flowing around. Even on the ships the crews still had replicator rations stipend to them which they would trade around and sometimes federation credits. Also Earth was an exception, many of the Federation planets were not doing well and economies and quality of life varied wildly. Additionally while the Federation and Humans engaged in war, the Ferengi (the most profit focused culture) never got involved in large scale wars, nor historically committed genocidal acts, or had an economy based around slavery, or even ever used things like nukes on their own planet."

"Tipping isn't really popular in Europe, but it's virtually mandatory to tip the waiter or waitress at least 15% of the bill. If they give bad service, tip less, and if you get extraordinary service you should tip higher at 20% or 25%. If you don't tip at all, especially at an expensive restaurant, you'll be looked down upon and you won't get great service the next time you go.

Also, ignore all of these people that are saying bad shit about the police and how they'll ""assault and murder you"". 99.9999% of cops in the United States are really friendly and kind and helpful. Just because you hear about a few bad apples on the news doesn't mean you're going to get murdered."

He has bullshitted about a lot of things and made promises he never intended to keep, but when he says ""they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,"" he's not fucking joking.

"I think you're probably right, the problem is that this loud minority intimidates anyone from challenging them. Evergreen college was a great example.

They intimidated the president to the point where he was keeping is hands down because they said making hand gestures is oppressive. He allowed them to ""escort"" him to the bathroom. The police not only did not break up this clearly illegal behavior, they were actively told not to intervene. 

So maybe they are a minority, but as long they successfully intimidate anyone who gets in their way, they matter."

Because you called me for an interview and the other guy didn't.  
"People will hate me but ""Handsome Jack"" is a pretty tragic character. 

He wanted to do good for others and made it his life's work to give people a good life even if it meant he would die. However after being betrayed by everyone around him from his loved ones to his allies he became corrupted. Everyone started treating him like a madman, a reject, an insect that his sanity slowly snapped.

His goals became corrupted. His compassion and empathy were replaced with manipulation and greed. No one would approve of him so he sought sanity by approving himself. All of his statues and grandiose journey on Pandora was essentially a cry for attention, for recognition, for someone to say ""that guy has his life on track.""

I didn't believe he was such a tragic character until I looked at my own life. Emotionally battered by my parents who never approved of me no matter what good I did. There was always someone better than me, someone out there who is living a better life. My father even once said he would replace me in a heartbeat if it meant having some genius child. Yet they will not admit they're folly. They will never see their words and actions as anything but ""proper"" parenting.

I am seen as nothing more than annoyance as Jack was seen trying to do good for others. No one ever said anything remotely kind about either of him and years of that turned him into an unfeeling sociopath. The Jack we see in BL2 is a narcissistic man who enjoys torturing others. He feels no remorse and believes everything he does is for the greater good. He doesn't care about right or wrong because being right or wrong doesn't get you anywhere.

To climb the corporate ladder you have to be ruthless. Everyone and everything around him was nothing more than tools to be used and thrown away. He wanted to stay on top and create a utopia so that he could maybe finally get some recognition, no matter how twisted it may be. In the later games he wanted to program robots with his face to have a Jack army (and if you didn't get the significance of that then good grief get a book about symbols). The Jack army is a thousand mirrors all with his face and while it never started off, he probably would have programmed them to say good things about Jack. Why, because we all look in mirrors and tell ourselves we're doing a good job because no one else will. The epitome of loneliness is to be talking to yourself because no one else wants to because everyone else thinks you're insane. 

When trying to kill Jack off once and for all he begs to not be sent back to the computer world where no real person exists where no real emotions exist. All this time all he wanted was some small amount of recognition, genuine recognition not out of fear or hatred. He was a child crying out for someone to hold him.

tl;dr: Handsome Jack from the Borderlands series was a child in a man's body who sought compassion and recognition after receiving none his entire life."

If it's anyone, at some point you could just get down to a guy who would enjoy having his gooey bag held for a day.  My point though was it was a friendship and if your new friend was responsible for you getting a million bucks,  buying him a thank you gift would just be polite. "

"He encompasses why Trump got elected in the first place. Too many liberals are just unwilling to even listen to the other side.  You can call people rednecks, hicks, uneducated, bigoted, pieces of shit, whatever. You can shut them out of public dialog, ban their twitter accounts, kick them off of Facebook, talk over them when they try to say something in person. You can completely shut them out of the public discussion space and make it so they can only find people close to their side on extremist, fringe websites, YouTube channels, etc.

But the one thing you can't do is oversee what they're doing in the voting booth. You have no power over these people on election day. You can't threaten them. You can't out them. You can't dox them. You can't form an online lynch mob to get them fired. You can't scream ""racist! bigot! Homophobe! Transphobe!"" at them because the voting booth is the *one* place in this world where they are absolutely shielded from you and it is in the *one* place in this world where they can express what they *really* think.

And America voted for Trump. Not because they liked Trump, for the most part anyway. They voted for Trump because they hated Hillary Clinton more. They voted for Trump because Hillary Clinton has a train of scandals behind her and it's a good rule of thumb that if someone smells like shit, you don't need to see the shit to know it's there somewhere. Someone with *that* many accusations flying at her over the years can't possibly have her hands completely clean.

While the far-left was choir-preaching to voters in states they were going to get anyway, Trump addressed the people in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, etc. directly and talked about the fucking trade deals that were shoved down their throats in the 90s and...guess what...were never *really* convinced that they were a good thing. See, nobody *really* convinced the thousands of people who lost their cushy factory jobs to Mexico and China in the 90s that it was all for the best.  Nobody *really* sold all those people that it was *good* they lost their jobs and homes and lives all those years ago because it created all these jobs in California! Isn't it great your family went through absolute hell so these assholes on the West Coast can live in their million dollar silicon valley homes? Well, guess what? Folks here in the rust belt *don't* think that's so great. They don't think it's great *at all*.

And oh sure, they have jobs now. Shitty jobs that pay less, but they have jobs! Shitty jobs that they can only stay in for a few years, but they have jobs! Shitty jobs that gamble their money on the stock market instead of a guaranteed pension, but they have jobs! Shitty jobs that give them less vacation, less sick time, and shittier, more expensive insurance, but they have jobs!

Yeah, tell us again how Hillary ""we're gonna put a lot of coal miners out of a job"" Clinton is the *obvious* choice for poor West Virginia families. Tell us again how Hillary ""NAFTA was a good thing"" Clinton is just the *obvious* choice for us Michiganders and Ohioans and Pennsylvanians, and Wisconsinites.

Hillary Clinton was the absolute *worst* candidate the Democratic Party could have nominated, hands down.

"Not sure if this is relatable or not since I'm not a parent or a child of someone who has cut contact, but my whole family (myself included) cut contact with my step-grandfather. 

My little sister (15 at the time) went over to their house for spring break because she wanted to spend time with him and his wife. He brought up the idea of a grandpa/granddaughter backyard camping excursion and she thought the idea sounded okay, because it was her grandpa after all so why not. 

While my grandmother was cooking, he asked my sister to follow him outside and look for a possible campsite for their backyard. The creepy fucker sits down and convinced my sister to sit on his lap when they got outside, where he decided it was appropriate to talk to her about how he could buy her all these sex toys, how to orgasm, how he gets hookers (shocking for a 70 year old man with health issues), etc.  By this point (err, well before this point) she was getting extremely uncomfortable and starts to walk away. He then full fledged groped her chest and she ran away to the house crying and screaming. 
After telling my grandmother what happened, she refused to believe it and denied it. She locked herself in the bathroom and called my step-dad and told him to pick her up. They got there asap and ended up screaming at each other and it was a giant mess. 

It really fucked my family up and they ended up pressing charges. He fully admitted everything, but if I remember correctly the cops decided to drop the case because of elderly delusions or something along the lines of that.

A red flag for me was hearing my step-aunt say, ""Uh, you shouldn't have let her sleep over in the first place. My kids have never been allowed to."" That makes me think of a possible, unspoken abusive background between the two of them. 

TL;DR my step-grandfather tried to molest my sister, we don't talk to him anymore "

"I just gotta say, my dad stopped coming to visit when I was in middle school. I don't know if it was because I started acting disinterested or if he just wasn't interested. Or maybe both. Kids are gonna be kids. And sometimes being a kid means you don't like hanging out with your parent that visits you every other weekend, or once a month or whatever. Maybe I was a shit kid, who knows. I definitely don't remember. I just wish he fought harder to be a part of my life. Now that I'm an adult, I wish I had him in my life. I could so easily reach out to him like my sister does. But at this point I'm upset that he was never an adult about the situation and seemingly stopped caring about me completely. 

Maybe trying to reach out to your daughter at this age isn't going to go well. But I would recommend trying again when she's a little older. And can think for herself instead of being manipulated by the mother. "

"I was sleeping in my previous house summer of 2014, freshman high school year had ended. (Was 14) Can't remember what month but it was sometime between June-August. I was home alone. My room was at the back of the house, and there was a door that lead to the back porch, and next to my door was the door to the second floor of the house. My bed has this backrest with some cubby-type holes for maybe picture frames and such. It was resting on the door, plus the door was painted over and hadn't been opened in about 3 years at that point. As i was sleeping at around 1 in the afternoon, i heard knocking. I thought ""maybe they'll leave, i won't answer."" Knocking turned to banging, i jumped out of bed, and he kicking started. First thing i grab was my phone, and in only my boxers, ran from my room to the front door in literally 2 seconds, ran, called 911, called parents, whole 9 yards. Hadn't entered the house until the cops had left maybe an hour later. Guy entered through my window which had an A/C in it, pushed it in and stole my mom's ipad, mom and sisters' jewelry, skipped over everything in my room for some reason (then again my xbox was tied down and nobody would steal a desktop through a small window). The scariest part apart from being in the room when he started kicking at my door was when i had already run outside and heard the front door slam shut. He knew i was there, and i have no clue if he saw me. Maybe not as bad as some of the other stories here but i still have trouble dealing with it. What if he'd just gone for the window? What if he was armed?"

"That your political persuasion oftentimes has to do with with your physical environment / population density for very tangible reasons. 

Urban residents tend to like liberal policies because more heavy-handed government involvement is necessary when people are forced to have 50 anonymous interactions every day. You need more rules and regulations when there's 10,000 people per square mile. 

Rural residents tend to like conservative policies because people are better at self governance when there's 5-10 people per square mile. The poor are taken care of by neighbors and churches, you can't act like an asshole because everybody knows everybody (and you'll end up shunned), and like it's been said elsewhere; any government services that may exist are so far away that they're of no help by the time they get to you. You're more likely to want a gun because the thought of the nearest cop being 10 miles away gives you little comfort in case you're being threatened. In that environment, government benefits and regulations are seen as unnecessary."

"But we don't need evidence that there isn't any God. If we did, we'd need evidence to disprove Santa Claus, his flying reindeer, and - as Bertrand Russell suggested - a little China teapot in orbit between Earth and Mars around the Sun. The notion religious people have that God exists unless we can disprove him is flawed in that something cannot be said to exist until there is evidence to suggest or prove it -- a sentence they seem to confuse with saying that something can be said to exist until there is evidence to prove it doesn't.

"Well for me it was working at hockey rinks. A quick Google search tells me that a rink in Langley pays $23/hr, so I'm guessing the standard pay is pretty close to what I was getting in alberta. Here in AB zamboni drivers make $20-25 and cashiers (at city owned rinks) make $17-21 usually. 


I also have known multiple people who worked for parks n rec departments in the edmonton area doing lawn mowing and other landscaping-esque jobs and those also pay around $25/hour though I'm not sure if there's part time opportunities available. 


Lifeguarding is another sweet money making opportunity since you work 30 minutes on /30 minutes off and therefore only actually work for half your shift. I could never be a lifeguard though, too stressful.

The people at the ""Eco station"" who stand around and tell you where to put your crap also make like $25-30 hourly but they have to be around trash so they deserve it IMO (not sure what Eco stations are called in other cities but it's basically a city-owned place you can go to dispose of hazardous or recyclable waste like old lightbulbs and motor oil and whatever)"

"Main downside to open-back (besides no noise isolation) is that they lack in bass, they’ll get to maybe 50Hz, but they won’t get the super low frequencies. The soundstage is amazing though.  
  
Rtings has reviewed/measured quite the amount of headphones (and televisions), so they are good for unbiased research. The frequency consistency score is huge, it can account for say a 6dB difference based on how you wear your headphones and if you wear glasses (their YouTube video on it shows how much they care about their job), better scores in that category means you can guarantee that the sound you hear will be similar to what they measured."

"I'm one of those weirdos that don't let my kids have a tablet or phone when we are out running errands. At 4 and 6,the world is exciting and there's plenty to talk about with them, letting them passively learn.... 

That said, I don't fault parents for letting thier kids use tablets. At all. The way I figure, they probably don't get a lot of downtime, as parents, between work and communtes, cleaning and cooking, and if they are running errands with kids, it's probably because they absolutely have to. On top of that, some people are more anxious out in public, so the less variables to manage, the better. 

I handle a tantrum like a champ, and am very unconcerned about appearing stern in public, but so many parents do not. ""Shitting on parents"" is the new American past time, and at some point, if someone gets anxious about getting criticized, they'll avoid it at all costs. 

Like, in an argument or facing criticism, I have no problem being rational and it's not easy to make me feel badly about how I parent. But I'm lucky, because people say awful shit to people, about thier kids, in public places, all the time.... And I haven't had that happen, once. 

Of all the parenting-friends I have, I am the exception. Think about that, tho. People are really fucking mean to stressed out parents. What the actual fuck? 

If people weren't so damned annoyed by other people's kids, then tablets wouldn't be necessary for a lot of kids. "

Sugar is the catalyst (imo) for insulin resistance that makes your body tell you to eat more food.

"You're driving more sound waves yes, but the average amplitude of sound experienced by the inner ear will be magnitudes lower than without them on due to the way destructive interference works. So they aren't actually increasing pressure, they're actually lowering it below your surrounding environment unless you're already in a sound proof room.

More sound waves doesn't always equal more damage if the sound waves destructively interfere like they do in noise cancelling headphones. You'll end up with spots that experience practically zero pressure change. They engineer active noise cancelling headphones to put that spot right near your inner ear. Then they alter the sound signal of your music so it doesn't get cancelled out by the sound waves meant to cancel out the outside noise."

There have only been two studies that have ""shown"" this - One was debunked (it's more like an article than a study) and the other one has not been able to find the same results nor has anyone else, meaning the drops in sexual abuse were probably because of something else (if there really was a drop). Oh yeah and there was that one bozo who said that porn reduced sexual assualt, but the actual study said that having the internet did that - not porn. Which makes more sense bc think about how much time we spend on the internet like reddit, youtube, etc instead of committing crimes.

Be careful with believing this bologna bc what you would essentially be saying is that if men don't have sex, they become rapists. The research we have about sex crimes shows that sexual abuse is a little bit more complicated then that. Don't drink that koolaid dude."

Followed her all the way to her room and she said she thought she knew me and I told her I was still in high school. She said ""Oh well that's fine but if you want you can come out later were gonna be here all night"". I said maybe and left after she signed, never planned on going because I didn't know ANY one there and even though I was a senior in high school they all looked so much older than me. Right as I was about to get off the same place ordered again and I said fuck it I'll take it and went out again. This time when I got there they were all really drunk and the same girl was there and said she's been looking for me all night and to follow her to sign again. I went back and her friend was laying in the bed with the covers covering her and the girl yanked them off and they did the whole ""omg stop giggle giggle"" thing. She was totally naked. They didn't exactly offer anything specifically but I'm 80% sure they were hinting to a threesome idfk I don't get that shit. But either way I had a gf and was already getting yelled at by the manager for being late on deliveries so I had her sign again and left."

I went out of my room and around the corner and there was a guy sitting on the floor crying with his leg in a door, and someone inside was slamming it on him. He explained his brother was inside with broken beer bottles cutting his wrists and that he had made suicide attempts before. I got him my bandana so he could go in and try to stop the bleeding while I called 911. I can't say for sure how things turned out, but I do know the brother was still alive when they got him out of the room to an ambulance and from what I could tell they didn't seem to be in a huge panic so hopefully he did okay."

"To not hate people that are different. I was raised in a racist, judgmental, just horribly negative household but early on, in maybe 5th or 6th grade, I realize how stupid their views were, and that being racist, or homophobic, or just an ass in general is pointless, stupid, and just sad. So I promised myself I would love everybody regardless. 
I started dating a black boy a few years later, when they found out they lost their shit and almost kicked me out. I told them that I wasn't a racist asshole like them, and that I don't care what they think or say because love is love and I will love whoever the fuck I want. 
I stopped sharing my relationships and personal life with them after that. It just wasn't worth it, because we've never been close anyway. I just wish they were different, but it's okay. Because I still have that boyfriend, and we're getting married when he finishes boot camp for the marines. ❤️ "

If it's anything like running a bar you just hope to break even most nights and then you can turn a profit one or two nights a month. "

"That might be getting more at the reality of what I meant. If you go into a flirtatious scenario and you go into not looking to get anything out of it other than learning about the other person, you'll come out of it 100% successful every time. 

Maybe phrasing it differently would be this. Go into it looking to qualify THEM as a worthy partner for yourself instead of you qualifying yourself to them you'll have a whole different perspective on it. Like say you see a cute girl at a bar and you initially wanna take them home or whatever. Go over to them with the mindset and goal to see if they're a good enough/cool enough person to pursue, with the assumption your the best you can be, so that way you're truly trying to learn about them as a person. In this scenario the only thing you're looking to get out of it is to learn if they're essentially 'good enough' for you to be interested. If they don't reciprocate you know they're not and there's nothing lost as that's a reflection of them, and not you. If they do, then you get the chance to see if y'all mesh. "

"Yep. Cocaine. Had it happen to several friends, some close, others not. In my experience, cocaine rapidly destroys your personality, and replaces it with the stereotypical arrogant coke-head.

We had potential, but our keyboardist couldn't keep his act together, and he got the guitarist into it too, and that was that."

"The section is really not that long. A lot of people seem to think of the book as being 4 major sections, University-Vintas-Fae-Ademre, but really the felurian section is less than 70 pages out of a 1000. Even then, some of that time is Kvothe talking to the Cthaeh, some more is probably going to be important world building about what the Fae realm really is and so forth. 

Its certainly my least favourite section in the series, and I'll admit to skipping it on a couple of rereads, but I think people make a much bigger deal of it than is necessary.

(It's also possible that when you said 1/3 of the novel devoted to fucking included the Ademre chapters, and back at the university, but in that case I think ""dedicated"" is too strong a word)"
"A holocaust survivor actually co-founded the US animal rights movement, he did an AMA on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2h8df0/i_am_an_80yearold_holocaust_survivor_who/

Here is what he had to say on this nazi comparison: 

&gt;The negative reaction is largely due to people's mistaken perception that the comparison values their lives equally with those of pigs and cows. Nothing could be farther from the truth. What we are doing is pointing to the commonality and pervasiveness of the oppressive mindset, which enables human beings to perpetrate unspeakable atrocities on other living beings, whether they be Jews, Bosnians, Tutsis, or animals. It's the mindset that allowed German and Polish neighbors of extermination camps to go on with their lives, just as we continue to subsidize the oppression of animals at the supermarket checkout counter.

"Considering everything that's been happening in the US lately, especially this past weekend, I find this documentary to be paramount to understanding why things are the way they are in that country. Anyone who doesn't understand why things are that way, why black people need to have loud, pronounced voices in conversations surrounding race and rights, needs to be sat down. This documentary explains very plainly and without mincing words how the system has been unfair to an entire race of people even with a declaration of their freedom. I fancy myself an amateur fan of American history and politics and before this doc I had been sheltered to a lot of truths about what it's been like for African Americans even with so-called freedom.

"I take your point, but put yourself in their shoes for a second. You spend years making and promoting a film, and then the guy who's the fulcrum of it all up and dies--under those circumstances, you kind of have to say something. 

Essentially, their options were: a) issue a tersely-worded statement that says nothing, which considering the scope of their probe into the guy's life would seem a rather strange and unsatisfactory response; b) blast him on the way out, which is just unseemly; or c) do what they did, which is basically to say ""hey, this guy may have been a creep, but no person is 100% pure evil; he was still somebody's son/friend, etc. Anyway, he's dead now and there's no use dancing on his grave.""

Add in the fact that, I don't care who you are, nobody wants to think they helped to hasten another human being's departure; and whether it was a suicide/heart attack/whatever...I think it's hard to argue the stress of this whole ordeal had to have contributed in some way to the dude's death. Meaning that while we as viewers don't have to mourn the guy, I think it's natural for the filmmakers themselves to feel a little sheepish upon hearing the news. "

"I just talk to my niece and nephew normally. They're 9 and 7. I'll tell them things that are totally true, then realize maybe I shouldn't tell kids that. And these times they will think that I'm kidding with them and not believe me lol I guess they're incapable of understanding the way the world really is?

I've never told them anything bad, or about sex or death or anything like that. Just normal things like I'm always tired because I work night shift, or that I don't have money to do X,Y,Z. 

They also asked where my ex was after we broke up because they were so used to seeing us together so I told them that he wasn't very nice to me but they didn't understand because he never screamed or yelled at me. He cheated, but obviously they couldn't understand that so I just told them he was mean to me. 

I feel weird talking to kids too and never really know what or how to speak with them. They were making fun of monkeys and apes one day and I told them not to make fun because we're cousins with them and they thought I was lying to mess with them. Then I tried to explain evolution but right over their little heads lol"

"Definitely not the same. Train guards are usually nothing short of lovely. These revenue protection officers are purposely out to get people and don't have a shred of humanity in them. 

I was unlucky enough to get caught out by one (an honest mistake, I didn't realise my railcard wasn't on me). I was belittled and treated awfully. I offered to pay the full fare, I offered to show her a photo of my card. I offered to have to have my partner bring it down. 

In the end I got a fine for over eighty pounds. 

It was thoroughly stressful, I couldn't afford it. 

Thankfully my dad wrote a letter for me to send to them and they wrote it off. But it never should have escalated that far in the first place. They're supposed to let you pay the full fare and you can get a refund of the difference. Bitch.

"My mom lost a child, my sister when she was 8 years old, she drowned in our home pool and this made my mom depressed for a long time. She blamed herself for this for so long wishing that she killed herself when it happened. Almost 15 years later she moved on, and I mean it, for so long she carried guilt and pain with her, she always said the only thing that kept her holding on was the rest of us kids. My mother was blamed by neighors for killing my sister, because my diagnosed skitzophrinic aunt called the police saying she heard my sister screaming the day she died on the phone.

I can vouch, seeing first hand how my mother dealt with losing her daughter."

"The thing about the older games, particularly apparent in Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker, was that the dungeons had a very strict formula. You enter; follow a linear path while noticing all the paths you can't reach yet; discover a new item; go back through all the paths you couldn't reach before; mini boss; a couple of grand puzzles that require your new item, problem solving skills, and gameplay expertise; and finally the boss, which can only be beaten with your new item.

While I'm not saying I don't like that system, one thing I did appreciate about BotW was that Nintendo had the self-awareness to notice the limitations of their own formula and get rid of it. I didn't like the Divine Beasts, but I think that's because I was spoiled by such intricately-designed and linear dungeons from previous Zelda games. I didn't like the shrines either. It felt like Nintendo had ""dumped"" all of their problem-solving puzzle ideas into the shrines. So I would say on balance I would have liked to have the dungeons back, but I also respect Nintendo's decision to cut them this time. I have a feeling they'll make a return in the next game though!"
"I think the fact that they give you all the 'tools' you need at the start takes out the need for over-linearity (is that a word?) Even in the first Zelda you still needed to hit certain dungeons before others because of various items you had to collect. BotW lets you run it as you want to run it. The only thing holding you back is the quality of your gear and your skills, and if your skills are good enough you don't even need that great a gear set."

"YOU CAN BUILD A MOUNTAIN,

I was across the lake during the 2003 forest fire in and around Kelowna BC. I was 5 and was coming out of the bathroom at a summer camp in the area one evening. Happened to catch a glimpse of the fire out of the corner of my eye. Point it out to my mom (my family was volunteering there which is why I was there) we just kinda wandered over to a little viewpoint and watched for a while
This is so fucking sad and creepy.. stay safe everyone.
"I've been waiting for this moment since it happened. 


Back in January my whole family got sick with some 'shitty' stomach flu. I was the Patient Zero and confined to my bed, where I slept all day and had vivid dreams about funhaus and that Bigfoot game on steam. One night I was woken out of a particularly hormonal dream about that one scene in the game where Bigfoot comes up to the camper door and grabs at you, by my older brother. I have a prescription of like -2.47 and woken up very suddenly, my brain registered the scene as my older brother shoving gay porn in my face. He was using his phone as a flashlight and was waving it in my eyes to see if I was awake.


*groggy deadpan* **""Why are you showing me gay porn.""**


My brother is 6 foot something and is smart as fuck. He's going to GW University in the fall on a scholarship or whatever, but he actually has the bumbling stick legs of a newborn fawn and the common sense to match. He was coming into my room for tissues cause he was out. His excuse was that his nose was stuffy and he plucked a single tissue from the box and made a big show of blowing his nose when he walked out. I was laughing my ass off as much as I could in a sleeping house as he retreated in humiliation. Later he came back into my room, told me to shut the fuck up, ""And for the record, it was straight."""
"Because at their core, they're unbelievably, incredibly ignorant."
"&gt; NOTE: No, i'm not an insecure unconfident son-of-a-bitch. My reasons include seeing things which can't be unseen. It's easy to say you love life when you've only seen the best life has to offer.

You can't ""unsee"" things, you can only learn to deal with them. And that's something pretty normal that lies in the nature of life itself. The prehistoric people surely would like to ""unsee"" their fallen brethren savagely torn apart by sabre-toothed tigers, but they moved on and that's the reason you're here. Life is a struggle, so make the most out of it before you inevitably get swallowed by the silence of eternity."

"Seven years ago, in high school, I set up my two friends to start dating. The guy was my neighbor and close friend, and the girl was a close friend from my church. My friend (the girl) told me last week that he sexually assaulted her and just generally abused her, emotionally and sexually, while they were together. Seven years later, she is still battling those demons. I haven't been close to the neighbor in years, but now it is taking everything in me to not scream in his face every time I see him. I can hear him having a graduation party right now, I've been thinking about crashing it all night. "

"I've shared this before, but several years ago I was on a road trip with two friends across the U.S. We played in a bluegrass band together and would spend days between gigs busking on busy sidewalks. 

One night we cleaned up pretty well at a club in Atlanta and decided to stay in town that night to spend an extra day busking in the city. We got a motel room on our modest budget in a sketchy part of town; the door of the room opened directly to the outside.

Two of us hauled our bags and instruments up to the second floor while one of the boys went to get ice. We poured the last of some cheap bourbon into three plastic cups and turned on the ancient antenna-style T.V. The only channel to come thru was showing an old western movie. We settled in for the night.

Maybe twenty minutes later, the landline phone rang. It startled us, but the guy who got the ice was closest to it and picked it up. After a few seconds it became pretty clear there was something weird about this call, and all of a sudden, my friend slammed the phone down on the hook, ran over to the door, locked it, and braced it with a desk chair.

He turned around slowly and told us the call was a man, who was pretending to be a woman, trying to lure him out of the room, presumably to hook up. We weren't sure if the guy on the phone followed us from the club, or just saw my friend walking back from the ice machine. We turned out all the lights and peeked out the window. There was a man sitting in a grey truck in the parking lot, just staring up at our room. 

We called the front office to complain, but they didn't do anything about it. We threw around the idea of calling the cops or just booking it out of there. We paced and drank and freaked out for what felt like an hour or so, then decided to look back out the window again. The man and his truck were gone.

None of us slept a wink that night. Still to this day creeps me out."

"TL;DR lost my virginity and almost got circumcised my first week in college



First week of college was great: roommates were nice, everyone was new and wanted to make friends with everyone so they always wanted to talk, and a lot of girls were looking for rebound guys after their summer flings before college.

Cue to the night before classes start; I had been talking to a girl I was interested in and convinced her to go on a date with me. We lived in the dorms and the bus lines to town hadn't started yet, so I was a little pressed for where to go, but I get a great idea: a nighttime picnic date to see the stars.

I set everything up: blanket, a tin of fruit, and a speaker I borrowed from my roommate. The college had an outdoor auditorium and it was the perfect spot, so I set up and call her down from her dorm. Things go good and she starts giving me a hand job to set the mood and then starts putting the condom on and gets on top of me. After about a minute, we see headlights and we realized that there was a car passing by, so we get scared and head back to the dorms.

I'm dropping her off at her dorm and I look down at our hands and they're covered in blood. She looks and immediately she gets freaked and tells me to rush to the dorm to check myself; she believes it's her but she wants to be certain. 

Let me back track real quick, so this girl was particularly girly and really liked having fake nails on.... You can kinda see where this is going...

I check my dick and this girl had accidentally cut my banjo string (I'm uncircumcised) holding the skin of my dick up, and that shit is squirting out blood everywhere. I had to go to the nurse in the morning because my dick was so fucking sore. When it healed I had a huge scar on my dick and I feel it whenever I jerk the chicken.

FUCK FAKE NAILS."
"I officiated a wedding at a VFW Club.

There was sawdust on the floor.

The groom was Hispanic and didn't speak English and the bride didn't speak Spanish. She was very pregnant. 

He was so nervous he got drunk.

The bride and her sister got into a screaming match that almost turned physical.

Then the Father of the Bride actually got into a fist-fight with his son right before the wedding (about some random shit from years before), so the son left and  took his little girls (the brides nieces - flower girl and ring barer) - not to mention the sound system with him, so no dance music for the reception

Fortunately, some random woman from the VFW bar could play the piano (because, yes, of course the place was still open during the wedding) and more or less new the Bridal March.

Oh, and it was catered by Taco Bell.

In the end I had to end our ""friendship"" when he informed me that he was using me to stabilise his mood. It was like he was feeding off me because his emotional dumps were draining me while making him feel better. "

That and the singleplayers utilizes way more of the map. The story really makes you see more of it
"Especially if the relationship they're in ends as a result of the other person catching them. Then the ""other man/woman"" becomes the significant other either because that's who the cheater is left with, or out of residual spite out of being caught. But that will be short-lived. 

They might tell you they initiated the breakup because they ""chose"" you. This is rare - if they say this happened, it's more likely their partner found out somehow and confronted them, and at that point they either denied it and got dumped, admitted it and got dumped, or sensed they were about to get dumped and said they had chosen the other person and was ""about to tell"" the partner to save face. But even if they truly, on their own, found the courage to face the person they hadn't been truthful with for a length of time based on their growing feelings for you...you're not that special. That person was special to them once too. You will be just as easily replaced if not easier, since they could say you were ""accepting"" of cheating with someone you knew was in a relationship, so you should have expected it and it's not their fault, and that's a fault in *your* character, so again, it's not their fault, it's yours."

"There were a lot of us that thought it was a long time coming. When I first joined people were trying their best to stay in the closet but most were pretty obvious. If someone got caught with a questionable pic on their FB it could get them kicked out. When the word came down they mandated the CO explained the new rules to everyone. So basically the head honcho had to tell every person under his command, from the XO to the jr crewman, about what was expected at the end he would take questions. The rules and changes were pretty boilerplate but the Q&amp;A session with the CO was when the real entertainment came out. Its no secret that the military is made up of all types of people including homophobes. There were certain people that were visibly disturbed with rules like they will be bunked with their gender and department. Many people thought there should be a gay berthing. Another rule was you cannot change racks to distance yourself from a gay crew member. One guy looked like he was about to start crying because his CO was telling him he cant move berthings to get away from gay people. For the most part the repeal of DADT didn't really give any gay person a reason to come out. The rule basically just said we will no longer fire you on the spot for your sexual orientation. They still didn't give spousal benefits(they fixed that shortly after) or any reason a gay person would want to come out at work. There were a couple of guys that had some serious issue with gay people being in the same living space as them. One guy asked what do I do if he looks at me after I get out of the shower? The CO asked what do you do now when people look at you after a shower? He didnt have an answer to that. There were more than a few guys who asked questions about how to prevent rapes. It was basically a workshop in what a gay person is to grown adults. The way some people talked gay people where some evil monsters that were out for blood. The reality of it was this was the first time some of those people ever addressed homosexuality. "

"Very early on in knowing my girlfriend, I introduced her to the legend that is the [Average Homeboy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXb6bjCCtuY). We looked through his most recent videos, because I guess his sudden popularity with his 80s music video on YouTube made him think maybe he was a good rapper (he isn't, here's one of his other songs: [Black Men Can't Swim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj5urT2VBxo)), and we found them all hilarious in that so-bad-it's-good kind of way.

Obviously some dumb, Denny Blaze-related joke had to follow. Her birthday was coming up in a few months, so I looked at Denny's website, and found a contact email address. I ended up talking to him back and forth, explaining how we were fans, in that joking kind of way, but he turned out to be a cool guy.

I said her birthday was coming up soon, so it'd be cool if I could get something signed for her. He said sure, he sold autographed photos through the website, of course I'm going to pay $10 for the sake of this stupid idea. He also mentioned it was his birthday the next week, then I mentioned mine was only a couple weeks later, and we found out that he lives less than an hour away from her.

We stopped emailing after 5 or 6 responses, then I went on with my life, awaiting the incredible gift I'd paid for. After two weeks of radio silence between the two of us, Denny Blaze emails me just to wish me a happy birthday.

The autographed photo turned up, addressed to the both of us, telling us to ""Keep Blazin!"" or something to that effect, even though I hadn't even asked for any kind of personalisation on the photo; I was just expecting some photo with a signature and I'd be happy with that.

Maybe it wasn't incredibly far to have to go for a stupid joke, but it's the most effort I've ever put into a birthday present."

"Hey man, I went through this too. Out of the blue I got a phone call, a fucking phone call, as she is a terrific graduate school program far away. In a few hours my summer plans to spend with her as well as my life plans I have been building for the last three years (all while she is working in school, but enjoying life otherwise) are gone. I got her a fucking high-caliber internship through personal contacts, a price which I will still have to return the favor for down the line. She even met someone else while at the job I got her. I decided to call things off after she refused to work things out over the summer.

Given how I see alot of similarities in this story, let me give you some advice. Of course, we aren't identical, nor are our (ex) SO's, but I hope this helps a bit.

1)This isn't something to be embarrassed about. I conflated it with failure, but its not a war to be won against her or life in general.
2)Mine was too cowardly to do it herself, I had too. It sucked; literally like losing a family member. (Which I had experienced only a few months before). But if you don't think she'll work it out WITH you (I tried single-handidly to fix it) don't waste twice the effort on the same result. 
3)If you do intend to work on it, seek a counselor. They can provide mediation and teach you healthy ways to communicate.
4)If your relationship ends, you and your dreams don't. I've dumped all my time, money, and effort wasted on her before back into myself and my friends. I've since done better at work, had some amazing opportunities, and did/are planning things that she never wanted to do (in retrospect she was really controlling). You can lose yourself easily in the turmoil. Don't be afraid to grieve, but don't let yourself come to idle in the middle of that storm that is grieving. I kept myself on track by writing down my goals. Whenever I got that depression or anger, I harnessed it and pushed towards one of my goals. But this transitions into my next point...
5)Don't compete with them/their new SO. Compete with yourself 3,6, or 12 months ago. Someone who truly loves you will want you to be better, and I believe that becoming better will attract someone who loves you.

Apparently it's very common. Someone presents in the ER or at the police station with beliefs in their divinity, and schizo disorders are the go to diagnosis."

Me:  Don't tell mom.  If she asks you have to tell her the truth, just don't volunteer it.

Me: just don't run in and tell her you got a lego set alright. If she doesnt ask, you don't have to tell her about it.

"Late to the party and all... Don't really care if someone reads, but it bugs the fuck out of me... But okay well here goes:

Got engaged on New Years two years ago. We were together 2 years before that, living together for 1,5. We were almost 5 years together and set the wedding date for July 1st this year.

On December she confessed to me she cheated on me. Then backtracked on her wording, and said that she WANTED to cheat, but didn't go all the way as the man wanted to use protection and she didn't use the pill (due to side effects it causes).

She confessed this at midnight and I was going to work in 5 hours. Drove her to her mother's place and left my ring in her hand. Drove home, slept what I could sleep. Thought it over at work. When I propose... I mean it. This would be her only and last chance. Earlier she told me to cut off all contact to one of our mutual friends. Didn't think about it more at the time, the two were always at odds every now and again. She'd have moodswings due to her braindamage and he'd have some personal difficulties to work through... So I just figured I should stick with my SO.

Aaaand scrolling forward a few months... Sunday. She had left to her moms and decided to stay the night. I'd get pretty mad since we'd planned to do some dinner and whatnot... Gave it a rest and went to sleep. After the following workday, I came home and started booking flights for honeymoon, figuring out the special arrangements for her wheelchair and whatnot.

She came home, walked over to the bed next to me and said it's over. She doesn't love me and hasn't loved for a year. Which was a little odd since... She would seek comfort from me for everything and say she loves me etc... She blamed it all on me, I've changed her and all. (Remember the braindamage? Yah, doc's opinion was that it's more than likely it's going to change her but whatever)

I was... Devastated. Everything was kinda OK and wedding was almost planned. Took a 15k loan for it and spent most of the money. She had gotten her reparations for the damage a little earlier to our joint account and I was crushed later when I noticed I had less than 1k to pay all the bills. Had to stay working but with what strength...

Later found out... She had been cheating on me for reals... multiple times with several people.... Sooo I had to get tested (results came back clean) but... Man... I thought I knew her. That mutual friend I wasn't allowed to talk to? She'd told him everything on Dec and he threatened to tell me unless she did herself. About all the cheatings... But I was only told the one half-truth...

She had a horrible childhood... Knew how I felt and that I'd most likely not survive if she broke up like the way she did. (Denied any contact and had to leave my home for a weekend so I someone would look after that I wouldn't kill myself... She took my old PC, kinda all the valuable stuff and leave the house looking like it's robbed...)

Yah... I was... In a bad shape. For a long time. Kinda cobbled together that her sister (who didn't like me, blamed me for her damage and all) was kinda aware of her plans and that she was already dating someone else... It didn't help that I grew to trust her mom and family for some stuff and suddenly they just... Treated me like I was no one and complete dirt.

Still hurts... Badly. Honestly no idea what the fuck I did to deserve it... But then again... Her web of lies were kinda so wide spread so I think I was almost about to find out about the truth of her double life... When I began dating her I had to acquire goverment protection due to her father's... Past and present... So I'm in still 'hiding and in protection'... It makes my life kinda difficult, but... yah...

And since she's better off than I am, she's lied to everyone already and I'm treated like I'm a cheater and master manipulator... Recieved some hatemail in a game we used to play from her fellow gamers... Yah...

I know this is kinda hard to follow through... But can't kinda help it. This how much I can concentrate on stuff nowadays... Used to be very thoughtful... =P"

"TL;DR: dog got bitten by a rottweiler.

My mum's friend owns an energetic and disobedient shar-pei. This breed of dog are wrinkly as fuck, like 80 year old grandpa's saggy ballsac wrinkly. It makes keeping them on a leash difficult as they have so much loose skin they can easily slip off the collar.

I was walking the dog when exactly that happened, he got off the fucking leash. Worse still, a dude walking a wolf-sized rottweiler was heading towards us. I stood frozen, 100% sure the shar-pei was dog meat as he charged towards the rottweiler, and then the dumb dog leapt up and grabbed the rottie's neck. The rottie jerked sideways and twisted, snapping it's jaws on the shar-pei's back, but before it could do any serious damage it's owner somehow defused the situation with a few pats and tugs on the leash (like Cesar Milan on the Dog Whisperer does). I ran after ""my"" dog, empty leash in hand, shouting ""sorry!"" to the completely confused dude as I passed. His rottie gave zero fucks and was waiting for the walk to resume. 

I caught up to ""my"" dog after a while (stupid cunt wanted to play tag) and inspected the injury. I was expecting deep wounds and blood, but there were only two small pricks on his back. I leashed him back up and took him home, washed the cuts, and admired how fortunate we both were that nothing worse had halpened. 

When my mum's friend got back she thought he had scraped his skin off rolling on the stone patio trying to get rid of ticks. I let her believe that. I never heard a complaint from the dude with the rottweiler, nor from any of the shar-pei's owner's neighbours, and I'm glad. The lady paid me 250 bucks for ""looking after Brutus so well"" even though I damn near got him killed. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Edit: just felt I had to add that I dislike immensely dog owners who refuse to train their dogs in simple obedience, because they think their dog acting hyper and spoilt is ""cute"" or ""natural."" It is annoying as fucking shit hell, and can even be dangerous if a dog has never been taught any obedience. If you're too lazy/timid/useless to train a dog, get a cat instead. Isn't the whole appeal of having a dog the loyalty and obedience they can demonstrate?"

It would be a lesser drain on China, since an NK 'peasant' is closer to a Chinese rural farmer, both in what they do and how they do it.  That said, SK would be able to train the new population faster than China could (or would try to), and they wouldn't be a drain for long.  

As for suddenly being able to compete on a range of industries they couldn't before - not only do they have to train the labor force, but they also have to buy or build factories, tooling, machinery, and the infrastructure to expand those industries.

"I was snorkeling in La Jolla Cove near San Diego. This place is crowded with scuba divers, snorkelers, and kayakers. It also has sea lions. Lots and lots of sea lions. I saw them all on the rocks away from the people, so I naturally assumed they would keep their distance from all the people in the water. I got separated from my dive buddy (always a bad idea) and started exploring the coastal caves by myself. Since I was looking down into the water, I did not realize the rocks above me were covered with momma sea lions and their pups. I was in a part of the cave that was maybe 5 feet wide and 8 feet deep when I see a sea lion swim right below me, literally two feet or less from me. Since I was in a shallow cave, it seemed to come out of nowhere. I swim along and try to get away from the sea lion rookery, only to encounter 8 to 10 more sea lions. Not another human in sight. These things are huge. Like 7 feet long and 700 pounds. With big teeth. Like lions of the sea. Apparently, I was not the first snorkeler they have encountered, so they swam very close to me, but otherwise left me unharmed. "

"I recently bought a new ""big kid"" safety seat for my 4 year old.

Cheap safety seat:  $18 at Target.  Five star rating.  Has removable and washable covers and two cupholders (why?).  Appropriate for any child aged 4 and up, weighing 40-100 lbs.

Expensive safety seat:  $215 at Target.  Five star rating.  Is made out of carbon fiber and has memory foam gel inserts (what is ""foam gel?  Who knows?).  Has a back that is removable.  Usable with back for ages 4 and up, weighing 30 lbs or more, or without back for ages 4 and up, weighing 40 lbs or more.  Has four cup holders (*WHY?*).  Comes in ""cool"" colors (the pink version of the exact same chair was $15 cheaper).

So I looked at these two chairs and I bought the cheap one.  You're paying almost $200 more for a back that your kid will either never use or will barely use (most 4 year olds already weigh nearly 40 lbs, if not more - mine weight 39.5 lbs the day he turned 4 and he's average weight), 2 extra cupholders (which is still 3 more than you need), and cool carbon fiber and colors.

"The problem with having the droids in the prequel it ends up raising a ton of questions regarding the original trilogy. Because all of a sudden everyone during the Rebellion War forgets the two droids who played a crucial role in the Clone Wars. Of course we get a half hearted hand wave because droids can have their memories erased and no one else pays attention to droids. But this doesn't dismiss the fact that Darth Vader would almost certainly remember the droid he named C-3PO that he built when he was a little boy.

And one of the references to the droids should've been Chewbacca. Chewbacca also didn't need to be in the prequels. Neither did the Wookies in general. The fact that Chewbacca worked side by side with Yoda raises a whole bunch of unnecessary issues in the original movies especially Empire.

My grandfather who's wife took countless years taking care of him gave the house to said son. Said son won't let her own the house and she can't afford to leave. He won't repair her air conditioning, even though we live in Miami during one of the hottest years to date. She has a separate studio apartment on the same land that me and my sister (college students) could live in and help pay her bills while taking care of her. He decided to scrap the inside and wants to rent it to a stranger. Both me and sister offered him our complete student refund checks and offered to pay to refurbish the interior, told us no he didn't want family in there. When his sister fiancé beat her and she snapped and defended herself with a knife, his words were ""her problem, should've called the police"".

"I was 20 years old and my wife was 19. She was seven months pregnant and had an appointment for her second ultrasound. We go in and the Ultrasound Technician is having trouble finding the heartbeat. She keeps trying and still gets nothing, but tells us that sometimes it is hard to find. She takes the measurements and takes us to a different room. We are waiting for what seems like an eternity and I have a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach. My wife is worried and although I am a Deist, I am praying to God to just let everything be okay. The doctor comes in and sits down, before e has a chance to say anything, my wife asks, ""Is he gone?"" The doctor says, ""Yes, I'm sorry."" We both break down in tears and after discussing the next steps with the doctor, we head to her parents' house. We don't speak much on the way there, but I remember her gripping my hand very tightly the whole drive over. We walk into her parents house and my wife calls out, ""Mom?"" Her mom knows something is wrong, but before she can ask, my wife says, ""He's gone!"" Her mom, shocked and confused, just says, ""What?!"" and immediately starts crying. After things calm down a bit, I need to start making phone calls since my family was living states away from me at the time. My parents and grandparents dropped what they were doing to come out and help us through it. My wife had to go to the hospital a couple days later so they could induce labor and the funeral was a couple days after that. That was the worst day of my life so far. Luckily, time does in fact heal all wounds and we are still happily married eight years later with a happy, healthy three year old son.

"The disorder was named long before anyone really understood anything about it. Actually recent studies have shown that people with autism tend to experience empathy MORE strongly than neurotypicals, but just lack the ability to read others' emotions, so what seems like not caring is simply not understanding.

And if someone was actually a ""home run"" on the spectrum, they wouldn't have a kid nor be on the internet talking about how much they don't care about that kid, they'd be unable to interact with people at all. So no, having a kid and talking about how much you don't care about them isn't an example of autistic behavior."

"Everyone I've talked to on this subject is always so obsessed with where things **began**. Let's instead consider the here and now. Within the scope of the theories put forth by the scientific community at large, our universe is [roughly 14 billion years old](https://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_age.html). In keeping with the theory of evolution upon our planet of Earth, the human species as we know it is roughly [200,000 years old](https://www.universetoday.com/38125/how-long-have-humans-been-on-earth/). Again, in keeping with these complementary theories, that would mean that the entirety of our species, from the moment we evolved and diverged from our ancient common ancestors has lived for approx.. 0.001% of the lifespan of the universe.

I don't know about you, but that makes me feel **existentially tiny and unimportant**. But that may simply just be the reality.

I, personally, think that the theory of evolusion and the collective theories of our universe's existence (not *beginning*, but existence, such as the theory of relativity and others) is plausible enough and makes enough sense based on what I have observed, and what has been observed objectively by others. That's what science is. It's not a belief system. It is a consensus that is reached mutually by scientists based on studies that are conducted and replicated in order to achieve efficacy.

To my point about feeling unbelievably small - I think that religion was created very early on as an answer to these burning questions - why are we here? What is our purpose? - and the hubristic assumption that it must be more than chance, that it must be more than **nothing at all**. Religion makes us feel important. Wanted. Loved. When in reality, we are a small blip of space-dust hurtling at ungodly speeds towards the endless cosmos. Our solar system could pass through a nebula five hundred thousand times its size. Our lives could all be winked out instantly, without any of us realizing what happened. Our sun will one day explode, long after we are gone.

We, as a species, are less than a millisecond in the lifespan of our universe."

"As an adult who had my dad walk out on me when I was 6, that's a bunch of absolute nonsense. This tale that you have told yourself to assuage your guilt. 

The psychological pain of having a parent abandon you is unbelievably great and reverberates through adulthood. Abandoning your kid is basically telling him he wasn't worth fighting for. Wasn't worth knowing, loving and caring for as he grew up.  

Kids need their dad. Even if my dad took the time to visit, that would have hurt so much less than being abandoned. 

Your opinion is frankly wrong and cowardly. Your son will never fully forgive you for abandoning him. Nor should he. "

My uncle brought the ashes to the service, and they were going to place them in the urn in the plastic bag they were in, but it wouldn't fit. So they cut the bag open and tried to pour them in, which was . . . messy. And they still wouldn't all fit. This was the point at which I had to leave the room.

"Had a student whose brother committed suicide.

We also brought in a counsellor for a few weeks to help students who were struggling with their mental health - this counsellor was awesome and made sure that every kid she talked to was equipped with the knowledge and resources they needed. Other than that, we made sure to stay in contact with the student and they're family and provide any help or comfort that they needed. The student was in quite a few of my classes and I just made sure to check in with her daily and try to be as understanding as I could be. We didn't divulge any personal details to any of the other students as that was not our place to do so, but we did give this student space to grieve and we were extra lenient when it came to homework and missing class.

"Well... yeah. To even do it properly, we'd have to have a humanoid robot that can mimic even the most minute facial expressions and voice inflections, since that's how infants learn. We'd also have to make sure that robot reflects the infant well enough, as it's the beginning of the process of ""self"", comprehending who you as an individual are in the Grand Scheme of Things. 

Hence why stuff like Baby Einstein and Dora the Explorer are absolutely god-awful for teaching your child any sort of language: they can't actually make out the way the mouth and tongue move in relation to the teeth/gums and sounds they're making. Once a child gets old enough to internally comprehend how to move your mouth/tongue to make specific sounds and tones, they can actually make use of stuff like Dora or Baby Einstein or the old 90s standby for rich worldly white people, Muzzy. Even then, you gotta start it young, since after age 5 there are some tones in some languages that are used constantly, but are never used in English, and you apparently can *never* perfectly pronounce it if you learned it later in life.

And that's just language, that's not even counting all the OTHER shit that children learn by supposition and inflection and nuance. Robots will not be able to do that shit properly for I'm guessing at least another 100 years.

SOOO many parallels to the cigarette industry of ~40-50 years ago. Something most people think is perfectly healthy and don't even worry about.

Beyond all that, the livestock industry is an enormous ecological disaster. It's a leading cause of: climate change, ocean dead zones, deforestation, and species extinction.

Beyond all THAT, for much of the world, it is a huge ethical blind spot masquerading as culture. Not only will it be looked at like the cigarette industry, it will be seen with ethical and moral disgust by future generations."

"We had 2 students succeed and a 3rd attempt within a week.  It was pretty rough, the 2 that succeeded were not in my class but were the previous semester.  It was rough at first, and there was paranoia about copycats following.  Kids close to the 2 were very shaken, but it was a large school so the reverberations were short.  It seemed like a week or two later it wasn't someone talked about anymore.  It was tragic that they made that decision to end their life, but like everything else in the world we all moved on.  I would imagine that there were a few students deeply moved, I know it bothered me for a while.  But at this point i can only remember 1 of the threes students names.

"No video display device on the market today is technically superior to the best CRTs, in *any* video performance-related way. The only current display technology that's even in the same league as a CRT is OLED (because they are both emissive display technologies), but that's only when the OLED is brand new, because they degrade so fast. A CRT still has the advantage of being able to sync to multiple resolutions, while all digital display devices are inherently fixed-resolution, and can only simulate other resolutions by scaling the image before displaying it, which looks bad.

A CRT's black levels can't be beaten; the best that any other technology can do is match a CRTs black levels. CRTs, being an emissive display technology, display black by simply not firing any electrons at the phosphors, which means no light is generated, which is the very definition of black. LCDs for example, are backlit, and none of the LCD panel types (e.g., TN, IPS, VA) can perfectly block the backlighting in order to display a true black.

A CRT's response time can't be beaten, because the electron guns respond to the video signal at the speed of electricity, which is effectively a real-time response. At best, a CRT's response time can only be matched, and current display technologies have response times measured in milliseconds. Even 1 ms is an eternity compared to a CRT's response time.

A CRT's color range can't be beaten, because the colors are analog driven, therefore there are infinite possible levels between off and fully energized on each of the three guns (red, green, and blue). The best you can do against ""infinite"" is match it, and that will never happen with digital display devices, no matter how large of a bit-depth they assign to each color.

Digital display devices are cheaper to manufacture, take up less space for a given screen size, are practical to manufacture in large screen sizes, and are more energy-efficient than CRTs. That's why they are in the position they are now. As for video performance, they are still playing catch-up to CRTs, even though it's been about a decade since the last CRTs were manufactured. They should be embarrassed. "

"I'm not saying we should avoid whole plant foods at all. I have a few pounds of broccoli in my freezer myself. :p

What I am saying is that the propaganda that says we should be making up the majority of our diets with carbohydrates such as bread, rice, potatoes, grains, etc, is outright false. Broccoli, overall, is pretty low carb, but it has a lot of nutrients in it. All I'm establishing is that you don't have to have carbohydrates to survive. Carbohydrates aren't essential, because our bodies are designed to make them on their own. They're the only macronutrient (fat, protein, carbs) that we can legitimately live without as long as we have enough of the other two. We cannot live without proteins &amp; fats, because we have no way to produce them. 

The fact that the American diet is loaded with refined carbohydrates and heavy carbs like rice and the others I previously listed is the biggest issue. Restaurants don't like to serve anything green; they like to serve cheap carbs. Every mainstream restaurant I've been to recently, it's hard to find a green vegetable on the menu. 

Insulin problems in the US are directly related to people eating too many carbohydrates and the idea that we should be eating from the time we get up until the time we go to sleep. The idea that we should have breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner, bedtime snack, then a midnight snack if we wake up and feel hungry is pervasive in US culture when we actually should be eating no more than 1 or 2 times a day. Our insulin is spiked all day, every day because we're consuming food all day, every day. Insulin causes weight gain, so your body is constantly in fat storage mode when your insulin is up. "
"People don't experience things anymore.

It used to be that whenever someone would go on a hike or out to dinner (or whatever else), they'd be present in the moment and enjoying themselves. Nowadays, it seems like every fork in the road needs to be documented by an onslaught of hashtags. People used to anticipate the arrival of their food at a restaurant; now they watch for it through Instagram filters. Vacations have become little more than opportunities to take selfies, passing moods prompt Facebook status updates rather than any kind of introspection, and it probably won't be long before someone tries to live-Tweet their own wedding.

We take pictures that nobody looks at, share thoughts that nobody reads, and offer opinions that nobody wants to hear. We block our own view of the world by looking at it through a lens and on a screen.

"Most methods of backing up files maintain a complete backup along with incremental backups at different dates to save space, but unless you have unlimited money and storage, at some point your backup system is going to start throwing away the oldest stuff.  While I wouldn't put it past a company of Facebook's size to never throw anything out, even large companies sometimes have issues with, for instance, an employee sneaking something malevolent into the system some time before they quit thereby making it *very* difficult to recover when they leave as the last good copy has already aged out of the system.  By introducing the changes very slowly over time, you are increasing the likelihood that the original data is no longer entirely backed up, and the remaining data is now suspect to the point where it isn't possible to definitively say whether any particular piece is valid or not, and even if all the original data is still there you've made it a lot harder to identify at what point the invalid data started slipping in."

One of the frustrations of early development is getting that kid to eat.

One thing they will do, when all else fails, is give the kid junk food. Good old fashioned sugar, in any form, will almost always get results. Puffs, cheetos, crackers, cookies, anything to get a few bites for dinner.

""I know it's not the best, but at least it is *something*"", those poor desperate parents will always declare.

No. No it's not. Feeding those kids sugar is nothing short of putting a toxic deadly substance in their bodies. It doesn't kill you right away - neither do cigarettes - but it does kill you. It is a step backwards, be sure of that, and did not give your kids anything their bodies can use.

"This past weekend I went to one of those trampoline parks for my friends birthday, and I being a big male (roughly 240lbs) was happily bouncing all of my cares away when this little punkass kid decides he wants to run across my trampoline while I was gleefully laughing. When he started across mine and did a big bounce and stopped myself from going up causing all of the built up momentum in the trampoline to go into the kid launching him face first into the trampoline next to us. It may have been the best thing that I have ever done. "

"If strengthen immune system is the end goal, I think there is a more methodical way doing it than randomly eat cheeto off the ground.

Kind of like that Australian snake venom guy who keep inject him self with snake venom daily and gradually up the dosage, and eventually build up poison immunity to the point that snake bite no longer faze him.

So potentially we could develop vaccine for infectious bacteria and virus of various lethality, and we gradually vaccinate our selves with more and more deadlier version of these bacteria. Eventually we could become some kind of super immune monster that can eat ebola pus filled burger out of septic tank soup and still wouldn't get sick.

Not sure where I'm going with this, I just find this mental image pretty funny."

"There are ways to reduce your risks of bad outcomes.  I had it, and love it.  
1) Select a center that does ""all laser"" surgery (""bladeless"").  They can cut the flap with a razor or a laser.  The starbursts are usually caused by ""flap"" problems.  There is lower risk of this with bladeless surgery. It is often more expensive ($200-$400 per eye).

2) Select a very experienced surgeon, not the cheapest.  Surgeons who have done more, do better.  Ask questions at your appointment about how many the surgeon has done, how long, complication rate. 

3) Follow instructions.  Wear the safety glasses, don't touch your eyes, put in the drops, etc.  

There are no guarantees, but the risk is less than 1% if you have an experienced surgeon and all laser treatment and follow instructions.  "

Yes, the song is based around a cover of Eleanor Rigby. "

"I dunno. I don't get this. I'm ten years out of high school. I would NEVER go back. High school and uni were WAY harder and shittier than adult life. 

I go to work. Come home. Chill with my baby and love of my life. I always have enough money for food. To be fair, we have chosen to live a very simple life to save money... Tiny house, solar power, collected water. So my only bills are insurance on the house and car and my $26 phone bill each month. Oh and property tax once a year. But so worth it.

Still. Christ. I way prefer bills to no control. If my job suddenly sucked, I could go elsewhere. High school? Trapped. I can buy the food I like. Do what I want, when I want. I want to go overseas for a month over Christmas? I'm going. 

But then, I took school very seriously. Got scholarships so my loans were minimal. Lived cheaply so I could pay it off. But it's not like I make millions. I'm a teacher and my husband is a tradesman. "

The other issue is that, in a lot of cases, abstinence only education tend to literally only teach that (I would know, I had sex ed in an abstinence only school). You don't learn safe sex practices or what protocols to follow with STDs other than they are bad and should be avoided at all costs. And even if everyone did wait until marriage, that type of education helps NO ONE. Your partner can have an STD even if you're married to them. You can still have an unplanned pregnancy with your spouse. So it's better to cover safe sex in any case rather than just saying ""don't have sex before marriage, or you'll get AIDS and pregnant"".

When I asked the server for the check, he told me, ""it's already been taken care of by someone."" I asked my him who, but he said they wanted to be anonymous and just wanted to do something nice for a soldier. I was shocked. No one had ever done something like this for me before, least of all an faceless stranger, but it was an act of kindness I have replicated through the years now."

 I called my dad and he had said that traffic was crazy and it would probably take me close to 6 hours to get home. I was already exhausted from the traffic leaving savannah, and I had a vomit covered cat and several anxious lizards with me. 

So my dad calls around, trying to find somewhere for me to stay. They were aquantinces of this couple that lived in Macon, and they agreed to let me stay the night till traffic cleared up. 

Me, my sick cat, and three lizards drove to a huge elaborate mansion, where the woman fed us, allowed me to bathe my cat (he gets carsick) and gave us a soft bed. 

Might not seem like much, but it meant a lot to me that these virtual strangers were there for us. They even said I could stop in whenever I go through Macon! "

"You can lose your home if you don't have a reverse mortgage and are unable to pay taxes.  Eventually the local government takes the home.  

Reverse Mortgages aren't evil, they're protecting their investment. They give you a bunch of money upfront based on your homes value.  If that collateral no longer has the same value they have to step in to protect their investment.  I don't know if they're being up front enough about this, because I don't need a reverse mortgage so I've never looked into it deeply enough.

"Jews wear kippahs and some temples separate the men from women (and there are certain books that men are exclusively mean to read).

Mormons are Mormans, through and through, but there are some communities that only require certain things at certain times. The temple garment isn't necessarily worn by every individual Mormon unless they're in Church, for instance.

You're right, just make sure there's someone to look after them. It's really not that hard. My wife and I don't question each other one bit if we want a night out with friends, but you just have to have a healthy relationship.

Just make sure you have some money saved up, enough to cover your living expenses until you can get a new job. Yes, you'll have to save a little more because you're feeding more people, but that's life.

Shaming people is often contrary to people getting their shit together.  Picture the guy who is unemployed and chronically depressed, so he puts very little effort into his job search.  Do you think shaming him is likely to motivate him?

"Anyone who orders potato skins as an appetizer instantly puts me on red alert.

I went on a date with a girl once, Alicia. I had gotten a $50 giftcard to Applebee's for my birthday and suggested we go there. She got the potato skins appetizer and we had a lively conversation. We ended up dating casually for three or four months until I caught her cheating on me with an ex. Strike one, potatoes.

I found myself at the 'Bees a little while later and sat myself at the bar and began to work my way through an ocean of Blue Hawaiians. One of the girls at our office had a second job as a waitress there and I kind of had a thing for her so I wanted to accidentally-on-purpose run into her there and show her the cool new shirt I got from Old Navy. Anyway, she wasn't working that night so, dud. But while I was steadily losing sheets to the wind, I overheard part of an absolutely disastrous first date going on at a nearby table. 

The guy was a neckbearded wreck of a man. He had sweat stains reaching across the back of his ill-fitting *Merona* brand dress shirt like hideous angel wings. He had clearly shaved for the first time in weeks mere hours before the date (judging by the iridescent razor burn on his chubby face) and was stuttering through every red-pill cliche in the book. The girl was a solid 7 so I don't know what shitty life choices led her to her rendezvous with Flops McSweatty, but she was already eyeing the door by the time I noticed their presence. Every word out of her mouth was *Yeah. Uh-huh.* And he was laying it on thick: *I b-bet you'd be pretty too if you t-tried, y-you know?* This guy should have been eating broken glass out of this girl's hand and he's trying the negging shit. Unbelievable.

He got up to use the bathroom (and if he had a brain in his head, change into an emergency shirt and put on more deodorant) and I made my move. I introduced myself to the girl and offered to take her to a bar I knew nearby for some decent food. (Did not know a bar. Ended up going for pizza.) She just up and left the date while her dude was in the shitter. Long story short, we made out a bunch and I got a wicked zipper burn on my junk from some fortuitous grinding but she dodged my texts going forward. As we were leaving the restaurant I noticed her order-- a barely touched plate of fully loaded potato skins. *Strike two.*

The third one isn't anything special but I took my mom out for her birthday dinner and there's this greasy spoon type place by her house that she likes. We went there and she ordered the deluxe, extra bacon potato skins which sent my neck hairs aprickle. I told her about the previous two experiences and she started lecturing me about always trying to pick up women at restaurants and how Blue Hawaiians were for bitches. I told her I didn't need to take her shit and she smacked my buffalo wing out of my hand which was really fucking uncalled for. The place we were at serves their wings really saucy and the half-eaten wing bounced off the table and hit me in the chest, staining my awesome new shirt (unrelated to aforementioned shirt.) I tried using OxyClean to get it out when we got back to my mom's house but she keeps fucking salt in the OxyClean tub which just chewed up my shirt and broke her washer. I had to buy her a new one and it wasn't cheap. I told her it was her fault for getting the god damn potato skins and she called me a bad son. Thanks a lot, potato skins. *Strike three.*"

I ran up to the doors and stuck my foot in between just in time for us to get in. We all stood inside very silent and awkwardly. I looked in the reflection in the door to see the couple have this discusted, scared look on their faces. I didnt give a fuck about their feelings and i made sure they knew that. "

"I makes me glad my grandpa isn't alive to see this.  I don't think he would mind Nazis openly marching, he was always very adamant about people having the right to free speech. However I think seeing people attacking others over their beliefs would have really upset him.

They got along fine enough, I think he understood that it was the way she was raised, they were her beliefs and she had the right to them.  Although they didn't agree on a lot of things he had no ill feelings to her and was genuinely upset when she passed.

It is one thing to have hateful beliefs and another to use those beliefs to attack others."

The 10 year was on august 1st.
"Former ERACer here. Got a couple - did it for almost six years. Left as a BM. Grossing almost 50% more now and I'm only 8 months out of rental.  I made some good friends there but it just wasn't for me anymore. 

Had a 40 year old grown ass man use his mom to rent a car (she barely qualified herself). They're pretty rude coming in to pick up. Would only take a Malibu or Impala. 
Come back a week later, seems fine. Return done without much fuss. Get a call from them an hour later from them demanding the vehicle. Wouldn't specify why. Of course it's summer time and we rolled it 5 minutes after they returned. The son is threatening to call the cops and keeps repeating how much trouble we will be in if we don't help him. So I do my due diligence, call the customer and get the car brought back. He called the police anyway. 
Malibus and Impalas have a ""hidden"" compartment behind the infotainment screen. He left an unlicensed handgun in there. The police did get involved. In the end, one pissed off 40 year old man who couldn't rent his old car is in a lot of trouble.  Well, he got himself in trouble. 

Second story. Guy is going through an insurance claim. Said his car was stolen. Everything is going fine with the rental for the first two weeks. Then one day insurance stops paying for any further days on the rental. No notes why. His card declines for further deposits (of course). I call the adjustor handling the file. 
Adjustor says they found out the car wasn't stolen. It was repoed. Customer lied to them. Won't return our calls. Do the whole skip trace, stolen vehicle report thing. Drive by the address he gave us, it's a random business and no one there knows who he is. We get it towed in. Guy has been living in it for about 3 weeks and it smells like...well it's a hard smell to describe.  Not *bad* but very *used*. 
Inside we found: sleeping bags, clothes. A bunch of porn dvds. Lotion. Vibrators of all different sizes, some still in brand new packaging. 

Last one. This ERAC lot (like many) is in a bad location. Open lot with barely any security. We forget to lock the cars one night. Come in the next morning and this huuuuuge homeless lady is sleeping in one of our SUVs. Numerous bottles of hard liquor are strewn about the car and she is butt naked.  Car is rank with the smell of sweat and sex. 
Walk up. ""Excuse me ma'am, you aren't supposed to be here.""
She stammers something incoherent. 
""Ma'am, we are about to open and I need to ask you to leave""
More incoherency. Then she says ""you're making me feel very uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment!!""
""Ma'am please exit the vehicle or I will have the police department forcibly remove you.""
She struggles up and gets out.  Pops a squat in the middle of my lot and pisses everywhere then runs away. 

Edit I lied. Two more.

"It's a good habit to get into.  One trick I learned from a book that I never thought of was storing large, complex if statement conditions  in one or more bool variables named in such a way that naturally describes what they do.  The compiler was optimizing the variables away anyways, and it made things much clearer than trying to explain what was happening with a comment.  

Over-commenting obvious code doesn't really hurt, but it's wasteful and can cause a future reader to skim over comments instead of reading them, missing the ones that are actually important. "

This mind set will help with a lot of the other suggestions in this thread. You'll be less nervous because you're less worried about impressing him. You'll be less likely to feel pressured into doing something that you don't want to do or that might be dangerous because you're thinking about whether you like/trust him instead of what if saying no makes him not like you.  

It's not necessarily an easy mind set to switch to, but it can make a world of difference."

"When you get married in the military, they pay you allowances for housing and food. Another massive draw for a lot of people that are enlisted is that you don't live in the barracks if you're married.

An older child could call police or family and say ""my parents haven't come back for 3 hours"" a 6 month d could not. They leave the window open-- perfect opportunity for someone to break in. 

There was an article about a mother who left a young child (I think 6 years old) home alone overnight (while she was sleeping) and her apartment building burnt down while she was away. The kid wasn't saved and died. 

There are literally so many things that could go wrong. Why can't one parent stay with the baby? Or why can't they take the child? At 6 months babies are still relatively quiet, they don't want and most can't even sit-up yet so they are calm in their car seat.

"Cropping pit bulls ears started back when dogfighting was a popular sport. Ears are a weak spot that bleed very heavily, so it was common to crop them to prevent other dogs from being able to latch onto them. 

It's similar to why Dobermans who do police/security work have their ears cropped short; prevents people from grabbing them to try and escape from/hurt the dog.

So basically, there isn't much of a reason to crop a pit bulls ears (unless your vet recommends it) outside of wanting it to look ""tough"". I have two pits, and both of them are uncropped.

"My last apartment started off being awesome. Really clean and well managed, had a really nice maintenance guy there 8-5 m-f. Then they sold it at the end of the year and didn't tell anyone. Maintenance guy left for holiday break and never came back. Got a letter in the mail from solme new company stating I had to come sign a new lease and pay them. Super shady but turned out to be legit, and they no longer had maintenance on site, but would contract it out. No longer sprayed for bugs or changed filters, just said to call in if any issues and they'd get someone on it when they could. Started letting crappy neighbours move in. Valentine's day, I was sitting on my couch when I heard a couple downstairs the next building over yelling. I went outside, made a few coughs to get their attention and walked to my mail box giving them a look. That quieted them down for about 5 minutes. Then I hear their glass shatter, (guy punched through their front window in a fit of rage) at which point I grabbed my 9mm (had it out on the coffee table anyways) and walked out on the balcony to hear them screaming again. Cleared the chamber, and the sound echoed off the brick walls. Whole place fell silent. Not another peep rest of the night. I called the new management the next day to complain, and they had called in and said they accidently broke the glass and needed it replaced. Management thanked me for letting them know, as evidently none of the other tenants called in. I moved out 2 months later and had to pay over a grand to break the lease, but it was the best money I've ever spent.

If they said they want it to match and the daughter had a dirty blonde hair i would pull out light brown. The mom would say my daughter is blonde we want blonde i would show the blonde and it would be almost white. I would explain to the parent that once we add gel to her hair it will be darker so light brown will match the blonde will not. About 3-5 times a week a mom would demand we use blonde and I would then at the end of it the mom would yell at me saying i said it would match and this looks horrible and i lied to them and they weren't paying for this.

"Depends on where you're at, many states have what's called a [Stand Your Ground Law](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Stand-your-ground_law). 

The law has different interpretations, and it doesn't mean necessarily that if someone is stealing your property you have a right to shoot/kill them. What it does say is that in the event that you are in immediate danger and someone has the intent to harm or kill you, you have the right to defend yourself.

So in that case if someone came up to your car with a loaded weapon and attempted to car jack you, you could shoot them. In a state that has a stand your ground law, you likely won't be charged for murder, attempted murder, etc. 

There is also the [Castle Doctrine](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Castle_doctrine). You would need to read up on the specifics for each state, but taking the same scenario as above - in some states, regardless if that person had a weapon on them or not, if they are attempting to unlawfully enter your property (which a vehicle is considered in this case), you have the right to defend it even in the course that the defense results in death.

There have been cases where these laws were abused and allowed people to get away with murder, but that's not their intention. Usually you have to show evidence that the the person was under immediate threat and was defending themselves from a violent attacker.

Basically though, just don't break into peoples homes or try and steal their cars - not that hard."

She's happily married now, finished grad school, and settled in her chosen career. I still talk to her every once in awhile.

"IDK the particulars of OP's situation, but there are a ton of factors that can make you ""not realize"" you were raped.

* It happened while you were asleep. 

If you're in a relationship, you like a person. You don't want to think of them as a rapist, so you rationalize, ""Well I never said DON'T have sex with my body while I'm asleep...

* You became aroused/enjoyed the act.

Both genders are victims of this, make no mistake. ""She couldn't rape you if you weren't hard and if you were hard, you obviously wanted it."" No. It's a biological response to stimulation, end of story. See item 1 for ""You don't want to believe this person you love is a rapist.""

* You were coerced, but technically said some words of consent.

That's not consent. That's still rape.

* You agreed to sex under false pretenses. 

This one has a lot of grey area and probably isn't what OP went through. A good example is agreeing to sex with condom usage and the condom is intentionally removed during the act or was never applied in the first place. (Genitals have variable sensitivity and lubricant can have a numbing effect. Why do I bring this up? Because I've seen people claim it's not rape because the victim should have known immediately that there wasn't a condom and stopped the assault. Which is ridiculous on the face of it because obviously the not-agreed-to-penetration had to have already begun for this argument to hold any weight whatsoever, but this is the world we live in.)

But I also think your question is offensive and ridiculous on the face of it if you're not under the age of 12. By the time you're a teenager you should know that when someone you care about and trust does something bad to you, you may not realize it until much later. You might still hurt in the moment, but you might not have words for how you were hurt for years.

When your mother calls you a weakling and a failure for being sad that your girlfriend broke up with you, you don't immediately think, ""Hey, my mother is emotionally abusing me right now!"" You think ""Wow, I already felt like shit, but now everything is *worse*.""

The fact that you tried to justify your bullshit question

&gt;It seems to be that if you were in a recurring sexual relationship with someone and there wasn't any ""no""/resistance/incapacitation (that I don't think it would take months to realize), what circumstances would have made it rape?

"Guessing you are not from around here, so let me give my perspective as to why people visit India-

* Things are cheap and the overall cost of living is really low. Medical care, aside from serious stuff like cancer, having an injury won't life you physically fine and financially crippled for life as is with most other countries. Medical tourism is quite a big thing, and given the rigorous medical programs, people pay a fraction of the price they would in their countries for top-notch care.

* Diversity- India's HUGE; with a really developed and diversified culture. Through travelling a few hundred miles, you can visit a place with completely different food, values, and beliefs, which is quite intriguing and given India's history- can be a haven for foodies, or architects.

* General Tourism- I don't have to expand on this, we have the Taj Mahal, Gateway of India, and a ton of architecture, etc. going back centuries as a whole. Coupled with the exchange rate, and India is a go to destination for travellers who want to explore a vibrant country at a low cost.

* Companionship. At the cost of sounding cliched, I do know of some people who've actually come down for a wife. Unsure if its physical, cultural, or emotional attachment, but yeah- that's a reason too believe it or not.

* Retirement. With only $2000 a month, you can live beyond comfortably in one of the most expensive cities- Mumbai. Slash that by half if you go to the outskirts. Many people come down to retire here as everything is quite cheap, with all the amenities and conveniences of developed nations but at a fraction of the price, alongside things like medicine or care not burning a hole in their savings as they would come to rely on such services more as time went on.

"I'd like to share my favorite quote about homeless people getting jobs:

""People always say that to homeless guys, get a job. Like it's always that easy. 

This homeless guy was wearing his underwear outside his pants! 

I'm guessing his resume ain't all up to date. I'm predicting some problems during the interview process.

I'm pretty sure McDonalds has an 'Underwear Goes Inside The Pants' policy. Not that they enforce it very strictly, but technically, i'm sure it's on the books.""

"I ended up in a ""similar"" situation once where I had some playful banter going on with a CNA while doing blood work. I handed her some trash and asked for something I needed for the procedure, so she put the trash back in my hand and took a few steps. I thought she walked across the room, so I playfully swing my hand in her direction while looking at the patient and smacked her solidly on the ass. Like not a grazing or a little tap, but a rebounding, almost clapping bouncer of a smack. I whipped my head around and we stared at each other slack jawed and the patient just giggled like a little schoolgirl"

"Married (happily) horse farm owner here.

It's also an F-ing LARGE demographic.  Seriously, you just wouldn't believe how many women have a horse that they have no time, money, or especially land for.  Buying the horse is the cheapest thing you'll ever do with it.
And you can't put them by themselves, they'll go crazy.  It's like putting a person in solitary confinement.  On the other hand, most horses will buddy up with a cow or goat just fine.  We have 10, no lonely horses here.

Edit:  I love my property, horses, and lifestyle.  BUT, if you're someone who wouldn't enjoy that and you meet a girl who says she's ""really into horses.""  Guess what? You're going to be paying for horses, trucks, farriers, vets, trailers, shows, feed, supplements, hay, boots, saddles, pads, tractors, and fencing for the rest of your life.

And if you don't know how to swing a hammer or fix anything, MAY GOD HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL living on a farm.

Gah!

THEN! They moved nearly everything that was on the edge of the store (The meat section has moved 3 times). Jesus, it was infuriating and they did not move the overhead aisle signs until the whole thing was finished. My carefully thought out lists were useless.  I just abandoned all hope and now go to the Meijer that is 3 times the distance from my house.  Eff you, Kroger. "

Couple that with a modified Honda (they tried to argue my aftermarket headlights made me harder to see), I didn't stand much chance.

(Of course I am happy  that internet speeds got faster and my computer doesn't freeze every two hours.)

* To witness computers and the internet getting into every household and even our phones.

* To live in a time when computers weren't designed for people with the mental capabilities of a 3-year-old, with huge colorful buttons and all the settings hidden to prevent users from fucking up their own PC. Also not having every freaking thing you need to find highlighted in video games, they actually meant a challenge.

* A time before I could start a program without an app that requires logins into accounts, downloads updates constantly and uploads who-knows-what about you to the developer (""for improving user experience"").

* LEDs. I am still fascinated by the fact that something like that actually made it into the real world. I've been reading about new batteries that charge super fast and last super long for 10 years and have never ever seen one. Just news that a group of researchers at Whatever University created something that will change [an industry]. And then nothing. LEDs actually happened. Just think how crappy flashlights were back 15 years ago. Now even my phone is better.

* Also lots of scientific discoveries, but I guess those happen all the time. I was particularly excited to see Pluto for the first time though. I hope we'll live to see humans landing on Mars and estabilishing permanent bases on the Moon.

"&gt;Most towns in Montana have ambulance services and life-flight is available around the clock  
  
Can't speak for Montana, but can speak some for a small mountain town in Colorado.  If a helicopter is available, needed, and there's a spot to land (frequently people are transported to a landing spot by a team of people on a hand held gurney in rough terrain situations), it'll get there.  Some altitudes require military choppers, which come pretty regularly.

&gt;Time is an issue, but we've responded to every call in under an hour.   
  
I know volunteer EMT's that have left their full time job, hauled ass up rough trails for half an hour on an ATV or side by side, and then literally run most of the way of a 14,000 ft high mountain to save people.  On one occasion last summer, if the volunteer had jogged, a woman would be dead.  
  
&gt;There are medical resources. Those ranchers who have built a line around the fire are also volunteer AEMTs and carry kits with them.  
  
The specific place I'm talking about has a great medical center and the doc will wake up at whatever time he is needed, but high altitude recovery isn't something he goes on.  *Everything* outside of that doc and his staff at the medical center is volunteer.  When I was up there summer before last, there were two high altitude body recoveries and one high altitude rescue I almost had to go on over then course of three days, and I was only there for two weeks (but my uncle was a volunteer ems driver).  Volunteers from neighboring counties  help each other out, but this was a heavy three days of tourists doing stupid shit.  Two of them died and one of them lost his foot.  It also takes a shitton of people to get a 200-255 lbs man down over rough terrain at 13,000 feet, even if it's to a spot that a chopper can land at.  When you've got multiple injuries in neighboring counties that are very rural, that can exhaust the number of volunteers you have very quickly.

He also only ever consumed burnt popcorn and TONS of Pepsi max. Like, 2 liters a day. He always had a dozen bottles in the fridge. On day I came home and he had purchased every single one they had in the store. Seemed like addictive behavior or something.
Then, he changed all the bulbs in the house to colored bulbs. Green blue and red. I couldn't see anything!! It was so terrible!! He also hung blankets and towels over all the windows so it was super dark, even with the lights on.

"[Research is conflicting.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-antiperspants-do-more-than-block-sweat/)

&gt;The antiperspirant finger-pointing began more than 40 years ago with new discoveries about Alzheimer's, a progressive dementia that affects more than five million Americans. Antiperspirants use compounds—such as aluminum chloride, aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum zirconium—to form a temporary sweat duct plug. Researchers back then found that exposure to aluminum caused rabbits' brains to develop nerve cell damage—thought to be a precursor to Alzheimer's at the time—and long-term dialysis patients with high levels of the metal developed dementia.

The article goes on to refute claims that aluminum ingestion/ uptake at normal concentrations (30-50 mg/ day) has any real effect. I think that the jury is still out.

"Except in the justice system, where schedule 1 drugs are said to be of no medical use, with a high potential for abuse, including but not limited to: Peyote, LSD, Marijuana, and Ecstasy.

If you step down the ladder, you can see some drugs that the government has deemed ""safer"", such as: Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Fentanyl, Adderal, Ritalin, OxyContin, and a few others.

One step further down the ladder, to some even safer drugs (we're at schedule 3 now), we have ketamine, steroids, and low-dose codeine. 

Finally at schedule 4 we start to get into some *really* safe drugs, with much lower potentials for abuse, like Xanax, Ambien, Valium, and (I did not know someone actually made a drug with this name) Soma.

Schedule 5 is low-dose cough syrup and couple stragglers.

"&gt;It's funny because they said this about Gen X with television and Millennials as well. Turns out life skills develop anyway.


I don't think anyone's claiming they will have zero life skills, but every generation from the baby boomers onward HAS suffered from worsening arrested development, with longer lasting immaturity, and significant gaps in understanding how to live a responsible adult life (managing money, interpersonal relationships, effective parenting, focused career choices, sacrificing smaller immediate pleasures for greater long term happiness, etc).


I can see some of these worsening maturity gaps clearly in myself (Gen X) as well as my friends and family. It's a very uncomfortable thing to face, and we all want to say ""Oh, other people may be like that, but not us..."", but I think if we reflect on a lot of the habits we have, especially in regards to entertaining ourselves to death (whether by TV, movies, music, games, internet, drugs), we see the mentality of child - that can rationalize like an adult - avoiding tougher/painful decisions to just have an easy, fun time."

Most aluminum cans have a liner to prevent it leaching into the liquid, but aluminum foil does not. Cooking food which contacts aluminum foil can lead to ingestion.

On the contrary, aluminum is a widely recognized neurotoxin that inhibits more than 200 biologically important functions and causes various adverse effects in plants, animals, and humans. The relationship between aluminum exposure and neurodegenerative diseases, including dialysis encephalopathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinsonism dementia in the Kii Peninsula and Guam, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been suggested."

"4th year doctoral student of audiology here. This. 

Hearing loss doesn't discriminate and although most people only think hearing aids are for old people, that couldn't be further from the truth. The audiology community (in the US) is kind of up in arms at the moment over a new over the counter bill being introduced for hearing aids to combat the high cost of a good pair of hearing aids. Although I agree that the hearing professional should not be taken out of the equation, I do like the idea of a company like Apple to make more (relatively) affordable forms of amplification that help get rid of the stigma of wearing a hearing aid. We live in a loud world and I hope the trend goes toward actually doing something about a hearing loss *insert WHAT? Jokes here*"

"I suffer from a fairly severe acrophobia, and when I was little it was at a crippling level. We were at a carnival and they had one of those tall slides with a small hill in the middle that you ride down on a little burlap blanket. My older sister went up and so I followed her. Unfortunately, to add to the fact that the platform was pretty high up (especially for someone of my size at the time) the metal steps had no backings (there was nothing connecting one step to another) and so I could see straight down to the ground. I got about halfway up, looked down, froze, and started to cry. Some dude who was on the steps right behind us picked me up and carried me hammock style down to my mom. He was a good dude."
"A very religious cousin of mine got married literally the day after losing her virginity to a friend of mine that was most decidedly not the groom.

She damned well went through with it, anyway. 

They're still married... Shit, must be going on three years now. Makes no sense to me, but to each their own, I suppose. "

&gt; You could trip and fall, hit your head and die.

That's not a really good argument dude... I'm sick of seeing ""oh you could die from just walking out of your house"" to excuse something that is avoidable. For instance, traffic accidents. They would be INSANELY reduced if every car on the road was controlled by some sort of Tesla style autopilot. If it would practically eliminate deaths by traffic accidents then why not do it? And as others have stated, they'd probably make tracks where you could drive your cars with other people. 

&gt; If you start trying to eliminate every risk in life why not just end it.

You're right. So let's stop using any form of modern medicine then! Just because we can reduce the risk of getting and prevent diseases doesn't mean we should right! 

&gt; So many things could kill you in an instant that if you worried about them all you'd have an aneurysm.

Yeah, so many things can kill you in an instant, but that's not an excuse to not eliminate one thing that can kill you. Because most things that can kill me in an instant, I can prevent. I can't prevent someone from falling asleep at the wheel and killing me, for example.

I appreciate that you enjoy driving, but as someone who couldn't care less about driving, I think we should get rid of it if we can. If we have the capability of reducing unnecessary death, then why wouldn't we do it?

I'm really getting sick of these slippery slope arguments against doing things that would save people's lives for no other reason than ""oh there's a bunch of stuff that could kill you at any second, where does it end!"" That's a really weak argument. "

"I think you have a good point about everything you said with the exception of the ""people are gonna have sex anyway"" counterargument.

This kinda goes broader than the focus of your comment, but abstinence-only education, both from my experience and reading online, often fails to explain the merits (assuming what you said is correct, for the sake of argument) of abstinence and instead focuses entirely on beating you over the head with ""don't have sex because the Bible says so but I'll be fired if I say that, so don't have sex because I said so!"". This just hurts people and leads them to make ignorant decisions, as you've likely seen with the recent articles being posted about abstinence-only education being related to an explosion in teen birth rates.

This is also totally anecdotal, but out of my friends, the ones that have been the most vocal about ""no sex until marriage"" have had the most partners by a large degree. For what it's worth, one is a Muslim and the other is a Christian. Take from that what you will.

She ended up getting pregnant and I was pretty happy about it, ready to start a little family.

Well, important to her because she used that money to get an abortion and told me she ""didn't want my hell spawn"" needless to say I called it off there and we haven't talked since. I'm pro-choice, but I certainly feel maybe I should have been part of that conversation and she knew how wildly excited I was about it. Probably more pissed I paid for it.

"They did lie, but they also revealed their good natures about each other. Before Aladdin realized Jasmine was the princess, he was willing to risk great harm to himself in order to protect her. The previous scene where he gives away the only food he had to two children also indicated he helped Jasmine purely out of altruism, and had no intention to take advantage of her naivete of the streets. When the palace guards show up, Aladdin does not ditch Jasmine but does his best to escape with her. 

Initially as Ali, Jasmine wanted nothing to do with him. It was only when Ali actually *listened* to what she was saying, and respected her wish to be left alone that she realized there was more to him than met the eye. This was further reinforced when he slipped with the, ""Do you trust me?"" line he first said to her as Aladdin. It was by knowing Aladdin that she came to fall in love with Ali.

They may have lied about their positions, but they fell in love with one-another's hearts and personalities and that's why it was so easy to forgive. The Sultan understood this, and that is why changed the law. Note how he worded it: not that the Princess can marry commoners but the Princess can marry *whomever she deems worthy*."

"TL;DR Tried to be a good samaritan and help a random girl on the side of the road, ended up becoming part of a drug deal.

Was driving home from work one night when I saw a girl crying and begging for help in my neighborhood. I stopped to see what was wrong, and she tells me she needs money for a cab because her boyfriend kicked her out. I recognized that she was a girl who graduated from my high school a few years ahead of me, and I didn't have any money or anything, so I offered to take her somewhere else where she could get help. She refused, and insisted on getting money for a cab. 

At this point I knew something was up and she was trying to scam me for money, but I continued on ""just in case"" this was actually serious. Her boyfriend comes out, and it turns out to be someone I used to play basketball with when I was at school; we recognized one another, and were able to avoid any kind of hostility. We talk for a minute, and the girl says she has a friend nearby who can get her money, and asks if I can take her. I agree, and her boyfriend wants to tag along. 

We get to an empty parking lot where we're supposed to meet her ""friend"", and waited for about  15 minutes with no response. She tells me they actually wanted to meet at a nearby gas station. As I'm driving, I'm already well aware of what's going on, but I didn't want to be an asshole and just say fuck it and dump them on the side of the road. The boyfriend at this point was kind of sick of it, as he was showing me texts on his phone secretly telling me she's trying to setup a drug deal and to just say no and take them home. For some reason I didn't listen; maybe it was because he was a friendly face, but I'm not too sure. 

We get to the station, and sure enough, there was a car parked on the side. I really didn't want to be there, so I told her to just hurry up and get it over with. The dealer comes towards my car, pretty much fitting the sketchy DD stereotype, and goes to the passenger window asking her for payment. 

This is the part where I felt instant regret for going this far, as I see her hand him a $1 bill wrapped around a roll of paper. As I saw him grab it, I was preparing myself to just turn and burn if necessary. Luckily, after seeing through that piss poor attempt of a trick, he just told us to fuck off and walked away. Immediately after, she says she kind try to contact someone else, and I tell her ""fuck that, I'm taking you two home"". After dropping them off and getting an apology from the boyfriend, I took off and headed home as fast as I could away from any kind of shady nonsense.

So let it roll back and up the backside and kick the clutch in again.  Three tries of this and still no dice.  By then boss sees and sends a more experienced operator over to get it going.  After some horrendous noise and a cloud of clutch smoke he did get it going. But clutch went out the next day.

&gt;When I go into other people's houses I leave my shoes on because taking them off would be rude. It's not my home and they don't need to be seeing or smelling my feet. 

Where I am from we wear socks in our shoes, so people won't see our feet when we take off the shoes. 
We also tend to wash our feet once or twice a day and ensure that no fungi are growing on them, so our feet do not smell.

&gt;Taking off shoes in someone else's home is roughly equivalent to calling someone's grandmother by their first name.

This confuses me to no end.

"Speaking as someone who's been there and done that...

Get past it. Easier said than done, I know. But IMHO the important thing is to understand I'm not saying ""learn to not care when they hurt you"" - it's learning to understand that they aren't actually trying to hurt you. 

If you ask someone out, there are a billion factors that go through their head resulting in a ""yes"" or ""no"":

- Do they think you're attractive? 
- What do they consider ""attractive"" (this varies)
- Do you seem like you're worth spending time with?
- Do they have another romantic entanglement?
- Is there room in their life for another relationship? 
- Do they feel like stepping into the 101 level of a relationship right now? 
- Do you remind them of an ex they don't like? 
- Are you from New Jersey? (NY residents only)

and so on. 

The point is that they look and decide and say ""yes"" or ""no"" without knowing much about you, and a ""no"" has zero value. It's not ""this guy looks like a power tool dweeb, so I'm going to step on his soul right now and enjoy it"" - it's just ""nah""

Couple this with not investing so much emotionally into someone before you ask. You don't want to emotionally feel like they're the one you want to marry and spend your life with - you just want to be at a level of ""I think I would like to get to know you a bit more than I do now."" 

This is the non-asshole perspective of how the ""Pickup Artist"" thing works, without all the stupid psycho bullshit. The key part is simply ask people out when they seem interesting, walk away if they say ""no thanks"", and don't take rejection personally. 

Now stir in a bit of ""use some discretion of your own."" When some folks get a bit emotionally desperate, they get less discerning about who they ask out - this translates to desperation, which is a turn-off for some women. You don't want to ask out the waitress because she's pretty. You want to ask her out because she obviously got your Star Wars joke, or because she knows what reddit is, or because she said she's going to the NASCAR race this weekend - she shares your interests. Or you feel a click with her personally, or you like *her* sense of humor, etc. 

And instead of writing advice books on the internet for total strangers like I do, get out there and meet people. (Man, once you start typing sometimes...)"

"I completely understand making shelters contingent on being clean and sober, but not access to food. As I've said, I subscribe to the ""addiction being a mental illness"" model, and I don't think addicts should be cut off from food and water because they are addicts. I understand that other peoples' safety, however, should be paramount, and community shelters don't have the resources to shelter addicts and keep the addicts AND other residents AND staff safe - too difficult. As an alcoholic myself (lucky enough to have a great family and great treatment but also some extensive time spent with a range of addicts and my own behaviour - though I've never been violent, just withdrawals are a medical emergency), I understand how volatile and intensive treatment of addicts can be. I suggest - clean and sober - get a bed. Not clean and sober - here's some food and water but find somewhere else. I think that's fair. "
"&gt;When a guy who turned out to be a Korean working in Japan offered to help me.

I dunno. I can be a pretty miserable person at times, but I try to appreciate the small things in life. It seems to be the norm and indeed expected to be jaded nowadays, and people almost consider you naive if you aren't. ""Oh, you like your job? Well, you're just a mindless corporate slave, aren't you?"" ""Life is ultimately meaningless and has no purpose."" ""The world is falling apart around us, why should I be positive?"" And so on. I don't know how people can live like that. I had to stop hanging around people who say all this stuff because they think they're so smart and intellectual but really I think they're just depressing themselves for no reason. We only get one life and we might as well try to enjoy it, you know?"

"I guess it depends on the circumstances of your upbringing. I was 7 too, but I remember it quite well; watching it live on the news during a ""sick day"". And as an Army brat, I saw my world as I knew it change over the course of the afternoon; gates were now manned with armed guards, bomb-proof cement barriers were posted outside the PX (basically like a Walmart for military folk), alarms were blaring, military vehicles littered the road, my dad and all the other soldiers were put on alert to have to deploy at any minute. I was a few thousand miles away from the disaster, and I can't begin to imagine what it was actually like for kids up there. My civilian peers however, don't have as clear a memory, as it didn't seem as serious to them at the time. Ironically, the town my dad retired to, and where most of my civilian classmates are from, is the town that produced many of the firetrucks used during 9/11.

And there's also the fact that you were only 7; a lot of people don't really have clear memories until around after 10 years old, and enough of these people could be lying/misremembering too, I don't think most 1st/2nd grade teachers would turn on the news for something this horrible, and it's been drilled in our heads for the last 16 years, ""where were you on 9/11?""."
"Yes! This makes such a difference. 

My exes house (still living with parents) had nothing of sentimental value. No photos or trinkets or anything. The only thing remotely close to a photo was a fucking creepy oil painting of my ex and his mother when he was like 4 years old hanging over the fireplace.

But that all changed when the /u/Fireguy12 Nation attacked. Only the /u/Avatarguy12 mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A few days have passed and the /u/Fireguy12 Nation is nearing victory in the War. Two days ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the /u/Earthguy12 Kingdom to help fight against the /u/Fireguy12 Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the /u/waterguy12 Tribe, and that the cycle is broken. But I haven't lost hope.

"Two days after the radiation would be at 1%, after seven hours it would only be at 10%. The most harmful radiation occurs immediately after the blast. That being said, it is wise to stay indoors as long as possible. Some sources say two weeks, but after a few days the vast majority of the danger is gone, just don't drink the water or forage for food in uncovered places. Don't starve in your house because you fear a little radiation. Try your best to stay clean and you will be fine. If you get dirty, try bringing an extra set of clothes in a backpack. If things are really bad infrastructure wise, you may be much better off foraging soon after the attack before all the easy targets are picked over. If everything falls apart starvation is your biggest threat, not radiation. If things are really bad, grab anything edible off shelves, dog food, grape nuts, pork skins. In the relatively short term, calories are all that matter. Vitamins can be rationed and deal with majority of malnutrition problems relating to mineral deficiencies."

Also, net deck. And stick to 1-2 decks untill you're really good with it and can focus on thinking about what your opponent might be playing instead of having to focus on your own deck's mechanics."

"I realized he didn't care at all about me. Not a smidge. We were in a long distance relationahop after being together for 8 years. I would ask how his day was and suffer an hour and a half about some kickstarters that I didn't care about and then hear how awful I was if I asked him to talk about something we had in common. Then he would go on about the gross parts of weightless that we were both experiencing. It wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact he still hasn't asked about my day. 

If I brought up planning for the wedding he got annoyed with me saying how expensive it was while simultaneously refusing to talk budgets with me. I specifically remember saying $1k was unreasonable, and him barating me about how hard it is for him to think about limiting the number of invites or maybe doing it at the courthouse. I should have been more able to make a huge wedding on $1k because that is what his mom and grandma dreamed of. I also wasn't allowed to hire a wedding planner because it was too much and I should ask his mom for help. His mom wanted to make it just like her 3rd wedding which was nothing like what I wanted.

The day I broke up woth him I timed our Skype convo and it was 2 hours and 15 minutes of him talking about stupid shit without asking me how I was. I just said ""I can't do this.""

He harrassed me for 2 days. Alternating between telling me how terrible I was for being dramatic like this on a night before he had work and him demanding we talk it over and I just tell him what he did wrong so he could fix it. 

Then he switched to contacting my friends until he found one that would tell him what I was doing and where I was going and who it was with. That lasted for 2 months before his source spilled the beans.

It was over a year before I could get him to sign over my car and leave me alone. He was already engaged to someone else at that point so I don't know why he was such a dick. "

"Stock trucks these days barely have any more clearance than a car. They have lowered over the years to meet EPA fuel economy requirements.

I live in the Western US.... There are actually quite a few areas (I'm a hunter, obviously) where a stock truck will bottom out, so a little lift helps with ground clearance and allows for slightly bigger tires. I prefer a 2"" lift, as it is very useful, without looking ridiculous.

There is a point of diminishing returns.... These 6"" lifts with 37"" tires are what we call “pavement princesses"" because they're too big to fit on trails, and they've lifted their center of gravity so high that they're at serious risk of rollover. These are usually driven by high school dropouts, who work at the local factories."

"I'll give a quick example with the most pernicious form of it, [Intersectionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality).  

Let's say a group of people are talking about some potentially controversial topic, let's say inner-city poverty.  For the sake of argument and simplicity, let's say that the discussion group is divided equally between white and black participants.  Under Intersectionality, half of the participants are considered to have inferior opinions right off the bat because their identity may not line up with the debate at hand.  It does not consider that someone with the 'wrong' identity may be an expert in a field relevant to the topic of discussion, their opinion is immediately discounted because this problem is a Square Hole, and they are not a Square Peg.

I know this was fast and very simplistic, but crap like that is **part** of why we're here now.  People are literally not allowed to state their opinions on some things in America in some circles because of their identity, and this massively reduces the communication and debate that can go on between people of differing political opinion.

edit: in fact, if you want a real-world demonstration look at the way the Pulse nightclub shooting was handled by politicians and the media.  Intersectionality currently views Muslims as more oppressed than Gays, so you had the weird case of people falling all over themselves to try to downplay the event.

"Got myself raped like that. We'd been together for about a year and we went out with one of his friends and he (ex-bf) did.... stuff while his friend watched and jerked off. I'd been arguing with myself to stay home because he texted me and said not to wear underwear, wear a short skirt but I was looking for male approval (because I never got it from family). I went along with it and the entire time I kept telling myself ""hey this isn't going in a safe direction, do something"" and I could have kicked his ass or out-run him, easily lol but I didn't want to embarrass him in front of his friend by leaving without an explanation or by pushing him away from me or yelling something about not wanting to have sex or screaming because I knew he had trouble making friends and I didn't want him to lose a friend because I was a prude. I just told him ""no"" and ""stop it"" a few times and he kept going and I froze up because my anxiety was already pretty bad but being underneath a guy, naked with an audience only made it worse. We broke up after he threatened to send my nudes to his friends and his parents and my grandparents. He didn't send them but he stalked me for almost a year after that and now I've got a restraining order. And now he's on meth! So bullet dodged I guess?"

The issue of certain groups not being represented happens no matter how we elect the president (has to be solved in other ways) and is just shifted around by the EC, not solved, but popular vote is closer to accurately representing the will of citizens because at least it is based on majority opinion instead of a selective minority's opinion.

You are also vastly overestimating how much rural people care about the EC.  I'm not from California or something, I'm from upstate Maine, a rural, republican territory.

"My family made/makes a decent amount of money. Enough that I didn't get a bunch of free money for need-based aid, but not enough for them to pay for my school fully (they helped a bit).

My experience was thus: got some scholarships based on merit (has no relationship to NEED, only grades/tests), and then took out some federal loans.

Contrary to popular opinion, most minorities don't get free rides. They're in the same boat- if they get good grades, they get some scholarships. Then they take out loans. And if they're lucky they may get some free money from minority-specific funds, but those are definitely limited (I worked in admissions for almost 5 years, trust me- there wasn't a bit slush fund available to all the nonwhite students).

If anything, people need to recognize that under Republican leadership we've reduced access to loans, which hurts white students quite a bit. When I graduated from college my federal loans carried a ~2% interest rate. Under GWB that rate increased to ~6.8% for students that came after me.

There are lots of things broken with our education system, I just wanted to refute the possible misconception that nonwhites are swimming in free money when whites are hard-up. Everyone suffers a bit in our educational system, and the costs just keep rising. I wouldn't want to be going to college in 2017, versus when I graduated."

"Ya, I don't want to be judgey on a thread meant to be informative, but the dude basically wrote a book about how he's the real victim here living a great life and career while his baby girl doesn't have health insurance.  From the mother's point of view it's a pretty shitty situation for her, they both enjoyed the act and when accidents happens she's the one stuck with it while he has the option to move on with his life.  I'm not a feminist or anything, but you would imagine she has future plans also that she had to abandoned because she choose to keep her child instead of giving it away.  

To be fair, I don't dislike him for being a deadbeat, I dislike him for playing the victim and acting like it's a terrible thing that happened to him instead of the woman he left with a child.  People who just don't want to deal with kids are fine in my book, it's both people's fault for the kid, the woman also made a mistake in choosing a partner (and maybe not adhering to proper birth control?) so I don't feel sympathy for any of the parties involve.  The thing that really disgust me is the lack of empathy in his post about how the woman and child is dealing with the situation and paint a picture of his extreme suffering while living his dream life.

"Because the thoughts and emotions of a depressed person are simply not rational - it makes no logical sense for a depressed person to feel that way or to not be cheered up by the efforts of those around them.  Therefore it's very difficult for people who haven't experienced that state of mind to understand it.  But if it was logical, it wouldn't be a mental illness.

Though there's also the factor that, as a part of the depression, a depressed person has difficulty feeling the same sort of connection with other people as someone has when they're not depressed.  That means that even when they do find someone who understands what they're going through - perhaps because they've been there themselves - a depressed person still doesn't feel like the other person understands."

"The town I live in - my hometown - was zoned such that all of the apartment buildings are on the edges of town limits. The effect of this is that most of the black population is concentrated on the east side of town, which borders a violence-stricken neighborhood of a large city, and most of the Hispanic population is on the south side, which borders more heavily Hispanic (and less affluent) suburbs. The white people live in the giant old houses to the west and north. On paper, it's a very diverse place to live, but in practice, it's segregated. This applies to the public schools, too, since you go to your elementary school based on where you live.

So there are a lot of wealthy white people in town who can pay themselves on the back for living in such a diverse place while also casting aspersions on the black kids who play basketball at the parks on the east side of town. There's a movement against high-density housing that's going up in the downtown area, and that movement is populated entirely by wealthy white people because they're worried about where they'll park if more people live here. I've heard wealthy white people telling renters that they're (we're) leeches because we don't pay real estate taxes, which of course is insane since it's rolled into our rent.

Add onto that our ludicrous parking system: Practically every block is its own parking zone. My block has *two* zones, one for the day and one for the night. During the day you can park on both sides of the street, but at night you can only park on one side of the street. This disproportionately affects people who don't have garages - or in other words renters, or in other words lower-income residents, a greater proportion of whom are non-white. So there's this added *quarterly* expense to renting that equates to basically $70 a month on top of your rent. 

But it's also set up to make a profit for the town on parking violations. Last year the town made $9 million from parking tickets. Again, this disproportionately affects renters, people who don't have garages and tend to be lower-income. But then come to find, when I try to purchase my permit, that some of the homeowners buy up as many permits as they can despite the fact that they have garages because (according to the people who work in parking services) they want to limit the number of people parking in front of their homes.

So basically my town is systematically racist and classist and makes a pretty sum off of it. 🤷🏼‍♂️"

"I think that making the states themselves have more pull on laws than the federal government would be a great plan. Have the federal governement dictate interstate relationships and laws, but leave a majority of the things up to the states (drugs, gun control, etc). It maximizes the power of the citizens to affect their own laws and leaves the least number of people unhappy. IIRC, that was the original plan anyway. "

"I got the solution for this from a bad US movie about nuclear war with the Soviet Union--dated. They claimed Strategic Air Command bomber pilots wore an eye patch in the event they were flying and we're exposed to a nuclear flash, blinding their unprotected eye. They could then remove the eye patch and continue on with their mission flying with the other eye.

So I keep both eyes open for good depth perception until it's too bright, then close the eye closest to the blinding light. Once I pass them a split second later, the closed eye has recovered it's ""night vision"" sufficiently to see immediately while the blinded eye recovers.

Try it, you'll thank me."

It could be decades since the last time they jumped. Maybe they forgot how. They have no reason to jump ever so why would they. I hope I never forget how. I wonder when the last time I'll jump will be. When I do it I probably won't know It's my last time. Anyway you don't even need to jump over the hurdles for the event. It's just usually faster too. "

you think I was the bad doctor and the private doctor was the good doctor.

if I were a private doctor, I would have to give you antibiotics if I wanted to compete with the other doctor.

In a national hospital, I don't give a fuck if private practice does this because I don't have to compete with them.

"There's no direct conversion rate like currency.  It's all about the principal.  Basically, if you smoke enough you'll develop COPD.  And it's not binary, where after smoking this one joint, suddenly you have COPD.  You have symptoms of poor lung function and pulmonary edema that worsen slowly over time until it's eventually diagnosed as COPD.  That's not advertised right now, and instead you have people saying marijuana is healthy and natural.

-

People who smoke cigarettes only when they drink and people who vape aren't the people developing COPD.  People who smoke marijuana one a month and people who use dry herb vapes aren't the people who are going to develop COPD.  The point is that people who smoke anything with regularity are going to develop lung problems, regardless of if it's tobacco, weed, or lettuce.  But that's not the prevailing mindset.

* When buying snack food, only buy as much as you need a week. So instead of buying a bag of candy, a box of twinkies, and ice cream cones, just buy the box of twinkies. There is your sweet snack for the week.
* Make a ""meals you want to eat this week"" list before going shopping and compare it to what is on sale. What sides or meats can you buy in bulk?

Just doing that would probably save you $50-100 on your grocery bill each month. Maybe more, if you are a binge eater."

Its been rough to say the least. I try to make it a point to form genuine friendships with each of my students, so that I can teach them as individuals with the respect they each deserve. But with such a close relationship, it made losing him all the harder. 

At least my students had some respite in that, with such a well-established classroom community, we were able to mourn together and support each other wherever needed. But I was never really able to mourn the same way. As their teacher, I *needed* to be their source of stability when they had none.

"So I was interested about what you said and I did indeed do my own research and on the Cowspiracy website they directly link each study to back up their claims. What I found was this http://www.worldwatch.org/files/pdf/Livestock%20and%20Climate%20Change.pdf. So the figure of 51% comes from the original figure of 18% from the UN study however takes into account factors that they may have overlooked (such a respiration and land usage/deforestation for animal agriculture). So in fact I don't think it was at all falsifying data or sensationalist, but I'm interested to hear if you've seen that particular study? 

Also out of interest, what do you think is the biggest problem to our planet? Sure there are issues with greenhouse gas emissions from transport and energy production however I feel like solutions to these problems require years of research and development to come to fruition and won't be solved as easily as avoiding animals products, which will make a larger impact too (when compared to transportation anyway)."

"For all those history buffs, there are a few really good ones on YouTube.

•""Going Medieval"" Mike Loades always has great stuff, and I learned so much about the life of an ordinary person. He also has a series called ""Weapons that made Britain"" that's worth a look.

•""The Battle of Megido"" is also on YouTube. The video quality is trash but it provides a great insight into the life of an ancient Egyptian footsoldier. 

•""Secrets of the Castle"" is also on YouTube, although I don't think the entire series is up. A group of experimental archeologists go to Gederlong (I know that's not how it's even remotely spelt, but I'm on mobile and can't search this stuff up) and literally help to build the castle, showing how stone was quarried, smoothed, and hoisted into place, how mortar was made, how chores were done, and even how furniture was made back then.

•""A Tudor Feast"". The same team from ""Secrets of the Castle"" rents out a Castle from the Tudor period and, using period accurate ingredients, methods, equipment, recipes, and even clothing, cooks a feast for the family that owns the castle. This one's my favorite, and is available in 3 or 4 parts on YouTube.

Honestly, YouTube has so many great documentaries and channels dedicated to education. If any of you decide to go on a documentary binge (like I do, a lot) then YouTube is a fantastic resource."

"Oh my god, I watched this while stoned out of my mind in Amsterdam earlier this year expecting a funny little documentary to make me laugh. It got real weird real quick."
"People find it a hard documentary to explain. It's because the editing and the story are somewhat of a mismatch. Often a documentary will hit you with a revelation, then give you some time to digest what you saw. This documentary hits you with some heavy shit but then quickly drags you back to a story line that you really have to pay attention to in order to keep up. Then when it's over you contemplate what you just saw and realize the magnitude of the story. This documentary doesn't so much take you by the hand as much as it drags you through some tough information whether you're ready or not. The documentary is made by a friend of Zachary's family so you get an insane story mixed with incredible access to the people involved. This combined with very fast editing leads to a story that leaves you angry, sick to your stomach, and just an overall uneasy feeling. I attend the university mentioned in the documentary and live where most of it takes place. Last year I wrote a paper about the case and got to read the entire story. It's a heartbreaking story. 

Documentaries are funny. I collect them and have over 1400. Sometimes you get an amazing subject matter but the filmmaker drops the ball (Zoo). Other times you get what some might consider a mundane topic but the director is so brilliant you still get a great doc (King of Kong). I commend the director of this film for bringing awareness to this story but I think it really could have been made better. "

"&gt;At least you could say they died to feed someone else. You can't say that about the Holocaust.

Are you implying that the Holocaust would have been less horrifying had the Nazi's fed on their victims?

&gt;You cannot compare the horrific nature of Nazism and the Holocaust to the mistreatment of animals by the food industry.

Why? You do understand that you can compare aspects of two things of varying severity, right? A toddler punching someone and Mike Tyson punching someone are very different things, but there are other similarities to which we can draw comparisons."
"Many Neo-Nazis are radicalized and considered domestic terrorists. The USA has programs specifically targeting white nationalists that work to deradicalize and investigate them.

Hopefully this answers the pertinent part of your question?"
"I mean, the father was entirely inappropriate to do that at a god damn wedding, but imagine if he had paid for her to go to private primary education her whole life, then to a private uni for 4 years, and then when she's getting married he finds out that she just wants to be a stay at home mom or something like that. That could be upwards of $300k going to naught.

The father could have endured financial hardship giving her the very best opportunities possible, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars so she could have the best advantages money can buy. I'm sure it would be very embittering to find out it was all for quantitatively nothing.

Disclaimer: I am not bemoaning stay at home moms. Stay at home moms have very difficult jobs that I respect highly. However, it probably would not require a very expensive private school education."

"My kids are 18 and 20 and were part of this culture. They got a trophy for every team they played on from age 4 all the way through high school clubs. I don't think they were damaged by this at all. They threw away the old soccer trophies when they got to be teenagers. They don't feel like the world owes them anything, they work hard in college and apply for any scholarship they can find. They have no problem with disappointment or unmet expectations. 

I don't see this as a problem with their peers either. I really feel like that whole idea has been created by boomers to bitch about younger generations and it isn't a problem. 

The actual problem I see is helicopter parents who give their kids no freedom."

"I've been laying awake thinking of this story and how it's making me sad, despite how awesome that family was.

When I was in college, I started hanging out with Colin and another guy, and we were all just getting to know each other. After class, Colin offered to drive me and the other guy to his house to study - by playing video games. 

I was a bit nervous being on the opposite end of town without a ride, so I asked Colin if he was okay giving me a ride. He looked at me like I was a bit daft and said, ""Of course. Everyone gets home.""

Now this was nothing like your story as I could of easily walked home by dinner time. But it still stuck with me, and you've reminded me of it.

There are some amazing stories in this thread of people helping others in their time of need. It just makes me sad that it's necessary so often. The world should be more like Colin and your pastor."

If you've read most things around here, you know that police officers often do not share the usual workplace dynamics of typical office workers. When you're doing CPR together, fighting felons together, chasing crooks together, there is no banal watercooler discussion, no obligated, cordial pleasantries which are exchanged at the copier. A sense of brother- and sisterhood develops, wherein you to a certain extent become enmeshed in the fabric of one another's lives.

Thus, when significant things happen in your life, they tend to get shared with the rest of the squad, for better or worse, and commemorative events included. One of our squadmates was getting deployed overseas with his reserve unit, so we demanded an off-duty evening fueled by pizza and beer and coarse jokes giving way to getting real at the end of the night with fist bumps and handshakes and the manliest back-slapping hugs we could muster.

The evening was turning out grand, with war stories and questions about deployment and some zingers of jokes and pies and pies of thick, delicious pizza. As the meal wound down, our sergeant flagged our waitress down and tried to pick up the tab; this was met with a chorus of disapproval and a collective groping for wallets. As plastic began being stretched toward our waitress, though, she said, ""Guys, I'd let you fight over the check if there was one, but someone already took care of it.""

There was an instant, silent whodunit that started around the table, with eyes reading one another and low pointed fingers of accusation. Seeing that everyone at the table was suspect, she continued, ""It wasn't anyone in your party, and I didn't comp you. Someone else in the restaurant - and they've already left so don't strain your necks looking - covered your check and said thank you for your service."" Someone said, ""Okay, but the rest of us still need to pay.""

""No, everybody's checks. You're all good to go.""

A group that had been boisterous to the point of being raucous at points was rendered all but silent for a moment. It would have been notable if someone had graciously picked up the check for our comrade being deployed, but all of us? There were probably ten or twelve of us there, none of whom ordered the special and most of whom had ordered multiple drinks and appetizers - and we'd all ordered enough pizza to ensure we had lunch the next day. The collective bill assuredly ran into the hundreds of dollars, though the waitress declined to divulge the grand total - I got the feeling that was a stipulation she was given. Needless to say, we tipped generously on top of whatever she might have gotten from the giver and admonished her to, if she wouldn't budge on identifying the giver, to at least pass along our sincere gratitude should he or she come back in during one of her shifts. 

It might seem a simple thing, but that gesture was something I often fell back to when I had rough nights going forward. The simple knowledge that, no matter how many people spit at you, curse at you, threaten your family, roll their eyes at you, throw punches at you, that there is somebody out there who appreciates the effort you're exerting serving your community, was very gratifying. I hope the Unknown Stranger was blessed for his or her gesture, but I've got a pretty good feeling that they were.

"I was homeless for three years.  One day I was sitting on a bus bench and a guy asked me if I was hungry. I responded yes and he asked me to wait there for him.  He returned 15 minutes later with a bag full of clothes, hygiene products and food.  I thanked him profusely.  After he had left and I opened the bag he had also put $500 in the bag.    Used that $500 to get hotel.  Ended up getting a job within a week because of this mans kindness.  Saw him inside a Wal-Mart years later.  I attempted to pay him back but he refused to accept it.    Due to this experience I now drive around with backpacks filled with clothes, hygiene products, food, and water to give homeless people when I see them.  He changed my life.  I will never forget him.

"Not terrible at all, I think it's pretty common. I didn't feel connected to my first born at all until he was about four months old. I remember the nurse handing him to me so clearly and just feeling nothing. I felt like he could have been anybody's baby, he didn't feel like mine. I thought ""this feels the same as babysitting' for months. I'm not really a baby person in general, though I am good with babies. I know I took good care of him during that time and he really didn't suffer for it. He's five now and I love him so damn much, it hurts. 

I think there was a bit of a mourning period for my childless life. It was carefree and there was a lot that I loved about it. It was an unexpected pregnancy and I was excited, but also genuinely terrified and anxious all the time. 

In contrast, I bonded to my second right away. I think it was because I was more aware of how awesome it would get. When my first was born, I felt like I lost a lot of my freedom but he taught me how much I could gain so that I could truly enjoy my pregnancy and first few weeks of my daughter's life.

"God this feels weird even typing, but my journey through the world of masturbation has been an odd one. I, too, used a similar technique, and oddly enough, it has evolved into something still in practice. I'll do something similar, but instead of pushing down, I slowly rotate. I think it feels really good, and it's between me and... me... so who cares. 

I also learned something very valuable a few years ago. I was dating a girl who had a very hard time coming to climax. This is something that was really weird to me. I have had my fair share of partners, and this has never been a problem, but she was just very difficult to get off. It showed the head of another problem that I found in myself: I would actually go soft before we'd finish. 

I did a fair bit of research, and it turns out, I was doing something very right, and something very wrong in my own habits. The right thing was treating my solo sessions like a marathon and not a race. Turns out it basically builds stamina and you can last a really long time. Now the part I was doing wrong actually made the correct thing a wrong thing until I made some adjustments. I was doing something that is known as ""the Death Grip"". 

The Death Grip is the act of using WAY to tight of a grip when going to town. The issue is that it simulates something that is way too tight in comparison to a real woman. This means that I was desensitizing my dick to what actual sex feels like and was only able to feel something from other means. 

So I corrected that, but still kept up my distance practice, and now I am golden.

Side note to the original topic: I have been a musician my entire life. My second instrument was Trombone. You need to keep shit around to lubricate the slide. Coldcream + young boy + experimentation.. I had a good childhood."

"I lived in Las Vegas for a few years.  My roommate was a total nutjob conspiracy theorist.  I had taken some vacation time from work and was drinking very heavily.  We were talking one night, and he convinced me to go with him to some place in the desert, because you could supposedly see area 51 from there.  Drunk me decides this sounds like a good time,  so I agree and off we go.  We drove out into the middle of the fucking desert,  in the summer heat,  with no provisions at all.  And he gets his jeep stuck. And I mean sand up to the fucking rear fenders stuck.  So now we have a choice.  Try to hike out or stay with the jeep. We decide that we have to walk out, because nobody knows where we are and we can't just hang out there.  So off we go, in what we decided was the general direction of the last road we saw. We walked through the desert for 18 fucking hours before we came across a ranger station. And there was no one inside. Completely fucking empty.  He kept saying that we should just wait,  someone would come along soon. I wasn't having it. I  picked up the closest rock I could find and shattered a window. Climbed in and immediately dialed 911. 45 minutes later sheriffs arrived with an ambulance.  They checked us both out, gave us both an IV and took us into the nearest town.  A few days later the local sheriff called my roommate to say they had located his jeep and he was amazed that we made it out alive. He said if we hadn't found that station we would have probably died out there.  "

It was such a huge group of people, everyone was friends, hell some of us were like family. I stuck with them through BC but about halfway through it all fell apart. I stopped playing at Cata and lost touch with everyone. So many people would talk to each other daily, and then it was all just gone.

"Ah. Our alphabet is a descendant of the original Phoenician alphabet - the *aleph-bet* - and it's ordered the way it is basically as an accident.

Originally, all texts were copied out by hand by scholars - a painstaking process where a single mistake could ruin a work (if they were picky) and it could take days or weeks to copy an existing work for resale.

At the time, there were plenty of works being copied, but as few people other than government officials and teachers had their letters, few original works were being produced. As it is, the ordering of the *aleph-bet* is due to it being the order one of the very first scholars at the time ordered it...and it being copied in the same order ever since. Over time, it would come to be known as the natural, familiar order and to change it would feel wrong."

Best time in WoW."

"It's a dumpster fire. It's an embarrassment. It's an outrage. 

As a liberal Canadian, watching this go down results in such a massive range of emotions - from infuriated to helpless. I can't affect change across the border but it's so close that it feels like it's my problem and that I should be doing something about it. The frothing-at-the-mouth lunacy of American white supremacists and the silence of their implicit supporters is astounding. 

I run in very liberal, progressive circles and after the election, I did wonder if I'd been isolated from intelligent, competent conservative viewpoints. Shortly after I traveled in Central America where I had the opportunity to meet 3 Trump supporters and someone who voted for Harambe. Surprise, surprise - my views of them were only further confirmed. One was a white rich boy from Texas who'd never bothered to travel til age 25. Despite being a bible thumping anti-abortionist, he had sex in a Costa Rican jungle with a woman he'd just met. I have no issue with the latter, but the mental gymnastics of him trying to justify it after was cringe-worthy. 

The second was a New York bartender, who at the beginning claimed he was pushed to vote for Trump by all the liberal customers advocating for Clinton for months. As the night progressed and we got drunker and less civil, it ended in a screaming match from him about how he grew up white and poor so, therefore, didn't believe in white privilege and that women weren't disadvantaged cause they got free entrance to bars and better tips as bartenders. 

The third was a greasy middle aged asshole who had a second residence in Central America and spent 10 minutes ranting about the inconvenience of dodging taxes in Florida and CR.

Despite the small sample size, what I encountered in person is no different than what's playing out across the country right now. I can understand the frustrations of some impoverished ancient farmer in North Dakota, but [that's not who's doing this](https://twitter.com/JuliusGoat/status/896326301832925184). These are well off, educated, deeply racist shitbags who are fighting for dominance and power, not jobs or economic stability. 

In short, it's disgusting. "

"This is actually really awesome and kind of makes me wish I still lived in a small village. I got raised Catholic, I'm an atheist but certain aspects of the religion still stick with me. I sometimes wonder if religion is really at the heart of these things.

So churches serve a pretty solid purpose and help keep people in orbit of what's important.

But getting pissed every time you encounter one in the wild? Christ, you'd never have time for anything else.

Or, if she just thought you were kinda hot but not the hottest, why would she go out of her way to lie about it? I tell my boyfriend he's hot all the time and he doesn't believe me because he hasn't been with a lot of women, but like, for me (and many women) whether a guy is hot or not is a really complex thing that doesn't boil down to something as simple as ""you've got abs"" or some shallow bullshit. My boyfriend is overweight and self-conscious about it but he's so handsome, he has nice skin, I love his beard, he has lovey eyes, it's just so much more than that. He's very hot, and i wouldn't care if I were the only woman on the planet that thought so, it's still true. :)"

"Well, the thing to remember that it is ""forced teaming"" that is the sinister one.  

If some schmuck says ""I don't like the cat, and my flatmate agrees!"" - that's a harmless ""bluff"".  He's assuming the landlord won't consult the flatmate, and so will assume a genuinely united front.  It's annoying, but harmless.  I bet someone has cited MY supposed opinion, and I never even heard about it.  I can't think of any situation in which that tactic would actually be dangerous for the person who is being 'exploited'.  The only reason ""press-ganging"" came up is because a poster up there ^^^ somewhere thought it was an example of forced teaming, when it wasn't.

""Forced teaming"" is an attempt to manipulate you into trusting someone or letting down your guard; giving them something, or giving them access to you or your personal space, by making it seem like you're friends, when you're not.  Unlike being ""press-ganged"" about the communal cat or noise levels, you can count on ""forced teaming"" to never accidentally or intentionally be to your advantage; could actually be to your very great endangerment.

"It's kind of hard to lay it all out, but I'll try. It started out as I guess what you might call a prayer group. We would meet up, read the Bible, and pray for our college campus. Not bad, and it didn't harm anyone. Then we got into the more charismatic bits of Christianity. Speaking in tongues, prophesying, and...casting out demons. We looked for signs and Biblical parallels in our time (mistake #1). Being in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains, we ended up idolizing the Native Americans. We figured that they were here before us, so they must've known something we didn't. Secret knowledge. We started researching things and incorporating it into our beliefs (mistake #2). At that point, the flood gates of syncretism opened and we incorporated anything and everything. Coming up with spirit animals, looking for visions, some of us started doing drugs for a ""revelation"", etc. We believed that each of us was destined to play a pivotal role in a revival of sorts. We believed our numbers would grow exponentially and that many would be in awe of the power that God would demonstrate through us. At this point, one of our own seemed to be ""haunted"" or some such by a demon. This boy had a mild form of cerebral palsy, plus scoliosis. He had a hard time walking some days, much less exerting significant physical force with his arms. We prayed over him numerous times. Each time, it seemed we were successful in casting ""something"" out. But, it kept coming back. He would do weird things like zone out, pretend to speak in a disembodied voice, burn Bibles, etc. We demanded to know it's name. We got one, though I can't remember it. In comes my best friend and the part which still scares me. He's a big dude. He's got a good 5 inches and 40 pounds on me and I'm 5'10"" at 200 pounds. He threw me bodily into the ceiling once. As we were praying over the handicapped boy, he grabbed my friend by the wrist (his hand was on the boy's forehead and started bending it down like you would a paper clip. My friend had both hands on him trying to cope with the pressure, but was obviously in pain. He was almost brought to his knees, until we renewed our efforts and prayed harder. Keep in mind that the boy is handicapped. That amount of effort shouldn't have been able to come out of him. It wasn't long after that the group started falling apart due to other factors. Sorry for the rambling story, but that's the only way I know to lay out the belief system. We never really wrote it down. "

It includes such highlights as: 

- Bella and Alice give birth not to live young, but basketball-sized soft eggs similar to alligator eggs
- the main alien race that Edward and the rest of the Cullen men belong to has physical features like triangular pupils, tails, and 3-fingered hands ^and ^huge ^schlongs ^ribbed ^for ^her ^pleasure
- Bella is literally worshipped as a mother goddess by part of the alien population

I think by saying that ""A woman had never not farted since the days of old"" what the mean is that even though farting (or queefing) considered unlady-like it is still an unavoidable biological reality.  In that case I think it would be more calling out sexist then reinforcing it.  Although I don't know enough about Sumerian culture to be sure that's what the joke actually means. "

"You can still be infectious even if you don't experience any symptoms. Either because of the incubation period (the time between when you got infected to when you first show symptoms), or because your immune system can deal with the pathogens good enough so that you don't develop symptoms, but others might not. 

You can't know for sure that your seemingly harmless sneeze is not infectious. "
"Well it was some time ago however. A Vape Pen and I'm going to be doing more then just one line in case we have any Smokers who want to quit but are having trouble.

Last year I wanted to quit smoking due to a number of issues. The cost of cigarettes being a big one, I live out in AZ so it's going down to the Reservation but still it was getting costly. I was also waking up after a few hours of sleep to go have a cigarette. Add in the general health issues as well.

Went and got a Blu E-Cigarette, something I'm sure some of you know about or have tried. The thing with the Blu is, there's a very low amount of nicotine level nowhere near what you are getting from a normal Cigarette. Still it did help me smoke less, rather then having a smoke every hour I was able to get it down to every other hour.

The Vape Pen however? That finally got me off cigarette's for good. I had gone out of town to visit friends and by this time I had started to ween myself of cigarettes. Again the Blu did help, however after a few hours I'd have to run outside to have one. My friend decided to bring up that the cigarette store they went to before trying to quit as well had a bunch of e-cigarette stuff, along with that I made a post over on /r/electronic_cigarette asking about what I should look into.

Went to the cigarette store, the lady running it knew nothing. Thus we found a full on vape shop, picked up a pen mod, some e-juice and coils. Last cigarette I had was half of one that night, I haven't had one in over a year now. Still for you smokers out there? If you are really wanting to quit give vaping a try. I'll admit it's not for everyone but it's better then the cancer sticks."

"The difference there is that your life would be significantly different if you never leave your house. Not smoking only means you don't stand outside in the cold during winter time and freeze your ass off to keep your addiction in check. 

Maybe you should compare it to something a little more similar, like drinking. There's a social aspect to it, sure, but it's easily replaceable with other activities. "

"Posted this before so I will post it again. I am female though, hopefully this still counts. You know that stereotype of the bitter, child hating, child free person? That was me...that's still me, no maternal feelings, frustrated by small children, grossed out by pregnancy, I was and am the text book stereotype. From the age of 18 on, when people my age started having kids I just didn't get it. I couldn't relate at all and I hated being in the presence of my friend's kids or listening to oxytocin-high ramblings about their kids. If I could have, I would have gotten my tubes tied.

Flash forward to when I was 25. I was dating the man of my dreams for a few years. He had said he wanted kids in theory later down the road, but his band was his number one passion in life which would come first. He was okay with my view because it wasn't an issue to him at the time. Then I find out I'm pregnant. I wasn't super sad or stressed about it. Because it wasn't even up for discussion. I was having an abortion and my boyfriend was ""supportive"" because like I said, band. So we get to the clinic and I am unemotional, he seems a tad bit bothered but not really. Then BAM they make us look at the sonogram. I looked at the 6 week old fetus and felt nothing, I could have Googled the damn picture and felt the same. But he, he lost it. All the way home he began to beg me to reconsider, to which I first resisted. Time went by and began to question the possibility of the whole ""It's different when they are your own!"" type of thing. So I confided in two friends of mine. These two friends were in similar situations, stuck with an unwanted pregnancy (they were guys and the girl didn't want to abort). They both insisted that I would fall in love with the baby and they promise it's the most fulfilling thing in the world. So I decided to keep the baby, assuming that my mother instincts would just kick in and all would be fine because that's what happens to everyone else right?

Through out the pregnancy my feelings never changed. I'd dream that the whole pregnancy was a dream and be happy and wake up with the baby bump and just cry. I was miserable the entire time. And miserable after the baby was born. This ""bonding and love"" never happened. The baby was a girl and I'd just stare at her, and feel nothing other than stress and resentment. I would take any opportunity to get away from her. The only time I would talk about her is to complain about how stressed I am. I would constantly ponder how my day could have went if I didn't have her, going back to grad school, going get noon drinks with friends, making funny videos and putting them online. Living and loving my life. But now, now I was a mom and I was very close to suicide. I'd even sit there just staring at a knife, holding it up to my wrist. As for the baby herself, she wasn't a particular bad baby, I guess. But I didn't enjoy interaction with her. I'd feed her and rock her to sleep but immediately run out the room to get away from her and try to reclaim as much of myself back as I could between cries.

Funny thing is, part of my boyfriend's way to persuade me into keeping the baby was him getting a better job so we could live more comfortably. But the better job he got required more hours so he didn't even bother parenting much because he was working all the time even though I was working too. So I got stuck with all the responsibility and he'd pop up and play with her maybe 30 minutes a day. This made me begin to resent him too. He was the one wanting this baby I'd gladly work 50-60 hours a week if that didn't mean being stuck with an infant all day! I began having an online affair with a man I met online that felt the same way about kids that I did due to my bitter resentment towards my BF. I could be open with this man about how much I didn't love my daughter and how much I hated this lifestyle where I couldn't with anyone else. After about a year or so I got up and left. I moved out of state to go live with this man. (Yes, I am aware this was a shitty thing to do)

Now my daughter is 5. I live a nice CF lifestyle with my current s/o which we I recently married, I have a better job and a cute little cat that I adore. Though there is no formal amount given I send money to my ex and the little girl for child support. I have to keep reminding him that I am not interested in how she is doing, don't care to see any pictures or what she is up to. I made her for him and him alone. His parents are super great grandparents and his mom got the girl she never had (my boyfriend just has brothers) sure it's not your traditional family setting but from what I hear everyone is happy, except my ex doesn't really like being single and living with his parents, but he only works part time teaching guitar lessons in the evening so the kid has all the support she needs but I am sure he will find a person to date eventually. Society will spit in my face for abandoning my family and not loving my child. I tell some people about it and get told off, I don't tell others because I just don't feel like being berated by them. I know it is selfish and in most people's eyes I am a terrible person, but the selfishness I feel is exactly why I shouldn't be a mother. I wouldn't be a good one and I wouldn't be happy. Now I am. And from what I hear the rest of ""my family"" is too.

I regret not having the abortion and bringing someone into this world that I didn't want or care. I regret allowing other people to convince me of something I knew wasn't the case for me. I know they were just trying to help and most people come around to liking kids and wanting to parent but I knew, I've always known it wasn't for me and I was right, it wasn't different if they are your own, for at least me. But after everything is said and done, I can't change the past. The little girl has love and support, food and shelter. I am now happy.

Hate me if you wish.

Formally an edit for questions I got: I guess I'll try to answer some of these reoccurring questions. I was on Paragaurd + pull out method, because hormonal birth control makes my anxiety, depression and insomnia worse. I tried to find doctors to tie my tubes but none would do it since I didn't have kids and I was in my early 20's at the time.. My ex and I had a fantastic relationship before the baby. And no, I am not unhappy. I did what was best for myself, so therefor I am not unhappy. The only thing I regret is not having the abortion. It is very hard for a parent or a person that wants to be a parent to understand my frame of thinking. The way I see it is plenty of kids grow up with single parents, her grandparents are young, (early 50's) she has all the love and support she needs and is pretty happy according to my ex. I might be the most disgusting type of person in the world to you which is fine. But I accept who I am and no amount of insults is going to impact me. Keep trying though.

Now I am getting questions about my childhood. It was fairly normal, no neglect or abuse. I was a wanted child, my parents did get divorced and my dad moved out of state but I still talk to him a few times a year and visit him maybe once every two years or so. I just don't like kids. No real reason, I just don't, at all. I don't get googley over babies, I find them ugly and annoying. Toddlers are the fucking worst. Older kids (8+) can be tolerable because you can have a real conversation with them but that's it. I'm well aware that I could have made better choices but I can't help but roll my eyes far into the back of my head when people are suggesting that there is something wrong with me for SOLEY not wanting/liking kids and not enjoying motherhood.

Will I contact her when I am older? Idk, I probably won't. If she wants to come meet me as an adult, I'll sit her down and explain to her that it's not her it's me. Some people just aren't meant to be parents and we were both better off without me there.

ALL PEOPLE READING THIS: IF YOU HAVE A NATURAL AVERSION TO CHILDREN AND FEEL NO SENSE OF PATERNAL OR MATERNAL FEELINGS CONSIDER MY STORY BEFORE LISTENING TO THE MASSES WHO TELL YOU IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S YOUR OWN.

"My friend lives in a rural part of NY state.  Myself and a bunch of people from the city came up to visit.   A few of the girls were very angry and got very political when they arrived and there was a shot gun on the kitchen table.  My friend politely explained that he had the gun out because there had been a black bear roaming around recently and he was  concerned that one might mess with his cat.  The girls didn't seem to care about that argument and were still pretty pissed off.  Upon leaving, one of them slid off a road and hit a tree.  They immediately called 911.  45 minutes later a deputy arrived.  The girls questioned what the hold up was to get an officer.   He answered, ""hold up?"",  and continued to explain, ""luckily I was on this side of the county when the call came out,  so I could hurry over, we've had a lot of reports of aggressive black bears in this area"".  Later he explained that there was only 2 deputies on in the whole county at night.  If there is a call one side that requires two officers it could take a ""really long time"".  Later the girls apologized to my friend.  While I believe they are still anti-gun, I think they gained a different perspective on life in rural us. "

"This happened when I was young, about eight or nine. I was sitting in the living room couch that faced two windows watching the TV that was between those two windows. It was a small NYC apartment so the living room wasn't all that big so it was about 11 to 12 feet from the wall behind me to the wall with the windows. So I'm sitting there watching something and in the corner of my eye I see what seems to be a small golf ball sized sphere of light coming from the wall that rapidly accelerates and crashes into the other wall next to one of the windows. It shattered in a way that resemble like someone throwing a ball of gold glitter onto the wall but it disappeared and left nothing behind. Normally i would have thought that maybe I imagined it but my mom was right next to me and confusingly asked me ""did you see that too?"". Even at that age I thought that there had to be a reasonable explanation for it like maybe it was a reflection of light bouncing off something but the way it moved and shattered looked too unnatural to simply explain it as light.

Because then I come by with my dog and I'm like ""oh great they're going to think it's me that let my dog leave crap cylinders all over their yard/sidewalk"". So I let my empty bags hang out about halfway of my pocket when we're walking, to be like ""see I'd clean that stuff up if it was my dog's poop"". Then when I inevitability do have to carry a loaded sack, I proudly carry it like ""see fuckers, this is what responsible dog owners do"".

"Health codes also say you can't eat raw cookie dough, but most people have no problem with it.

I've been on immunosuppressive medicine for the past 5 years and I routinely cook a pizza for lunch one day, leave it out on top of the stove, and eat it the next day. I grab the meat that's marked down (usually a day or less from its sell by date) and sometimes wait up to a week to cook it and eat it.  I throw leftovers out after about a week. My dad and I cleaned out our chest freezer (~ -20F) and ate 15+ year old chicken and beef for many days. 

Now, obviously if something looks or smells bad, I'm not going to eat it, but following the health code to the letter isn't necessary for most people. I probably err on the side of being too carefree in terms of food safety, but the only time I ever get an upset stomach is when I eat out restaurants, and that's rarely.  I've had food poisoning twice in my life.  Once in Costa Rica, once from a local mexican restaurant's salsa (the only thing I ate for 2 days was their chips and salsa... don't ask.)

But yeah, to actually answer your question, leaving stuff out for a long time, especially raw meat or deep warm dishes, is bad, and you should throw it out even if it's not past its sell by date. That being said, I do it with cooked stuff all the time and never have a problem.  YMMV"

"A few years ago I went to a town hall for my Congressman. One of his junior staffers was being very rude to the interns and volunteers. I decided to arrange a donor dinner at my house for the Congressman and worked with a senior staffer to put it together. During the planning stages I specifically asked that the rude junior staffer not attend.

Event comes, packed house, the volunteers and interns that helped me put everything together were fantastic, and one of the interns lets me know that the Congressman will be arriving in a minute. So the intern and I go out front to greet the Congressman and he shows up with the senior staffer and the rude junior staffer. The Congressman and I shake hands but before we go inside I tell him that the junior staffer has to remain outside or leave, didn't matter which. The Congressman, a consummate politician, asked why without betraying any sort of offense. I told him that I witnessed the junior staffer being rude to volunteers and interns at the town hall, that I didn't trust the junior staffer not to be rude to my guests, that the junior staffer's actions reflect on the Congressman, and that by association would reflect on me. The Congressman looked at the intern that was with me and asked, ""Did you see this, too?"" The intern nodded and the Congressman told the junior staffer to wait in the car.

We went inside, had a great time, raised over $22K, and I received a wonderful thank you call from the Congressman where he let me know that the junior staffer was no longer on his staff and that he discussed with his interns and volunteers about speaking up when someone is acting like a jerk in his name."

"I feel so sorry for those who have yet to taste a sublime pastrami on rye, or a mountainous Rueben, or even a freshly steamed brisket sandwich so big the first half fills you up. 

A Jewish deli is the epitome of goodness between two slices of rye bread. Everything on the menu is delicious and served in generous portions. They're mainly known for their pastrami and corned beef, steamed on the premises. Ordering egg salad when you could have delicious beef is like asking for a Pepsi at Starbucks, or going to Burger King for the salad. 

While a Jewish deli is kosher, everyone I've been to has mayo on request. While I'm a mayonnaise on a sandwich type of guy, I'll only have mustard out if respect and tradition. Spicy brown Guldens mustard is the way to go. 

While I've been to the well known ones over the years, Wolf's, Carnegie, 2nd Avenue, one of the better experiences was finding some no name, little deli in the middle of Borough Park.

"My Great aunt. She sacrificed her entire adult life to work in the jungles in Africa (formerly Zaire) at small make-shift ""hospitals"" miles from anywhere. She deserves a movie. Staying there during outbreaks of cholera, being accused of being a witch (because her doctor partner got cancer), she was awarded the British Empire Medal and would only come home when the British embassies would inform her they were removing her from the country for her safety (things had to be REALLY bad by then).  

In her final years, dementia got her. She didn't deserve it. It completely altered her personality and the last couple of years of her life was lived in complete anti-thesis of the most self-sacrificing, kindest humanitarian I've ever known. Everyone that ever knew her made a caveat at the time of her death in 2012 that she will never be remembered for who she was in her last 20 months or so. And there's hundreds, if not thousands of people alive today because she was here. 

I really hope they figure out dementia sometime soon. It's a terrible thing to experience for both sides.  "

"Many years ago, according to the stories told by the people of swole, there lived two brothers who were not like other men, or like the gods and goddesses of Mount Broylmpus. The name of the elder of these brothers was Brometheus. Brometheus was always thinking of improving and setting new PRs. He wished to spread the word of improvement to the world. Brometheus did not want to live amongst the Gods of Iron on Mount Broylmpus. He was too busy for that. The gods were spending their time lifting, but their bodies were the only swole that could be seen. Each of gods was propelled by jealousy, pettily comparing PRs like high scores on a game, wishing to inflate their ego with each rep. However, Brometheus was planning how to make the world stronger and better than it had ever been before. So instead of living on Broylmpus, Brometheus went out amongst men to live with them and help them and he quickly noticed that they were no longer happy as they had been during the golden days when Bronos, the titan, was king. He found them living by the Crossfit and cardio. They were hunted by wild beasts, and while humans had strong hearts, they could not fight back. ""If they only had Iron,"" said Brometheus to himself, ""they could at least fight the beasts and make gains; and after a while they could learn to make their own Iron and build themselves “gymnasiums”. 


Without Iron, they are worse off than the weak privileged.""Brometheus went boldly to Brodin and begged him to give Iron to the people, so that so they might be strong.""I will not!"" said Brodin, ""Not one plate will I share with them! For if men had Iron they might become strong and wise like us, and after a while they would drive us out of our kingdom. Besides, Iron is a dangerous tool and they are too poor and ignorant to be trusted with it. It is better that we on Mount Broylmpus rule the world without threat so all can be happy.""Brometheus didn't answer, but he had set his heart on helping mankind, and he did not give up. As he was walking by the seashore he found a sea snail. He saw that such a small soft creature, with steady determination could carry a heavy weight. He began a long journey to the top of Mount Broylmpus. ""Mankind shall have Iron, despite what Brodin has decided,"" he said to himself. And with that thought, he snuck quietly into Brodin’s domain and stole two plates from Brodin’s own rack. Brometheus securely strapped the plates to his back and hurried back to his own land, carrying with him the precious plates on his back. When he reached home, he called some of the thin people from their caves and built a bench and rack for them He showed them the dead lift, squat, and bench press. He showed them the food with which to make gains. Men and women gathered round the rack and were happy and filled with new strength, and thankful to Brometheus for the wonderful gift which he had brought to them.One evening, Brodin gazed down from Mount Broylmpus and noticed men and women lifting happily in every village across the land. It did not take him long to realize that Brometheus had disobeyed him and given Iron to men. Brodin was very angry and ordered that Brometheus be pinned under the mightiest of bars. And there Brometheus stayed, thinking of the future, happy in the knowledge that he had given Iron to men. After some time, men and women of the earth were strong, and they were ‘mired across the land by man and beast alike. They decided to thank Brometheus at the heights of Brolympus. As the people ascended, they heard a most saddening noise just outside the Temple atop the mountain. It was their savior, Brometheus, held down by a bar so mighty that no man can lift it.

Brodin saw the humans climb the mountain, and was angered and jealous of the gains they acquired. He saw them gather around Brometheus. His prisoner would not have the luxury of company! As Brodin approached the unforgiving bench, he saw the humans gather themselves into two groups, one on each side of the bar. Brodin hid himself and chuckled to himself. Perhaps this will teach those humans not to tread in the domain of gods.

The humans approached the bar and gripped it. As they lifted, the bar began to bend, but the weights remained on the ground. Bromethus pushed upward, and slowly, the weights rose. The bar was lifted, inch by inch, but lo, it crashed to the ground. Undeterred, the humans and Brometheus lifted again, and again, but with each attempt, the bar was raised less and less. “Enough! I have seen enough!” Brodin himself emerged from his cover and strode toward the humans and prisoner. “Why do you wish to free this man? He has wronged the gods, and must suffer.”

“No he has not.” replied a young man. He was not as mighty as some of the others, but he still stood valiantly. “Brometheus has saved us. No longer do we cower and run from animals, but we fight them. We use our cardio not to run, but hunt. We have fullness about our hearts. We feel complete both physically and mentally. Our PRs may not be as mighty as yours of the other gods, but that is not what is important.”

“This concept confounds me” Brodin stated. “If not to lift the heaviest weight, then why lift?” The young man replied,

“To improve. It does not matter where you are, but how far you’ve come. The iron tests us and our dedication, our determination. We have grown more on the inside than the outside.”

The man turned and headed to the bar, and the rest followed suit. Brodin watched on as the humans attempted again to raise the bar. Failure was wrought on their faces, and Brodin turned to the heights of Brolympus, and saw in sadness the vanity of the other gods. His fear had been realized. The humans grew wise, and him a fool.He once again gazed on the humans’ struggle. The more he looked on, the more his heart felt…different. As if his heart had swollen to defy the constraints of his chest. Visibly shaken, Brodin approached the bar. The humans, so dedicated and focused, did not notice. With an exhale and mighty pull, the bar was raised higher and higher until Bromethius was able to excape.

Before Brometheus could thank the humans, Brodin stood and stared down and the humans and demigod. “Forgive me. I thought all was the Iron and body. But I have experienced a new PR. I am now aware of the transformations of the heart and mind, and they too cannot be denied. This unity. This consolidation of mind heart and body, shall henceforth be called Swole. Only with all three tenets shall one ascribe the title of Swole to themselves.” Brodin approached the not-yet-strong man. “You are twixt the worlds of weak and strong, but your mind and heart are truly mighty. Your state shall be known as trans-swole, and it will be honored, as those who wish to change their weak bodies to strong ones are truly righteous if their commitment to the Iron is true. Pray to me at the Iron Temple and I will bless your reps. Worship me with righteous meals and I will bless you with gains.  Wheymen. "

"CRTs were still in fashion a lot longer than pretty much every other major technology that's changed in PCs in general. No-one thinks ""Man, it's weird that ISA cards were the bees knees just x years ago but now they're completely worthless"" and I think it purely comes from that generation that's old enough to have lived when CRTs were the mainstream but young enough that LCDs took over while you were still way too young to understand the situation or the like. So it felt *different* when CRTs became worthless because that was one of the few times a staple product in a house completely and utterly changed for nearly everyone around the same time.

In theory if we got rid of our cars for driverless pods (Think single or dual seater cars) the current generation of kids would probably think the same of traditional cars as we do CRTs."

"To be fair you have to think about what they're charging for individual drinks: a bottle of vodka is roughly 25oz. That's roughly 16 cocktails. At a club, it's not outrageous to pay $10 per drink, right? Especially if this is one who's charging that much for bottle service. So that's $160 alone, not including the Red Bull they probably gave you guys... I know it's like $2/can at the gas station but consider the stupid markup on a vodka/red bull... It usually adds a couple bucks to your drink. I've seen Smirnoff and RB go for $15 a pop at some bars. That said, let's say all of you guys drank red bull with your vodka, so the club values that at $14 instead of $10 per drink which comes to $224. Plus they're making it worth the server's time when you're not ordering anything else.

So yes it's a stupid dumb markup but it would've been more reasonable at like... $300. Also part of the cost is insurance for the off chance you and your pals are bozos who get too drunk and vomit."

"The life expectancy was that low mostly because the majority of people died as babies and children. If you made it to your late teens, the average life expectancy, even way back in like the 1400s, was 65+

From wiki:

&gt;Life expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above listed the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles at 30. Having survived until the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:

&gt;1200–1300: to age 64  
&gt;1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the bubonic plague)  
&gt;1400–1500: to age 69  
&gt;1500–1550: to age 71  

Even in Ancient Greece, people living over 50 wasn't uncommon. Plato wrote in Laws:

"Yeah as someone who is going through gestational diabetes and now has a significant risk of type 2, I watched that and got pissed. If you overwork an organ it's going to eventually quit on you. By constantly spiking your blood sugar, you're creating an overproduction of insulin, which in turn wears out your pancreas. Then having more insulin flowing through your body overall isn't great for you. 

Sugar and carbs that become sugar is what's causing these spikes. You can still have sugar and carbs but you need the right kind. You want to slow your body's digestion of these nutrients by pairing them with fiber and protein. By slowing it down you have a slow release rather than flooding your body suddenly and causing a spike. 

But this is just me googling for the past few months. I don't fucking want type 2 and I don't want my kid to develop type I because I couldn't control myself while being pregnant. Fucking any day now this kid will come out and I can allow myself an occasional treat but this was a real eye opener on how incredibly unhealthy the American diet is. "

"Disagree entirely.

I think this is a sign of huge intelligence.

- If you genuinely don't understand what someone is saying, and you ask for further clarification, it shows confidence and an active attempt to make sure you are getting it right

- Asking for clarification may mean that the original person is not communicating something properly

- Asking for the question worded in a different way can very often help the person think of it in a different way that may give rise to an answer not previously thought

- Asking for more information may be a sneaky smart person's way out of doing some of the leg work involved in the task or question given

I think going forward without understanding what another person has said is a clear sign of stupidity a lot more than asking a lot of questions."

I mean the comment I replied to said it's hard for a guy to focus on his wife when he has so much porn at his fingertips. And guys agree. Yea it changes perception of sex, but it also changes where your sexual energy is directed and your desire for your own partner. I still think indulging in any kind of porn can be negative depending on how much you watch it, just because it takes away from your own sexual relationship. I think it would be fine in a relationship if it was a once in a blue moon thing, but most people are watching it everyday and I don't find that healthy at all.

The National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute conducted a study that found:

&gt;[Participants who ate canned meat twice a week had double the risk of diabetes compared with those who ate canned meat only twice a month](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/news/spotlight/fact-sheet/strong-heart-study-targets-high-rate-heart-disease-among-american-indians)

Here's a great [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921224/) that observed Taiwanese Buddhists, some omnivores, some vegetarians. All of them consumed very little animal protein (The median for omnivorous men was 19g per day, compared to 4g for the vegetarians). They also made sure to adjust for age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, education, leisure time physical activity, smoking and alcohol. And of course, the vegetarians had way lower rates of diabetes compared to the omnivores. 

&gt;The crude prevalence of diabetes in vegetarians versus omnivores is 0.6% versus 2.3% in pre-menopausal women, 2.8% versus 10% in menopausal women, and 4.3% versus 8.1% in men.

Here's a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4073139/) on 7th day adventists that found vegetarians have lower risk of diabetes, obesity, certain cancers, mortality, and heart disease compared to omnivores, and that vegans had lower risk of all those compared to both omnivores *and* vegetarians. 

Vegetarians had 55% lower odds of developing hypertension. Vegans had 75% lower odds. The odds of developing type-2 diabetes were 25-49% lower for vegetarians compared to non-vegetarians. The risk reduction for vegans was 47-78%. 

Here's an [image of the Results section](http://i.imgur.com/EifgUJg.png) of the study, which is crazy. 

I can show you more studies if you'd like. Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, Heart Disease, and certain forms of cancer are linked to meat consumption in any amount.

"I determined that I was addicted to porn (at least mildly) a couple years ago when I realized that I couldn't resist using it even when I wasn't in the mood to masturbate. It took a while, but now I've trained myself not to allow the use of porn unless I want to masturbate. Sometimes not even then. It's still not completely under control, but I'm getting there.

"A couple of friends and myself went to see Hostel Two, and it was jam packed. I don't remember much of the movie because a) not that great and b) my hilarious neighbors. This guy and his girlfriend were next to us, and they were as stereo typically ""ghetto"" as it gets in a predominantly white area. I'm not a fan of movie talkers but his commentary was amazing. He had me in tears. People around us were getting SO pissed, but I couldn't breathe as I tried to keep quiet, while hyperventilating with laughter. About 3/4ths of the way through there was a scene that sent him over the edge, and he screams ""OH LAWD, JESUS NO"" and jumps into MY lap. And then, once he realized what he had done, tried to escape, tripping over purses and down the stairs, abandoning his girlfriend, who is looking at me with a look of complete shock. I don't remember much of what happened after that, but I think she just sheepishly tried to follow him. "

"The issue would be that if the majority of cars on the road were self driving, they would have a higher running speed and much higher traffic efficiency than manually driven cars due to all cars communicating and electronically establishing the most efficient route/lane to be in/speed etc. 

Due to this, having a manually driven car on the road would be detrimental to overall traffic flow and imo manually driven cars would have to take separate roads as they would seriously reduce efficiency due to not having as good decision making as a  computer and their unpredictability would make them a liability to the self drive cars. 

Whilst I understand your point of view and I totally support you continuing to drive even if self drive cars become the norm, it may well only be legal on private roads. Also driving is a privilege granted by a government ratified driving licence, not a right. Sorry to burst that bubble. "

"You might want to dive a little more in the underlying research on some of those studies. Just as an example, I've seen studies comparing outcomes for elderly people of normal weight vs overweight that didn't control for disease status. So if you were already dying of something that tended to make you lose weight along the way, you were contributing to the mortality numbers for the ""normal"" group. Another I saw didn't control for (or at least didn't mention controlling for) smoking status. Smokers might be unevenly distributed to the normal weight group because they consume an appetite supressant, but of course that will throw off morbidity as well.

It's really tricky when early data suggests a new finding, I really think one must look at the study pretty closely. I recall one study on keto that had a counter-intuitive finding and upon inspection the authors had people on LCHF for something like 3 days and then looked at their blood. That was the whole duration of the change in diet. Most keto people will tell you that it takes longer than that for the body to make the major adaptions to keto. So what is even being measured? Just the metabolic effect of having just started LCHF, not adhering to it."

"*Transitioning from a scene detailing the differences between male and female humans.*

CROSS-FADE TO:

INT. A PARTY - NIGHT

*Dozens of college-age individuals are milling around in every room of a large house. Many of them have red cups in their hands.*

**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) On some occasions, both the males and females of the species will come together for an evening, engaging in a complex ritual of courting and companionship.

*A YOUNG MALE awkwardly circles a room full of revelers while holding an empty bottle of beer.*

**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) Here we see a male, in the prime of his adulthood, surveying the scene. In his hand, he clutches a totem of melted sand, which serves as a sign of his availability to prospective mates. At first, he seems unlikely to succeed in his quest, and may be forced to return to his nest without company.

*The crowd parts, and YOUNG FEMALE wearing glasses is revealed. She is talking to the host's cat.*

**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) Then, an opportunity appears. The male, seeing what he believes to be a likely candidate for his mate, approaches the female. He offers a guarded greeting in the form of a time-honored mating call.    
**MALE:** Hey, uh... what's up?    
**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) The female, surprised by this advance, takes up a defensive posture.    
**FEMALE:** (*Shouting*) NO, I DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DRINK!    
**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) Undaunted, the male continues.    
**MALE:** Haha, no, uh, I was just... hey, so... I saw you, and... but I guess I'll leave you alone.    
**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) The pair continue to appraise one another. The male, understandably, is agitated. If he fails to impress the female within the next few seconds, he will become the pariah of the herd. He makes a motion as if to leave, prompting the female to offer reassurance.    
**FEMALE:** No, wait, I'm... sorry, I just thought... I mean, everyone here... it was my friend's idea, and...    
**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) The gesture has its intended effect. The male, now certain of victory, proceeds with the next stage of his mating ritual. This involves offering an exaggerated display of virility to the female, via a series of complex sounds and motions of his limbs.    
**MALE:** ... but *I* always thought that *Bulbasaur* was the best choice, because...    
**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) To show her approval, the female offers further encouragement. Her facial expressions reflect a sense of intense attraction as her voice brightens into a rapid-fire explosion of laughter.    
**FEMALE:** HA HA HA! I'm drunk!    
**MALE:** I thought you hadn't had anything to drink?

**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) The time has arrived. The female, now thoroughly smitten with her prospective mate, leans forward to display her ample bosom. The male, taking notice, begins to grow flush and sweat profusely, indicating to the female that he is ready... for copulation. 

CROSS-FADE TO:

INT. A PARTY - THE BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

*The young man and woman nervously enter a bedroom, then fumble with one another's clothing.*

**NARRATOR:** (*V.O*) (*CONT'D*) The pair depart for a suitably private setting, where they employ shaking motions to remove each other's garments. After a few failed attempts, the male enters the female. Intercourse may continue for as long as twenty-eight seconds... or until life outside of their ecstasy reasserts itself.    

*The door bursts open, and a BRO enters.*

**BRO:** (*Shouting*) Whoa-ho! Hey, dudes! Check it out! *Nerd sex!*

FADE TO BLACK.

"When my daughter was born with severe disability we made the decision my wife would quit work to take care of her full time. To take care of the family, I worked a FT job, a PT warehouse job, and a PT overnight security job. There were stretches where I'd only sleep for 15-60 minutes per day for an entire year. It took 6 months of getting 8 hours a night before I started feeling normal again. "

"Any job that has you holding passively flexed positions can be exhaustive on joints and tissues. A job that has you doing both just tires out both. Proper daily stretches before, during, and at the end of the day coupled with deep consistent breathing will help with any muscles that have become hypertonic due to prolonged stationary flexion. It is important to stay moving.

Stretches as well as a hot bath/sauna once a week will help draw toxins from the muscle tissues like lactic acid that can physically glue muscles together. The heat dissolves the lactic acid and breaks apart lactic adhesions that have already formed. The heat from the water also acts as a vasodilator which allows more circulation to the joints and tissues. More bloodflow means more oxygen to aide in tissue restoration. The heat from the bath also increases your blood pressure to regulate your core temperature. Sweating is important because the body detoxes through urination and sweat, so your body is filtering out a lot. Especially the lymphatic fluid. On a regular basis, your body filters out 4 to 6 liters of lymphatic fluid a day. A massage or long hot bath increases that from 10 to 30 liters.

Morning stretches shouldn't take very long. They're primary function is to warm up the muscle tissue and ligaments. Throughout the day, shoulder rotations forwards and backwards while deeply breathing through the rotation will help loosen up your rotator cuff as well as your shoulders. The issue with why people at desks develop neck and shoulder issues is because sitting for long periods causes the lower back to slouch to give your core muscles a break. In doing so, you're sitting lower in the chair, but the keyboard and mouse are still the same height. So your body compensates by raising your shoulders higher. The problem with that is when your levator scapula becomes hypertonic, your shoulders will have a harder time lowering. The shoulder rotations causes you to actively flex your pecks, rhomboids, lats, levator scapula, teres major and minor, suprispinatus, and traps. If by the end of the day, your neck and shoulders are feeling sore, you can consider purchasing a heated neck wrap for the end of the day, or drape a hand towel across your shoulders in the shower and run the hot water on the towel while conditioning your hair or washing your face. The towel absorbs the hot water and retains the heat on your shoulders. Now, with the lower back, a foam roller would be your best friend, and YouTube hip flexor stretches. This will help alleviate tension in the lower back and glutes. Stretches at night are meant to be longer to ensure that you bring all the muscles to their end range of motion. Whatever tension you bring to bed with you just gets worse as you sleep."

"I remember him, his name was Fergie Olver and it was from a Canadian game show from the 80s called Just Like Mom.

I remember having a really creepy gym teacher back then who would walk right into the boy's and girl's changing rooms while we were getting dressed and I don't think he ever got in trouble. "
"Our system of government is designed to only sustain 2 parties.  When ""things get too bad"" a third party can pop up to offer a remedy but the only time that was successful was the Civil War. Yes, that party (Republican) survived but the Wigs than had to die.

In order for a party to be successful at a national level it has to have enough appeal to at least temporarily grasp hold of a plurality of support.  (This would be easier if I could use diagrams....)

With two parties they control a ""base"" on either side of base ideology (yes, many people hold values on both sides of the political spectrum but the vast majority of them prioritize a few specific issues to the point the issues which don't line up with their chosen ideology are just ignored, the individuals whom hold strongly to conflicting ideological perspectives fall into the middle....""the moderates"")

It is than this middle where the fight begins.  Whoever can twist priorities enough to get just enough of these people in the middle to break 50% ""wins.""  Simple enough.

You don't have to be a history buff to see this is why you always get the pendulum swinging back and forth. One party gets power, basically does very little or even if they do accomplish a lot, it is easy for the party out of power to point out &amp; exploit the million other things of why the world/country isn't perfect.  The middle get frustrated so ""bring in the other guys.""  This just goes back and forth forever in our political system.

So a third party wants to jump in on this; on the federal level they will need a single IMMEDIATE issue that grabs those in the middle and moderates to the left &amp; right (long standing issues like abortion are so far down most people's priority ladder it will not capture the attention of a lot of voters, the issues has to be an emergency like war, a massive failure of the economy, or [possibly] the planet is catching fire).

To cut to the chase; that third party MIGHT be able to grab a plurality in the immediate term BUT one of two things will happen; either one of the original 2 parties will adapt &amp; ""steal"" that single issue or that single issue will be satiated by the third party so those moderates that brought the third party to power will be able to be pulled back to the left &amp; right battle. Either way that third party will whither and die.

....or that third party will evolve and reach out to the left or right extremes and simply replace the party that was there.  Same two party ideological battle, just new names.

You want a third party; focus only on local politics or move to a country with a parliamentary system.

"Well, a combination of things. First off, I'm going to state the fact that I'm a 20 year old male, since that's probably important. My confidence in my appearance and social skills is relatively low.

I'm really not good at catching hints, even if they're obvious. In general, my social skills are very much sub-par. I'm improving, and today can hold a decent conversation with most people, but it's still very draining, and I still have no idea how to approach girls without seeming creepy or weird, especially when they're in a group of their friends.

My main two interests are gaming (and other nerdy things, fantasy, sci-fi, etc.) and guns. That second one tends to scare people off, especially in the very liberal area I live in. While similar interests are not necessary in a relationship, it's a bit hard to explain why I go to the shooting range to someone who is terrified at the mere thought of me owning a gun. That, and I have a far easier time talking to people with common interests.

With the current dating pool, I feel like almost every girl I come across is basically the same person. Same clothing style, same interests, same personality. I rarely find anyone interesting. It's always generic ""I like Netflix and hanging out with friends"" girl #2, or generic ""Country girl"" #5, etc, and it bores the shit out of me. It's like playing a game filled with the same 5 generic NPCs, with the same lines of dialogue, but different faces. I want to date someone different, someone more like me that I can relate to, and that's so incredibly hard for me to find for some reason. It's not that these girls are unattractive, most are gorgeous, but I know that our personalities are simply not compatible for a long-term relationship that I'm looking for.

Anyway, TL;DR: I have social issues, I have no idea how to approach girls, and finding someone I can relate to is nigh-impossible."
"A friend of mine struggles with depression and when she's really down she doesn't answer the phone for weeks. I decided to test how long her voicemail records for (15 minutes). Over the years I've read her all of the weirdest fanfics I could find including this^ one, one where the giant squid has sex with Dobby and Hagrid, a BDSM story with Dobby and Ed Milliband. There was one about Voldemort pining over Dobby. Generally if it has Dobby or the giant squid in it I've read it to her voicemail."

You made decisions on behalf of her body. Be honest with yourself OP,  if you were the one ""taking the wheel,"" this whole fantasy probably wasn't really about her. "

"My ex-boyfriend had a little from his fraternity's accompanying sorority, and same story pretty much. At first I didn't mind, because I was in a co-ed professional fraternity and my big, whom I was very close to and hung out with all the time, is a guy, and there was literally never anything romantic about our relationship at any time.


However, the amount of time they were spending alone together paired with the way he would talk about her (""She's so cute!"") began to bother me, and when I tried to talk to him about it, he called me crazy. 


Sure enough, they were together within a week of our inevitable breakup, and they're still together. Cheaters always think they're so slick."

"&gt;The occasional drunk will get caught shooting at planes or fish

This would be a serious issue in, say, Los Angeles. When you live in an area with an average of 7k people per square mile there's no space to just shoot a gun for shits and giggles. Shit, if you shot at an intruder in your apartment building and missed, there's a significant chance you'll hit an innocent bystander. This is a big reason why the gun debate is so sharply divided between urban and rural demographics. "
"I loved Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger when I was younger though I don't know if it's stood the test of time. The Cobra Event by Richard Preston I've re-read multiple times and it is possibly one of the more frightening books I've ever read. 

Edit: by standing the test of time I mean that I don't know if the book would mean to me now what it meant to me nearly fifteen years ago. If it would speak to me in the same way. For example, I loved Fight Club when I was twenty but now believe Lullaby or Survivor would be Paulinick's best work because I no longer associate my masculinity with what I do but instead it's inherent in who I am. I don't know if the feeling of isolation in The Catcher in the Rye would speak to me since I actively seek out places where I can be truly alone."

"The Stupids starring Tom Arnold. It was awarded Worst Film of 1996, but it is one of my favorites. Basically, the plot is that Stanley Stupid notices that his garbage is being stolen when he leaves it out on the curb at night. So, he investigates and finds that a large truck comes and takes it. He follows the truck to the dump where he discovers the trash of thousands of people. To this he exclaims, ""I've discovered the crime of the century!"" All throughout the film, it turns out that he unknowingly discovered an ex-military arms dealer that is selling weapons to foreign powers. The bad guys mistake Stanley for a government spy and spend the movie trying to stop him, all while Stanley somehow saves the world, but not in the way he thinks. The film also features an amazing cameo from Sir Christopher Lee.  
In a fitting fashion, the best way to describe the film is ""stupid,"" as the title points out, but I can't help but laugh hysterically at everything (especially when Stanley thinks he dies and meets God)."

"&gt;Yeah...see...feminists aren't asking for special treatment.

Except that the documentary provides proof, directly from the mouths of feminists... No, the feminists don't consciously ask for special treatment, but because they falsely believe that women are 2nd rate citizens in many ways in our western society, their idea of 'equality' actually becomes 'superiority'.

For example, feminists believe that women get paid less than men. Because of that belief, they demand that women get paid more. 
However, [that belief has been proven false.](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/public-policy/hr-public-policy-issues/Documents/Gender%20Wage%20Gap%20Final%20Report.pdf)
As a result, instead of fighting for equality, they inadvertently fight for having superiority to men, because of their false beliefs (that a large part of society believes as well).

This is just one example."

"I had to walk my neighbours dog, who was dreadfully unexercised and slept in a cage. For the purposes of this story all you need to know is this: it was a tiny dog, weighing in at about 5lbs max. All his energy was focused into barking incessantly. But they paid handsomely so who was I to refuse as a broke 16 year old? 

I figured this dog needed to stretch its legs, so I attached its extendo-leash and took it for a run with me. About 600m in, the dog is doing a fine job, and keeping pace with me, so I decide to up the speed. The dog matches my speed, and even overtakes me. So I let him run ahead for a while. He's about 2m (6ft) in front of me, when all of a sudden I feel the extendo leash max out, and this dog launch like the eagle he was never born to be. This dog  flew back at about 20% the speed of sound. Turns out he had gone one side of a lamppost, and I had gone the other. The leash did the rest of the work. 

My initial reaction was that this dog had definitely crushed his windpipe. My 175lbs of muscle moving forward at a brisk pace vs. his 5 pounds of fluff and annoying attitude concentrated over the area of his dog collar, I figured he was done for. Nope. He just bounced back, I walked around the lamppost, checked his collar, and ruffled his hair and on we went."

"Red flag five: if your five year old feels safer with a comp!ete stranger for who knows how long, rather than go anywhere with her father, you are undoubtedly getting this parenting thing very very wrong. Six: if you willingly allow your five year old to stay in the company of a random teenager instead of taking them with you when you are thrown out of the park, again, getting that parenting thing totally wrong.  

Thank you for taking care of that little girl. I hope she's well away from her shitty father."
"Well for one thing my dad has bipolar disorder and really it's a fucking flip of a coin if he's going to yell at me for 2 hours for leaving drops of ravioli sauce on the counter or he's going to talk to me about how David Bowie was a great musician and how he's proud of my music.

I agree that parents are there for guidance and discipline but for him it was less about parenting and more about anger and his inability to control it. I was going through a phase of immaturity but I think that anyone in my household would have told you before he was medicated it was like walking around in a minefield with a bomb also strapped to your chest. Even if you avoided everything it was only a matter of time.

In contrast me and my mom have a wonderful relationship as she provided me with endless hours of support, love and care. I've had very little problems with her and vice versa. She has helped me through many a situation even without any clue how to. I love her very much. Meanwhile I barely speak to my father.

Another thing I'd like to say is that as a kid, especially raised in that house hold. You didn't talk and still don't talk to each other. You keep your head down and stay out of sight. So I know you're trying to ""give advice"" but really you don't know too much about my family. 

Telling me to let one out of thousands of situations where my dad overreacted by insulting me and screaming in my face at me is nice but I think I'd rather just deal with it by avoidance. So far the past 3 years where he says he misses us only to call us fucking retards when he visits for not closing drawers and then trying to kick my younger brother out of the house when my dad let the dog out of the house without a leash and almost got hit by a car (which is not his fault in any way) is going much better than before his medication. (Both situations were literally 2 months ago and while on medication).

So thanks man. I appreciate the words but I just wanted to share that I said some dumb shit about the wrong person and got caught using social media and that it's not always funny haha stories but sometimes people eat really mad and punish their kids."

"Watched it last night and felt the same way. The turn it did take was an interesting one, but as we ventured further into the territory of the fact Russia used a *state-sponsered* drug program, the further we got away from the idea that the top X amount of athletes in nearly any sport are on drugs and just haven't been caught for it yet. That seemed to be the angle they were going with when they kept describing the top-10 guys in the Haute as 'superhuman' and so far ahead of everyone else in the competition, etc.    

Also, while I realise this is a minor complaint, did anyone else feel like the doc was a little overproduced or something? I was confused whether we were actually watching the events as they happened and they had a *really good* film crew, or if it was dramatically re-enacted. Kinda watched like the latter, in any case.

"I think that was the point of showing that in the documentary. These kids have the same viewpoint as the KKK members, just from the other side. They have an extreme pride in their race, and feel like they should be able to have groups and places strictly for themselves. 

I also think that's why you've seen a lot of white men move towards the right.

Racism:

a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human racial groups determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others.

Far left leaning professors say a LOT of things to push agendas. You can trust all science, history, and math rooted in truths because they're facts.

But when it comes to opinions and cultural issues there's a political agenda for academia and SJWs.

"I've known a few in my time, and it seems that they are protesting the Black Lives Matters movement and are standing for most of the things that BLM are against. Many of the conservatives (I don't think that all of them are Nazis, but there are a few whose posts I find very troubling) on my FB feed are demanding that BLM be recognized as a hate group as well.

So, like many conservative movements in the last few years, they are not so much protesting for something as they are trying to undo what liberal organizations are doing.

Now, from that post some might think I'm extremely liberal. I'd actually consider myself more moderate and somewhat conservative in some countries, but if certain conservative movements are going so far back as to look up to the Nazis, then I will look pretty damned liberal by comparison. "

"Holy shit! This literally *just* happened to me yesterday. Left my car lights on after driving to work in a storm. When i left work, it was late so everyone had already left, and it rained again in the evening. No covered parking. Battery was dead. No big deal right? Bear in mind everything below happened on a pitch black night on a street with no lights in a light drizzle.

Arrange for a Grab (something like an uber) to a petrol station to arrange for a jump. RM6 is something like $1.20 so i figured no driver would bother with such a short trip. One did and offered to help me with a jump. So i switch on the car to release the steering lock, push it nose to nose with his car, and we hook up the batteries. Only when we connect the second terminal, the car spazzes out and thinks we're trying to steal the car and locks itself. Only the keys are still in the ignition. And my work laptop inside.

So now we're trying to figure out to jimmy the car, removing door trim and trying to lever the window down. Turns out power windows dont break so easily. Give up and grab a hammer from the shop floor. A few hits later, determined but conscious of ripping our arms open, we figure wtf we're pussies. Look, auto glass is tough stuff and windows are designed to have a slight give, and the gasket also absorbs some energy - no baseball bats handy, basically we only have a footlong hammer. So we decide to drive about 40mins round trip back to my place for the spare key. Arrange for the factory security to watch the car (laptops can be replaced, but not the information within) and head off.

The trip was a pair of bros going off on politics, the nations religious shortcomings and sharing of an idea for this app he was working on.

Return to the car, open the car, hook everything up. Alarm goes off, and presumably the immobilizer. The car is 20 years old, so the bypass switch is basically a capless stub now. Rip out the switch and figure it is either always off or always on. Get the thing to stfu so we can get back to trying to jump the car.

Hook everything up, dash lights are bright, turn the ignition - nothing. Struggle for a few more minutes before deciding to try to roll start the car. Noe the battery is completely dead by now. If the other car was not hooked up, the alarm would sort of grunt itself to death. No luck.

We finally try a second jumper cable, and BOOM - ignition on first try.

Tl;dr: what starts out as a $1.20 grab trip turns into an epic oddessy of selflessness, brotherhood and what we in malaysia call 'semangat muhibbah' - the spirit of harmonious fellowship (dont hold me to that translation). Tipped him a fat bonus for his effort. 10/10 would recommend."

I was recently out in San Francisco. Coming from a small midwestern town where we don't have homeless people the homelessness was staggering to me. My sister brought me to Berkeley and it blew my fucking mind. I don't carry cash on me and I just felt so bad for some of these people approaching me asking for help or food. Some were down right crazy while others just seemed down on their luck. 
"Following a nasty accident in which I burned my hand, I was prescribed Percocet.

The weirdest side effect, hands down, was that it made me eat eggs.

Now, that may not sound like a particularly odd medicinal effect, but the truth of the matter is that prior to then, I hadn't eaten eggs (at least on purpose) in fifteen years. There's just something about their combined texture, flavor, and smell that sends my stomach into a series of nauseating back-flips. After swallowing a couple of Percocet, though, I found myself feeling obnoxiously giddy, mildly adventurous, and oddly content with anything that life might throw my way. For whatever reason, the combination of these emotions prompted me to fry up and consume two sunny-side-up eggs with a side of toast. I can't say that I enjoyed the meal very much, but I *did* finish the whole thing.

Another side effect of my exposure to Percocet involved an immediate addiction to Percocet.

The funny thing is, I didn't even notice that anything was amiss at first. I'd pop a couple of pills in the morning when I woke up, take another in the afternoon, and then take a fourth right before I went to sleep. Then, as my hand healed, I decided to start forgoing the evening pills... which is when the misery started. I felt this odd compulsion to continuously move my legs, my entire body felt stiff, and the air around me was simultaneously too hot, too cold, and too dry all at once. Worse still, being so wide awake meant that I was conscious as the aching, throbbing sensation in my hand climbed up to full force, and I eventually decided to take a Percocet to offset the agony.

Only a few minutes after I'd swallowed the pill, I felt much better. In fact, it was almost as if... oh.

Right.

Fortunately, I managed to recognize what was happening before it got too far out of hand. I still needed the pain relief in order to effectively function in my day-to-day life, but I made a point to keep from taking enough to actually feel *good*. After my prescription eventually ran out, I left a pill in the bottle, just to prove that I had enough willpower to resist its allure.

I *almost* tricked myself into taking that pill in celebration of my success, but I caught myself just in time.

**TL;DR: Percocet: A study in addiction and eggs.**"

"I was at a wedding of two kids FRESH out of high school. I'd run to the bathroom immediately after the awkward ceremony and came back to go through the receiving line. By the time I got back to them, the whole wedding party was having a smoke break and I hear the mother of the bride say, ""honey, I have your pipe when you're ready."" 

The groomsmen all disappear and show up half an hour later reeking of weed. The bride and groom run off, with the groom loudly bragging they're going to consummate the marriage. They came back about 5 minutes later complaining they couldn't get her dress off. 

I was hungry and stuck around waiting for the food that I kept hearing was ""coming out any minute"". After an hour and a half there was still no food, no drinks, no music, and the bridal party was nowhere to be found. However, they had all marked their places at the bridal party table with their vape pens and fidget spinners.  

It didn't feel like a wedding so much as a crappy high school house party. "

"You need to talk to a doctor about why you should avoid foods you are allergic to.  First off, not everyone is you and food allergies to kill.

It's better to avoid those foods now so in 10 years an accidental exposure will just give you a rash instead of stop your breathing."

"About ten years ago, I had a long bus commute in a rural kind of area and would often spend the time reading books that I'd gotten from the library (I was wicked broke, so couldn't afford to buy books, but luckily the local library was well stocked). I'd been doing this for about two months when one of the other morning commuters stopped in front of my seat. I recognized him from us being on the same bus every weekmorning, but had never spoken to him before. 

""Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you and I know I hate when people talk to me when I'm reading but I just wanted to give you this."" He handed me a small envelope and then got off the bus at his usual stop. 

I opened the envelope and inside there was a note about how he had recently gone to a conference that encouraged him to think about the people on the periphery of his life, who he might not know on a personal level but who still had an impact in some way. He wrote that it made him very happy to see me reading on the bus every morning and he found himself always curious to see what I was reading and he'd wonder if I liked it, etc. He was leaving town but he wanted me to know that I had made a difference and made him smile and he wanted to thank me.

In the envelope was also a $100 gift certificate for a local bookstore. I still have the books I bought with it. "

"I got very lucky. My Mom absolutely always wanted kids. She's supportive, loving, and involved without being overbearing. She made my childhood, though we were crazy poor, mostly wonderful. However, I had friends whose parents clearly never really wanted children, but did it because of societal pressure, and they definitely suffered for it. These friends had parents anywhere from abusive drug addicts to just kind of cold. These friends spent a lot of time at my house because my mom has such an infinite amount of love to give. I swear she parented dozens of kids, but only 3 of us were hers by birth. Being a parent definitely isn't something you can half ass and expect to come out okay."

Sober, I'm a really nice, smart, compassionate, empathetic girl who loves my family and friends and fucking dog above everything. When I'm sober, I'm a really great person. I have a law degree with fantastic marks with a top 20 university degree in the world. I'm selfless and loving. But there's a drive to drink that I have that even I can't explain, and when I drink I'm not a good person. I even neglect my dog, who I love more than I love myself. Addiction is strange. It abducts your brain. It's truly a mental illness. "

"On POF. Saw a cute pic of a guy, read his profile and he fitted my nerd requirements. Sent him a message saying to read my profile and message if he was interested but no worries if he wasn't (most guys aren't actually looking for a relationship, just some tail or sexting).

He sent a message back with ""Imperials or Stormcloacks?"", to which I obviously replied ""Stooooormcloacks!"" He laughed and we started talking. A week later we met in the nearest town between us (an hour each way for us both). It went great and I was smitten.

3 months later he let me move in because my housing benefit got wrongly cut off and I was asked to move out. He helped me cope with my mental issues to the point where I could get a job again. 

We're about to celebrate our 2 year anniversary. He has been there through my being mugged at knife-point in an alleyway, my mother getting cancer and almost refusing treatment then resulting suicidal idealisation, my brother dying from opioid overdose (the inquest is the end of this month), and numerous psychological issues.

He encourages me to be a better person, to do more, be more, and become the best I could be. I feed him and give him the validation and company he's probably craved."

"It's because ""bigotry"" is a subjective line, and people disagree over what that line is.

**For example, take the following statements, from ""right"" to ""left"".  You'll likely believe some are bigoted, and some are reasonable.**

---------

 1) Women are less represented in STEM because they are biologically inferior to men in brain capacity and logical skills, just like how men are stronger than women physically.

 2) Women are less represented in STEM because they're biologically less likely to have skills which translate to proficiency in science and technology.

 3) Women are less represented in STEM because they're biologically less likely to have interest in science and technology.

 4) Women are less represented in STEM because they're simply less interested in science and technology due to our culture's gender-related biases.

 5) Women are less represented in STEM because STEM is a boy's club and women don't feel comfortable entering into male-dominated fields, partly due to harassment.

 6) Women are less represented in STEM due to unconscious sexist bias against women.

 7) Women are less represented in STEM due to overt, conscious sexist discrimination against women by men.

 8) Women are less represented in STEM because all men are sexist bigots who want to keep women down in society to maintain patriarchal control.

--------

For most people there are upper and lower bounds on what they would consider ""bigoted"".  For example my friend doesn't believe in #7 or #2, but believes all the others are true.  If someone says ""You believe #3, you're a bigot"" to him, there are a lot of people who would disagree, and think #3 is true.  They might consider that person an SJW bigot, and sever ties with them.  The opposite can happen on the other side of the spectrum as well.

"There's a local legend in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which involves a mysterious and supposedly deadly sort of otherworldly creature. Some versions claim that it's a man-like shapeshifter, capable of blending in with the shadows as it stalks through the desert. Others describe the beast as being curiously canine in nature, albeit with too-long limbs, black claws, and eyes that seem to burn like pinprick embers in the darkness. One thing that remains the same through every retelling, though, is the high and eerie keening noise it's said to make when it hunts down its prey.

One evening when I was about eleven years old, I heard it.

I had been lying in bed, reading beneath my covers with a flashlight, when a mournful howl pierced the air from somewhere across the moonlit sands. My first thought was that it had been a coyote... but as the sound echoed through the night for a second time, I felt a shiver of panic flash up my spine and a deep weight of dread coalesce in my chest. That evil wail was not the call of anything I had ever encountered, nor of something that should have even existed in the waking world; it was the cry of a nightmare incarnate, and no amount of reason or rationality could shake me of that notion.

Now, at around the same time as this story, I'd been doing my best to foster a reputation for being an independent and unflappable badass. That goal went swiftly out the window as the screeches seemed to draw ever closer, and I quickly ran from my room to seek the protection of my parents. Upon reaching their door, though, I was presented with an even more terrifying discovery: The howls were coming from *inside the house*... along with a lot of heavy breathing and the occasional whisper.

I couldn't look my mother in the eye for a week.

**TL;DR: The call of a creature from a nightmare forced me to face a truly mind-melting horror.**

My brother made the mistake of drinking out of it and he took a swig and said it burned his mouth like crazy. He also did it another time when the bottle was on the counter awaiting to be taken to my car. Those bottles of poison fixed my dirty windows and also stopped my brother from just drinking out of everyone's stuff. 

**Edit- the point of this was, most likely who ever drank it immediately knew it was poison and likely didn't drink half a container. "

"A Chicago alderman and a small-town councilman decide to do an exchange program to see how politics works in a different setting.

The councilman arrives at O'Hare, and a limousine drives him to the alderman's lavish house. There's a brand-new Lexus in the driveway, and the house is filled with nice furniture. Over cigars, the councilman says, ""So, I have a question. Your salary is only $110,000 per year. How do you afford all of this?""

""Ah, I was waiting for that question. Come upstairs and I'll show you how politics is done in this city. Look out the window. See the towers over there? They're low-income housing, just recently built.""

""Yes, I see them.""

The alderman smiles and pats his pocket. ""I get 5% of that. You want to do business in this part of the city, you have to come talk to me.""

The councilman understands immediately and compliments him.

Later on, the alderman arrives at the Pigknuckle Municipal Airport. A Rolls-Royce picks him up and drives him to the councilman's mansion. A Ferrari is in the driveway. All of the furniture is fine, antique mahogany.

A typical card counter, in all his life playing blackjack, will never encounter a count low enough that would precipitate the player to hit a 17, if it's even possible in the first place.

By and large, a card counter plays basic strategy, since the idea is that basic strategy gets more and more accurate with the higher the count.  There are strategy variations that take place with higher counts (called indicies), but they make up a marginal fraction of the edge gained in counting and an AP can do just fine without them."

"Two ways.

The first was when I learned the difference between a trophy child and a golden child.  My mom would parade me around because I was successful, volunteered in charities, and had *very basic* social skills, but when we were alone I was the work horse of the family even though I'm the only child living on my own in the family.

The second was when my mentally ill brother was trying to get my mom to move in HIS. DRUG. DEALER. rent free into her house.  He tried to get me to back him up and I said he doesn't respect mom or her house (he had screamed at her after she had major surgery just days prior and wouldn't even get her water).  He then started yelling at me that he didn't want me in his life and that I should kill myself and *my mom took his side*.

***

It gets more complicated though.

That second one I literally physically felt something break in me.  I tried to talk sense into my mom about how I was trying to support her (I had been coming over at 6 in the morning and leaving at 11 at night caring for her after she had surgery on her leg... I'm married and hadn't seen my wife in days at that point) but mom told me that since I was healthier I *deserved* to be wrong.  Because I was healthier I was always wrong.  It didn't matter what the circumstances.  I'm not even paraphrasing.

I didn't handle it well.  I flipped shit and yelled an embarrassing amount.  

I went No Contact that day.  

The more I distanced myself the more I could see what was happening.  

My mom *wanted* me sick.  She didn't want me better than my brother.  She resented me for being well.  "

They run stop signs and red lights. They go full speed around blind corners. They don't drive close enough to the side to be passed. Even when a bike lane is present, they drive on the damn line. They drive all over the place unpredictably. They know all liability is on the driver if anything happens and they abuse the hell out of it. They don't pay attention to anything. I have to constantly honk at them to get them to even notice my existence as they serpentine down the road.

They see themselves as pedestrians when it suits them (parks and sidewalks) and a vehicle when it suits them (in the middle of the fucking road).

It is kinda hard not to hate them.

My opinion of them would instantly be positive if they payed attention and didn't break/abuse the law.

So in a weird way I'm grateful.

"Throwaway for obvious reasons --

My wife's best friend cuts my hair. She's a pro, but since we're all friends she cuts me a deal (no pun intended) and cuts my hair at her apartment for $20 cash instead of me going to her salon and paying triple. 

She's very attractive, complete ""hot single mom"", and has magnificent breasts. *What? I'm a guy, I notice things.*

The last time she cut my hair, couple weeks ago, I show up and she answers the door in a thin spaghetti strap shirt and pajamas, very clearly not wearing a bra, and looks surprised to see me. 

""Oh hey, what are you doing here?""

""Oh.. um.. Kelly told me you two had planned for me to come get my haircut today""

""OH! Oh of course, I am so sorry, the kids were crazy today, I totally forgot.""

""Oh okay, I can come back another day if today's not good after all""

""No, of course not, come on in""

She pulls out a chair for me into her kitchen area and hands me the smock thing, I put it on and sit down.

She gets down to snipping from behind me, cutting away, and eventually moves around to the side. Now, my face is right at boob-level, and I doubt this was intentional, but the entire time she's working on the sides and front of my hair, she's got her erect nipples brushing against my face and neck through her shirt, and her crotch pressed against my arm through the smock. 

I jerked off to her Facebook photos while my wife was at work that night. I feel guilty about it. "

"For the record, most women DO suffer an economic loss after divorce.   If you search, you will find comments saying this isn't true, but the vast majority of studies show that women suffer.  Having children hurts women's income more than men.  Divorce hurts them even more.  

That doesn't mean that men should get screwed, just that the idea of women living high on the hog after a divorce is just not true in most cases. "

"Cars are a privilege, though, not a right. Having armaments for self defense is a human right enumerated and protected in our Bill of Rights. It's there to prevent the government from disarming and abusing the people. Having a weapon is the ultimate way of saying ""No"" to anyone that tries to hurt you.

I'm totally in agreement that we need widely and freely available safety training, but I'm wholly against the idea of a mandatory system of licensing a right. It'd be the same as requiring a license to vote or speak a political opinion in public. All of our enumerated rights are on the same level, and need to be treated as such. If a restriction is inappropriate for speech, voting, or privacy, then it's inappropriate for our right to self defense of ourselves and community.

All Americans have the right to own weapons for self defense purposes. It's in the constitution in plain language- ""shall not be infringed"". Since we all have that right, we should all have free and widely available safety training and education. Make every kid in a public school attend a yearly safety class. Offer up some more advanced classes in high school for kids who are interested in competitive shooting. Make it a public and normal thing to know about gun safety and firearms, at least passingly. But don't make a mandatory licensing system a real thing. 

We've seen the hardships that creates in places like New York State where you need to spend $200-400 just for the classes and permit fees to even ask permission to own a gun... and that's on top of the cost of the gun itself. If you're a poor single mother working 80+ hours a week, you likely can't attend the police interview that's only available for scheduling on every other Thursday from 10am-1pm. You likely can't drive two towns over, take the day off work, hire a baby sitter, just to get a police interview (one of multiple, possibly, on top of training class requirements, shopping for a gun, etc). Mandatory systems disproportionately affect the poor, and it amounts to a poll tax on those who are disadvantaged in our society."

How I overcame it was lots of self-reflection.  I got into therapy, I read a lot of stuff (Buddhist philosophy really helped me let things go), I took up hobbies (bike riding, board gaming), I met new people, I reached out to old friends.  Within a year, I had a much better job and was in a much healthier relationship.  It wasn't easy -- especially the first 3 or 4 months, but it does get better."

"Its nice, I like that mix but there are also some downsides. I've lived in a couple small towns, the first one was quite isolated, along a highway and there was nothing for 30 miles in any direction. The other was a ""town"" about 30-60 minutes from a decent sized city. Now the community in the first place is great, they organize events, try to bring musical shows to town, and lots of other things to bring the community together. Easy to make a lot of really great connections. A lot of really outdoorsy people always going out hiking/biking/climbing/skiing. Now the downside is, if you get sick of the people or something happens, that's all you got and you pretty much gotta move away or become a lone wolfer. 

Now the other small town didn't have a community like the other one, everyone just went to the city for everything even groceries. The grocery store in town sucked because everyone would drive to costco on the outskirts of the city. There was nothing unique or interesting going on in the town, it barely even had a name, it was just ""we live outside _______"". It was just a little offshoot of the city but it was also great cause I had land, quiet, and nature. If you pick the right small town, there can be amazing culture and a lot of interesting things going on."

"Sometimes when I am real high I start reading wikipedia and can waste a whole day just going through a single topic with references, links, and etc.

Just a week ago I had one of those weed and wiki sessions, and, weirdly, it was about French in the WW2. The contribution was tremendous. It was one of the first country to actually try and do shit when Germans rolled in. Mind you, French got to fight ""fresh"" German forces. I am not trying to say Russians had it easy, but by the time Germans got to the USSR they were pretty exhausted. When they invaded France they were fresh as pickles. French fought bravely. THey lost lives. 

The problem with people judging them for giving up at some point is that they dont realize that French fought on their own soil. Like, Germans have common borders with France. THey crossed the bordered and entered major cities pretty quickly not because the French were weak fighters, its because they were so close. And when you fight on your soil you have to be very careful. You cant fuck your enemies up with artilery because the enemy is in your city, and your citizens, that you swore to protect and serve, are there, in those cities. You cant just roll tanks in and fuck up enemy's positions because enemy may be hiding in buildings where your family may be living. You cant just call in bombers and cover the whole area because that could piss the Germans off, and who knows, maybe they will hurt civilian population to get back at you.

Overall, the reason many people think less of French participation in the WW2 is that French dont seem to popularize their role and do a better job explaining their limitations. I cant think of any famous movies made about French in the War. Their politicians dont seem to be discussing the role of French soldiers and etc."

 Don't think controlling automatically equals narcissistic. 
"i grew up very much country but currently live in the city. I completely agree. I've always explained it in a very similar way, with one difference: interaction with the government. In the city, you pay a percentage of your income to pay for things like the parks department, road maintenance, emergency services, and social welfare programs without a second thought because you *see* them in action. You get a park to play with your kids in, library programs in your neighborhood that teach job skills, social services to help if you or your family are having a hard time, and emergency services mere moments away. Nobody minds paying taxes when they *see* the outcome.

In the country, by contrast, you see a Sheriff's deputy cruise by a couple of times a week, you have to maintain your own dirt road, and the nearest library is 45 minutes away. You have to pay 25% of your income for THAT? 

When things go wrong in the country you don't have anyone to call to help you. After any crises die down, you now get to worry about an EPA official coming out and seeing a low point in your property that, for a week a year, holds some water. God help you if they decide it qualifies as wetlands, because your property value just got cut in half. Oh, your neighbor got drunk and is screaming at his wife in the yard? Well the cops are 45 minutes away if there's a shooting, so I don't think they'll be here any time soon for a domestic. You better head over there and distract him.

Country living is very much dependent upon certain elements of that old west mentality, simply because nobody is going to help you. I distinctly remember one morning after a freezing rain covered our 1/2 mile dirt road in fallen trees all of the men and boys (3 families worth) just automatically grabbed chainsaws and axes and went to work. Nobody was going to clear our road but us. The same goes for guns. We had bears, coyotes, and cougars that occasionally picked off a neighbor's sheep or cow, so we had rifles to protect our livestock. No sheriff's deputy was going to show up in 2 minutes or less when we spotted a mountain lion eyeing our horses. 

Like anything, though, it's a trade-off. We didn't have gangbangers shooting it out on our corners, burglars (every time I see a report of a burglary in my hometown it's almost always paired with the burglar's condition at the hospital, post-shooting), or dog poop bags. Now I don't have to split and stack firewood, carry a pistol when walking my property, or worry about cell reception if I hurt myself.

Given the opportunity, I'd move back to the country."
"Yes I do if I have any cash, I offer to buy them food and water if I don't.

If I were in that situation I know I would want someone to help me. "

"My best friend has the worst family when it comes to this kind of stuff. She is the only one expected to clean at all in that house, so she's cleaning up after three adults, one child, and four dogs. She came and spent the night at my house recently, but before she came she had to clean the kitchen. She left that kitchen spotless before coming to my house. The next day when she got home, she sent me a picture of the kitchen. The ENTIRE kitchen counter was covered with food covered plates, glasses with gross milk in them, trash, and just random objects from around the house. It looked like the start of a hoarder's house.

That took one day for them to do. When she moves out, I don't want to see their house. Their house is gross now, because my friend is the only one who cleans ANYTHING but she can't get everything all the time. Every time she turns around there is a mess where she just cleaned. "

"I'm actually very pro-marijuana for a variety of reasons though I only partake  4 or 5 times a month. Just yesterday I was reading some research that came out of GSU in Atlanta saying in at least their research, there is an increased risk of hypertension leading to morbidity in some regular marijuana users. I'm remaining skeptical because some of the methodology seemed a bit suspect and it certainly needs to be replicated. But it is something to consider. I know for some people there is an increase in heart rate and anxiety, so that could certainly be related to the blood pressure pathology. But I wouldn't jump to any quick conclusions either way. The one thing I do know is that weed isn't a simple panacea. Does it have many benefits? Absolutely. Are we 100% certain there are no downsides? The jury is still out. Should adults have access to marijuana and be able to self-medicate or use recreationally without punitive law enforcement intervention? Fuck yeah! 

Edit - Uh oh looks like I touched a nerve, without eliciting any feedback. I don't usually add an edit for this particular kind of reaction, but I really believe these issues need discussion, level heads and not hiding from inconvenient *truths*."

"I've done it a few times, but I don't really like to do it but it gives closure to the family.

I do shifts in the ER as a general physician and there have been a few times when we get a patient who's just minutes from dying. A lot of them are from automobile accidents/myocardial infarction/stab or gunshot wound.

&amp;nbsp;

After the patient passes away, family members usually ask the same question:

&gt; ""Did he/she suffer/have any pain?""

I always answer: ""No, he/she did not feel a thing""

&amp;nbsp;

Truth to the matter is that I don't know or yes, there was pain involved. A lot of automobile accident victims have a lot of broken bones, myocardial infarction causes severe chest pain and get stabbed or shot at is painful depending where the wound is inflicted (being a victim of a chest stabbing, I can tell you getting stabbed and having a collapsed lung suck ass).

&amp;nbsp;

I don't like to tell lies, but it always gives closer to the family knowing that their loved ones passes away painlessly. I think if what I'm doing is the correct way or not, so I look at it this way: If I'm dying, and it's the most painful experience of my life, I would like to let my family know I didn't suffer, so they can continue on a lot easier."

"Why does play have to be how you define it though? Play is such a broad term. What is bothering you probably isn't that they aren't playing, it's that they are playing in a way that is different than how you label and value playing.

Your playing taught you things that you value. And when you see young people not having that same experience, it's understandable that you worry that they are missing out on something that you value.

But the reality is it doesn't mean they are getting worse because they are missing out on those things. They are learning very different values and skills from those experiences. And the value of those values and skills is extremely relative in reality to our society. Which will be inevitably different anyway in many ways by the time these kids grow up.

So I think it's folly to judge them based on our society's current values and structure. Because they will not live in that society or under those same value systems anyway."

I didn't understand it too well, but I asked my dad who is a doctor and he said the study showed that weed killed off the cancer cells, but it also killed off normal cells. He said, in this study, weed was just effective at treating cancer as bleach would.

That isn't to say weed can't help in symptoms for cancer or even that it doesn't have some real medicinal properties that can help fight cancer. It just says the research isn't there to show that it helps. Doesn't mean there won't be research that shows it does help or make it much worse in the future.

Second, of course women have reproductive rights. Every women on the plantet has that right, but the exercising of that right is severely restricted.

"When CO2 dissolves in water it produces H2CO3 - [carbonic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid). It is a weak acid, and depending on the pH of the solution, this will then dissociate into HCO3^- and H^+. In an alkaline solution, it can release a second proton to form CO3^2-, carbonate ions. Both the bicarbonate and carbonate ions will form compounds with dissolved cations such as Na, Ca, K, Mg, etc. When another acid - particularly a weak acid, like citric acid - is added to the solution, the pH of the solution won't necessarily change because some of those salts will buffer the solution.

This bicarbonate buffering system is how both blood and oceans buffer against changes to pH."

Having the 3 separate endings and giving them out randomly to movie theaters was very cool I thought. It made it very unique in that sense. "

&gt;What Causes Heart Disease?

&gt;Smoking, including secondhand smoke

&gt;**High amounts of certain fats and cholesterol in the blood**

&gt;High blood pressure

https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm
&gt;High blood pressure, **high cholesterol**, and smoking are key risk factors for heart disease.



Interesting quotes from your Telegraph news article:

&gt;Cholesterol does not cause heart disease **in the elderly** and trying to reduce it with drugs like statins is a waste of time, an international group of experts has claimed.


&gt;The results have prompted immediate scepticism from other academics, however, who questioned the paper’s balance.


&gt;The British Heart Foundation also questioned the new research, pointing out that the link between high LDL cholesterol levels and death in the elderly is harder to detect because, as people get older, more factors determine overall health.

"Research Chemicals are the result of the idiotic drug laws that most countries strictly adhere to.

If so called 'dangerous' drugs such as MDMA and cocaine, along with all other illegal drugs, were legalised and regulated, then the appeal of RCs would go down.

The reason people use RCs is because they have decided that the biggest risk of taking illegal drugs is the social stigma and potential criminalisation that they are given.

If the biggest risk of illegal drugs is being criminalised, then that reveals the fundemental problem with the war on drugs.

It was common in the 18th and 19th centuries to snip off a swatch of a deceased loved one's hair as a keepsake. Families passed the lockets with these hair samples down through the generations. I read somewhere that the analysis of such hair samples revealed that many wealthy people of the past were suffering from serious lead and other heavy metal poisoning. This because they regularly ate from decorated china and drank from lead crystal goblets. The poor didn't have such things. Wish I could remember the book title.

"While doing HVAC work, I got a call from a real estate agent about a vent that didn't seem to blowing air and he asked if we could come out and look at it because they were trying to sell the house and had some people coming to look at it that day and they didn't want it to be too hot in that room.
I head out there, get in the attic, find out that the flex line is torn from the vent--so--I head out to the truck, get some flex pipe, head back up in the attic, repair the torn line, check a few other things, then head back down into the house.
As I get out of the attic, I hear some pretty intense moaning. I glance over the railing and, below me in the living room, the home owner (older woman--but in incredible shape, definite MILF or GILF material) was laid out on the couch, blouse open, tits exposed, skirt hiked up over her waist, legs in the air, getting drilled by her real estate agent.
I just casually walked down stairs, out the front door, loaded my stuff into the truck, and sat there smoking a cigarette until the home owner and real estate agent came out to sign the paper work.
Best part was, after the agent walked away, the home owner handed me a $100 bill and said, ""Thank You..for coming out so quick and for not disturbing us. My husband is an asshole and I don't get a good fucking often, so, I get one when I can and I appreciate not being disturbed.""

Felt a little bad for the husband, but, not my problem."

"Smoke is smoke, man. Firefighters can go their entire lives never smoking cigs or weed or anything but they are still far more likely to develop cancer because of their exposure to smoke and all it's comprised of. Diseases like COPD are caused by lung irritants that damage the lungs and airways; the most common being cigarette smoke. However, you are still breathing in smoke when taking bong hits or pipe hits or smoking a joint and that basically does the same thing. No one is arguing that the contents of marajuana are less harmful than cigarettes and all their chemicals but the basics are basics. Smoke is hot by nature and definition (no smoke without fire) and when you breath it in it is an irritant and is essentially abrasive to your airway and lungs. That's all it takes. Also, keep in mind that we don't have hoards of research to pull from on weed because of the drug laws we've had since Nixon and Reagan which means it's hard to look at long term affects. That makes it hard to make such certain claims as yours. Can weed cause cancer? Maybe not the actual chemical components of it, but it is still entirely possible that smoking it can be enough to influence cell division and mutation and smoking in general is more than enough to give way to problems like COPD. By all means, smoke and be merry or whatever but don't try to kid yourself that it's completely harmless. "

"My parents have kept the fact that my brother's bio father isn't our dad for his entire (27 year) life. My dad chose to date and marry my mom while she was pregnant so it's not a scandal or anything. Only my mom knows that I know this - she admitted it after my parents' divorce and my prodding. She even showed me who his biological father was. 

The real secret is that my brother is fully aware of his parentage through his own suspicions and has accurately identified his bio father to me."

"Hmm, I'm a bit surprised here at your pH considering the relatively moderate reported average levels of alkalinity (39 ppm) and hardness (44 ppm). Also, total dissolved solids (63 ppm) are pretty low. In other words, your water is at best only slightly hard.

I'm not an expert in water quality, but there has to be something accounting for that extremely high pH. That's alkaline enough to damage or kill plants. It's not toxic for you per se, but I'd be slightly leary about long-term consumption. I've never seen water with such a high pH that hadn't been first treated with high concentrations of calcium or sodium hypochlorite.

Could be that the chlorination of your water - which seems considerable since you have moderately high concentrations of chloramines around 2.4 ppm - is bumping up the pH, and without much in the way of acid buffering the pH is going up and staying there. Groundwater tends to buffer better against acids than bases (though it depends on the aquifer).

I'm also a little surprised about the moderately high levels of nitrate in your water (6.3 ppm). Again, not at levels considered a concern, but suggests that the water is contaminated by agricultural runoff. This might explain the need for chlorination.

"Almost a decade ago I went to a wedding with a reception at a restaurant. As you would expect, nobody bothered to call the restaurant at any point to ensure seating for the 60 people in the party. It was a local place called Barney's. Barney came to the front and said ""No.""

We ended up at a public park and the groom's family bought all of the cooked rotisserie chickens from a Walmart and some potato salad/chips/soda. We were actually having quite a nice time at the park until the cops showed up and cited the parents for hosting a private event in the park without a permit. "

"Yes, and tv was the downfall of society because people no longer went out and talked to each other. Soon people would not know how at all.

So yes, the weight loss is due to the reduced intake rather than any magical properties of paleo foods, but it's wrong to say that the diet plays no role. "

"I've been involved in the gay tickling fetish scene since I started looking at internet porn in middle school. The portrayal of the mastermind behind the videos was pretty consistent to what people in the community had been saying about him on forums since at least the late 1990s, a few years before I became involved in this world. There was a lot of discussion also about whether or not forum/community members should be allowed to share his videos with each other, because there was a lot of rumors about the abuse the documentary showed. 

Tickled is such an interesting documentary for me, because I have kept this fetish a secret from basically everyone not involved in the scene my whole life. While the doc was under production, the creators would come to the forums/sites that we use and ask the opinions and listen to the concerns of community members. A lot of people were fearful that this doc was going to shine a spotlight on a small, niche fetish group and portray us in a negative light, so they were against production from the get go, and felt almost personally betrayed when people like Cat agreed to be interviewed for it. 

I'm rambling now, but it's just so bizzare that now thousands of people with no interest on tickling sexually have seen some of the porn that I've watched since I was 13.   "

"There is no evidence supporting that eating meat in moderation is healthy or ""much healthier""

&gt;looking at 89,000 people, and we see a stepwise drop in the rates of diabetes as one ate more and more plant-based, down to a 78% lower prevalence among those eating strictly plant-based. Protection building incrementally as one moved from eating meat daily, to eating meat weekly, to just fish, to no meat, and then to no eggs and dairy either. Followed over time

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983060

&gt;vegetarian diets were associated with a substantially lower incidence of diabetes, indicating the potential of these diets to stem the current diabetes epidemic.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983060

""What about eating a really healthy diet with just a little meat? Is it better to eat none at all? We had new insight last year from Taiwan. Asian diets in general tend to be lower in meat and higher in plant foods compared with Western diet, but whether a diet completely avoiding meat and fish would further extend the protective effect of a plant-based diet wasn’t known, until now.""


""Traditionally, Asian populations have had low rates of diabetes, but a diabetes epidemic has since emerged, and appears to coincide with increased meat, animal protein, and animal fat consumption, but the Westernization of Asian diets also brought along a lot of fast food and junk; and so, these researchers at the national university didn’t want to just compare those eating vegetarian to typical meat eaters. So, they compared Buddhist vegetarians to Buddhist non-vegetarians, eating traditional Asian diets. Even the omnivores were eating a predominantly plant-based diet, consuming little meat and fish, with the women eating the equivalent of about a single serving a week, and men eating a serving every few days. That’s just 8% of the meat intake in the U.S., 3% for the women. **The question: is it better to eat 3% or 0%?""**

http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0088547

&gt;Again, both groups were eating healthy: zero soda consumption, for example, in any group. Despite the similarities in their diet, and after controlling for weight, family history, exercise, and smoking, **the men eating vegetarian had just half the rates of diabetes, and the vegetarian women just a quarter of the rates. So, even in a population consuming a really plant-based diet with little meat and fish, true vegetarians who completely avoided animal flesh, while eating more healthy plant foods, have lower odds for prediabetes and diabetes after accounting for other risk factors.** They wanted to break it up into vegan versus ovo-lacto like in the Adventist-2 study, but they couldn’t **because there were no cases at all of diabetes found within the vegan group.**


Also you're telling me that we're adapted to eating meat, yet we need to eat it in moderation cause otherwise it's not healthy. But you're telling me we're meant to eat meat and not a plant based diet even though it's just as healthy without the negatives and you can eat as much of it as you want without any increased risk of cancer, diabetes, heart disease and more.

How does that makes sense now?"

"I'm so sorry, but I agree that you really dodged a bullet. So many people believe that love is what you see in a movie--romantic, blinding attraction, obsession. True love isn't like that at all. It's selfless, putting your partner's needs ahead of your own. Doing what makes them feel loved. (read The 5 Love Languages--people feel loved in different ways) Being there whatever happens--good or bad. Sexual attraction doesn't stay constant--it ebbs and flows. Real intimacy grows when you work on it.  --don't talk bad about your partner to other people, don't tell secrets about each other, take interest in each other's work and hobbies. I don't like golf, but my husband does. So I encourage him to go hit a bucket of balls when it's nice weather, spend some of his bonus on whatever he's been wanting, find vacation packages with a great golf course and spa day for me. I love antiquing, so my dh would go with me when we were first married. Turns out, he really likes it, too. We also love cooking together, and running errands together is more fun. (that late 30s aged couple popping shopping cart wheelies in Walmart at 2am was us) The serious part is that I have serious health problems and so does my husband. He's been there for me--I told him I could get very ill and couldn't have kids before we got married, but he insisted on being with me. He said that when he got sick, it really helped that I could understand how he felt. Life isn't always a bowl of cherries, but your true family is who is still at your side when the smoke clears when your life gets turned upside down. A partnership and marriage takes work and dedication. There will even be temptations, but you just have to keep reminding yourself that it's an infatuation and isn't worth the pain and heartache. If you do feel like you've made a mistake and don't want to be with your partner anymore, the right thing to do is be honest, agree to separate, pay alimony and child support so your children won't suffer, divorce, and don't date while you're still married. Do the honorable thing. "

"Another flaw is that evolution thrives on genetic variety. When two ugly dumb people get a kid, sometimes they still get a pretty and smart kid, and vice versa happens as well. Genes still have a lot of surprises for us, and some have probably more than one function.   

When mutations happen, sometimes they lead to risks of heart failure, and sometimes they lead to amazing eye sight. These mutations can only have positive influence if we allow all mutated people grow up and live their live to the fullest. Because only then we can be sure to have a chance at seeing the full effects of mutations.

Genetics is mostly chance. We don't understand enough of genetics to even know what we should be selecting on, if we should be selecting at all."

"That opening narration for the very first episode always gives me chills (and makes me cry):

&gt;Down this road on a summer day in 1944, the soldiers came. Nobody lives here now. They stayed only a few hours. When they had gone, the community, which had lived for a thousand years, was dead. This is Oradour-sur-Glane, in France. The day the soldiers came, the people were gathered together. The men were taken to garages and barns, the women and children were led down this road, and they were driven into this church. Here, they heard the firing as their men were shot. Then they were killed too. A few weeks later, many of those who had done the killing were themselves dead, in battle. They never rebuilt Oradour. Its ruins are a memorial. Its martyrdom stands for thousands upon thousands of other martyrdoms in Poland, in Russia, in Burma, China, in a **world at war**."

"Well, as I said there's basic ""celebrity dick"" stories. 

They were filming ""Days of Thunder"" here (well a tiny part of it) because we've got a historic NASCAR race track. 

So, there's the time Cruise came flying into one of the main arteries into town in his car doing something like 68 in a 35. And then when he got pulled over was all ""do you know who I am?"" and bitching about it.    
To be fair, that particular road just a bit further out is open sailing for speedsters, *but* by the time you're near the city limits, the speed has been 45 mph for about a mile and you've been driving through a residential area.    

Then, he apparently stopped in at some local fast food drive-thru. To be fair, this 'restaurant' was literally only a drive-thru. It's not like a McD's or something with inside seating.     
Same kind of stuff. ""Hey do you know who I am"" Yeah and your bill is still X$. and then he threw a fit about the crappy service. 

But then, the best story...

***

See, when I was growing up we had this one blind kid in school with us. Short version is that when he was born, his optic nerves didn't develop. No way to fix it, so his parents got him glass eyes.     
He was a cool kid. He'd sometimes be sitting in class and raise his hand and ask to leave because ""I forgot my eyes in my locker"" and he'd have someone go with him to open it, blahblahblah, but he was really doing it to just get out of class half the time. What teacher is going to tell the eyeless kid 'no you can't go get your eyes'?     
He had a great memory, which is how he retained most of his lessons from class. Too, he could tell you which adult/teacher was coming down the hall by the sound of their footsteps/walk. Obviously this didn't work when classes let out because there was too much noise in the hallways, but if we were just sitting in class he could tell you who was coming down the hallway or even if a teacher was walking around in the classroom vs a student. 

He was also a duck hunter. Again, to be fair, duck hunting requires some degree of skill, but not necessarily a lot of sight. He'd essentially go hunting with family/friends, they'd sit in a small circle, shoulders or backs touching, and he could track the flight path of the ducks by the noise they made, shoot a shotgun towards the front of that flight path, and if he hit one, a hunting dog would retrieve it.    
Not that big a deal, but then we all grew up around this kid. He wasn't hunting alone, he always had folks with him, so it wasn't dangerous or anything. 

Anyway, apparently somehow while the film crew was here, Cruise heard about this local blind high school kid who was also a hunter and just had to see it for himself. So someone arranged with the kids parents for Cruise (and a couple of other industry folks) to go hunting with the kid one weekend.    

Cruise gets introduced to the kid at his house. Kid is somewhat unimpressed (*I guess he'd never seen a Cruise movie, ya reckon?*) and an hour or so later, they've got a group of about a dozen armed men tromping off across a muddy Southern field to go hunt ducks.    
Southern farm fields, after a day or so of rain, are muddy and treacherous affairs for the uninitiated. While crossing the field, apparently Cruise lost his footing, slipped, and fell. It could happen to anyone.      
Except, well, remember I said that this kid knew who folks were by their walk/footsteps? Yeah, well... he knew exactly who had fallen, because of the sound he knew exactly where, and apparently from Cruise's whoop of surprise and then frenzied cussing and splashing, the kid turned and pointed right at him, laughing. As one does when someone falls by surprise in a mudhole. Allegedly, the kid even called out Cruise by name, still laughing.    
Whether Cruise's ego was bruised or whether the kid being able to point and laugh at a mud-victim was proof enough of his skill is up for debate, but Cruise and the industry folks never made it down to the pond to hunt ducks. 


Incidentally, the blind kid now runs a kennel outside of town. He's got braille numbered keys for the kennels and can stick his hands in the bowls of occupied cages to see if the dogs need food or water. "

"Seconded. Glassdoor is fucking awesome.

Three months ago I was hit up with a offer in a tech support role. That was exactly what I was looking for, so I said absolutely, let's talk!

I get on the phone and we interview for a while about my experience and so on, blah blah typical stuff. At the end they drop the news that *they* aren't hiring, but they *are* a staffing company that is placing people in a ""work from home"" position. The odd part here (and what immediately threw up red flags for me) was that they refused to tell me who the company was... I had to pass the pre-employment stuff first. Okay... weird, but I'll listen.

I pass everything, and finally, they tell me the name of the company. I had never heard of it, and had no idea what they did, but now that I had the name of the company in hand I did some googling, and Glassdoor was *immensely* helpful. Hundreds of negative reviews about how they *charge you* for the equipment you need to record your calls, and then don't garuentee any hours working; dozens of reports that they fire people for taking a single day off, all sorts of reviews for how abusive management is, how rude they will be...

Immediately e-mailed and said no thanks.

Glassdoor is a huge help; now I check every company that contacts me through them."

I was at this stage for a while.  At least you've identified the issue.  The easy answer is mass gainer, but I try top use supplements as a last resort.  The real key to eating big is eating throughout the day.  I had trouble because I did most my eating after work.  Now I have a planned breakfast and lunch that is higher calorie so that I can get in more calories while bulking without feeling as full.  Also, if you need to, dirty bulk.  Make all your milk into chocolate milk (and obviously whole milk)  and start eating fast food 1 or 2 times a week.  It really helps when bulking."

"It was Christmas Eve night.  My husband is a big coffee drinker, and we somehow ran out of coffee beans.

Unfortunately, their English wasn't very good, so he couldn't understand what they were saying... Eventually they ended up bringing her back, but he was pretty annoyed by the whole affair.

"I run yellows if I can, I know my safe stopping distance and usually it seems like I come up to a green right when it's turning yellow.

It saves gas, and I have one of those insurance trackers in my car that raises my rate if I stop too hard, so I try to avoid stopping at lights in general. Sometimes this means coasting towards a red, sometimes speeding up at a yellow.

It's also important to know your car; if you're coasting to a green and it turns yellow, but your car can't accelerate fast enough to get through the light before it changes, you should stop. Keep in mind that different areas have different yellow light durations as well."

"When I was growing up (90s) my Dad and I would drive around the country ever summer, and stop in 4 to 6 cities and watch a baseball game. We did this every year, and our goal was to visit every single Major League Baseball stadium in the US/Canada. 

One year we made it to Kansas City, Missouri to see a Royals game. I was about 11 years old this year, and we had pretty decent seats on the first base line. 

There was a group of 3 men sitting behind us who were locals to Kansas City. I forget how or why, but they chalked up a conversation with my Dad (probably could tell we were from NJ from our difference in accents). 

The one man asked what brings them to their city, and to see a Royals game none the less. My Dad explained our bucket list trip to the men, and all the miles we have driven together to accomplish it

The man was so impressed with out journey, and kept complementing us for spending the time together. Our conversation died out, and I overheard one of the men taking beer orders from his two friends, and he proceeded up to the concessions. 

After a few innings of missed baseball, his buddies were getting restless for their beer orders. Finally, he returned, but without a single beer in his hand. Instead, he had went our and bought me a baseball hat, A George Brett jersey, a Royals Pennet, as well as some other novelty items from the team store (easily over $200 worth of mechandise).

I remember my Dad trying to give him money for the items, and the gentleman refusing to take it. The man just looked at me and my father and said, what you two are doing together is worth more than all of this. And how it touched his heart to see us bonding and making memories, and wanted to leave a lasting impression on me etc. 

Which it has. 20 years later. I still remember everything about that night, all because of a strangers generosity.  "

So our rather sick researcher decides to test what the effect of removing the limbs of frogs might be.  So he takes the first unlucky frog he sees, and sets it down in front of him.  He claps his hands once sharply, and the frog jumps away.

He dutifully notes this in his research notebook.

He then cuts off the frog's front legs, lets the wounds heal and repeats the experiment by setting the frog in front of him again.  Once again he claps once sharply and the frog jumps away with a bit more difficulty.

He dutifully notes this in his research notebook again.

This time he amputates one of the frog's back legs and lets the poor animal heal.  And once again he puts the frog in front of him and claps once sharply.  The frog jumps with just a touch of awkward spinning.

He dutifully notes this under the other entries.

He's really curious now and wants to see what happens when all four legs are gone.  So the poor frog loses his last remaining leg and is allowed to heal up.  The now rather sad looking frog is placed in front of the researcher who claps once sharply.  Nothing happens.  He claps again, this time louder.  The frog doesn't move.  One last time, he claps, but of course nothing happens.

As his last entry, the researcher writes: ""Final Result: cutting off all four legs causes deafness.""

"It is a bit of snobbery, firstly. But that is generally how ""finer taste"" things go. Are you enthusiastic about anything in particular? A specific hobby, or something along those lines? I may be able to format it into that context to better illustrate the points here. But basically, a steak is generally seen as a premium product. A luxury item. Especially a steak cut from prized beef, think black Angus or really [wagyu](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagyu). Such a steak is going to cost a lot of money. Generally, such a steak would be acquired at a fine dining restaurant where chefs that have devoted themselves to their craft work. Such steaks are prized for their texture, flavor, juices, etc. The most widely agreed (amongst professionals) prepared form of such a steak is going to be [med-rare](https://www.thespruce.com/steak-doneness-from-rare-to-well-336362). This prepared form preserves most, if not all of the desired qualities in the premium beef. To cook the steak well-done, is to destroy everything that makes it a premium piece of meat. There goes the texture, there goes the nuanced flavors, there goes all the juices, etc. The main point being that the premium steak is now indistinguishable from a cheap steak that is cooked well-done. To add ketchup on top is essentially insult to injury. So, this is seen as horribly offensive to those that love steak for what it is, and not as a ""because I can"" meal. It lacks respect for the meat, respect for oneself (if you wanted to make that argument), and respect for the chefs and people behind the cow that was slaughtered for the steak. I hope that helped and wasn't just a rambling mass. "

A ghost would have to have some kind of energy source, since they're often depicted as glowing. Regardless of if they glow or not, the ability to move implies they gain energy from something, and it certainly isn't food.

Ghosts can't be beings of _pure_ energy. First off, they have a defined shape, which energy simply can't do. You can't form a ""ball of light,"" and definitely can't create a ""person of light."" 

All of your memories are just data stored in your brain. Not only that, but any one of your memories (no matter how vivid) can simply be fake implanted ones. A study was performed where people who have never been to Disneyland were shown photoshopped photos of them as children at Disneyland, and they started pulling details out of thin air, adamant that they were there. Where is a ghost getting memories from if not a brain, and how do we know they're real?

To speak to you (and ghosts often speak), they would require more brain, and specifically a human one, because the Broca's Area/Wernicke's Area (associated with speaking and understanding speech) are mostly unique to humans, hence why your dog can't speak English. Regardless of that, sound waves require energy to travel. How is a ghost speaking without physical vocal cords? 

""Ectoplasm,"" you all say. What is ""ectoplasm?"" If a human dies, and you were to keep track of the corpse, everything it discharges, and everything you add, there would be no ""missing matter."" If nothing is missing, there is no such thing as ectoplasm. Matter can't be created or destroyed. Energy can't have a physical push (people being choked by ghosts, poltergeists, etc) without a ""body"" to transfer it.

People only see ghosts during grieving, rarely past the stage of acceptance. Those are hallucinations, my friend.  You're not seeing ghosts.

However I do take some calm in knowing she went out how she preached, and as one of the youngest of 10+, she had watched many of her older siblings slip into dementia and die a shell.

He never took me up on it. But I made damn sure I was there by his side whenever I could be because I cared about him. I made sure I fucking showed him he still had me. I had some fantastic times with him until graduation and I hope he did, too. He joined the army out of high school and we fell outta contact.

"My grandmother is not physically cheating on her husband, but talking to men from dating websites. I've read conversation on her phone where she used the words ""I love you"" and all that other stuff, how she's waiting for my grandfather to pass so she can move and sell the house.

I've thought about bringing the situation to light, but she's currently helping my dad who can't work or drive due to physical in capabilities, and my grandfather's medical bills, as well as helping me with car payments if I'd ever need them, though I try not to ask.

If she knew that I had seen what she's said to other people, I fear she would stop helping the family and either become reclusive or leave. My dad has little to no income and my grandfather doesn't make enough off his security to pay for things. I barely make enough to make my own ends meet so I can barely help out.

Serious question. Do boys and girls usually practice together? I guess if you're the only girl you gotta wrestle against someone. But I would imagine this makes for lots of awkwardness.

"I recently realized I've been overmedicated the majority of times I got sick as a child.

I've been out of my parents house for roughly five years and got very sick about a month ago. I went to the doctor and found out that I had viral tonsillitis. I... honestly had no idea that tonsilitis could be caused by a viral infection and as a child ALWAYS was given antibiotics when I had anything throat related. This time I was told by the doctor to wait it out for a few days and sure enough I got better. The few days I was sick my mom pestered my non-stop to get a different doctor because the first one did not prescribe me antibiotics and was therefore incompetent.

I wonder how many illnesses I had as a kid my mom pestered the doctor into giving me antibiotics when I really didn't need it. I had so many trips to the doctor and very recently realized that a lot of them probably were not warranted and probably made me sicker in the process. "

"Not OP, but my cousin adopted out her child (to another cousin though, who couldn't have kids, so she's not totally out of his life) after a year. She kept him because she could breast feed him, which was better for both their health, and couldn't have happened otherwise. She was also not sure she even wanted to give him up initially, but after a few months she became more sure, and once pregnancy leave ended she had no question that it was the right choice. 


Personally I always find it weird how on tv babies are just ... gone, poof, new family, huzzah. IRL, even newborns put directly into the system, if they don't have someone lined up prior to the birth, generally spend a few weeks with a fosterer before ending up with a home. One of my best friends parents fostered troubled teens, and her brother fostered newborns who were up for adoption. Some of them are sill in the system years later."

"My mom, sister and i would often meet my dad for dinner at a restaurant after he finished work. Because we were coming from home and he was coming from his office, we'd wind up with two cars at the restaurant. After dinner, my sister and mom would get in one car, my dad and i in the other, and my parents would straight up street race each other home. My sister and i loved it, would egg on our parents to crack 100mph, burn off the line, all of it. We were like a family out of the Fast and Furious, with my mom in her S420 and my dad in whatever he was driving at the time, Lexus SC400, 90s T-bird, Lincoln Mark VII, etc. 

didn't realize anything was weird with my family until i wound up in a similar situation with a friend's parents and they didn't race home in their matching Ford Taurus station wagons. i remember thinking they were so lame. didn't realize how dangerous and dumb my parents were until i started driving myself. 

Still, i talked to my sister about it recently and those races remain some really fond memories from childhood for both of us. Also, we both made it to adulthood so that's pretty cool. "

It was one of those bathrooms with only three urinals and he chose the middle one so I was kind of forced to pee next to him as tired me probably couldn't figure out how a toilet worked at that point. 

Stood next to him, unzipped my fly and peed. Only problem was I didn't take my manhood outta my boxers, resulting in me peeing my boxers and having some half stream leak through into the urinal. Right beside my teacher.

I quickly zipped back up, grabbed some paper towels, stuffed them in my pants, washed my hands and left.

"We moved into my dad's friend's house when my dad lost his job, because he agreed to give us a good deal on rent. He lived upstairs and had a black labrador named Auggie. Now, Auggie Doggie was super cute and sweet, but she was HIS dog, and he loved her a lot- like, a lot. She was his sole companion (no wife or kids), and she went everywhere with him, and if there was somewhere Auggie couldn't go then he didn't go either. And he frequently came downstairs to visit, and brought Auggie with him into our home, because it was just expected we should be cool with another person's pet racing excitedly through our house.

We had a pet cat named Opi Juan Kenopi when we moved in, who we had owned for about 2 years, since he was a kitten. He usually avoided Auggie like the plague, hid whenever she came down. Except one day about six months into living there I guess he just had enough of that dog's privacy invading shit. She came in through the back in the kitchen, and Opi up and bolted through the front of the house to the back, and latched himself onto her face. She yelped super loud and ran back out the door, and he kicked her ass until she was off the back porch, where he proceeded to stand and hiss menacingly at her. Balls of steel.

Well, unfortunately our nutty landlord was super offended at the cat literally being a cat, and demanded we get rid of him. It didn't even occur to him that maybe the situation would be rectified by not coming into our apartment with his big ass dog- instead, the family living there had to lose their cat. We couldn't afford to move, so my mom just stopped letting him come back inside. We'd still feed him, but he started sleeping under cars, and got a nasty odor to him. When we moved out he had gone feral and we couldn't catch him, and to be honest after all we put him through I wouldn't want to come with us either. I was always super pissed at that kook upstairs for that move, but he honestly acted like he did nothing wrong, and continued to come downstairs with his damn dog. I still miss my cat. "

"That's because they don't consider the day you ordered it as a ""Shipping day"". They take a day to process your order then the next day starts the shipping process.

Say you order something Friday night after close of business with 2 day shipping. The weekend doesn't count towards their shipping day count even tho they deliver on those days. So Friday, Sat, Sun then Monday they process it. Tuesday starts the shipping process and it has till Wed to arrive to be 2 day shipping."
"Ehh not quite true? If you're trying to push a lot of data over an HDR cable (for example 4k HDR content) you really will need a probably more expensive hdmi cable. If it doesn't support HDMI 1.3 you may run into issues, and depending on the length of the run you could need higher gauge or active cables. 

If the cable isn't enough for your application, it's possible it will just not transmit an image, but it's also possible that the image will display but with flickers, or cuts in and out. 

So yeah, gold plated cables for a 6ft run on your 1080p won't do jack shit and is a waste of money, and probably the gold plated won't do much EVER, but not *all* expensive hdmi cables are automatically a scam "

"I pondered this as well after reading his answer. The words ""up"" and ""down"" are just as arbitrary as the words ""left"" and right"", but their meanings are completely different. 

Left and right are the same logically, just opposite. Think about your body. We are (mostly) symmetrical beings. What is on your left is the same as what is on your right.

Now think about up and down in context to your body. What is up is drastically different from what is down. If you ignore the words, the places they describe are not similar.

It's the same if you think of it in relation to the the world as well. If you are standing in an empty room, what's to the left? Wall. What's to the right? Wall. What's up? Ceiling. What's down? Floor?

Left and right are almost always the same, but opposite. Up and down are almost always different.

All of this assuming gravity is involved."

"Humans, like most (all?) vertebrates, are [bilaterally symmetrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_in_biology).  For the most part, if you folded us down the middle from top to bottom, we'd line up pretty much exactly.  Fold across the middle from left to right and we don't.

So we're acutely aware of the difference in ""up"" and ""down"" and less so along the sides, where are bodies are mostly identical to each other.  ""Up"" are our heads and ""down"" are our feet.  That's a huge difference.  ""Right is a hand and ""left"" is...another hand.  Not so big a difference."

I love little moments like that in movies.

When I found out it was adapted from a Stephen King novella, I went through my dad's collection and, sure enough, he had it. After reading the novella, one of my favorite parts of the movie is a throw away line towards the beginning, where Andy asks Morgan Freeman's character why they call him Red. He answers ""...Maybe because I'm Irish."" I always took that as Red just being a dick to Andy, but in the novella, that character is actually a red-haired Irish-American. I love that they threw that line in there as an acknowledgement of the novella."

As we crept deeper still into that haunted wood, we were suddenly shook frozen by a terrifying sound. A sound that continues to haunt my dreams to this very day.

"A fix for Tinnitus that might help:

[Place the palms of your hands over your ears with fingers resting gently on the back of your head. Your middle fingers should point toward one another just above the base of your skull. Place your index fingers on top of you middle fingers and snap them (the index fingers) onto the skull making a loud, drumming noise. Repeat 40-50 times.

I like to go for a few casual lengths of a morning occasionally. There's 2 designated lanes, a fast lane and a regular lane for swimming laps, the rest of the pool is a free for all, do what you like sort of area. Now, I'm not a fast swimmer so I avoid the fast lane but the regular lane for laps is still too fast paced for me. I like to chill and go my own pace. Maybe get to the end and just float, y'know. It's nice. BUT the old ladies. They are so annoying. They just stand and gossip (fuck knows what about, ""Here, Margarets not been taking very good care of her petunias this season.."") and complain about being cold (of course you're cold Evelyn! You're standing in water!). They usually stand in the way as well so you have to swim round them when they decided they can no longer continue gossiping in one spot at the side of the pool and they make a pathetic attempt to walk about a bit.

"And as soon as you mention anything negative about porn, hoards of people attack you online.

Trust me, I used to consume sooo much of it. For thirteen years. Nearly every day. For hours. Fetish porn, especially. (Not to rag on fetishes, but it had to be that specific fetish or I couldn't get off.) It reduced my ability to get aroused when I was with a real woman who wasn't performing to my increasingly detailed and specific fantasies. I was convinced I had ED (at 19) even after tests showed everything downstairs was working fine.

That's not to say everyone who uses internet porn is addicted like I was. Nor am I crusading to ban it. But there's a huge difference between wanting to look at pictures of naked women sometimes, and *needing* new, increasingly explicit material every day because looking at something more than once was boring. Because having a real, attractive, naked woman in my bed was boring compared to fantasy women who would do whatever I wanted and never have needs of their own.

Porn eventually ruined my sex life until I quit using it for about a year and a half. I'm not religious and certainly not anti-jerking-it. But it just seems to me that evolution didn't prepare us for the longterm physical and social effects of high-speed internet porn."

"The unfortunate reality is that there isn't much we can do about it *right now.*

We can yell and scream and take to the streets all we want, but none of that is going to change the balance of power *right now.*

Let's be clear. 2016 was a stunning, and crushing defeat for Democrats. It will take a long time to recover. The best we can reasonably hope for is a strong showing in the 2018 elections. If we can gain a few seats in congress, and maintain and perhaps flip a few Gubernatorial races and state legislatures, that is a huge win. We should not expect to gain a majority in the US congress.

If we do well in 2018 (and that's a big if) we then have a strong shot at flipping Congress in 2020. And if (again, big if) we run a candidate with an iota of charisma, who can speak in complete sentences, we should have no problem flipping the presidency. 

The Supreme Court may just be fucked for a while. We can only hope that Gorsuch and the inevitable future appointee(s) are actually from planet earth.

Now, until then, I don't want to discourage anyone from demonstrating, protesting, and yelling as loud as you can in the face of injustice, cruelty, and bigotry. But we have to be smart about it. 

I'm going to do the bad thing here and stereotype conservatives. They fall into two camps. The first are the real whackos and assholes, who ""drink librul tears"" and view outrage from left-leaning Americans as a sign that everything is going well. The more we act like we're oppressed, the happier they feel. There is no use trying to swing these votes. The second camp is the ""law and order"" conservatives. These people just want to be able to get on with their lives, and wish everyone else would too. They don't want to see endless riots and demonstrations on TV. They don't want to see crime. They don't want endless confusing gridlock in congress. They don't want to worry about nuclear war. These are the people we can, and must, flip.

The republicans themselves are going to help us with this. Now that they have total power, the onus is on them to get things done. They are solely responsible for any and all chaos in Washington, and law and order conservatives know it. Trump cannot long stand up to these voter's scrutiny. However, they are not going to flip their vote if they see Democrats as an unorganized, angry mob. That's not their bag, baby. A whiff of chaos and they're gone.

So what do we do? 

Well first, find out who our local candidates are. Donate money, and volunteer time. The candidates themselves know how we are going to be the most useful. And, if they don't win, in our system, nothing else we do will matter.

Second, present ourselves well. Are we an unruly mob, howling for blood? Or are we a group of organized citizens petitioning for change? Protests and demonstrations should inspire, not terrify. Rhetoric we use should be about building things up, not tearing them down. We're building a better America, not tearing down a corrupt system of kleptocratic bigotry. We have to be bright shining examples of the America that was promised, and not strange, violent specters of its downfall.

And I get it, that can be frustrating. When faced with the endless, hate filled vitriol of the right, it can be hard to not want to lash out in anger. But we can't stoop to violence and stupidity. They will beat us at that game. Anger is an important, and just, feeling to be having right now. But anger unchecked, and unguided by solid strategy will just further the divide between Americans that has placed us in the situation we are in.

**TLDR** It's only been 8 months. We've got a long way to go before we can make change happen. Until then, the best we can do is react to what happens, and plan for the future. We've not grown complacent, we're just in it for the long haul."

"The problem is all these fools smoking unclean wax. Every other loser I know was blowing their own dabs (with butane), and scraping it up right away and smoking it/giving it to other people.   
   
So many people have such low expectations, or can't even tell the difference between 'tane soup and cleaned up concentrates.   
   
IMO, skip the contaminants and press your own dabs with the Rosin technique. Only contaminants will be *maybe* the wax paper, and whatever was on your green.

Then there's the matter of waxes, which are already present if you were going to smoke it anyway. With oils, we have the ability to dewax them though.

I think, the biggest problem will be the crazy people who like dabs ""hot and hurty"". You crazy fuck, you're burning the hell out of your lungs! Low temperature dabs *may* waste some on occasion, but it is so much smoother, and easier on your lungs."

"I'm not 100% sure that the commenter meant this, it was phrased a bit oddly, but from a developmental point of view, taking calculated risk is learned. Basically, young children need to fall over. *Not* as some commenters have said, because getting hurt is good for you, but because they learn ""Hmm, if I push my limits this far, it's really hard but I've achieved something new. But if I push my limits THIS far, I fall off the climbing frame."" Physically it's great for awareness of abilities and the world around them, but children also transfer it to taking risks in their learning (not being scared to be wrong) and social interactions. Importantly, children need to know they have a safe space to come back to when they need comfort. It's a balance of knowing when to step in and when to step out. *Never* helping your children also doesn't develop good risk-taking skills, as their brains will wire themselves for survival, so risk-taking may not transfer to higher-order thinking."

"In the original movie I can even remember to quote Raphael as saying ""So that's the plan from our great leader, huh, just sitting on our buts"" which implies Leo was recognised as the leader."
That whole scene where they speak in Latin is so iconic. That alone is what makes the movie memorable.
"Yeah, meat is expensive! It's better to just go out during whichever animal season and get a moose/caribou/seal/whale and feed the whole family for months. Recently someone got a beluga (made me sad because they're my favorite marine mammal) but that was enough for like, a quarter of the town. And of course as tradition, elders get the first cuts. My husband's grandparents often get meat from other townspeople after they get a moose or caribou because their own elder relatives have passed or whatnot. 

One thing that sucks is people often want to donate subsistence foods to the local food pantry or the assisted living facility but since they're both government run they can't accept things that aren't USDA certified. So my MIL who raises chickens and ducks can't donate all the extra fresh eggs she has. 

Technically you can give individuals subsistence foods though so often when someone gets a whale they make sure the elders get some, as they're the ones who appreciate native food the most. 

Most of this generation can't stand some of the weird native foods like zombie salmon (spawned out fish that are still swimming but kind of rotting, they turn white it's really creepy) or thinks like stink heads or stink eggs(salmon heads/eggs that are buried to ferment) or seagull eggs or muktuk (whale blubber) Those who are raised on subsistence foods usually enjoy them though. Like agutak, salmon strips, fish eggs and kelp as well as seal oil. 

My husband is native and loves agutak. I've tried it and it grosses me out. Then again I'm from Illinois so berries mixed with sweetened crisco is always going to be bizarre to me. He tried muktuk once and said it was like fishy flavored gum that you couldn't really bite through. He also said never again. 

I enjoy fresh salmon as well as fresh wild blueberries, and of course the good old Pilot bread. And making salves and balms from chythlook, which my MIL taught me. 

Shameless plug, I have an etsy shop where I sell those salves, balms and stuff made of native plants. Message me if you're interested. "

We're all adults, why are we even pretending around this subject?

And then I just felt like zombies are everywhere."
Wow. And earlier in the thread people were talking about a guy who was the father to a kid even though people were telling him the kid wasn't his.

"We hung out in her living room with her roommates. Pretty normal apartment. After her roommates went to bed we started kissing on the couch. We go in her room, lights are off and we get on her bed. We do our thing. Then 10-20 seconds after we are done I hear a sound in the corner. It was like a light yawn. I turn around and in the opposite corner there is a crib. I knew she had a kid, so calmly and politely I asked ""Is your baby over there?"" She said ""yeah he is sleeping"". I stayed for a minute or two but then left. The whole time thinking WTF, who do that in front of their baby. Even if he is asleep, why? She messaged me the next day and I decided to never respond to her again. Weird weird weird night. Some people think I'm a ""player"" now because I essentially hit it and quit it and thats fine."

In another train of thought, many hunters have died this way as well. They fall from their tree stands and their tether system catches them- but it doesn't have any way to get to the ground if they can't climb back into their tree stand. So they end up hanging by their harnesses until they die of lactic acid poisoning. Always get a tether system with a release to get back to the ground. "

I was on the verge of going vegan but needed something to tip me over the edge. It was incredibly difficult to see these animals tortured in the ways that they are. Seeing a live fox have his skin peeled off his body so someone could wear the fur, or dolphins flapping around on dry land while a fisherman hacks at it with a butcher's knife are very, very hard to watch. And because I was already feeling guilty about not being vegan, seeing these images put me over the top and I cried like a baby. Not the whole time. But for a few minutes here and there.

If NK goes nuclear, it's gonna be fast war.  SK and the surrounding area (maybe as far as Japan) will have massive losses.  But, if NK goes nuclear, you can bet Trump will too.  NK will literally glow from the aftereffects.  SK, Japan, China and all the other surrounding countries will *not* be happy with the radioactive fallout they will be dealing with.  I doubt Trump will consider this when making the decision to launch, however.

Conventional will last much longer.  There will still be massive losses in the area, but probably less than a nuclear war.  The major cities in the north will fall quickly, but we will have to deploy ground forces, and if the ~~Vietnam~~ Korean war taught us anything, it's that those jungles are no joke.

Either way, China is going to be ***PISSED.***  Not only will they have to deal with the millions of refugees flooding the border, they will most likely end up with a unified, democratic Korea on their border - something they DO NOT WANT.

"How long do patents last?

My problem with our current intellectual property system is that the length has gotten out of control. The Constitution had it right at fourteen years. Performing someone else's song or making a copy of a video game is NOT the same as stealing someone else's property. You aren't taking anything away from anyone, you're creating a brand new copy.

The reason for IP laws is to incentivize people to create IP, not because sending a friend an MP3 of a song you like is immoral.

Imagine all of the free content that would exist with 14 years as the limit for IP? All music, movies, TV shows, books, video games, and inventions before 2003 would be free and available to everyone. That is an incredible public good. And all of that stuff still would have been created if IP only lasted 14 years, which is more than enough time to make money off of your idea."

"I was at the museum of science and industry in Chicago with my grandparents and somehow managed to get separated from them and lost. I was 10 or so and decided I would sit on some steps that lead upstairs and wait for them to circle back and find me. 10 minutes pas. 15. 20. 30. Eventually I realize I'll probably never see any of my family again and will just live in the museum and start crying quietly so no one would see me. I figured if I was spotted I'd be in trouble for getting lost. A woman with a couple kids around my age saw me and asked me what was wrong.  


After I explained it to her she took me by the hand, told me that ""hasn't your mommy told you to trust other girls with kids of their own?"" -this sounds weird typed but I was reluctant to go with her. She took me to the museum security and sat with me and her girls played with me until somehow my grandparents were contacted. I think they had reported me missing with security in a different part of the museum. 


After my grandparents got back I cried and they thanked the woman up and down. We ended up spending the rest of the day with that woman and her family walking around the museum. Her daughter Violet is now my best friend (even though we live two hours apart) and I'm going to be the maid of honor in her wedding that's in December. Her daughter has saved my life more times than her mom. She's always there for me and just to think I'd probably be dead (was very depressed in middle school) without her daughter and it all happened because she took pity on a little lost girl.

I think I just prefer freedom too much. To wake up and do whatever I want today. In some ways it's bad, since a lot of those days just turn into playing whatever MMO I'm into while multitasking work, but I just don't know what the draw is in raising a family. 

I question it all the time, but what makes kids and working crazy hours to raise them equal success? Why is that any better of a time waster than dicking around leveling my mage up? Or focusing on your work? I'm having a harder and harder time defining what is and isn't a ""waste of time"" as I get older. I watch people work themselves 60 hours a week for money that they just buy garbage with and never find happiness. I see people around me break down that they can't afford to do anything fun anymore because their kids cost a fortune in both time and money. Is it just for that final endgame retirement to say ""I did it?"" Is it bragging rights when you are sitting around at 70 with fellow seniors discussing life? So many older people are miserable in their 60's even with a big family. 

I'm sure societal pressure as I get older will hit harder and harder as more people around me pop kids out, but it still doesn't make me want them any more. Will it happen some day? Maybe. Will I regret it if It doesn't? I don't know. I'll probably regret it about as much as not starting a serious business to potentially experience the wonders of being a millionaire, or not chasing after a degree in astrophysics or some other science I've been obsessed with over the years. #1 and #2 aren't what society tells us we need to do though, so are kids more important in the end? 

TL:DR - What exactly IS a ""waste of time?""

You had to specifically say ""do not call me again/put me on your do not call list.""

Ocean acidification is caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. An estimated 30–40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes. To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid. Some of these extra carbonic acid molecules react with a water molecule to give a bicarbonate ion and a hydronium ion, thus increasing ocean acidity.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification (Additional sources contained within).

A carbon sink is a natural or artificial reservoir that accumulates and stores some carbon-containing chemical compound for an indefinite period.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sink (Additional sources contained within).

The majority of the mass of a tree is created from carbon dioxide absorbed from the air by the tree's leaves. When you clear cut land, the carbon stored in trees and soil is released. (You can tell because the trees aren't there any more). This is usually accomplished by burning, which releases the carbon into the atmosphere, but it's destroying a carbon sink no matter how the land is cleared. That carbon settles and is absorbed into the oceans, contributing to ocean acidification and global warming.

The second half of this Vice episode came to mind, regarding how carbon sinks can be destroyed releasing massive amounts of carbon:

"So after watching the link you provided I can't help but think you're completely misreading him here.

1. He never says if you're a liberal who doesn't want to vote for Hillary you're a piece of shit.  He says ""If you're a liberal whose not going to vote you're a piece of shit."" This is within the context of remarks of some liberals not liking her as a candidate because ""There's something about her"" or ""I don't like the tone of her voice"" (aka inconsequential stuff rather than things of substance). Right after that he implies Hillary is a two faced conniving crazy bitch by saying that's what our country needs in a president right now. I think saying our country needs that is stupid, but it's not like he thinks Hillary is perfect.

2. He never says Hillary is the best candidate ever. The closest he comes is ""I'd take her over anyone else that would do it"", and in context it's pretty clear he's talking about anyone who ran during the primaries. He's emphasizing he actually likes Hillary as a candidate and not merely as a lesser of two evils.

3. He says he's more excited to have the first mother president vs the first female president. He then goes into a comedy monologue. Seems to me it's just poking a bit of fun at the ""first female president"" bandwagon. That isn't to say he doesn't see it as a plus, but he's clearly exaggerating for comedic effect. Regardless he never once says you should vote for her ""because she's a mother"". At worst he's saying he's voting for her because she's a mother along with the half a dozen other things he says he likes about her. 

That's my take on it anyway.

"I have a good friend that just found out he has a daughter in her late 30's. At first he was kind of scared to even return her calls. He has raised to sons on his own, and he is a good man. (one of his sons has special needs and still lives at home. Always will, and that is fine by his dad.) After checking her profile on social media we found that he also has 4 grand children. He knew that returning her call was the right thing to do, and that is what he did, because as I said, he is a good man. He would have done right by her sooner, but had no idea that she even existed.He is still nervous about the whole thing, but that is normal. They live pretty far apart, but as soon as the DNA comes back, I imagine they will be meeting face to face.
I should explain the part about the DNA. Apparently one of the Ancestry sites has a DNA database that one of his aunts or other family member has contributed to. I don't fully understand how it all works, but the short is that if you are looking for family, you can submit DNA, and they look for matches. Apparently he is the only one it can be, but they are doing further testing to confirm. I saw the grand kids, and the boys could be twins of his own sons, as well as his  sons son.
Anyway, I am trying to say that if your biological father is a good man, he will want to know you as much as you want to know him. It was hard for me to understand when I was younger, but family is all we really have in this life that is hard to live without. Everyone deserves to know where they came from, and to know the history of their family. If your dad turns out to be not such a good guy, the chances that he has other family that will want to know about you are high. Go for it. Worse thing that can happen is that he is an asshole, but you still have the benefit of knowing your roots."

"i can never recommend this movie enough. I love everything about it, the plot is simple yet explores the human state of mind. It challenges prejudices and encourages us to take a closer look at others and ourselves. It  invokes in us a sense of uneasiness with the ""truth"" and makes us read a bit more into the story, to look a little closer at the details, to pay attention to those around us and realize that they are humans with human lives and emotions. It is a deeply personal movie that starts off with a sense of disconnect and apathy but by the end we are appalled at the swiftness in which they reached conclusion so that their lives may continue but an others should end. The movie begins by boring us, but climaxes with making us angry and anxious but ends with us content that perhaps the 12 angry men are leaving the room and the world a better place."

"Kind of surprising to hear about the lambos.. The story I've heard/read about how Lamborghini started making cars came to be since the maker Ferrucio Lamborghini had a Ferrari but the clutch was the weak spot and constantly breaking, so he put a much more solid tractor clutch in his Ferrari instead and showed it to Enzo Ferrari .. who didn't like it. So he decided to make his own sports car instead. [A source article with the story](http://jalopnik.com/ferruccio-lamborghini-fixed-his-hated-ferrari-with-a-cl-1759677501) .. If that was the true origin, one would think solid ""unbreakable"" clutches would one of the signature aspects of Lambos. "

"I don't know if this is any use to you, but maybe it will help.

When you were a little boy and you fell down and scraped your knee, you'd run to your mother, she'd make you feel better.

When you began to grow up and you'd screwed up or you'd made a mistake, when you were hurting and you were angry with yourself, I'll bet that you would turn away, turn in on yourself sometimes. You didn't *want* to need that hug, those open arms anymore, as much as a part of you longed for someone to come and make it all better. That felt childish to you and you'd try and hide the sting of the tears instead.

Your mother saw this, and she understood it. She went through the same thing herself, and she knew it was an important part of you learning how to understand and handle your own emotions.

And then one day she had to tell you the very worst news you had ever received. She had to go to the young man whose scraped knee she once kissed better and be the one to break his heart in a way that no kiss could ever help or heal. And she did it because she loved you, so that you would have someone there in that moment who would be ready to open up their arms to you, or to watch you turn in on yourself, and who was ready for whatever might happen. Someone who you could be raw with and real in front of. And I'll bet she knew very well that there was nothing that could help this time, and that your pain and your anger wasn't about her. It was a wild animal thrashing in agony, and all she could do was stand by and keep it from harm as best she could.

Pain, grief, the rending, tearing sensation of true human agony is not something which is rational or even directional. It spills out of us as we are torn open and there is no predicting or preventing that. It washes over whatever happens to be nearby at the time, even the very people who would do anything to spare us what we're feeling.

So instead of feeling guilty, feel glad. Your mom tried to give you the best, safest, situation to have the worst moment of your life and she managed that. It doesn't matter that you lashed out; she was there and ready to give you whatever you needed. And I'm sure she was sad, and maybe she was upset, but did you ever wonder if perhaps the thing that hurt her the most was seeing her baby boy suffering a pain that no kiss or hug from her could begin to touch? The sadness of having nothing to offer you which could help other than her presence?

The people that love us, truly love us, can see past a slight against them when there is a wall of grief, pain or fear looming over us. Don't regret how you behaved; be glad that you had someone who loved you enough for that to happen."

There was good Freakonomics podcast about sugar and if it should be illegal.  

http://freakonomics.com/podcast/theres-war-sugar-justified/

&gt;DUBNER: This episode was inspired by a listener, who wrote in to say, “If sugar is as bad for us as a lot of people are now saying it is, why isn’t it regulated the way other potentially harmful substances, like alcohol or tobacco, are regulated?” How do you answer that question?

&gt;LUSTIG: Well, the public health community has identified four separate criteria that are needed to be fulfilled before a substance can be considered for regulation. Number one: ubiquity, that is, can’t get away from it. Number two: toxicity, that it’s dangerous. Number three: abused, that increased consumption is inherent in the molecule itself. Finally, number four is externalities. That is, your consumption hurts me. Now alcohol, tobacco, morphine, and heroin clearly meet these four criteria. The question is, “Does sugar meet them?” And the answer is, yes, it does, absolutely."

"It's great that you allow him to learn (I mean, who wouldn't? Well, my grandmother).

My brother loves to hear what I tell him about the human body. I am a medical student and he is 11. My grandmother yells at me when I get into neurotransmission and explain to him how his autism works. She says I'm filling his head with knowledge he's ""too young to have."" I simply don't understand how it can be bad to know more than expected; as long as the knowledge being passed down is honest and well explained, kids can have it too! 

He can run laps around most adults when the subject is cars, because he loves them and I made sure to teach him everything he is able to understand. We're not getting into tire thread distortion due to torque until he has a better understanding of physics, for example, but that engines have four strokes, what the transmission does, why suspensions exist, how weight relates to acceleration, etc.: things a kid can understand, if we respect them.

Recently he was asking about geometry (he's having basic 3d shapes in school like prisms and cubes), so, naturally, I explained what a regular shape is, that there are only 5 regular 3d objects and that they're called platonic solids. My grandmother started yelling at me, but he was never as interested in math than when I allowed him to go further than the school requires. It's a real shame when people do that.

Sorry for the long text, I'm just really annoyed at the idea that kids are unable to grasp more abstract concepts."

"Yeah, but there's also something called bodily autonomy that should be respected in a relationship. My husband and I are both very disappointed when the other goes to get their hair cut, and while we have a ritual of trying to let the other person say goodbye to our excess hair before the cut, we don't stop each other from cutting our hair, because ultimately, the other person isn't the one taking care of it.

To throw out another example, if my husband were in control of my body, he'd have never let me get any tattoos, because that's not his thing and he's squeamish about me being in pain for any reason, but he respects that I want them and they mean something to me, just like I respect that he'll never ever get a tattoo for himself, though I like the idea of us sharing that experience.

"My point was that technically, anytime the sun hits you it is causing some amount of damage. But you have to be practical about it. No one is suggesting to stay indoors or to completely avoid any sunlight. Doctors advise you to wear sunscreen and cover up in practical ways. Also, in times of extreme UV exposure to stay inside.

There are times that the sun is shining but the amount of UV reaching the earth's surface really is quite low making it safe to be outside with little shade. There are other times when you really should stay out of the sun 100%. A few weeks back, the UV index around here was around 9. I would walk outside and I could feel myself burning in under a minute so I stayed indoors. Tomorrow I am planning to go to the beach and stay outside all day without a shirt so I will wear sunscreen because the UV index is about half of what it was weeks ago.

No one is saying to stay indoors or avoid sunlight at all costs. They are just saying to be aware that the sun is always damaging and take the necessary precautions to decrease your likelihood of receiving unnecessary damage."

Best advice for someone starting high school? 
"They do this thing where they say ""all you can eat ribs"" but then on the plate you only get maybe 5 little teeny tiny ribs and 500 french fries. Then, when you ask for more ribs they bring you out 5 more teeny tiny ribs twenty minutes later with another 500 french fries.

They will not not bring you the fries.  If you say you are allergic to potatoes, they will tell you that you should not eat the ribs then because they are baked near the potatoes and so they cannot guarantee you there was no crossover.  

Then when you say don't worry about the crossover, they say ""well the fries come with the ribs; we can't not bring them together."" 

And then they will not bring you more ribs than the 5 teeny tiny little ones per plate of 500 french fries.  So you have to pile the french fries on the table, and keep asking for more ribs. But they bring the ribs out - all frickin 5 of them - twenty minutes or more apart.  So then you are hungry, but you don't eat the fries because you did not come for all you can eat french fries, no one wants that.  

But then your waiter keeps asking you why you are not eating any of the french fries, and you say ""because I came for all you can eat ribs and I don't want the french fries"" but they keep bringing you the stupid french fries with the measly speck of ""ribs"" they bring.  

So after like, about two hours, you've only eaten 30 little tiny ribs, and now you have a stack of a few thousand french fries on the table, and also, you've been in Applebees for two damn hours.  

Then they start to bring the ribs even slower apart. So now you are getting 5 measly ribs + 500 french fries once every forty minutes or so.  

It takes about five hours to get your fill of 50 teeny tiny ribs and that does not include the effort of sheer force of will not to eat the fries so that you have room for ""all you can eat"" ribs.  

No sympathy for Applebee's here, they deserve to lose business those lying french-fry feeders. "

"Don't know if this counts as ""wasn't really transgender"" or just ""achieved a level of total gender apathy that makes me happy,"" but...

I ""fully"" (that is, to the extent I was ever planning to - hormones &amp; one major surgery) transitioned from female to male from the ages of 17-21. I'd been aware I was trans from age 11 or 12, when I learned the term while watching Tokyo Godfathers at an artsy local theater with my hip babysitter. I held off on doing anything about it because I didn't realize all the options that were available to me.

After I had fully healed from surgery I realized I was suddenly enormously comfortable with who I was, and didn't care what gender people thought I was anymore. 

Also: Turns out if you want to ""pass"" as a guy you have to dress incredibly boring. So I was either going to be a short, dumpy guy who felt completely restrained by masculine gender roles, a short, campy guy who got yelled at on the street or a pretty average-height woman who got to wear whatever I like and only sometimes got shit for not looking ""exactly right"".

If there was a viable way to fit into a third gender or non-gendered category I'd love to do it. But with a really binary-gendered society, after the physical problems I had with my body were dealt with I realized I would rather just have a nice time and wear makeup and not worry about getting slurs screamed at me on the street all the time. 

No regrets or anything, aside from the fact that some people will probably use my trajectory to deny hormones/surgery to people who would really benefit from them. Also, shaving every day is a huge pain in the ass and I grow a full beard and Wild West-style sideburns if I don't. "

"Frankly, I loved the therapist's speech at the end of *Pickle Rick*, because instead of going for a cheap joke, it actually addresses some of the serious core reasons that many self-proclaimed ""smart"" people dismiss the value of therapy and insist it can't help them.

&gt;Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force, and as an inescapable curse, and I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's YOUR mind, within YOUR control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk, to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your own universe... and yet, you are dripping with rat blood and feces, your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy - the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is, it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just... work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people... well, some people would rather die.

&gt;Each of us gets to choose.

Therapy isn't like some kind of test where it's all about knowing the right answers, and you can decide you're *too smart* for that dumb old thing to help you. Therapy's like going to the gym. You can't get in shape by just reading a book on working out. It's simple, and it's not exciting, but you have to actually go out and put in the time."

"Here's how I quit caffine and sugary drinks (I've done this several times due to having weird late work shifts where I needed the caffine to stay sharp):

- Quit the caffine first.  Switch from caffeinated soda like Coke to caffine-free soda like (most) root beers and cream sodas.  After about a week, you should no longer be physically hooked on caffeine, and after two weeks your body should start noticing that you're just pouring acidic sugar water down your gullet and craving something less sweet.

- Then switch from caffeine-free soda to plain water.  It's that easy.

- Once you're no longer drinking sugar, you can start focusing on not eating sugar.  Don't buy or own any sugary snacks.  DO buy and own a variety of fruits.  Cherries are my jam right now, but apples, blueberries, bananas, oranges... these are awesome and healthy snack options for you.

&gt;In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by ≈30%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials.

Also, people don't even realize how low the ""obese"" cutoff is. They think ""obese"" means you're barely able to ride a Little Rascal around Walmart, but no. Obese might just be 50 pounds overweight depending on your height. So many people are obese and don't even realize it.

"I had a gym teacher who also taught sex ed. For the gym section the main issue was that she would fat shame the ""chubby girls"" (although she herself was very chubby).She would often say that anyone over weight were just lazy good for nothings. For sex ed the first day she started off by having us all draw pictures of what we thought dicks looked like. One girl drew one with the scientific anatomy labelled and the teacher yelled ""wow look at how much April knows dick. She really knows her way around them"" in a cruel voice. Then she asked us to put up our hands if me masturbated. When no one put up their hands she got super angry and yelled at us. The rest of the classes were her telling us how men are useless and that we wont cum if we are with men and that we should only be with other girls. Also once I had a group project and my group member ripped it up because she did not like the colors and when I complained to the teacher she said ""suck it up butter cup this is the real world"""

"$228 but okay. However you have to eat something. If you don't eat 10 servings of fruit/veg a day your health will be awful and you'll spend more on healthcare in the long run. Avocados are not soda, candy, or cigarettes. They're not some unnecessary luxury that's actually harmful. They're a damn fruit that's good for you and you need to eat some fruit. They aren't that much more expensive than other fruits, they're probably only slightly above average.

And in the regions they're actually grown like California they can be 0.5$ per. Now you're talking about a quarter a day. 

And again, for a down payment even at the 2280 a year or your 2700 a year you're talking 8+ years before you can afford a down payment. Assuming you don't spend it on other essential items which you probably will.

"You're missing the point though. Most artificial flavors are synthesized chemicals, often esters, that exist in nature. For example, the same ""chemical"" that makes some sweets taste like apple, actually exists in real apples (among other things, which is why you can never 100% reproduce the taste). If you isolated it from the apple, there would be no difference between the two, just that one was synthesized in some factory, while the other was built by a protein inside of the real apple.

"I went to a very very small liberal arts school, but suprisngly we had a well reknown sleep doctor (who was a very active researcher as well) as our school's on call doctor throughout the week. 

He gave some interesting talks about this and said people seem to have naturally diphashic sleep patterns, which would result in something like you said if we didn't combine parts of them for other reasons.

 He also said that while the type of schedule you mentioned isn't common among groups of people, he said it is a schedule that he finds at least one or two individuals admit to at every single one of his talks, and that included back home in India and Europe, so not just the US. I don't remember much else beyond that. 

Other bulletpoints I remember him mentioning:

- He was pretty psyched about the lab based proof that our brains 'rearrange' waste products during sleep, hypothetically for more efficient removal (this study had just come out at the time and he said was the biggest sleep news in a very very long time)

- He said sleep debt is a very misunderstood myth 

- He said even though there are genes that can identify sleep resistant people (not his exact words but I have heard the phrase elsewhere) there are other psychological factors that determine sleep requirements as well, and that people brought up in certain environments can not just psychological deal with a lack of sleep better, but can also appear more resistant to a lack of sleep's negative affect on physiological health.

"I got a flat tire on the highway once. So I got out and began to change it. An older man drove up and asked if I needed help. I said thanks, but I had it covered. He said he was impressed because he had never seen a woman changing a tire before. I laughed and told him my dad taught me. He offered to take the flat and get it patched for me. He said he'd bring it back. 

So I accepted the kind offer even though I was kind of expecting him to not return. After waiting for what felt like forever, he did return with tire patched up and wished me well. He didn't want anything in return. He was a genuinely nice guy. "

So, seriously, fuck it, if you have crooked teeth, smile. And smile not just because some self absorbed jerk on the internet told you to, but because you helped someone or because you achieved something great.  Even if it's something only you think is great.

If you can feel good about yourself on your own terms and choose your own path, you will be already better off than a large percentage of the population regardless of their biology or how much money they have.

A series of decisions that seemed to be the best option at the time didn't pan out and we couldn't survive the stress. We tried to save it for months, but we finally admitted to each other that there was no saving it (just yesterday, actually). We both admitted that we just didn't want to acknowledge that we couldn't hack it and that all of our efforts couldn't save us. It's a massive relief and it simultaneously fills me with sadness and fear. We were perfect for each other, but a little too perfect.

"Late to the party, but here's my tale:

Was with her for 5 years. Happy the whole time. She woke up one morning and said she wasn't feeling happy and needed to get away for a bit and stay with her mom for the weekend. We've been together every single day for years, so I though it could be a good thing to get away from each other for a little bit. She never came home. We met for lunch a week or so after that and she said she couldn't marry me. Then left. I was blindsided; absolutely happy and in love. In my mind, I had already given her my life, so marriage was just a formality. We went from seeing each other every single day for years and in love, to her not wanting to even talk to me. I honestly don't understand it or how you can do that to someone you love. She was very reluctant to give the ring back, but eventually did. I was supposed to get married October 21st of this year. Not fully through the break up yet. It sucks and I miss her. I have no bad feeling against her and I wish her the best. I will always love her and have a place in my heart for her. "

"I've a friend who says that tv shows like *Atlantis* hit a real nice sweet spot: characters you really like and an interesting situation, but enough plot problems that it actually gives people the push to start writing fanfic about it, to fix those problems.  And eventually you develop a writing community that hits critical mass and fanfic just keeps getting written, even decades later.

OTOH, you have shows like *Babylon 5* and *Buffy*, where the quality of the show's writing actually *hinders* the development of a fanfic pool, because people are constantly getting Joss'd by better on-screen writing.  Doesn't mean the fandom doesn't hit critical mass, just that it takes more effort for it to do so.

[This is mostly for tv shows, though.  The critical mass for movies [or tv shows with a low number of episodes per year] is lower because what a lot of the impetus there comes from the desire for *more* - you only gave us two hours of material this year and we want *more*.)"

"Long time Alaska residents, grew up there. I have sense moved to the lower 48 for occasional reasons. 

Winters
* Long
* Dark for most of the day depending on where you are in the state. The further up north the less daylight. 
* Depending on where you are, Anchorage get between -10 to 30 F on average during the winter, while Fairbanks gets down to -50+ on average. Fun fact Fairbanks has a huge temperature swing, winters are between -60 to -20 while summer is 60 to 90 on average. 


Summers
* Sun doesn't really set! I can go hiking, or anything outside at anytime. I've done hiking at 2-3 am before. 
* It's not cold during the summer. Usually around 50-70 F. 
* Rains about once a week sometimes a dry or wet spell 


Spring and Fall
* Very short season usually


Other
* Alaska has real mountains, non of these hills that are in the lower 48. 
* Great hunting (don't need to ask permission to hunt on land) 
* I grew up fishing, hunting, hiking, 4 wheeling, snowmaching (snowmobile to the lower 48), snowboarding, snow shoeing, dog sledding, etc... 
* Everyone always asks about the Northern Lights. They are sort of cool but after 22 years, it's like oh, the northern lights are out again. 
* Northern Alaska is mainly tundra, middle to south is mountains, and far south is more like a forest with lots of pine trees and mountains. The southern part of Alaska is extremely wet, in Juneau (our capital, small city too) it rains here more then it does in Seattle. As you travel north the climate becomes more dry and decollate. The upper and mid interior of Alaska is often considered an Arctic desert in the winter because of the low precipitation. 
* The Alaska TV shows about living in Alaska are a little far fetched.

"The *race &amp; class situation* is quite different.  I'm from Southeast Alaska,  What I usually notice second when I go down south (first thing being reverse sticker shock or a panic attack about how many people are on this planet) is how kind of racially and economically segregated things are and/or how white the lower 48 is.  

I was working most of Saturday and so I kind of missed the whole Charlottesville violence until later in the day.  In any case it got me thinking because I'd been working with my usual bunch which includes a bunch of multiracial folks.  Like almost everyone I run into in Alaska these days is some mixture of white, Asian, native and/or some other stuff.  I was thinking, ""Just how fucking closed off do you have to be to think race pertains to someone's worth?""  Then I remembered other places I'd been that aren't 40% this and 25% that and 20% that other thing.  I remembered some places really are 85% white, 95% white, etc.  I remembered there are communities where the rich live in gated subdivisions and that it can be possible not to know anyone working class.  So I'd say there's that difference.  To be sure, Alaska isn't some fucking utopia but we sure as heck have more mixed-income neighborhoods and racial integration than I've seen in most places down south.  I feel like while there is poverty here, there is also a way out of poverty because everyone's kids from the richest business owner to a family crammed into a 1-room house go to the same schools.  There's community buy-in for the good of all.

"In college a fraternity brother left his new cat (rescue cat, several years old, but he'd had it a few weeks) at the house while he was out of town. It was kept in one of the bedrooms that overlooked the 3rd floor deck. The cat got spooked when a group of girls barged into the room to see it, jumped out the window to go onto the deck, slid off the gutter/ railing and fell to its death. We told the girls the cat was fine but asked them to stay out of the room so they didn't spook it again. The next day, we sent two pledges to the local pet stores and shelters looking for a replacement cat. They found one that looked pretty close, so we put the old cat's collar on and called it good. When he came back in town I told my brother about the cat getting spooked, swore the pledges to secrecy about what really happened, and he lived with the cat several more years, never bringing up any concerns.

"I have several.

The families dog would not stop eating grass which caused it throw up. So I just kept it inside all week so I didn't have to clean up any more dog barf. 

A different house had two sets of door leading out to the area where the dog pooped. It was late at night and there was a really bad snow storm but the dog needed to go. I get outside and a burst of wind shuts the doors behind me. I had forgotten to unlock the doorknob lock (undid deadbolt to get out) on them and so was locked out of the house. I picked up the tiny dog and walked in my slippers in 18"" of snow about a half mile to my mom's house and slept there. I told my sister what happened and she happened to know where the family hid their spare key to the house and I was able to let myself back in. I was so lucky because I still had several days of house-sitting and they had 3 cats in the house. 

Another house had a very poorly-trained Australian Shepherd. The family was gone for about two weeks.  I got sick and tired of it jumping up and eating my food of the counter. So I marked the area around the island in the kitchen with tape and taught the dog that it was not allowed in that area. It took like 2 days . That's all, and it got the point. Didn't have any more food stolen. 

Never told any of the families. "
"This was me during my first year in college. In one of my classes, this girl who sat next to me started talking about some of the coursework. Then out of the blue, she asked if I could accompany her to a nearby city to do research on the class's project.

At this point my spine was practically jelly and I wanted to make friends so I agreed, despite my instincts telling me to run. 

Guys, I was stuck with her in that car for five hours. She got lost, despite telling me that she knows the city from the back of her hands. 

Then she went into this very, very, VERY long tirade about her boyfriend, whom she love/hate because he didn't like her cooking or that he found her clingy (YA THINK????) and desperate. BUT SHE LOVES HIM SO MUCH YOU GUYS! SO MUCH! So much that she's taking out RM30k (????????) to do a surprise visit for him in Australia. 

She dragged me to the Australian Embassy and argued with guard (for some reason), I was all, WTF R U DOING BITCH THEY ARE ARMED!!! I should have booked, I should but I didn't have money at the time to get a cab and I didn't want to bother my parents cause I'm stupid. 

She never stopped (EDIT: meaning for breaks or lunch, she stopped for her destinations) besides filling petrol and I had to depend on snacks and hope to god I didn't need to pee. 

She made me count the RM30k in a parking lot, IN BROAD DAYLIGHT and I'm sweating bullets cause we could robbed jesus fucking christ. 

Eventually she did drop me home but not before hugging me tightly saying I'm a good friend, then gave me a small buddha sculpture (????back then I was a muslim, it's lost after i moved) and said, one day I too shall find a love so strong that I'd be willing to ~~stalk~~ follow my love across the oceans. 

Like, what the fuck, we didn't even do shit about the project!

Next time I came into class, she had deferred and gone to Australia. Then I found out that she's known as the batshit-insane girl and that they wanted to warn me to stay away but didn't get the chance. "

"Men: porn lies to you. We are independent people. and our lives will have meaning before, during (and after) you. We are not self serving stations for ""giving"" sex to you, and a healthy relationship requires time and work for both people (including chores: do not act as if you are helping or doing an heroic sacrifice, you are doing your part if both live under the same roof, and I am including parenting). We, women, need to talk to communicate what we need or want (even when sometimes, we did not know or are too chained in the culture to say it out loud), and we want you to say when something is bothering you (the level of ""blunt"" may vary depending the case).

I don't know why I haven't watched it. Maybe I feel bad for the Durst family. Michael was a nice guy, who knew his brother did it and cut off contact with Robert years prior to 2002.

"I think you both are correct. Some peoples brains just work that way. They are selfish but also self centered and want to believe that they are a good person, just as everyone else does. So their brain changes the subconscious logic for justifying their actions. Their brains attempt to distance them from these actions and the concurrent effect they have on others with logic such as this.   

""Maybe they saw me holding this. I don't want them to know it was me. I'm going to hide this here so the employees won't see it."" Becomes simply ""I'm going to push it back here so I don't get in trouble/look bad.""  

In doing this the brain successfully removes other people entirely from the logical process, and allows the person to continue believing they aren't a bad person, while also carrying on with their selfish ways."

"As a child of parents who claim to have treated my brother and I the same...

Fairly and ""the same"" are not always the same thing. Be aware that they are different and respond to that. Kids and even primates have an innate sense of fairness. My mother is a permanent hypocrite. I noticed way before I knew that word and I was a novel reader with a post-HS reading level by 6th grade. 

The *most* important thing is to check yourself. If you mess up, **own it, admit it, and apologize for it.** After that, **you darn well better fix it.** You have to hold yourself accountable because they can't *do anything* to, but the emotion to hold you accountable will still exist. It manifests as resentment. Good leadership is good leadership, parent, soldier, manager, whatever.

After that, consistent accountability. They break rules, they pay the price. No, how tired you are is irrelevant. Your job isn't to love them to pieces, it's to prepare them for the harsh reality of the world in relevant, reasonable ways *tempered* by your compassion. Their future boss doesn't care about excuses; lame or valid, they just don't care. Don't make them learn accountability after they're out of the house.

In short, if you want them to respect you, you've got to respect them first. Respect starts with the leader giving it, not the other way around.

I highly recommend the book *Spit and Polish for Husbands*. It's funny, reasonable and has a ton of good marital/relationship advice. Take that same view with the kids and you'll be honorable in their eyes. That matters.

Sure hope I'm preach'n to the choir here, but maybe someone will see this and realize they've got some reading to do."

"I still don't understand why people think what we had before was better. Yeah shit might have been cheaper. That's because it didn't cover shit. On Medicare, 65% of Medicare is paying for old folks homes, people seem to forget that. We need the gov dictating payments to try to get medical costs under control. The GOP mantra about welfare queens stealing from Medicare is just to divide us. The free market failed. It's a free for all with our tax dollars. Health care should not be for profit."
"Saw it in band with the underclassmen. 

It was quickly discouraged not by the staff but by older band members when a freshman doing it fell over and flattened the trumpet of a very nice and talented upperclassmen.

"*Wall of text alert.*

That edit speaks to me. I have this..friend, we'll call him D, who was a cool guy when we first met and started hanging out. As time went on however I noticed that he was kinda weirdly clingy with me. I'm not sure if he's like this with his other friends but it makes me uncomfortable sometimes. I'm a lesbian and in a relationship with a woman. He knows this, he's met her. But I get this weird vibe from him that he is possibly very much attracted to me. I do absolutely nothing to play into these suspected feelings and I have made it very clear to him before that I am very gay. 

I got deployed last year and it kind of did something to me and made me ""grow up"" (not sure how else to put how it feels) and afterwards I was kind of becoming distant with him because he is rather immature. I just wasn't feeling the friendship anymore. He noticed my increasing distance. We didn't hang out as much, I didn't really reply to his increased influx of texts. I was gaining different friends and meeting new people. This seemed to set him off and he started this downward spiral of self deprecation and weird, awkward behaviour around me and my new friends. I would occasionally invite him to hang out and try to integrate him with my new friends. He would just say and do really weird and immature things. Like over exaggerating imitations and just being over all obnoxious and take jokes too far and whatnot. Everyone noticed. 

He then starts saying he's depressed and says he's drinking more so I help him get in contact with mental health on base to get evaluated and talk to a professional therapist. He did that for a while then claimed he was better so he stopped going. He was still being weird and obnoxious though. 

He starts getting easily offended by our jokes and we're by no means picking on him or anything like that. He would dish it out but couldn't take it. There was one time where we were at the smoke pit with my new friends and he said a joke and I said one back to him, playful banter type stuff and he threw down his cigarette and stormed off. We were all like ""wtf"". It gets worse and worse and I get even more distant because at this point it's just uncomfortable to be around him. Then he starts claiming he's suicidal and has a drinking problem. I once again helped him get into contact with mental health, everything's good, he's better, he stops going. 

My SO is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his behaviour and is getting weird vibes from him and asks me to stop hanging out with him. I am definitely just not feeling our friendship any more and I agree that I need to ""break up"" with this friend. So he's home from work one day and I'm at work and I text him and say that unfortunately I cannot continue to hang out with him as I think he has feelings for me and it makes me and my SO uncomfortable. He loses his shit and is apparently drinking alcohol and starts being rude to me and saying that no one cares about him and I don't care about him and that he's going to just kill himself and no one will notice among other things. I immediately tell my supervisors and they send out our first Sergeant to do a wellness check and talk to him and I go too. We end up taking him to an off base hospital for evaluation. After all that he is required to keep attending his mental health sessions on base and is now on strict no drinking orders and is put into a 6 month program for alcoholism. 

I can't say for certain because I'm not in his head to know his thoughts but I get a strong feeling that he is doing these things to gain my attention and keep me around longer since it only seems to set him off when I start to drift away. But since I couldn't confirm that and I didn't want the guy to kill himself i stayed in touch so he had someone to talk to. 

Recently, I had some people over to play monopoly and drink and I asked if he'd like to join us. I knew people would be drinking so I asked if he would be comfortable with that. He insisted that he would be fine and he came over. The night was going well and he seemed fine. There was only 6 people there and we were all having fun. Then some shit went down between my other friend and his gf and she ended up leaving and he was upset and wanted to vent about it so he, another friend and I went out back to talk and while we're outside I notice D is pacing back and forth in front of the sliding glass doors watching us talk and I was just thinking ""wtf is he doing"". After a while he opens the door and says he's going to lay down on the couch and we're like ""ok"". So he goes back in, my other friend finishes venting and we all go back inside. We were joking about something and D gets up from the couch and is visibly upset and we don't know why. He's pacing around the room as we talk and then he walks out the front door and we're assuming he just needed to get some fresh air. We finish up our convo, friends gf calls me saying she's in some trouble and needs a ride. No big deal. We go to leave and can't find D. At this point I'm getting really fucking frustrated with him. As we leave to pick up friends gf I text him asking where he is and he replies saying he walked to the gas station which is like 3 miles away. I ask him why he left and he goes on saying how we were not including him in our conversation and how we were all so chummy with each other. I tell him to stay put and we pick up the gf and head out again to find him. I'm angry at this point. I feel like it was incredibly immature to behave like that and not at all safe to just be wondering the streets barefoot at 4 am. I tell him this while I'm on the phone with him trying to locate him. We finally do and take everyone back to my house. I take him out back and ask him why he's doing that and acting the way he is and he says he doesn't know and apologises. 

I honestly can't stand to be around him anymore after that and I really do believe he just does stupid shit to get my attention so I'll stick around. I don't want to be his friend anymore. I thought I could help him and be there for him, but he continuously has these little tantrums and fits and uses it as a way to make me feel like I need to stay his friend or he's going to hurt himself. I honestly don't think he will. But then how the fuck am I to know that for sure. It really puts me in an awkward position and makes me feel like I have to be this persons friend or they will commit suicide. That's not how friendships work. I hate it. I wish he would leave me alone. I don't know what to do. My leadership praises me for alerting them the day he was acting crazy and said he was going to kill himself so now I really feel like shit and like I can't stop communicating with this person. He basically told them I'm his lifeline and only support system and they told me that when I tried to sever the friendship I was taking away his only support system. Makes me feel like an asshole to be honest. I despise this ""friendship"". "
"Nope. That's a myth. The bravest thing a woman can do after giving birth is having sex again.  I had an episiotomy after I tore, and after episiotomy, I tore again, so I got the joy of stitches. AND I heal keloid (bumpy/lumpy) so it was really painful.

"I became a hermit for a while. With no one to lean on or look to for validation I had to figure out how to do that for myself. I boosted it with therapy and really applied myself to the exercises. It was a great year of learning who I was at that point and who I could become. I think actively working on those things in the time made the difference between becoming reclusive and actually getting better.  I consider it the time I dated myself, and it was great. "
"When I was in my mid 20's, I fell into a deep depression. I was in a job I didn't feel appreciated in and that wasn't going anywhere - I would get laid off, get brought back, get laid off, get brought back, over and over, every time promised that THIS time it would be a full time position that never emerged. I was charlie brown and my work was lucy with the football, I never learned, and eventually I just figured that I could never get another job so I just had to take the abuse. I had no friends, I was totally isolated from everyone. I was living far away from my family and didn't see them as often as I was used to. 

I stopped cleaning my apartment because it's not like anyone was going to come visit me so whatever. It was filled with trash and fast food containers. Dirty laundry everywhere. I didn't clean the litter box. cat shit all over the floor in my closet, and my place 100% reeked of cat piss. My place was filthy. i was filthy, I showered maybe twice a week. 

Crawling out was a slow process. It started with cleaning myself and my place. That was slow going. Once a week I made myself fill a big black garbage bag with trash and take it out...it took a few months to get all of the trash out. I cleaned up the cat shit and forced myself to begin scooping the litter. Not because of the smell, but because I forced myself to look at it from my cat's perspective, it couldn't have been good for them to be forced to shit on the floor and suffer through that. I found a better job. I started showering. I found hobbies that made me interact with people. I joined a stitch'n'bitch group, I started playing x-wing.

It's slow. It's hard. It's the hardest thing I ever did. But I pulled myself out, and I'm in an infinitely better place now"

"(I talk about this sometimes on Reddit but here goes!) 

I was in 11th grade and I was very depressed due to some childhood trauma. I finally see my family doctor, and he puts me on anti-depressants for the first time. Later that evening I want to meet with my friend group, so we all get together and I let them know what's up. Other friend has news too: he had a brain tumour. 

So after a long Tim Hortons talk, we all go home. I enter my house with my mom and I'm greeted by a police officer and grief counsellors. My dad hanged himself earlier that day.

"Phase 1: Scrounge for supplies, take an RV and load it up with canned food. Hopefully the roads won't be too bad. There will probably be really bad forest fires with everyone gone. I'd probably fill a few RVs with supplies actually. Find big tarps and a big parking lot to hide from the fires, use the tarps to build big canopies to protect my supplies from UV rays. Within a day or two I'm going to need a gun and armor to protect myself from starving desperate dogs. Sorry doggos :(

Phase 2: Once the fires die down, time to make several trips with my RVs to some hydro electric dams. Probably take some solar panels with me. The hydro electric dams will probably be the only place with electricity right now until I get my solar panels figured out. Once I've got electricity, and my RVs full of supplies, I'll need to fish as much as possible to stretch my canned food. Luckily I have the whole dam place to myself. 

Phase 3: Ransack the libraries if they haven't burned down yet. With no new books being made, and a few billion years before the sun engulfs the planet, I might *actually* have enough time to read all the books. My dam-base should stay up for a few years, so I have enough time to build a better home and continue bringing supplies down to the base. 

I'll need to eventually move away from the dam. It won't last forever, and neither will my solar panels. I'll need to spend probably the first 5 years (at least!) building something uphill from the dam, and hopefully with plenty of shelter from UV rays. I'll have to make the most of the first year, because soon gas will stop working, and eventually the vehicles I'm using will break down and there will be no replacement parts.

After a few decades electricity will stop working. I'll need to be prepared for that. Hopefully my extensive library has prepared me for the day my last LED bulb dies and my solar panels stop producing energy. Entropy is a bitch. Hopefully I also have enough extras stored somewhere dry, cool, and away from the sun that I can keep things going for awhile.

I'll probably be pretty sick of fish, but by 50-100 years, the wild game will be flourishing and they won't know what to make of a human. I should have plenty of wild things to eat. 

After a few centuries, the disrupted ecosystems of north America will hopefully be finding a balance. It might be worth relocating somewhere more geologically stable (if I haven't already). As cool as it would be to witness volcanoes erupting and Yellowstone going off, I'd rather see just how long I can live. 

I'd be pretty surprised if anything that I recognize today still exists in a thousand years. I'll enjoy what exists while it does, but prepare to live pretty primitively. Hopefully my mind will remain intact over the millennia.

After a few million years, I wonder if I'd be aware of evolution? Would I remember what dogs looked like before they morphed back into wolves? Would there still be wolves 100 million years from now or would I be fighting off something worse?

I would hope that I could live long enough to witness just how alien the planet would become without me. 

Maybe, given enough time, I could breed another intelligent species? Not sure I'd have the resources for it, but it could be a fun side project. I'd start with crows and breed them for size and intelligence. I'd also work on raccoons too, since they've already got pretty good hands. 

Hopefully no asteroid would hit the planet and eject me into space.

"I have a stepson who was diagnosed with BPD when he was in grade school. They said at first they thought it was ADHD, but as he got older the symptoms progressively got worse. He started smoking weed in 7th grade, and that really made him a mess. He acted like he was on heroin when he was smoked up (no, he wasn't doing anything else). We had to throw him out at 18 because he was constantly stealing from us, wouldn't work or go to school, and we'd caught him with some extremely shady people in our house. He's now 30, has had pancreatitis 3 times and will probably die the next time he gets it. He shot his foot off last year in a rage over his girlfriend at the time (some crackhead he'd known for a month). The wife has tried several times to help him and he just shits on her. He's at the point now where he's blaming his life on her, so he won't talk to her anymore. Thank god. It will be harsh, but it's sad when you look forward to that ugly phone call from the cops. "

"Throwaway account.   Not really my children but kind of...  
10 years ago I started a relationship with a guy, Aaron, who had three kids, aged 13, 6, and 5 at the time. After about 6 months, I moved into the apartment building next to his house but pretty much spent every night with him.    
Aaron had the kids half time when we first met, his ex-wife had them the other half, but she had gastric bypass surgery and a drinking problem. Two things that really don't work well together. They had been divorced about 2 years at that point and she didn't work. Neither really did her new husband. They sat around their apartment and drank and spent the $150K she got in the divorce. Well, that money dried up and she couldn't afford to have the kids at her apartment as long. Aaron was/is a waiter at his family's restaurant and worked nights and weekends, I worked a standard m-f 8-5 job. So, the responsibility for the kids homework/food/emotional support started falling on me more and more. I was actually ok with this, we agreed on most everything except one thing. The kids' weight. The mother had been overweight until the gastric bypass. The kids were medically ""morbidly obese"". The oldest girl, 13 years old, was 5'2"" and 250lbs. So, when I was alone with the kids, I would teach them how to cook healthy and delicious foods and we'd go on walks and be a bit more active.     
As the years progressed, my actions were repeatedly undercut by Aaron. The youngest two would stop off at the family restaurant on the way home and have a big bowl of matzo ball soup without me knowing. Then, I'd be home and we'd make a healthy dinner not knowing they'd already had one pretty much.      
After 4 years of fighting him on the kids' weight, I just couldn't do it anymore. (That and after 4 years, he changed his mind and decided he didn't want to get married.) So, I put a deposit down on an apartment and was going to move in two weeks. He found out about it and kicked me out instead and told the kids I had been cheating on him.      
It's been 6 years since then. I found a better guy, we're now married with no kids. I heard from Aaron once. About 3 months after I moved out to let me know that his ex-wife died when her liver gave up (no food, all alcohol after gastric bypass will apparently do that much quicker). But I never talked with the kids after that. Every once in a while I'll facebook stalk them. It's upsetting to see that their father has continued the obesity trajectory. But I know that I tried.

Also, it pisses me off out of principle: You must know that, potentially, other people don't like the same music as you, and you choose to play it loudly anyway when you could easily use headphones and enjoy the same music without bothering anyone else - there is something particularly antisocial and disrespectful about it.

&gt;Overall, the lifetime risk of someone developing colon cancer is 5%. To put the numbers into perspective, the increased risk from eating the amount of processed meat in the study would raise average lifetime risk to almost 6%.

If you eat more than 1 hotdog/4 strips of bacon a day then you should probably limit your diet a bit, but going from 5% to 6% chance of colon cancer isn't a huge deal.

"Well, I don't have hard numbers for either group, but considering football is played with 11 on the field from each team, with (sometimes) at least 11 more on the bench, then factor in that probably every decent-sized university in the country has a football team...not to mention high schools, but the injury risk for high school is probably not nearly as bad, so i don't count those. 

Even counting only professional teams, I would be surprised if there's more MMA fighters worldwide than there are football players in America.

"It's not cheap, but it's easy to do. Set up a bug-out bag. You never know when you may need it, especially in these times. 
Things you'll need:

-a bag/backpack (obviously. Make sure it's decently sized too.)

-a knife

-canned/non-perishable foods

-2-3 gallons of water depending on what size bag you have

-first-aid kit (bandages, gauze, HCl, etc)

-an old cell phone and a charger (for calling 911/999 in case needed. Don't know how it works in other countries, but in America, even a cell phone without a SIM card can be used to contact emergency services; it'll latch on to the nearest network and use it.)

-anything else you feel you'll need for survival

Put all of those things into the bag, and there you have your very own bug-out bag. Make sure it's in a place where it's easily accessible in case you need to leave immediately, hence the name bug-out bag."
"&gt;Nicotine is almost as addictive as heroin, if not more.

Right off the bat, this kind of language is silly. Addiction is not objectively measurable.

I've never come anywhere near heroin but, from what I've read, people become dependent on it due to it's overwhelming short-term mood enhancing effects; like it dulls you entirely to negative feelings. Nicotine, on the other hand, makes you feel like you had a little coffee and back rub, and that feeling wears off in under 10 minutes. Honestly, taking a big poop is usually more satisfying than smoking, if you don't have nicotine addiction.

People get hooked rather quickly on heroin because it makes them feel dramatically different. People get hooked on nicotine usually because partaking is related to socializing and has virtually no noticeable side effects.

People keep coming back to heroin, once they're addicts, because withdrawal is violently painful and can last weeks. When smokers go into withdrawal, they just feel like they woke up on the wrong side of the bed, all day long for a week or so. Relatively speaking, it's shitty but no huge deal. People keep coming back to smoking because it's an easy way to get ten minutes of modest satisfaction, in lieu of moderate irritation.

&gt;[Ease of addiction] alone, is bad.

Sure it is. Dependence isn't psychologically beneficial. But the consequences of the resulting addiction are pretty innocuous, in the case of nicotine; I don't think anyone has ever robbed anyone else just because they wanted to buy Marlboros. Also, people who are addicted to nicotine deserve tools that help minimize harm, be it nicotine gum or vaping.

With all that being said, nicotine in the lungs is no more dangerous than coffee in the stomach, in the short term."

On that note, excessive ""stone""-work (in a lot of US construction, the stonework is a glued-on facade). It is fashionable, and more expensive, therefore it means that the homeowner is rich, right? McMansion.

Basically, think like this: pretend you're somebody who grew up as plain-old middle class. Somehow you've made your way into a fair bit of money - not build-absolutely-anything money, but enough that you're gonna build yourself a big house. And you want people to see your money, so you're gonna tart that thing up. Impress the neighbors!

They lost because they were decisively outmaneuvered both strategically and operationally.  Couple that with the fact that France is a (relatively) small country, such that they had no strategic depth to recover, and you have a recipe for disaster.

The French took the brunt of the fighting in WW1, and they fought bravely in WW2, but at the end of the day they got decisively beaten and fairly quickly.  But there's no shame in it because so did everyone else that didnt have an ocean protecting them or massive strategic depth to absorb the German onslaught."

"I didn't watch Friends when it was popular; I watched years after it was over, and I found it unbearable and infuriating. Here are some examples of what I hated:

Ross and Rachel are a totally incompatible couple. They have absolutely NOTHING in common. Rachel doesn't respect Ross' education and intellectual pursuits, while Ross finds Rachel's obsession with fashion and consumerism superficial and shallow.

Chandler and Monica are in an abusive relationship. Monica is a neurotic mess and is controlling to the point of psychosis. She tends to act more like Chandler's mother than his girlfriend/wife.

Phoebe is narcissistic and attention seeking that I almost stopped watching the series because of her. She acts as if she's wise and smart and clever, when she's completely idiotic. Also, she doesn't believe in evolution. What a moron.

Joey was a somewhat interesting character at first, with his friendzone theory and his job arc, but by the later seasons he was bordering on mental retardation.

As a group, I found their anti-intellectualism very annoying. Whenever Ross wanted to talk about something even remotely interesting, they all teased him for being ""boring"" and then went back to whining about stupid drama.

I really don't understand how an ensemble of such unlikeable characters became so famous."

"As Westerners, we always shame Korea and China for eating dogs. People freak out over Yulin every year.


But if you look at the numbers, dogs and cats are one of the few animals that are practically begging to be used for human consumption. Each year, approximately 2.7 million dogs and cats are killed every year because shelters are too full and there aren't enough adoptive homes, these carcasses are wasted. Now of course puppy mills can be to blame for partial over population, but this amount of animals is going to be killed regardless of whether we'd consume them, so if we're going to eat meat it'd be very sensible to utilize this already existing source."

All of the items you've named require a doctor's prescription and are not available OTC like condoms, and progressive states like CA and WA that no longer require a prescription by law still haven't implemented the new procedures, therefore requiring a prescription. The reality: women have to jump through hoops to get the same protection that's available to a man. "

This is just a thought though. I stupidly got involved with it when I turned 18 for money, but I can't lie and say I didn't like the attention thousands of men threw at me. If women aren't getting attention from their porn-viewing partners, I can see them turning around and posting on things such as GW so they can get that attention. Only thing is, viewing porn is seen as a fine method of self pleasure but a woman will be attacked for doing a similar thing by posting onto GW. "

"I appreciate the effort for the citations! However, some of these studies are seriously flawed and don't precisely support your argument. Most studies (I didn't read the last three, just the ones comparing LF and LC diets), had very few participants (&lt;20) and didn't have consistent macronutrutients. The first study you listed admitted that it wasn't truly ""low-carb"" as it was above 100g of carbs and most LC diets are labeled as 50g or less. The follow up study for that bullet point was a study explicitly on ""overfeeding,"" which is not what any diet, LF or LC, would recommend. The next study which discussed the metabolic slow-down was also used a poor diet. The subjects were only allowed 15% of their daily calories to be allocated to protein. I believe most LC diets rely heavily on high protein explicitly to maintain a steady metabolism. The last study I read was the most convincing. It was over a period of 20-26 years looking at tens of thousands of individuals, men and women, on LC diets. As the paper stated, there could have been false self-reporting, confounding variables, etc. However, I what I focused mostly on was the way they differented LC diets. They looked at (1)""overall LC diets,"" (2)""high animal product LC diets,"" and (3)""high vegetable fat/protein LC diets.""  

(1) was shown to be correlated with a slightly higher mortality rate than average. (2) was shown to be correlated with a significantly higher than average mortality rate. (3) was correlated with a significantly lower mortality rate than average. So, I would argue that you may be simplifying a varying diet. Of course, as with any diet, it can be done unhealthily. However, I would suggest that LC and keto diets can have lots of health benefits if done *correctly, carefully, healthily (you get the point).

"This is what I do, and I say this as someone who couldn't whistle until I was like 20 so it's not some ""oh man everyone can just do it naturally"" thing, and I know everyone tries to explain it (poorly) and it doesnt work so just bear with me:

* Widen your tongue so that the sides of your tongue are touching the very outer edge of your upper teeth. This only matters for the *sides* of the teeth, not the curved front part. You'll be doing something else for the curved area in front, so ignore that. If you're having trouble expanding your tongue like this, close your mouth so the top and bottom teeth are touching (as in, just close it all the way), then do the same muscle reflex that you would do if you wanted to stick out your tongue at someone. You should feel the tongue press against your teeth. Slowly open your mouth to let the tongue expand, and stop right before the edges of the tongue exceed where your top teeth are. Make sure the sides of the tongue are still connected to the edges of your row of teeth when your mouth opens a bit more. [Terrible diagram illustrating this](http://i.imgur.com/sghjush.jpg)

* With your tongue draped over your top row of teeth like a tarp, try to curl **only** the tip of your tongue. Connecting your tongue to the side teeth creates a ""seal,"" just like a real whistle is a contained structure with only one area for air to escape. The curled tip of your tongue is going to create the ""slit"" of the whistle, the part where air escapes. [Another shitty diagram](http://i.imgur.com/WQmlgei.jpg)

* Purse your lips into a cartoonish ""kissing"" shape, the same extreme shape as if you were saying ""Oooooooo!"" like a spooky ghost. If you don't know how to make the shape, put a pencil under your nose and try to pinch it between your upper lip and your nose. As long as you can still breathe through your mouth, the shape should be right.

* While keeping the edges of your tongue still (against the outermost part of your upper teeth, creating a ""seal"" between your throat and the rest of your mouth) and your mouth in the same shape (""kissy"" shape, like an exaggerated ""O"" shape. tense the muscles in your lips a lot for this one), blow out of your mouth and try to curl the very tip of your tongue up and down while keeping the sides stuck to the ""straight"" teeth on either side. If you start to hear a whistle, try to stop at the point where the whistle happens and keep your tongue there.

* Once your mouth is making the whistle sound (doesnt matter what key or tone it is), you'll then use your lips to change the note you're whistling. This follows the same logic as any musical instrument: Longer = lower. You know how oboes are super low pitched and piccolos are super high pitched?

I have never been able to see a random guy and think ""boy I'd like to get my hands on that"" like my friends did. It confused me. Then I realized that I also would see girls who were beautiful and were kind, but again never thought about them any further. At one point I thought I was bi because I thought I was equally interested in both guys and girls, but turns out i'm ace because i'm actually equally DISinterested in guys and girls.

"You ever read Watchmen? There is one part of that graphic novel where a character called Dr. Manhattan talks about the odds of you actually happening, how crazy it was scientifically for you to exist. 

""In each human coupling, a thousand million sperm vie for a single egg. Multiply those odds by countless generations, against the odds of your ancestors being alive, meeting, siring this precise son; that exact daughter...until your mother loves a man ...and of that union, of the thousand million children competing for fertilization, it was you, only you...(it's) like turning air to gold...thermodynamic miracle.""

After reading this I actually became aware that yeah, it's crazy that I exist and I'm incredibly lucky. So I disagree with the part about life being a gift and I do think that each and every person is a miracle.

It's why in Super Size Me Morgan Spurlock's liver was similar to an alcoholic's. The reason we don't get drunk on soda is because the byproducts are different. 

In any case, the substances in soda with HFCS cannot be used by the body the way sugar can. Giving it to kids/allowing kids to buy is basically forcing their livers to process something that has no nutritional value AT ALL and that their bodies have no business trying to process. And on top of that, it's sweet as all get out, so they get a craving for it.

Me, the virtual Black Thumb at the time thought ""meh, I can't kill this thing anymore than it already is"" and brought it home. I cut all the dead leaves back and it was practically just a couple of stems. Four years later I've had to replant this monster three times.

"My cousin became my hero a couple of years ago when she was stuck in a post-football-game traffic jam, waiting to get out of the parking lot.

Without a word--or apparently a thought about whether her new guy would find this alarming--she jumped out of the car, marched over to the truck, picked up the garbage and threw it into the truck bed. Then she went up to the guy's window and told him that only jerks and morons forget the basic life skills and manners that the rest of us learned in preschool. Apparently, he sat there in shocked silence while his passenger just about died laughing.

My cousin stomped back to the car, got herself re-situated in her seat, then asked her date if he wanted to go get a beer. Apparently, he did, and he didn't mind her outburst all that much. They got married in February."

"A long time ago. My friends and I were hanging out at a park in the middle of the night. Drinking and smoking. Doing no good. (We never bothered people because are community all knew each other one way or another )When from across the park we saw someone running directly at us. We didn't think much about it since there was always people exercising at this park.(even at weird hours) Looked away for a minute of so and placed my beer down.one of my friends screamed run. All of us quickly dispersed thinking that maybe it was a cop. where we would hang out there was bushes that went upwards to homes above the park. All of us scattered in different directions up the hill. I ended up with about 4 of my friends near the middle of the hill. (Said hill wasn't that big ) all of us were completely stunned to see someone dressed in all black, breathing heavily and was laughing like a mad man. I just remember how dark he was dressed. The park had pretty good street lights. But man who was a shadow compared to the rest of us. So here we are 4 kids sitting in bushes at a local park, scared shitless. This man was maybe about 4 feet in front of me. He started to turn back around and then my buddies phone started to ring. The man stopped dead in his tracks , and turned around again digging threw the bushes looking for us. (I am sure he heard the vibration) He looked for about 30 seconds or so. Stopped and laughed . This laugh was something straight out of a horror movie. Then he just ran in the complete opposite direction. We all waited in complete fear for about 10 minutes. We all decided to run directly to my closes friends house. At the same time we were getting on the phone with are other friends to make sure they were safe. Nobody answered. ( they all made it to a shopping center that was close by) As we are jogging to my friends house. Out of no where a 2006 or similar year Toyota Tundra comes flying out of no where and almost runs over my friend. As I pick him off the ground running and lifting him to keep moving . The truck goes in reverse and back at us. The houses that were behind the bushes also had a condo complex and the streets were super narrow. We hopped a fence in a back yard and waited there for about 20 minutes. We were all shitting our pants , none of us were talking or saying nothing. We all at the common goal just to get the fuck to a safe place. We hopped the fence again and ran about 3 miles back to the closest friends house. To this day, I have no idea what happened. That is the one of the most scariest things that is ever happened to me. My friends at that time were such a tight group. We know everyone and never found out what happened. I ran into my friend ( the one who's house we were running to) about two years ago at a local store.I completely forgot about it , until I saw him. I asked what he thought happened after all this. He is just as stumped as me and thinks about it all the time. I have no idea , and to this day I just cant wrap my mind about what happened. "

"That helped my daughter as well. Sometimes it helped her understand what was reasonable fear or worry compared to unreasonable. Because there were definitely things she thought was paranoia that I found reasonable fear. Like a woman walking alone at night is often scared. That's not paranoia. By affirming some of her fears it made her more secure in talking. And even the things that are not reasonable to the average person, by talking with her I was able to see why her brain was linking things up the way she was. She learned that I would never mock her. That I understood these fears &amp; worries (no matter how unreasonable) were very real for her. "

"I understand the toll that must have taken on your mental health and I am sorry for that. I still think you had other pathways to take that didn't involve cutting your daughter out of your life. She's a teenager, and she's not fully emotionally developed. Many young adults distance themselves, almost unknowingly, from their family at this time - a time where things are changing very fast and it's hard to keep all the plates spinning. It was/is your responsibility to keep that plate spinning for her - to help maintain the relationship between you when she was emotionally less able to do so. 

I'm not going to go near your other two points, because I feel that your responsibility to your daughter's well-being trumps all that. Sometimes familial issues CAN be exhausting and emotionally difficult - you need to work through that with the help of counselling, and you need to be there for your daughter. The relationship with her that you are throwing away is worth far more than this. 

The very best of luck to you and yours. "

"Having lived in both, a few anecdotes.

To country folks, the noise in the city is staggering.  Especially the sirens.  They can't sleep properly without a period of adjustment.

Anyone in the country can fix just about anything (not necessarily the ""right"" way.)  They don't often need to hire someone for odd jobs.  Their abilities are not hobbies, it's a symptom of their way of life.

City folks appreciate the arts and culture at a level that country types will never comprehend.

City dwellers have access to amenities and creature comforts that everyone else will never realize they want.

The two will probably never agree on guns.  Two completely different experiences.  IMHO neither side should be telling the other what they should think on the subject.  Country folk are extremely unlikely to get mugged or see the devastation of a drive by shooting.  City folk will never know what it's like to be 45 minutes from a police response if the stars align."
"Context is important for this -- be careful if you're meeting with an extremely busy, tightly-scheduled person. I'm not a fan of people plopping down in front of my desk 10 minutes before a meeting. Get away from me; we're meeting at 4:00, not 3:50. 

That said, this is a saying for a reason: It's generally true despite some exceptions. It's *especially* true for job interviews. I expect to be shaking hands and sitting down in the interview room at the scheduled start time, which means you should probably be sitting in the reception area 5 - 10 minutes before that."

"Never skip put on homework and take a photo of any new assignments you receive, deleting it when finished.

Go for AP classes as they usually have weighted grades that can raise your GPA above 4.0.

Be nice to the teachers. They determine whether or not you can pass. Especially in English class. 

Avoid extracurriculars until you have some knowledge on how long it takes for you to get homework done.

Look in the handbook for honors diploma requirements. You will likely fuck up and get a B somewhere, losing the valedictorian ranking but honors is still much better than a normal diploma. 

If you live in a small town, people are watching you at all times. Don't do anything that would look bad if somebody took a photo and posted it online and sent it to their friends.

Learn a language that doesn't use english letters. You can write notes to yourself but yet nobody can even type the letters out. Also, being bilingual helps you adapt to learning more about other languages.

Don't do drugs. Wait until you're old and there's nothing left to live for.

Sleep.

Get Netflix. You can start and manipulate a conversation with other teenagers by simply talking about things you watch.

Make sure not to fuck up after your freshman year. Even if you think you were right, you need to be able to shut down the topic by saying you were just a dumb freshman at the time and laugh.

If you have the time, get a part time job. You can't do things without money.

If you take spanish, don't eat chilipowdered mango pops. Seriously. That is one of the worst things I have ever tasted.

No neckbeards, no trenchcoats, no rolling backpacks, no pink/blue/green hair, no piercings, no tattoos, and most importantly, avoid social media. You don't want to have anybody see your teenaged self's thoughts when you grow up. You will regret something, but it's much easier to get over when no one has evidence.

Figure out where you go if injured or sick. That's a bad thing to not know when you need to.

Record fights, don't participate.

If you get to pick a seat in class, avoid the idiots unless they're friends with you. Unbearable.

Read the full handbook. You don't want to get in trouble for anything outlandish.

"That is just heartbreaking. Some friends just truly suck. I am currently dealing with a recent diagnosis and there’s nothing like tough stuff like this to show who the real friends are. It’s certainly shown me who truly cares, and who doesn’t. Sometimes the real friends are the ones you’d least expect to show up, it’s weird. I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this, good riddance to them and now you can make time for people who will truly be there for you. I really hope things get better, or maybe they already have."

"Going for a run down a country road and half the people that drive by stop and ask if everything's alright, do you need a ride somewhere, etc. I've ran by the road in the city, no one gives a shit.

Next to me stood my then-girlfriend, who I had dated for a couple of years up to that point. I had the headphones on and was getting my Wu Tang on when I realized I had to, uh, ""let one rip.""  In adolescent fashion, I thought it a humorous idea to place my arse squarely against her while I did it-- you know, because that is what you do when young and in love.

It was as if I had parted the Red Sea with my cheeks, her tiny body wedged between the two of them.  I laughed out loud as I obnoxiously and very audibly forced every last molecule of methane from within.  

Following full evacuation, I triumphantly spun around to face her, but to my complete shock, it was not her.  She had apparently slid down the aisle while I was engrossed in my music, and in her place stood a very confused and disgusted elderly woman.

"One afternoon during my freshman year in college, I woke up from a nap with this intense feeling of fear. Something felt wrong, even though I didn't understand what. I hadn't even opened my eyes at that point, but I had this feeling that something bad was about to happen. I thought that I must have been having a nightmare and that this was just leftover fear when I heard a deep voice mumbling at the foot of my bed. I couldn't make out what it was saying, but then it started laughing maniacally. 

Logically, I knew that there was nobody there, because my roommate was also napping in the same room, but I was completely awake and aware of my surroundings. I knew it wasn't a dream. The deep voice kept laughing and the feeling of fear became so overwhelming that I started shaking. After what felt like several minutes but was probably about 15 seconds, I forced myself to open my eyes...and everything vanished. The voice and the fear were completely gone and my roommate was still snoozing away. It was surreal to have such an extreme emotion switch off within milliseconds. It was also bizarre that I had just experienced something so intense and the person 5 feet away had no idea.

"  When we were kids and he ""accidentally"" punched me in the eye when I slept over at his house. 

  We were chilling playing videogames and he started wrestling with me. I wasn't about it so he sucker punched me pretty bad and I ended up lying about my black eye to my parents too. I told them their dog head-butted me in the eye when I was sleeping.

  I was young and it took me a while to realize something was wrong with him. The problem was that he knew he was my only friend and saw it as an excuse to be violent with me. That event certainly wasn't the first time he got physical with me but it was definitely an eye opener. 

  Nowadays I look back on it and feel pretty embarrassed for letting myself be used like that... But nobody wants to be a loner and I thought getting beat up was worth having at least one friend. I just wish I would have stuck up for myself."

Otherwise, the recycling truck/dumpster would quickly overflow with large, unbroken, cardboard boxes. Ditto many restaurants, etc"

"Thank you so much for your kindness. I've written countless letters that got mailed to the trash bin (the trash folder in the laptop as time went on) because I was too chicken to send it. And I do feel guilty. I love my children more than the moon and stars, and I do not want him to think for one single second that I didn't love him enough to keep him. I got a lot of flack after I handed him over, people telling me I didn't love my son. I guess that fear that that's what he would think got embedded during that time when my wounds were still so fresh. Maybe I keep putting it off because I'm scared that once he finds out that I went on to have another child six years later, and then another, and another, and that they were all girls, that maybe I just didn't want a boy (I did, they just happened to be girls), or that I didn't love him, or something else. I don't know. I'm just scared. I am trying really hard to commit to sending the letter I wrote a couple months ago.

"My uncle had this experience. He has four kids, three of which are married, two of which have kids, and are very happy. The first kid however, who shared my uncle and grandfather's name sake, was not a good kid. From a very young age he was a cleptomaniac. My mom would babysit him when she was younger, around 14 or 15 years old (she's much younger than my uncle, by over a decade). He would steal her wallet when she wasn't looking, he'd try to steal things from stores, the list goes on. They thought it was the kind of mischievous behavior that a kid could be led to do, and could be taught not to do. Now I don't know him very well, so I don't know all of the details, but essentially, he didn't stop. He'd steal cars, motorcycles, credit cards, and a whole host of things. When my uncle would help, it only ended up putting him in my cousins radar for theft. Long story short, we don't see him at any family gatherings."

"A few years ago my best friend needed to have major brain surgery. 

It went well and he seemed to be recovering normally.

 But six or seven months after the operation he still didn't seem to be his normal self. And he didn't look well either, often very pale and sickly and lost quite a bit of weight. But we all thought it was the after effects of the major surgery.

He lives close by and it was our routine every Friday night to go out for a few drinks.

 He would come round to my house and have something to eat with us and then I would ring a a taxi to take us into town which he would pay for for getting fed.

One day about 8 months after his surgery, he came round and looked terrible. He barely ate anything and I asked if he really wanted to go out or if he wanted to go home. He insisted that we go out, ""I need to get out of that house for a while,"" were his exact words. 

That night for some reason we couldn't get a taxi quickly.

 Instead of the 5 or 10 minutes we usually had to wait, the quickest it would be was an hour. So my wife said that if we waited about 15 or 20 minutes until she has finished whatever it was she was doing, that she would run us into town in her car.

 So we sat their waiting watching TV and I gave him the remote and told him to find something to watch (he didn't have satellite TV in his place). 

He was flicking through the channels and found an old Horizon science documentarty on the BBC4 channel, and started watching that.

 I was reading the paper or something so wasn't paying attention.


After about ten minutes engrossed in the documentary, he slumped back in the chair with a huge smile on his face and gasped, ""Oh Jesus Christ! Thank fuck!""

The documentary was about sleep paralysis. 

He confided to me then that about a month after his surgery he started waking in the middle of the night struggling to breath with what felt like something sitting on his chest and when opening his eye seeing , in his words, ""what looked like some sort of demon"" staring at him just inches from his face, which would then laugh and vanish.


He wasnt and isn't religious by any means, and this was happening regularly, so regularly that he was frightened to go to sleep, and was drinking coffee and even taking speed to stay awake. Of course he didn't mention it to anyone as he thought no one would believe him and started to think he was haunted.

It was getting to a point that he thought he was going insane.

The documentary included an account of a sleep paralysis sufferer that was very similar to his.
And once he knew  the rational explanation he knew he was normal.

He got absolutely wasted that night too.


He still gets it, but less regularly and is prepared for it happening now."

"A guy who bullied me invited to meet outside after the class, because I haven't kept silent. I haven't knew him before. I 'accepted the challenge'. 

So the class started. I had to wait. It was the longest class ever in my life. I was scared, never been to a fight before. I was a weak small nerdy guy.

After teacher realeased us, I went outside. And there was this HUGE amount of people near the main entrance of the school. It looked like they gathered to some kind of event. After a few moments I saw two guys talking to each other, like: ""hey, do you know who is going to fight?"" , and the other guy noticed me and pointed his finger at me, saying ""here, this one with *name of the guy, I had to fight with*"".

The world fell apart. Basically, the 'event' was my fight. And here is like one hundred people waiting for it. We started moving outside the school area. 

Finally when the fight had to start, my bully started to act cool - he wanted to take his sweater off, put phone away, to talk with friends, etc etc. I couldn't stand the stress so I went for it - goddamnit, everybody were watching, couldn't help myself standing and doing nothing. As I said I went for it - kicked him, punched him a few times(no big injuries though), got my jeans really muddy because of falling on the ground. He started to scream, ""hey, hey, wait! Let's go to the other place, I think it's too close to the school"". I refused, wanted to fight. Then he started to run, lol. I chased him, so did the crowd, guys mostly. He ran to the school. We were standing outside the school area near the street and he was in front of the entrance to the building. He was in 'the safe zone'.

So the 'fight' was over. Nobody got hurt. Somebody from the crowd threw his sweater for me. I dropped it in the mud and left it. 

Basically, it wasn't even a fight. I think I got lucky because my 'enemy' was scared. But I realised this just later after seeing some real fights with broken noses or serious head injuries. However, the feel was good, since it was an experience of a weak small nerdy guy.

TL;DR Got in a fight with a bully, whole school watched, a guy got scared and ran away (luckily)."

"In cycling, it's having a totally bligned out bike while being unfit, especially if you have an aerodynamic bike that's configured in an unaerodynamic position. Your body is the biggest source of drag, so racing bikes put you in a low and stretched out position. You need to be decently flexible and not have a big beer belly for this to work, so middle aged overweight guys buy these multi thousand dollar racing frames and multi thousand dollar aero wheels, then proceed to set them up for a very upright riding position that completely negates the marginal improvements in speed they would have gotten from the expensive equipment. There's even a term for it, Fred, that is derogatory. 

I personally don't really care that much how other people spend their money, and selling these high profit items to amateurs helps keep the bike companies in business and helps them sponsor pro cycling which I like to watch. If anything, I find the anti-Fred cirxlejerk on Reddit to be far more annoying than Fred's themselves, because they will mercilessly criticize anyone who has a more expensive bike than is necessary, and post r/thathappened stories about how they were riding a rusty beach cruiser and they were faster than a Fred on a $5k bike to the top of some local hill."

"I live and grew up in a poor Chicago suburb notorious to other schools that visit for sports and games and such for being ""ghetto"" and poor. The other schools in the towns surrounding us are very rich and full of the most stuck up white kids ever. 

My school is mostly black and hispanic and when I'm talking to some of these rich white kids they start spouting off the most racist shit and act like it's nothing. I'm white too and as soon as they get a little comfortable with me, they start saying shit about all the n-words and ""spics"" in my school and how they all wear torn up jordan's or champion shoes. They use the word ""ghetto"" to describe everything they see.

For example, I've overheard two girls from another school filling up their water bottles in one of our water fountains and call it ghetto because it had a button instead of a sensor. I've overheard these kids complain that their parents bought Great Value ketchup and refuse to use it. My friend moved to one of the rich towns nearby and said on her first day there, someone asked where she was from and when she told them, they laughed and asked how she could handle all those n-words.

I'm so glad I grew up here because those people are demons and I can't imagine having that kind of entitled mindset."

  I never even looked at them to kill people until I was older. Even as a gun owner the thought of ever having to use it as self defense makes me sick. Will i, to defend myself and my family,  yes,  but it's not something I want to do.

"During the night of my girlfriend's birthday I extracted a dildo from her anus while she was passed out drunk. Then while I had it in my hand, I went to the tap and ran it under the cool water, watching the flecks of faeces fly every which way. Some of it even landed on my cheek and my friend laughed. I stunk. I sniffed the dildo and threw it in the bin and my girlfriend came in to the kitchen, hysterical.

She said, ""Excuse me. What have you done to my dildo?""

I said, ""Honey, honey, honey. Calm down. Be so sweet as to make me a wine, my friend here a tea. Fill us with glee, honey, honey. You are my woman, the fire of my loins. You arise something within my groins. I taste your onion, you my celery, let us not be the cause of each other's misery.""

"I was disageeing with the ""youd have to smoke more than humanly possible""

The whole idea that weed is more ""okay"" to be using in situations where youd never dare be drunk or on any other drug is a huge issue in stoner culture, and imo claiming weed can't hurt you *that bad* is encouraging that.  
There's also a difference between an everyday smoker and a ""just on weekends/at parties smoker"", and I'd agree that the ladder means you probably wont see many health effects, but the more of this ""weed aint that bad"" thats around the more everyday smokers will use that rhetoric to justify it. It is a drug. You are still putting smoke in your lungs that shouldnt be there. People tend to forget that. "

But see, it was all about control.

Anyway, the haircuts happened every 5 weeks for years.  Each and every time, he would get out a fucking ruler and measure that it was of equal length.

Well, I'm using Wahl cutters, so it can really only *be* one length.

Anyway, he used that excuse as a platform to berate me for everything under the sun.

I begged him to just go to the professional barber.  Fights got so bad, I would tremble at the thought of cutting his hair again.

So....one day, I had had enough.

"Tron: Legacy

I know most people hated it but I do believe it is one of the greatest movies around the sci-fi / Cyberpunk / Retrowave genre

here's why:

1.- The story is compelling 

2.- Characters

It might seem Sam is a clichéd character, with rebellious nature, but that's what happens when you loose your only parent and guide

Flynn is a great character, he has spent so much time inside the grid as a god that he has attained some sort of illumination, he knows what must be made and how his own existence tampers with the balance of the grid, the more he rebelled the more that Clu would fight back trying to perfect the system, so he sat back and let Clu build an offensive, once the offensive was built then he could bring balance back to the grid

CLU a program made to perfect the system, that's pretty much what he does, he had a code that went ohh so horribly wrong but he adhered to it, he didn't care if his own programing had to override other programs, think of it as Flynn being the Task Manager and CLU being an ad-block

Quorra was as mentioned in the film, the last of the ISOs, she was the result of the Grid itself, she had been remade by the maker (Flynn) and she was given the opportunity to change the world, she was an active participant of the movie, greatly involved, and constantly learning, much like an AI would...

3.- The visuals

It is a great movie visually, altought some physics might be iffy, lets remember they're running on 80's tech, the vehicles and buildings were well designed, as you can see on the slow-mo execution of the light vehicle programs, they all have an engine and basic controls, and well designed ergonomics

4.- Music /sound

The music on this movie is absolutely perfect, matching the orchestra with synth sounds, taking for example the great cinematography in the motorcycle scene, the song ""son of Flynn"" makes it an amazing sequence, both in terms of visuals and added emotion trough sound

overall this movie sits on my top 10 because of how smooth everything goes on it, and how well made it was, from the sound the motorcycles make to Daft Punk cameos, to The Dude transcending humanity

This old bitch *insisted* that ""the battery won't go out for at least two years"" and just kept repeating it over and over, effectively refusing to sell us any batteries even after admitting they sold them. Just rolling her eyes and looking ever so put upon. Eventually we gave up and left in irritation.

"&gt;Then I guess forcing someone to have sex with you against their will isn't rape, right?

Ah, so you're not just selfish; you're an asshole too. Yes, forcing someone to have sex with you against you will is rape. No, taxation isn't theft. They are -- and I can't *believe* I have to say this -- not the same thing. You are, as a member of society, expected to contribute. If you only want to pay for the things you use, then no one in Bumfuck, Iowa gets a road to their house, because it's just not profitable. That's not how society works. You pay in, you get your share of the social safety net. This is not a difficult concept.

&gt;K. Why, though? And, at what percentage of income would you draw the line for too much?

The specific percentage doesn't matter. I'm not the one making policy. The argument here is in favour of progressive tax structures. Rich people should pay more because otherwise the burden of the tax bill necessary to ensure that the pinch a rich person feels isn't apocalyptically bad for someone earning minimum wage; this is the difference between *fairness* and *equality*.

"You shouldn't even need fresh meats, honestly. I get a solid 60g of protein (when excluding my protein powders/bars, which adds another 20-40g) a day on a plant-based diet.

Our dependence on meat is rooted in our lack of acknowledging the amount of protein in other foods. We add a chicken breast to our plate and think ""okay, got my protein"" and totally disregard the fact that the baked beans on the side is an entire extra 8g. That stuff really adds up when you start to take it into consideration and eat the right foods.

I've actually found that the amount of protein I've lost from giving up meat is easily compensated for by making a few smaller adjustments, such as switching from white to wheat bread (which is also something everyone should be doing). The veggie burgers I make have just as much protein as the beef burgers I used to eat, just because I use whole wheat buns now.   "

"Studies out of Asia are pointing to a correlation between being near sighted and time spent inside doing tasks which don't utilize long range vision e.g. studying for long periods. It's thought that this is highly related to the age; that is, the correlation seems to be based around development of vision impairment due to kids staring at screens or books and being indoors during a developmental period. It actually changes the shape of the person's eyes.

I'm on mobile, but I'll look for the source of anyone is interested. 

Edit: Here's the source from Nature (highly reputable scientific journal).
Their findings indicated that these kids had slightly elongated eyeballs, likely due to spending so much time inside studying and not utilizing long distance vision.

"I understand and am not outraged. CAFOs are a step in mass production which makes meat available to humans at 10x the efficiency of 50 years ago. While I understand that there are some problems with the method - relative comfort of the animals compared to free-range, as well as waste disposal - these issues are the trade-off for the scale of production involved. As the industry evolves, I expect to see different solutions dominate, though there is no certainty such a thing will happen in our lifetime.

There is a cost in progress. Who pays it depends greatly on the venture. Maybe in the future the cost will be human lives, if our consumption becomes unsustainable. I'm equally un-outraged about that prospect."

When a employee hirers someone, he does it for the money. If he pays the employee fairly, he's not gaining his profit. If he has such a 'risk' that it cancels out the lower wage, he is still not making a profit. The employee is getting ripped of under capitalism.

Capitalism is a system based on infinite growth, which is impossible in a finite world.

The business owners force eachother to make production more efficient. As stuff takes less labour to be produced, it's value is lowerd. As a result, the profit will lower if the economic situation improves, dooming capitalism (extreme simplification)."

"I think the main difference, and what I hear being discussed by psychologists, is that we (asexuals) aren't disturbed by a lack of sex drive. It's not a malfunction in the same sense as depression or hormonal imbalances. We don't feel that sort of crushing sense of lacking, (I'm sure some aces wish they were sexual for some reasons or others but you get my drift?). Basically, it may be an abnormality but it's not a detrimental one. 

I like to compare it to food. I think that helps people contextualize it. You probably like pizza. Most people like pizza. It's a pretty universally agreed upon food. But I (for real) don't like pizza. Does nothing for me. Don't eat it, don't crave it, don't fantasize about having some. Some of us who dislike pizza might be disgusted by it (so messy and oily and ugh) and some might eat it on occasion because it's there or their SO really wanted some for dinner. I personally just don't care for it and don't eat it. I'm not upset by that and I don't mourn my ability to enjoy it. Instead I can focus on other stuff, like eating fruit, or sushi or something else.

Do people still seriously think it is? I'm more than surprised that trans people in this thread and elsewhere online think that straight people should find them attractive or else are trans-phobic. Ever since I was a kid they way I understood it was you can't help what you want to fuck (maybe in less colourful terms) and if that means I can't get down with someone who used to be a man then that's just nature.
I just assumed Milk was cum and Cocoa puff being brown was the poo hole.
"Straight from the man himself:

&gt; The line, he guarantees, is not about poop. “That would mean I was some kind of fecal freak,” he said. “What I was really referring to was ― a dump truck when it backs up, it’s like, ‘beep, beep beep.’ So, ‘she had dumps like a dump truck’ is, like, when girls do a booty dance move and they look back at their butt. She’s like a dump truck back-back-backing it up.” Hm. I accepted the explanation. And at this point, his publicist suggested we wrap things up. "

"What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris, by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years; she's never taken another lover. I don't care, I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier."

"1. Mouthwash isn't particularly useful for most people, in fact it can dry your mouth out (alcohol based ones do), but in general it just rinses off the fluoride-rich toothpaste. Fluoride needs time to work, which is why dentists now recommend you leave toothpaste on your teeth overnight.
1. Regular check-ups with xrays at least once every two years (if not more often, high risk patients should get at least bitewing xrays roughly every 6 months, moderate risk every 12months, and low risk 24months) will likely catch things before they can lead to catastrophic destruction. 
1. Cleaning between one's teeth is very important. Flossing is very hard, so these days I recommend using interdental brushes (Piksters or Tepes are my preferred recommended brand, size 0 will generally fit in most gaps) and flossettes in between *all* of your teeth, as the former get the bit where the teeth don't touch (this exists between all of your teeth, right near the gums) and the latter clean the bit where they do (the bit that makes that 'click' noise when you try and floss). Not cleaning between your teeth is like not washing between your fingers. 
1. Brushing correctly is also very important, which is why I recommend an electric toothbrush - yes, it *is* possible to brush just as well with a manual, but you (the collective you) probably won't. Using an electric toothbrush has two major benefits - firstly the head is very small and thus can allow you to clean difficult to reach areas like the cheek side of your upper back teeth, and secondly all the patient has to focus on is moving the toothbrush head around in their mouth instead of also having to think about how to move it in gentle circles. 
1. Eating or drinking anything that isn't water results in the pH in your mouth becoming quite acidic. If a patient grazes (e.g., has a bowl of snacks beside their desk, and or sips on a sugar/acidic drink rather than gun it), then their mouth is constantly acidic. For patients who are doing this for medical reasons (weight loss, post lap band surgery, management of blood glucose, etc.), I recommend rinsing very thoroughly with water and chewing sugar-free gum (preferably 100% xylitol sweetened). For everyone else, stop bloody grazing and have a goddamn proper meal. 
1. Poor quality saliva and low volume is something your dentist will be able to check with a saliva test kit. Again, it is preferable to find out why this is the case, rather than putting you on symptom-management and be done with it. 
1. It is possible to have reflux/indigestion/heartburn and be unaware of it. Silent reflux is a thing, and not just in infants. Stomach acid can and does cause horrible damage to one's teeth.
1. If you throw up a lot (bulimia, after excessive drinking,etc.), it's still stomach acid coming up and ruining your teeth. 

Best of luck, hopefully your oral health improves!"

"On Reddit certainly, in person I don't think most people care, and if they do most people probably either like it or dislike it but not strongly either way. I don't hate it personally; I followed it and enjoyed it for several seasons, but dropped off later on. Largely because as time has gone on, it's become more and more like any other average American sitcom. 

The show was initially good because of just how different the main characters were from your usual sitcom staples; they were so awkward, so socially isolated and weird, that it felt interesting to see them interact with polite society within the context of the show and see how they made sense of their world WITHOUT assimilating into it. But over the seasons, all the main characters have become more like your average Joe; they've settled down, got married, had kids, and become social butterflies for the most part. They've overcome their social anxiety issues, and have become more ""normal."" Yeah, it's technically character growth, but it ultimately ends up feeling forced in order to drive the show towards it's inevitable conclusion. This is not to mention the show's increasing disrespect of its female characters, with Penny and Bernadette being simplified from their fairly complex and interesting origins into naggy wife stereotypes who come off as so unlikable it hurts.

I really wanted to fucking lay into them about that.

I have seen only a very few use underhanded techniques for getting their numbers up.  In this case, I am guessing that a Recruiter found this guys test scores, figured he would do well in the military, and called to persuade him to come and enlist by stating that he was already enlisted.  If the kid would have gone, he would have gone to his local MEPS, raised his hand and took the oath of service.  At that point he would have been under contract and by the time anyone figured out what the Recruiter was actually doing it would have been too late.

Other people do not have to ""make concessions"" to deal with your personal bad habit. People already have to put up with the smoke you're breathing into the air around them in public places. You need to show a bare minimum of respect for others and not throw your garbage on the ground.

They also sell sandwiches at convenience stores. Sometimes there aren't trash cans outside. You don't see people throwing their sandwich wrappers on the ground and saying ""it's not my fault, they didn't put any trash cans nearby"".

Now I agree with you that having more trash cans everywhere in cities would be great. Write a letter to your local representatives about it. But you don't get a pass for littering.

"So after realising you had been a selfish deadbeat father you soon after decided to move away for a woman and leave your kids again, one of whom had an alcoholic mother? Good job, man. "
"Especially considering that the mother will most likely be poisoning the child's mind saying negative things about dad.  

My mother tried the same crap but I knew it was BS precisely because my dad fought for me and got custody.  Not so uncommon now but pretty rare in the 80's.  Through it all my dad always made an effort to say good things about my mom or at worst ""she's had a tough life"" or ""she's your mom no matter what"".  When I would visit her she would tell me what a jerk he was.  It had the opposite effect, my dad and I were really close but when my mom died I hadn't spoken to her in a year and our last conversation was not pleasant."

"THIS! This should be fined; I can understand small, low powered and gear powered lights, but those battery powered white strobes with no softner or dampners that distract and blind should have never been allowed on the road to begin with. At the cost of sounding crude, everytime I see one of them, I just pray that someone will just bang into them and chalk it up to being unable to see, but that will never happen.

Case in point- there was traffic on an uphill road- there was a biemer (BMW) which was quite wide, and a bike was trying to cram between cars and wound up scratching it. Instead of the bike guy getting pulled over, 6 other bikes came out from no where and started yelling and bashing at the car, despite it being the bike person's fault. After a couple of minutes, the police came in and took the BMW away and left the bike person to be on their merry way."

They also bring home meat in the fall (deer). Would we use them on a person? If it was necessary. But we don't buy guns with the intent of one day shooting someone.

"I was about 10-years-old at the time. There's this well-known park in our city and many people goes there often to do their things.
It was a normal Sunday morning, and my mom took me and my younger brother for a festival happening in the park. The parking lot nearby is pretty crowded so she dropped us off at a temple-like house in the park before going to park her car. We got in, running around the park playing hide and seek, things were normal.
The temple has this somewhat 60-years-old looking after the place. Now, things were fine at first, and after a while playing, it's my turn of being the seeker. I was waiting at a small well inside the temple backyard, facing the fence. I didn't close my eyes while counting (and i'm glad i didn't), and suddenly this dude came behind me and started taking to me. I immidiately felt there was something wrong so i didnt want to talking to him much and when looking for my brother.
He attemps to talking to me a few more times after i ran off, and at some point he touched my face and my neck, arms. He seems kinda hesitant since i was with my brother at all time after i knew something was wrong about him.
 I didn't know he was a mollester/pedoplile then, i just knew he was annoying.
We ran off immidiately when i saw my mom. Dodged a huge bullet there. Might be a reminder for parents of Reddit, don't leave you kids unattended at all time, especially when they are not old enough to avoid dangers. For all i know, I could've been kidnapped or raped if i hadn't had my brother with me."

"I live in my van (by choice) and keep cans of soup and beans in the back. If someone asks me for food I hook them up. If someone asks me for a dollar to spend on cigarettes or booze I say no and ask them what that will do to change their situation. 

Got into a 2 hour conversation with the last guy. He was a young dude, didn't seem stupid, was pretty humble. But he was making literally all the wrong choices over and over and enabling himself. We worked out a game plan for him to suck it up for at least a month to find any job no matter how shitty, and hit up the shelter so his money doesn't get stolen. Set up a bank account and start saving. Cause nobody is gonna have pity on him enough to change his circumstance. He has to make the choice. 

Seemed like he genuinely was ready to put forth the effort to make a change. I really hope he did."

Most dealers can easily count cards...Probably even easier than memorizing craps payouts lol. 
"The most common method of ""counting"" cards in blackjack does involve watching every card played. But you don't keep track like ""1 ace, 0 twos, 2 threes, 3 fours..."". The most basic form of counting gives each card a value of either -1, 0, or 1. So for every card you see, you simply apply a -1, 0, or +1 to your running count. Then depending on what your hand is, you may play it differently if your count is negative, zero, or positive. Things like splitting, doubling down, hitting or staying, what you do on certain hand will follow a certain pattern if you're counting, and a good dealer will spot that after a while. "

"I once had to terminate a pregnancy, that I would have much rather mothered, for medical reasons. It effected me in a lot of negative ways.

I try to look past all the negative stigmas towards a person like me who has had multiple abortions. I speak out for women like me to have a choice. I see a side of the abortion argument that others don't and I support any and everyone that decides to make a different choice after a pregnancy has been developed. 

Overall I feel a lot of shame, but I try to remember that at the end of the day I made the best decision I could. 

It hasn't effected any of my relationships/friendships. Anyone who knows has supported me and loved me through it all. "

Maybe the bride looks happier when she's talking to someone else, etc. I can really tell if a couple is going to last when I see deep admiration in their eyes.

"That's not sustainable, though. One of the major reasons why healthcare is a much smaller percentage of GDP in other industrialized nations is that the governments have far greater ability to depress prices by keeping the amount they reimburse for low. Since the national health systems are the primary means by which providers get paid, the providers basically charge what the government dictates.

If we ever move to Medicare for all, then healthcare providers in the US are going to make far, *far* less money than they currently do. US provider salaries are massively inflated compared to their counterparts in other industrialized nations."

Problem was once he salvaged the working parts they were just left cluttering the yard. Last visit he still had several computers that are 10+ years old, covered in dust that hasn't been touched since they were out where they were. 

So after I left home watching TV with the other half we found a show about hoarders and it just clicked that dad was on the path towards this. Hewasnt anywhere near as bad as these people on the show, the house is still livable in and not entirely cluttered but it's definitely going that way and if mum goes first I don't want to see what it would evolve into."

Often novice hikers will carry only enough to get them to an expected water source (like a stream). But if that stream is contaminated or empty, they run out immediately.

But without water, their body sweets and breaths out it resources quickly, leading to a quick deterioration.

Later on, it started small. Some contact. Some fights. Ten years later, my relative and the two kids share holidays and even have lived together on and off and worked through drug or behavioral problems, but never ever mention those 20+ missing years to us younger family. 

That was all fine until recently when they all started arguing, together, about details over their 'childhood home' that they never got to live in, as well as false memories about birthday parties and lake trips. Fighting about it at our family reunion...

The air was literally found to cleaner than our air on earth. What fucking sense did it make to run in full PPE. Its like that scene in galaxy quest.

Also when people talk about them landing on the planet in covenant.

Fucking think about it, your getting a weird human like signal on a planet that wasn't supposed to exist, of course you want to check it out, could be distress, or aliens (with you being the first to contact them ever)

Covenant was the best alien movie since alien 3, its just that everyone wants to be an armchair space trucker."
I am positive people who have gotten a way with murder will confess to it on a random AskReddit question.

"Squeeeee I kind of want to pet a cow now. Though one thing I learned on a trip through Texas: my dog will not poop near them. We had to go further down the road for him to do his business.

"One of my friends:

Will comment on something he knows absolutely nothing about. I mean literally he could have learnt about something 5 mins ago and then he starts with his ""theories"". 

Let's call him RV. I can be talking to another friend discussing something I learnt while I was studying psychology and RV will pop in and start stating things that are completely wrong and have no basis for even being true. When you ask him how he know his answer, ""I though about it"". I shit you not. He, in all seriousness, will happily spit verbal diarrhoea c will pass it off as fact because he thought about it and it made sense to him. He did this constantly, wishing about things he knows nothing about claiming that he's right because ""he thought about it "". If you try to villain that he's wrong he gets touchy and will at time straight out refuse to accept that he with no xp in a particular field thinking about something does not hold up to the thousands of hours that people who have dedicated their lives to said field have put into researching and studying it. But no, his thinking about it trumps all of their years of work. 

It reached a point where we realised that he was constantly lying to us and claiming things he thought about as fact and so I had to start asking him when he told me things, ""RV did you research this or did you just think about it?"". Then he'd get offended because he has to come clean and admit that it was just something he thought about and that I don't understand because ""it made sense to him"". Then he started believing in his own Bs so much that when we asked if he research something he'd say yes he did research it. When I realised that things he supposedly researched were often wrong I ask him again if he really researched it and what research it was he came admitted that he didn't research anything but he instead thought about it and that's the same as research for him because he's always right when he thinks about things (he's not). 

I don't have a problem with having a different opinion from the norm or with challenging things that we already think we know. But to do so with no basis or any serious effort and to ignore the effort put in by so many people who dedicated so much time in the past simply because you believe that you're super intelligent, I find that really pretentious and disrespectful.

"Which religion is your family?  My guess is JW?  If so, there are some rather stark and damning proofs of its falsity that would naturally be unfamiliar to anyone still in the church.

I say with complete faith as a Catholic that God does not want her (or anyone else) to abandon you because of homosexuality.  PM if I can be of any help."

"When I was 16 I saw a motorcycle for sale on my walk home from school. It was gorgeous (to me at the time) and cheap! I knocked on the door and talked to the guy who lived there! Set up a price and everything! I was so lucky that he would accept exactly how much money I had saved up at that point! The only downside was that he didn't have the title. No biggie, he said. I can just file for it at the DMV. 

Got home and asked my Dad when he got home to take me to the bank that weekend so I could withdrawal the money. Told him all about it and he put the kibosh on it immediately. Still no idea if it was a scam. 

I know my Dad was trying to look out for me though so I'm grateful he didn't let me. Thanks, Dad. "

"That my Dad is a hoarder.

I just got used to having lots of shit around the house. Excess floorboards in piles in the corner of my parents bedroom. Christmas tree up until May (because there was no room in the garage to return it), then ultimately stashed in my parents room, ready to pull out for next Christmas. Under my bed was full of cases of stuff that didn't belong to me. My sister's room had more stuff that belonged to Dad than belonged to her. Every spare space (a corner, on top of a cupboard, a spare drawer in a wardrobe, under the coffee table) was full of odds and ends. Cases, boxes, things in plastic bags. 

When I was in my early 20's, my mother, sister and I moved out. 3 years later, the house was sold and we started moving Dad and ALL his shit out. It was then that I realised just how bad it was. He had manila folders and copy paper that was older than I was. VHS's that I had recorded in my childhood. Enough crockery for a party of 60 people (including two identical kitchen sets). And he *refused* to get rid of any of it, even though he had found no use for any of this stuff in over 20 years. ""I want to watch those videos before I throw them out!"" ""What's the point of getting rid of stationary, I'll just need to spend money to buy it again!"" 

It varied from vaguely humorous (I said, ""Dad, you do realise there are reality programs about people like you?"") to disturbing when he started throwing tantrums any time someone suggested he get rid of something. He would stomp his feet like a three year old.

He lives with his new wife now. He is renting out at least two separate garages that are just full of his shit (some of which are our childhood mementos, which we have no access to). I know that one day, when he passes away, my sister and I will have to take a month off work just to sort through it all and throw most of it away.

"At what point is the daughter responsible regardless of the situation? I know a girl my age whose mother lied and told her that her father didn’t want to see her and poisoned her basically. Her father made clear otherwise to her when she was like 19. She got married, divorced, told her father she hated him somewhere in the middle. I haven’t heard from her since but there’s no way she didn’t know by then that her mother was a liar. (She also has AJ older brother who lived with other family so wasn’t exposed to the same crap, just different crap) 

At 9, OP should have caught it. 10, 11, etc. he should have physically taken the phone from her. But he was young. If I’m doing my math on memory correctly, he was 20 when she was born. And assuming he had an okay childhood he could have easily missed the signs. 

I also thought the same by the way. My second thought was that the mother just told Janet to say all of those things. Her own personal power trip. Some people are like that. "
This thread has made me think of so much new information about country life. I can see more about how you like your guns if you need to defend your animals from bigger animals. We in the city tend to not have that concern; the guns we worry about are in the hands of people who want to shoot up our children's schools and movie theaters. 
"Ah yeah except that I wasn't even allowed to go out with my friends after sundown, because apparently going to hang out at a friend's place with a large group of people is dangerous. That's not smart parenting, that's toxic. Not to mention that my brother sexually abused me and my parents knew about it, and still didn't let me go out. They also covered up the abuse so my brother wouldn't go to jail, so no, me not going out after sundown didn't really have anything to do with my safety or mental health. Trust me, being inside that house was a lot less safe than being outside at night. Not being allowed outside after sundown also included when I was staying at their house over the summers when I was in uni, because that's how controlling they were. They were suffocating, not smart, and it's taken me years to undo just a fraction of the mess they inflicted on me."

"The pH scale goes from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). A pH of 7, which is right in the middle, is considered neutral.  Our bodies have slightly basic pH (for example, your blood has a pH of ~7.4 (7.35-7.45), and a lot of our cells and membranes in our bodies function best around that pH (your eyes for example).  I just looked it up (I don't have a pool) and it seems like most people set the pH of their pool to ~7.4-7.6  This would be the least harmful to your cells, since they're used to it!  Hope that helps!"

"Honestly, I'm no mental health expert, but the guy sounds like a sociopath. He probably has a high paying career in an area that requires cutthroat tactics to get ahead, views people as vessels to use to his advantage (which, in his mind, is okay because everyone does), and would quite willingly cut contact with anyone he views as harmful to him. He wants to be a father because that's expected, and because he thinks he might get some entertainment out of it, not because he wants kids. He likely views social interactions as games to win, and will say and do anything that gives him the most benefit.


His morality comes from societal expectations rather than personal convictions, and he'll only adhere to it to make himself look good. He most likely had emotionally distant parents (or parent, if he was only raised by one) with no consistent rules, leading him to learn to manipulate to get what he wanted and/or needed as a kid. "

For example, if you're buying a 4-pack of toilet paper for $4, that's $1 a roll.  You could get a 36-count package of toilet paper for $18 at Costco or Sam's, which would work out to 50 cents a roll.  Yes, you're paying more up front, but the costs work themselves out over time."

Income taxes were allowed in the original Constitution (Article 1, Section 2 and Article 1, Section 8).

The 16th Amendment gave the authority to more broadly tax income, this is true, but the legality of an income tax was never in question prior to this. There is precedent of an income tax even before 1914, particularly during the Civil War and the Revenue Acts of 1861 and 1862."

"I feel honored to read this. I'm adopted and have a similar story. My mom would give letters/photos to the doctor who delivered me (he personally knew my birth parents) but no one ever responded so she stopped, assuming that my birth family wanted space. Found out at 23 (after a year of research) that I have 4 full siblings. I was the youngest and they just couldn't afford me financially, or give me the attention a newborn requires. I wrote a letter to my birth mom when I found them and 2 of my siblings wrote me back/sent pics. I've met my siblings now and I'm ""friends"" with my birth family on FB. We're not close but I love KNOWING the story, knowing what's going on in their lives, and showing them what's going on in mine. "

For the love of Jeebus, be your own person. 

Edit: Rant cont'd.

You know what gets to be the oldest thing about being gay for me? It's not people harassing or rejecting me because I'm gay. Frankly, most people in my life either have no idea I'm gay or flat out don't care. My parents took the news well. Nah. The most annoying thing for me is that when it comes up and I tell somebody I'm gay, they get surprised and say things like ""but you don't act gay at all!""

What the fuck does that even mean? I'm supposed to throw on a lisp, dress fancy, act catty, and trade in my truck for a Miata? Fuck that. I hate that to be ""gay"" implies an entire lifestyle rather than just describing my sexuality. "

"BOOKS: Don't buy the required editions. Nearly all the required editions are new editions and cost anywhere from 90-150$+. 

The trick is to look for older editions but do some research before buying the old edition to make sure it is nearly identical or has the same content as the newer edition.

 Look for the amount of pages between old and new, compare chapters between the two books if you can get a sneak peak online, and buy USED or even RENT on AMAZON or EBAY. Sometimes the international versions are the same as the original ones...just a different cover."

"It was a rule growing up that we had to wear thongs inside the house. Outside shoes were not allowed inside. Walking barefoot was also prohibited. No thongs meant we would be yelled at and made to wash immediately, no matter what we were doing. The inside thongs could also not be worn outside, and if they ever were, we would need to wash them asap. 

I grew up thinking that this obsession/compulsion was perfectly normal... until I went over to a friend's house for the first time and realised that this wasn't a thing. What an absolute shock. Walking barefoot in my own house still feels weird and wrong, and I still have a pair of thongs hidden somewhere for when my mother might come over.

"It still shouldn't. Snow acts as an insulator itself. Sun doesn't get directly to the metal of the roof to heat it up because it's covered in snow. The ambient air temperature underneath in the attic is a larger determiner if snow melts.

That's exactly what should happen when the sun is heating the roof. A tiny portion of the bottom does melt. Then it refreezes into a frost covering the roof, which tends to stick even more snow to it. If a metal roof looks different than that barn, it is because heat radiating out *from inside.*"

My almost-four-year-old has a tablet.  She typically gets maybe an hour or two of screen time (TV/tablet) a day and we spend *a lot* of time playing.  The tablet makes it easier for us to go out; she's entertained, we enjoy ourselves, and it's not a distraction to other people.

"Yup,  I understand those concerns,  much like there aren't enough long terms studies on lasik and whatnot (and some are concerned about a national health crisis with that when everyone starts suffering macular degeneration),  

but long term studies on nicotine,  outside of some issues listed earlier I believe,  is that it can act as a wonder drug for people suffering from Parkinsons', alzheimers, .. it can act as a stimulant and a sedating effect depending,  and increases alertness and has many other benefits. 

As an alternative nicotine delivery system,  with the science and ""what we know now"",  vaping is considered to be 97-99% safe,  or safer by the Royal Academy of Health etc,.  and they are spending public money in an effort to get this across in the interest of public health.

 Nothing is better then clean air.  No argument.  

But vaping as a smoking cessation device has been far more successful then anything Big Pharma has come up with (nicoderm,  Chantix (evil!), etc).  

I don't recommend anyone who doesn't smoke get into vaping,  as you said,  we don't know everything.  But what we do know,  it is recognized as a far safer alternative etc.   

It is sad kids are getting into Juuls and whatnot,  and I agree with that of course... I don't want anyone developing a ""habit"" or dependence obviously.  But for smokers trying to quit,  they are recognized or accepted now as FAR better by Johns Hopkins etc etc.  There unfortunately is a lot of misinformation on vaping given to the general public (often funded by Big Tobacco and Big Pharma as they are the losers in this)."

"Sometimes as a cyclist I choose to take the lane for safety.  

For example, there is a big curve that I take on my way home, and invariably someone will try to pass me on the curve not knowing that there is a car coming in the other direction.  Because it's a downhill curve they end up needing a lot of distance to pass, and several times have nearly caused an accident.  Similarly, when there is no shoulder on the road cars will try to squeeze through the lane with you.  This does not provide the 3' clearance required by law.  Most states allow the cyclist to take the whole lane, and I believe they should when staying safe necessitates it. 

Not to say that you are the type of motorist that prioritizes a few saved seconds on your trip above my safety and potentially jeopardizing my life - but that would be the type of person I just can not stand."

"I used to work a desk job that shared with a coworker that had *bodily function issues* that was very strange. This woman would adjust herself several times an hour by getting up slightly and sitting back down, followed by an audible squishing/splash sound. Seconds later, smells of a dumpster full of damp armpits would flood the desk area. 

Within a week, she left. Another coworker admitted that they brought up the odor problems to HR. However, about a month after she left, I could smell the same armpit odor coming from our cabinet wall, where co-workers can put their personal belongings and purses and coats in. It was the same woman's assigned cabinet and she didn't clean it out. Curiosity piqued my investigation into what exactly caused the smell. After searching through a plastic bag full of Ziplocs inside, I found a Tranquility brand *All-Through-the-Night* adult diaper. Prying the diaper open showed this vile goob of tanned cream cheese with light streaks of blood. When I poked it, it was still warm. 

The smell lingered on my finger for days. "

Now, fair warning - it's pretty biased and the way the information is presented is very extreme. You'll probably find yourself getting angry while watching, especially when he says that eating one egg a day is the equivalent to smoking 5 cigarettes a day.
Anyway, point being - it's an extremely well-researched documentary with credible sources and tons of information about why eating meat is bad for our bodies and for the environment. It also goes into the advertising schemes that we've been fed our entire lives that basically tricks us into thinking meat is good for us. For one example, Tyson Meats is one of the biggest sponsors of The American Cancer Society. Basically, they give so much money to the cause and that's why ACS website lists meat as being part of a healthy diet. It's all pretty fucked up.

"Check out /r/keto.

You can read Gary Taubes and Robert Lustig as well. They, and many other researchers have very long detailed lectures on the biochemistry, clinical trials, and epidemiological studys on refined carbohydrate and frutose and it's impact on the body. You can watch a ton of video lectures on youtube. /r/keto has a ton, but there is a lot of information out there about keto and low carb/high fat.

As for how to do keto, the short answer is:

Start ~1g dietary protien / 1kg of body weight (moderate protien).
Limit carbohydrate to &lt; 25g per day.
Healthy fats to meet caloric goal.

Healthy fats are just about anything but the highly processed plant oils like corn, peanuts, and soybean. Biggest exceptions are coconut, olive, and avocado. This has to do with high omega 6 in processed plant oils.

You can eat just about all you want of vegetables that grow above the ground, as they tend to be low in carbohydrate and high in nutritional density. Vegan can be done, but it's harder to eat enough veggies without resorting to processed foods.

You still have to limit your caloric intake to lose weight, but this will come more easily and fairly naturally because the food is highly satiating and it has no crash. Some people can tolerate higher carbohydrate, but 25g guarantees that you won't be consume too much to start out.

The people that respond the best are insulin resistant, so people with type 2 diabetes usually see more massive weight loss than someone isn't. But regardless, everyone should see improved blood sugar control, blood lipids, and inflammatory markers.

It takes a while to adapt for some people. Most metabolic markers return to normal within a week, but you may feel a little lethargic while your body relearns how to metabolize fat. And some gastrointestinal distress until your gut adapts to the higher fat load. You may also experience headaches, which is usually associated low electrolytes from water loss from depleting your glycogen stores. Consume more salt (up to 4-6g a day has been shown to be the sweet spot in a 100,000 person study in canada). A couple of glasses of bone broth or bullion cubes are an easy way to replenish electrolytes. I have one cube in the morning and one at night.

Just remember, if you are trying to lose weight, and you are hungry. It is better to eat keto and stay with it, than to limit calories. Eat healthy first, and then worry about the weight. After you adapt hunger control is drastically easier."

This is why there's so much animosity from some AuD's toward Hearing Instrument Specialists - they're our competition. Manufacturers do not differentiate between AuD's and HIS because we have the same rates of return and the same Patient Outcome and satisfaction metrics. When hiring, postings call for ""qualified Dispensing AuD or HIS"" because they do the same exact thing. I work with excellent AuD's and HIS, and I'll recommend based on experience and reputation, not title. I get that it's frustrating having to compete with folks who didn't pay through the nose for schooling (which doesn't cover hearing aids at all, btw) but we should be looking out for the best interest of the patient - not our wallets."

"You got behind someone with celiac disease (gluten allergy).or someone pretending. We're not ones to judge who is who, so upon request, we go gluten free.


it stinks for the others in line behind, but if you do a little research, you'll see that it's necessary.  E.g., I roll a burrito with my gloves, touching the tortilla and mild salsa spoon in the process.  Then I grab a bowl for someone with celiac (no glove change). The flour (and gluten) from the burrito just went onto the mild salsa spoon.  Gluten free guy wants mild salsa. I grab the tainted spoon, then grab his bowl (or corn tacos). his napkin or spoon or hand touches where i jyst touched, ans I ruines his week.


What you experienced want an idiot or jerk. it we a slight inconvenience for hit, but a blessing to the kid with celiac. I get a genuine thank you about once every week or two, followed up by a comment on how we're free only ones that can be trusted with making someone's meal gluten free.


If done correctly, it shouldn't take more than a minute.  Usually it's a bowl (easiest). admittedly, corn tacos gluten free are a bitch, but only add an extra minute, tops.


One line guy changes gloves, cash sanitizes the line table, other line guy asks what guest wants and removes spoons.  As dirdr line guy, after I wash hands and change.gloved (30 sec), I grab spoons (while other line guy grabs fresh lettuce and cheese containers bc no spoons amd let/chz on line is tainted with gluten.


Then I make bowl. 30 sec wash hands, 15 to get spoons. 15 to make bowl.  Should be one minute.  If the tortilla guy is experienced, he can make this happen.  It fellas like forever when you're in line or see it happening, especially when we put through  three ot more orders.per minute (ideally). But, the benefit greatly outweighs the delay, even if it is longer than a couple min. 


Plus, if you go gluten free, unit can't half ass it. It's all or nothing.  We don't just accommodate the ""fad"" by having corn tortillas bc idiots think gluten has ""toxins"". We provide a fully gluten free, contaminating free meal for those ergo can't trust Applebees to be as diligent. 


But don't worry, aa implied above, the fad followers don't say the have an allergy (generally). They just all for corn tortillas or a bowl  (and double check that our salsas don't hace gluten). The fakers generally don't waste everyone's time.  "

"OK. Let's look at a different statistic then. According to [this](http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/08/08-26-16-Gun-policy-release.pdf) Pew Research Center poll, roughly 44% of all households in the US have a firearm. 

[There were roughly 125.82 Million households in the United States in 2016.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183635/number-of-households-in-the-us/) This puts the number of households with a firearm at roughly 55 Million.

Using the same statistics as before, 11,000 homicides with a firearm per year, assuming a firearm is only used in a single homicide, that still puts the likelihood of a household with a firearm being involved in a homicide at a mere 0.02%; or 0.06% if you want to throw suicides into the mix.

This is the *worst case* scenario. It ignores the fact that some firearms are used to kill more than 1 person (mass shootings, career criminals), and also assumes that each gun owning household only has a single person who owns a gun, rather than multiple members of the family. In reality, the percentage of gun owners who are involved in a homicide would be *less* than 0.02%. 

My point still stands. Characterizing firearms as being ""normally used"" with the intention to commit homicide is misrepresenting the truth; 99.98% of all households with a firearm will *not* be involved in a homicide in any given year. "

I was way too far out, being close to the end of the driveway with the trashcan. I noticed the car's window was rolling down. Luckily, my dad was following a little ways behind me, and his view was somewhat obscured from the perspective of the Sedan because of some trees. When he crossed the treeline, and was visible to the sedan, the window rolled back up and the car sped up and drove off. "

"Cheers for asking. Reasons:


1) Because the power of surveillance will be abused. If someone speaks out against the government and only the government can see their internet history, what is to stop the government from accusing that person of looking at child porn? Do you want to live in a society where you are afraid to criticise the government? 


2) Power of surveillance is already being abused. Local councils have already used surveillance to spy on people for extremely petty crimes (such as not cleaning up dog poop), according to the Telegraph. Do you want to live in a world where your every moment is watched by authorities? 


3) It will affect the freedom of the press. If the government can track your every cyber move, then journalists will not be able to use whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. The only reason we found out about the American government spying on it's citizens it because of that man. Do you want to live in a world where the media is restricted? 



Restricting information and making people afraid to use their freedom of speech is how fascism starts. It sounds dramatic but you should care because it will make society worse, restrict your freedoms and give the government more power. Hope that helped.

"I am a recently-former family law attorney. But this is only true in the US I dunno anywhere else;

The right to parent your children is a fundamental right and can't be terminated without pretty specific cause. You're entitled to a statutory minimum of parent time absent a showing of abuse, neglect, or dependency. You get that entered as a decree, you get enforcement power. You have to enforce it enough or if there's a substantial change on circumstances you can modify any arrangement. Most states will automatically modify child support to reflect the party's actual income if the change wouldn't be negligible. 

Also, from experience, the kid doesn't know you're a good Dad like a magical wand is waived at 18 blessing them with a  new perspective. Nine times out of ten a step dad enters the picture. You're the Dad that didn't fight because it was too hard, step dad is the Dad who was always there.

"Mine is like my mood is continually lower than most peoples would be. Rather than doing something good, or something I enjoy, I'll sit on the couch and stare at a wall.

"So this isn't some horrible thing like the body fell out of the casket or anything. Its horrible in the emotional sense. My grandfather passed away 3 years ago. He was married to my grandmother for 70 years. His best friend was his brother n law (my great uncle) who he had known for 80 years. Over the last several years my great uncle has had dementia and it was slowly getting worse. When they told him my grandfather passed he broke down crying and the next day forgot and they had to tell him again because he had asked about my grandfather which caused him to break down again. They told him again the day of the funeral and he lost it again and they decided they weren't going to go because it was to hard for him because he kept forgetting but he told them ""No we are going! I have to do this."" They made it to the cemetery where it was just family and he was looking around for my grandfather to say hi. They had to explain to him again what happened and he lost it again. He made it through the small service and afterwards started talking to my grandmother and then asked where my grandfather was. It was one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen watching this man having to relive finding out his best friend of 80 years died."

"When we first met I genuinely adored this guy. We had lots of fun adventures &amp; lived together a few times. I always thought it was so strange that almost everyone he met always screwed him over until it was *my* turn.

He moved in with 3 mutual friends, all eventually moving out until he was the last, all fucking him over horribly of course. My then boyfriend decided to move in &amp; things were fine until bills stopped being paid. Guess who was in charge. Eventually we were all evicted  (the house was going to be torn down) &amp; he supposedly scheduled an appointment with the ASPCA to have them take his dog because he was moving to McMinnville &amp; couldn't take her. 2 weeks later my boyfriend gets a call from our landlord demanding someone take the dog. *He left her locked in that house for 2 fucking weeks* &amp; the landlord had been feeding/watering her. So my bf &amp; his dad took off to save this guy's dog &amp; rehomed her quickly.

He told everyone we stole his dog.

Part 2. I dumbly decided to forgive him &amp; we got together to party for my birthday. He wanted to get some coke so I called my guys, got the blow &amp; had a perfectly fun time hanging out that night. Our bisexual male friend was recently single &amp; Dickhead was sweating him hard that night.

"What you are not considering is that generally these payments are income based. It the payment is $1100 per month, the parent paying this is likely to gross more than $5000 per month. I have two kids who live with me 50% of the time and I pay $852 per month because New York State assumes that 25% of the combined parents' income goes to raising the children. I pay a higher percentage of that 25% because I earn a higher percentage of the total gross income. For example, in NY:

Father and Mother combined gross income: $100,000 and two kids.  Father makes $60,000 and mother makes $40,000.

State presumes the cost to raise the kids is $25,000 per year. Based on income distribution, this means the father is responsible for $15,000 per year and the Mother is responsible for $10,000 per year. If the kids live with the mother 100% of the time, the father would have to pay $1,250 per month in child support. If they split physical custody, it would be $625 per month. There is a cap on this though. "

"We don't know there is a high probability of life. Maybe life is so rare that it really shouldn't have even happened on earth. Like maybe even if with all the planets in the universe there was only a 1 in a million chance of even 1 having life. We can't know though because we don't know what the odds on life developing are yet. 

Additionally it's possible there was life on other planets, but we are only in a tiny bit of the total time the universe has existed. Maybe entire civilizations have grown and collapsed before we even had a single self replicating cell on earth. Or after we are one of the firsts and will get to watch others develop. Or the first but we downfall ourselves that they will only find ruins of. 

Until we find another proof of life. We can't make hardly any guesses because we only have a sample that includes one successful creation of life. Could be far underestimating the likelihood or far overestimating it. Impossible to say. "

"I'm in almost complete agreement with you and I am a 'liberal' myself. Actually, I'm to the left of Bernie Sanders. Yet your reasoning as to why Trump got elected is spot-on. And half a year later, the Democrats are still not getting this. You need to give people something to vote *for*, not simply saying ""the other person is worse"". That doesn't work anymore. It's a losing strategy.    

Actually, America voted for Hillary Clinton, as she got three million more votes. The electoral college worked in Trump's favor, so he still won. But let's acknowledge that the majority of Americans who did vote, voted for Hillary. Having said that, she lost the 'Blue wall', the Rust Belt and therefore the presidency, precisely because of the reasons you listed. That is a spot-on analysis of what happened. Chuck Schumer even admitted it on tv: he said ""for every blue collar Democrat we'll lose in Westerns PA, we'll pick up two or three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia. And you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClytGvP_Qe4   

In other words, they weren't even going after the votes of the working and middle class anymore. Like you said, the Democrats have sold the working class down the river a long time ago, starting with Bill Clinton. Yet they are *still* doubling down on that strategy today. They're still smearing their progressive base. They're still saying they need to move further right. They have no clue.   

Well, that's not true. They do have a clue. Yet they are paid to not have a clue. They are bought off, just as the Republicans are bought off. Don't be fooled by Trump. Trump filled his cabinet with exactly the same Goldman Sachs motherfuckers as did Obama, Bush and Clinton. His health care plan was a big giveaway to the richest 1% and he's pushing for even more military spending. He's just like any other president before him.   

The difference is, on the campaign trail he at least paid lip service to the concerns of working Americans. He said he was going to end the bad trade deals and give people jobs. He's not going to, but at least he said it. Hillary Clinton had no message. She had nothing. She said ""America is already great"" and you can't say that when half your population is poor or in poverty and there's more income inequality than in the Gilded Age.   

Bernie Sanders got a room full of Trump supporters in West Virgina to stand up and gave a rousing applause to his platform of single payer health care and free college tuition. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whxM34M94SE 
 Hillary Clinton didn't have a message beyond calling people ""deplorables"". Was racism and sexism an important part of Trump's campaign? You bet. But you can't attribute his win to that alone. Eight million people who voted for Obama voted for Trump this time. It's because Obama promised change and didn't deliver and this time around, Trump was the one promising change and Hillary promised nothing."

"Copier isn't a polygraph though. It's just a lie. Plus the police have a huge bag a tricks to pull from to get you to just talk, they don't even need to ask you a question.

The cop essentially said ""I'm getting paid to sit in that room, doesn't matter if he talks or not, I'll just sit there and do paper work and he will eventually start talking because the silence will kill him."" Also they interview (interrogate) people for a living, you think they can't find a trick to get you talking?

Heroin is a bitch to quit. The withdrawal symptoms are nightmarish and relapses are pretty much a guarantee.

I'm pro gun, pro bible,  anti Islam. I believe in a strong border and strong military but i admit that our dod is too big and wasteful. 

I lean primarily libertarian and I'd prefer Rand Paul overall. I can't stand Hillary Clinton as a person and would not have voted for her even if she aligned with my views. Bernie was too far left and had a slim campaign built on young, vocal urbanites. When it's Clinton v Trump, Trump was the easy choice. I respect a business man over Hillary who has just been a government employee, only boosted into recognition through marriage.  I read that Trump  would've been better off financially if he had just put his wealth into an index fund instead of his many businesses so that tells you how good of a businessmen he actually is. He is more of a salesman and braggart than anything, but for most of the American public,  persona and appearances are enough to surpass substance. 

For every election I live through,  the more I despise our election system than anything else. I don't blame the candidates, as they still must play within the system they are given.

She looks really hot and i tell her so, she said she has more at her place so for me to come over i was almost done with work.  I told her not thanks I'm to tired to go anywhere she gives me this sad ok and leaves she never asked anything like that again. 
2. High school years there's this girl that likes to flirt with guys but no one takes her seriously even though she is pretty hot. She starts flirting with me and I'm just like ok whatever don't pay too much attention.  This continues for several weeks she was at a point in time grabbing my dick when we were alone still it didn't hit me that she was serious with me. Eventually she stops. Years later i think back on it and realized. I hate my younger self. "

"Thank you so much. I got a lot of flack for it from random people for some time. One lady in particular confronted me on the bus and told me I didn't love my son. If I did, I would of kept him, because she had six kids and they were doing juuuuust fine living in the Motel 6. I wanted more for mine. I wanted a backyard, I wanted to go grocery shopping and buy groceries for them without thinking, ""Okay, how many can this one 33 cent burrito feed? Do I need two? Can I afford two? How am I going to cook it?"" I wanted them to have new shoes if/when they needed it. I just wanted ...more. Maybe we could have been ""okay"" if we kept him. I'm sure the food stamps limit would have gone up, and maybe we would have qualified for more food from the food pantry. It's just that I felt like it wasn't fair to them. I love them more than anything in this world and they deserved so much more than what would have been if I had kept my son. It did work out. I don't know if my daughter is living as comfortable life as my son, but I know she is pretty darn close, and I worked so, so hard to get here for so long. Sorry for the novel, my current husband and my exhubs (exh is the father of them) are super sympathetic and how sorry they feel for the situation makes me feel really bad for sharing in the rare occasion that I do."

First reaction I had was ""oh, she's fine stop worrying"" then I look at her... she's crying, barely able to breathe, heavy wheezing... I immediately went into full dad mode. ""We're going to the ER right now."" I then called my wife's dad, who is a surgeon at the hospital we are driving to. He immediately calls for an ambulance (idk why I didn't think of that, I knew I just needed to get to the ER quick. We meet up the ambulance at a designated stop father in law specified.

Ambulance arrives and takes wife and daughter to ER... so me and the newborn haul ass to the ER, following the ambulance (which was actually cool, definitely not at the time)

Daughter put back into a room almost immediately where we met up with father in law and a team of Ear surgeons. Get daughter in for scans, lots of fluid, put on respirator, and given something to open airways.

Long story short is she's fine, we stayed overnight.
Aspirated the liquid of course. Father in law told us later that scans were really bad and we got lucky.

"He wasn't actually obliagted to do anything. You don't have to even try to be a parent.

But since you asked, before he moved he asked to keep the kids on weekends. Once he moved, he kept in regular contact with his kids. He invited them over for weeks at a time during the summer. Even after the youngest accused him of molesting her, he kept trying to maintain a relationship. He didn't stop after a long time of getting no response, and even then his last message to her was ""I love you"".

At some point, it stops just being the parent's job to have a relationship. His youngest didn't even try, and even made efforts to sabotage it. His eldest did and she got to move in with him.


Many parents do the bare minimum, and he did more than that.

Was he the best dad? No, but that isn't what we are arguing. "

I've been obsessed with the stuff ever since my grandfather passed away around Halloween, and we cleared out his cabinets to find bags full of the stuff. I mean, seriously, you'd think he was a drug dealer on the lam and he was trying to sell as much of the stuff as he could before they sent his ass back to Candyland jail. But needless to say, the children did not take the licorice come time for the holiday, and so the only thing keeping me from chasing those ungrateful bastards away from my porch was my holiday spirit. I went inside around 1:00 am, ate a piece from the bowl, and I swear to god you'd think I was Rick James trying his first line of cocaine. That shit was delicious. I ate a whole bag, called my girlfriend Myrtle over, and convinced her to try a piece. I swear to god my mouth was brown after eating all of that black licorice. I ran out of the first bag, and I just started licking the plastic like nobody's business, like an otter tongue-punching a salty clam

I have never stopped missing my son - the son I knew and loved as a child and young man. Hope remains but not the delusions.

Most importantly, however: 

I could not have done this alone. His older brother has been the backbone of our survival. He accepted our situation and his nieces without hesitation, never waivering in his love and affection and time. I moved to the same suburb he lives in and he sees them daily after school to help with homework, ensuring they are academically and socially successful. He keeps them at least one day a week while I drive into the nearby (in Texas terms) town for weekly work meetings. He loves them unconditionally and calls them ""my girls"". Without his love and help, we would have sunk.

Yesterday he sent me a link to a house for sale with a pool in the backyard. He has high hopes and expectations and keeps us all on our toes and moving forward.

Thank you for all the kind comments and for sharing your stories, it really has been so very heart warming and helpful."

I learned that in retail after apologizing too much. That's when I learned to stop apologizing and start thanking instead. ""Sorry for the wait"" turned into ""Thanks for waiting.""

If I said ""sorry"" they'd ask ""so can I get a discount?"" but if I said ""thanks"" they would just be like ""you're welcome."" I think it's just an immediate reaction to being thanked, so they respond that way without even thinking. Give it shot. "

"The things you are describing are to do with Rape. Rape exists. There is no ""culture of rape"". That's just poor quality sophistry. Its not the sophistry itself that's annoying, it's the complete lack of skill in trying it on. Also some of your examples are untrue, for instance:

""Rape victims can have a hard time getting police officers to believe they were raped"" in fact those accused of rape are the ones that have a hard time getting police to believe them. And not just rape - just about anything a woman accuses a man of, the police tend to believe the women's story - usually because its more likely to be true, but still a little unfair, impartiality ought to be the gold standard.

""We teach girls how to prevent rape, but don't teach boys not to rape"" Says you. Obviously you don't have any male children. Respect for women and how to treat them properly is part of most young men's upbringing in any normal father son relationship. If you think there should be formal classes that teach young people how to behave - i.e. a better sex ed, that would be great. But you cannot couch that as ""teaching men not to rape"" as if all men were rapists just waiting to abuse women out of sheer ignorance and need to be instructed not to!"

&gt; We teach girls how to prevent rape, but don't teach boys not to rape

"i unfortunately cant remember the source, but from what i understand nicotine on its own is no more harmful to you than caffeine, if vaping does turn out to be harmful (rather, more harmful than not vaping) then it will likely be the flavorings used, as the other components (vegetable glycerin and polypropylene glycol) are used in things like fog machines, inhalers, and way too many other things meant for various forms of ingestion than i can list.

"&gt;**7. Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean exactly?**
&gt;
&gt;In the case of red meat, the classification is based on limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as well as strong mechanistic evidence.
&gt;
&gt;Limited evidence means that a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other explanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or confounding) could not be ruled out.
&gt;
&gt;**8. Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean?**
&gt;
&gt;This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed humans.
&gt;
&gt;In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer.
          
TL;DR - Red meat *probably* causes cancer, but we can't 100% rule our other factors based on the evidence provided.  Processed meat totally causes cancer though."

Then a different month he said he couldn't pay it. Found out he bought a horse...put it in the backyard.  Keep in mind this isn't a very big back yard lol. Then we eventually had to tell them it wasn't gonna work out because he didn't pay us. Then the next lady who moved in said she would pay us on time and she had 3 kids. One around 16, another around 13, and a baby in diapers still.  After a couple of months we had to go check up on her because she wasn't answering our calls and didn't pay us anything. Me and my mom walked through the house. All of her shit was gone. We found raw meet that had been sitting out for like a month in the kitchen. We went to the basement and her kids sprayed pot leaves on the walls. We also found out that this lady didn't pay for the garbage to be taken out.  So in the garage was a couple of months of trash bags piled up. Since she had a baby there was nasty diapers in there. Guess who was in charge of cleaning that crap up in the garage....me and my older brother.  Don't know which family was worse...but I learned to never rent a house to anyone. "

"Dude, too soon."
"Also on Friday, my best friend on staff, Catherine, had something creepy happen to her. She was alone in the staff site, because her patrol had finished evaluating early. She was sitting alone, trying not to fall asleep as she waited for other staffers to join her. There was rusting in the bushes behind her. She sat up, as any rational person would. And then, she told me that there was a moaning in the bushes behind her. She told me, ""If you've ever seen the Walking Dead, it sounded exactly like a zombie moaning. No animal makes that sound."" Understandably, she scrambled to her feet, heart pounding like a motherfucker. We had a picnic table in the center of the staff site. Despite there being no wind, everything on the picnic table suddenly flew towards her- paper and boxes and the like. She hightailed it out of there, and ran to me. She was terrified.

The next day was Saturday. The candidates left. I loved them to death, and I was a bit heartbroken to see them gone. However, as soon as the candidates leave, the staff goes crazy. I almost forgot about Lenny until at dinner, Catherine asked me what I was going to do about Lenny. I was confused. Then she told me something that creeped me out. She said, ""Don't you get it? You're the connection. Lenny is doing all of this to you. Both of your patrols, and then to me, the person closest to you on staff. Lenny's haunting you.""

Well, damn. That made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I tried to forget it, but I could barely sleep that night. I ended up moving all of my stuff into Catherine's tent, leaving my tent completely empty. Oscar had been sharing a tent with Theo, but Theo left, so Oscar asked if he could sleep in mine. It was completely empty, and of no inconvenience to me, so I agreed. That night was the last night that we would be in camp. It took me a while to fall asleep, because I couldn't stop thinking about Lenny, but eventually I did.

The moment the alarm went off in the morning, Oscar came scrambling towards me. He told me that at three in the morning (thank god that watches were part of out uniform, or we might not have made this connection), he woke up to hearing someone pacing outside of his (technically mine) tent. Back and forth, back and forth. The moon was bright that night, so he could see a faint outline of a figure reflected onto the tent. The figure then stopped. Oscar said that he stopped breathing. He was afraid the figure had realized he was awake. Then, the figure kicked his (my) tent, whispered ""Hufflepuffwhore"", and took off.

That scared the hell out of me, but I was leaving in three hours, and it was light outside. There was no way Lenny would be coming for me. Those three hours went by mostly as they should have. As I was packing up, rocks started falling from the trees. This was the first time they had fallen during broad daylight. I shoved everything together messily, sprinted into main camp, and soon I was in a car heading home. I was really good friends with a staffer from phase one. She told me that they found an abandoned homeless camp just outside of their patrol site. We had just purchased the property a couple of months earlier. According to our driver, one of my superiors and a member of adult staff, they believed that a homeless man had been terrorizing my group. Maybe trying to scare us enough to leave the property.

I think that's a logical solution, but it doesn't explain everything. The rocks, Lenny choosing to terrorize me, the footsteps in the creek where no one was, the rocks falling in broad daylight. I believe he's a ghost, and the only reason that the paranormal activity didn't continue when I got home is because my house is blessed annually by a priest. However, whether he's a ghost or a homeless man is still unknown, but that's undoubtedly the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me.

TL;DR- a ghost/homeless man terrorized me at a boy scout camp. Please read it. I think it's worth it."

Middle School: Grades 6-8. Ages 11-13. 

High school: Grades 9-12. Ages 14-18. 

That's it for required education. If you want to go to University (which we also call College) you generally do it immediately after 12th grade, though you can do it later in life if you like. Part of applying to college is to take either the SAT (Standardized Aptitude Test) or ACT (American College Test).

Edit: As others are pointing out, the exact grade range varies somewhat. Elementary can end after 4th, 5th, or 6th grade, and high school can start as early as 8th grade, it depends on your particular school district. Also middle school is sometimes called Junior High.

"That is something more endemic to badly cooked steak.

Whether personally or professionally. 

I like my steak to be blue - or if you don't know what blue means, rarer than rare. 

But I will happily eat a well done steak if it is cooked correctly. 

OK so it isn't a juicy or as pleasing as a properly cooked blue steak, but if it's cooked the right way it isn't dry. 

I cook for myself a lot and sometimes the steak is too thin or I get distracted and forget to put a timer on or I'm doing too many things at once and have my hands full. 

The steak can come out at the end with no hint of pinkness at all and still be dripping with juices when cut. 

I have far too often decided to get a steak at a chain restaurant (tgis anyone) and have ended up with a nearly bone dry, rare steak (or medium rare because they say they aren't allowed to cook it any less) which I need to drown in salt and pepper to give any flavour.

"Some things can be proven to be untrue. For example, we know the statement ""all humans are female"" is untrue because we have evidence to the contrary (male humans exist.) 

But unfalsifiable things can never be proven to be untrue. They can however, be proven to be true. Just like in the case of God. There's really nothing you can technically do to 100% prove that there absolutely definitely is no God in any way, but if God were to descend from the heavens right now and reveal himself to us, he'd be proven to exist. 

So ""god exists"" is not an unsupportable claim. It's just that there has never been any evidence provided to support the claim, other than circumstantial or anecdotal evidence, which is far too open to bias to be considered legitimate evidence in an academic sense. Therefore, it wouldn't hold any wait in a scientific or academic setting (like a debate) "

The reason why people generally love the sound of the rain, or why it's soothing to us, is because it subconsciously reminds us of being in the womb.

"Not disagreeing, just pointing this out - Canada actually promotes a ""cultural mosaic"", vs. America's ""melting pot"" of cultures. Immigration in Canada is strict, it's more on a basis of if your career is in demand, or what you can offer to the country, not how well assimilated to the culture you are. I know a lot of 2nd and 3rd generation immigrants that are still highly involved in their ethnic communities. I would argue Toronto is not just more ethnically, but distinctly culturally diverse than any other North American big city. In Toronto, the Canadian ""identity"" is a useless word. There is no Canadian identity. That's why Canadians grasp onto things like saying sorry and eh, or beavers, hockey, or maple syrup so hard."

"&gt; Nationalism Socialism isnt inherently racist.

Quote of the year right there … wtf. It *was* inherently racist even if you disregard death camps.

But I think you misunderstand some things here. Mussolini's Italy isn't considered national socialist. It is just plain fascism, because that's where the ideology originated from: Mussolini's movement. Hitler's putsch was inspired by Mussolini's march on Rome, and so was part of his party's ideology inspired from Italy's fascism. 

A common classification of National Socialism is breaking it down to other core ideologies that were known at the time: *social darwinism* and *imperialism* (key ideologies that was previously common leading up to World War I), *the leader principle* (dictatorships revolving around personalities), antisemitism, racism, and fascism. Socialism is not considered part of it, not even economically, since private companies continued to exist albeit being forced to comply to NS standards (Adidas and Puma, back then one company, are interesting examples). 

Socialist reforms were merely enacted to appeal to the masses as those ideas were popular at the time of the Weimar republic – in 1923 several attempts at revolutions were made. The Nazis however were populists and thus threw those ideas into the mix before election. The left wing of the party survived until 1934 when Hitler had remaining socialists (others seceded in 1930) in his party killed – that was the Röhm putsch. The Gleichschaltung also affected unions thus effectively depriving the labor movement's power along with outlawing SPD and KPD and killing their leadership.

So even if we disregard the reign of the NSDP 1933-1945 and look at the years leading up to the disappearance of the party's left wing, the socialist tendencies were arguably the weaker part of the movement with socialists failing to influence the party leadership apart from points in the 25 plan and some reforms. Some historians indeed deem the program socialistic, others say those were of purely demagogic nature. Fact is, though, that not much of those marxist points were realised nor were they even realistic at the time (e.g. demolishing the banking economy).

"Good comments related to the question should be allowed. For example, the mods would probably delete a response to the question that boiled down to ""Well, my uncle left my cousins.

It could be a quality comment that's related to the question, but it would be removed because it's ""not from the target demographic"" (not that anyone is told that by the mods unless they PM them). And **apparently**, if too many answers are ""not from the intended demographic"" in [Serious] posts, the whole thread gets deleted. Without warning or explanation.

He literally ignored me for 24 hours before I said fuck it. I'm done being this dudes doormat. Every time something went wrong he blamed me. So when he asked me if I was going to apologize I told him to fuck off. Three months went by of ignoring each other (and everyone else in our friend group ignoring him because they only hung out with him because he was friends with me) he finally said ""Don't you think we should just bury the hatchet and just be friends again?""

"My dad was put in a position where he left and nearly didn't come back.

Rewind to when I was like 10; my mom got paranoid of everything and was always pissed off with my dad. They got into a terrible divorce that landed in court for years. My mom started to claim that everything we did warranted full child support and refused to let us see him until the courts decided on what he was/ was not responsible for. My mom went crazy and started line itemizing and coming up with crazy expenses (even including gas mileage and depreciation on her car to see HER family). 

I went from seeing my dad on weekends, to once a month, to once a year and then all communication stopped. Come to find out my mom would even return birthday cards and tell my sister and I that my dad forgot about us. All the while, she was hanging the divorce in the courts so he couldn't see us.

After 7 years, my mom unexpectedly died of a heart attack in her sleep. We were obviously devistated. We had the wake and funeral and the family didn't even tell my dad. Turns out, my mom had another court appearence against my dad a week after she was buried. An uncle of mine went to court and told the judge and my dad's fucking lawyer about my mom's death. 

The lawyer then told my dad that the divorce case was dismissed because his ex-wife died. Could you imagine how that call went?

So yeah, after years my dad was finally able to talk to his kids. Without a doubt, if my mom didn't die, I would never have seen my father again.

So yeah... that's my story.

TLDR: mom made it impossible for my dad to see us; she died unexpectedly and I got to see him again.

I taught myself it isn't real and that I'm just in paralysis. Its over very quick and I become very tired. Sometimes I have normal dreams about the man with the hat and the next mornings I always feel like shit.

"One of the girls that I lived with, who I thought was my friend, became enraged when my boyfriend and I were playing video games. There was no warning, no prior conversations, nothing. She then proceeded to verbally attack my friends and I at 2 am, saying that we were inconsiderate and rude to her, even though whenever she was invited to hang out with us, we would do whatever she wanted. It turned out that she was spreading horrible rumors about us, as well. She was also selling drugs out of our house and was cheating on her boyfriend, one of my best friends, with a 45 year old man. So, yeah...that was an interesting and toxic friendship that ended VERY quickly."

She then squeezed her butt back up against mine and we spent the next 15 minutes bumping butts. Felt pretty nice. I can tell it wasn't accidental by the end as our butts had all but merged into one, super butt.

"Not in my home but in my grandparents house. Their house was in a little village in Ukraine. A lot of the neighbouring houses were empty as people moved away more into the bigger cities. Over time, most of the houses around us had been reduced to looking like something out of a horror film. There was also a forest near by their house. So overall it was a very creepy place. Also, pretty much no one who I have told this story to has really believed me. But fuck it, I know what I saw. Anyway. Me and my mom were in her parents house for a visit. My grand parents would always scare me out of misbehaving by telling me about a monster they had made up. They spoke a mix of ukrainian and russian and they gave this monster a really weird name. The best way to describe or pronounce the monsters name would be ""Buh-bye."" Really weird how it actually sounds like an English word. Probably a coincidence though. Anyway I'll refer to it by that name from now on. Every time I would do something bad or piss off my grandparents they would tell me to not do that again or else the Buh-bye would come for me. It worked really well since I was about 4 or 5 and believed everything they told me. My grandparents took that Buh-bye thing way too far. They had one of those old village styled doors where you would lock it and then slide a piece of wood through these metal rings bolted to the door and wall next to it. Every time I would ask them why they would lock it so well, they would tell me it was so the Buh-bye wouldn't get in. Anyway I was in bed one night. My grand parents bed was across the room from mine and my mom and sister slept in the other room. My bed was close to the door where I could look out of the room, past the room with the table where we ate, and into the door that opened into the kitchen. The door to leave the house was right next to the door with the kitchen. My grandpa was like either asleep or half asleep at the time. He suddenly turned to me and said ""Don't look into the kitchen, the Buh-bye is there."" then he turned around and fell asleep again. Naturally as a kid I just peaked out and looked. I swear to you....unless it was a dream or something, this man or like shadow of a man stood there in the kitchen. It was as though he sensed me looking and turned to stare at me. He was this tall, skinny, gray skinned man. Didn't have any sort of clothes on but I didn't even noticed until I tried to remember it later. It was also dark and I don't even know how I could see him so clearly. When he turned to me I turned around and slid under my covers. I didn't look until I fell asleep. I still remember how I wasn't scared for some odd reason.  Still unsure if he was good or bad. Most likely bad. That was the creepiest and most unexplainable experience that I had ever had. I barely believe that I saw it anymore. But if it was a dream I doubt I would have been able to remember it so clearly."

"Butts are in the middle of a gigantic trend. High waisted mom jeans makes butts look bigger, and cling to curves in the legs, which is also in style. Once the great butt dad comes to a sad sad end, they will go back out of style, and people will look more towards the stomach area. This in turn will make the trend look more towards low waisted pants, which expose more and are a ""naughtier"" even though it's not that bad. There will also probably be a surge in sales of low waisted jeans from child actors growing up. To maintain their youthful look, they'll stick to trends with kids, low waisted jeans, since the slightly ""naughty"" aspect will also draw in adults. These low waisted jeans will mean butts get emphasized less and less, until a new pop star shows up rocking a big booty. Then people will like the pop star, and start trying to emulate her. So other pop idols do it too, bringing high waisted jeans back to the front of casual wear. This emphasis on high waisted booty bottoms will also show off the hips more, and with them the curves of the thighs. Again, bringing us full circle to high waisted jeans.

"I'm getting flashbacks traversing the Colovian Highlands at night, a soft breeze in the trees, torch in hand, ""Let There be Darkness"" mod making everything pitch dark. I'm trying to find my way back to the road after following a deer when suddenly my vision does a 180 and the screen's filled with a very angry guy in very big armor with a very iconic voice:

"I would work on your English.  As a student I would've said just to get help with the Chemistry, but as a teacher the biggest problem I see now is students who actually know the material, but aren't careful enough when reading the questions to actually answer the question being asked.  In your case, it would be not being able to understand the question.

There are subtle differences between words that are important.  Academic English is not necessarily the same as spoken English--you may be able to communicate fine, but you may not know what common teacher words mean.

Don't just randomly improve your English skills; actually work on technical English and academic English.  For example learn the actual meaning of ""compare"" and ""contrast"" so that you'll know what's expected of you when that question pops up."
"Yep, I always lead with my left..."
"Ofc it's an acceptable solution. I know it's this standing joke that brits, canadians, and swedes are too polite to force their existence on another person, but you're way too stubborn about it. It's not THAT funny.. "

"Locking my computer Everytime I get up and walk away from my desk.

I had a job where that was a policy and you'd get a ""corrective action"" disciplinary report for not doing it.  I haven't worked there in years, but I still instinctively do it every time, even when I'm home alone."
Haha that's funny. What city do you practice this in? I can't see you doing this in NYC as it would be a waste of time-- everyone is in a rush.

"I'm a rat owner for five years. This evening, in a few hours, I will bring our friend Cino to our vet for the last time.

Cino is about two and a half year old, which is within the normal lifespan of a pet rat.

He's been very healthy throughout his life, with the exception of few abscesses and an insignificant case of a common bacterial infection (Mycoplasma Pulmonis).

About two weeks ago he started to drag his right hind paw behind himself. It was barely noticeable at first, but every few steps he had problems to reestablish contact using the sole of his feet and stepped on his toes instead. We went to our vet and he diagnosed a hind paw lameness (probably incorrect translation) and gave us Vitamin B to slow down the progression of the symptoms.

His ability to move got worse day by day.

1 1/2 week ago he fell from one of the ramps in their cage for the first time. He fell a few more times because he kept going up and down without taking care or slowing down. We modified the cage by adding more mats and a thicker layer of bedding. Eating became problematic because he couldn't hold his own weight while holding the food in the fore paws. He supported his weight with his fore paws while eating.

1 week ago he stopped eating the cereal and focused on fruits and vegetables because he could no longer sit. I made a puree from the cereal, nuts, meal worms and malt paste and we started hand feeding him 3-5 times a day. Since he was no longer able to sit, he also was no longer able to properly clean himself. We began washing him with a damp cloth occasionally . His brother Yin died unexpectedly after a surgery.

5 days ago he stopped interacting socially with the others and becomes nervous when they're approaching him, with the exception of his last remaining brother.

4 days ago he was no longer able to walk up the ramps.

3 days ago he denied food and was bushy (hair on the head and neck standing straight up). We started giving him a painkiller and he started eating again immediately after the first dosage.

Yesterday, his poop showed that he had problems digesting the purree I made. We stopped offering it and offered baby food instead, which we also did before. He has become much weaker than the day before. He can't support his weight using his fore paws for longer than a minute anymore.

Today, he ate a portion of the size of a thumbs nail and a small amount of watermelon and cucumber. I was able to give him another dosage of his drugs a few hours later. He denies everything else.

I'm not going to let him starve to death. We must say goodbye."
Don't know why you were downvoted but I agree with this 100%.
