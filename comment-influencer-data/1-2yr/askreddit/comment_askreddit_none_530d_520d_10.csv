Barring all of that, it's a fucking sitcom. The young feminist bit was there to contrast the doctor telling mom to get her son to jerk off. The contrast takes it from being awkward and potentially makes it funny. "

"To the people in this thread with great wives congrats. To the single people reading with envy you should know most marriages arenâ€™t like that. Married guy here whoâ€™s wife is more roommate than anything. Yes, I love her but itâ€™s nothing like what some of these people describe. Marriage is work and we are two people who work well together and are great parents. That in itself is a really great outcome. Donâ€™t take this sample size as an expectation of what marriage is. Sure your mileage may vary but mostly itâ€™s work. 


Edit: Can anyone who is married actually tell me it doesnâ€™t take work? It takes fucking work. It feels very much like a job. Iâ€™m not complaining all Iâ€™m saying is that itâ€™s not rainbows and roses kids. "

Lol nice armchair psychology there pal. He even admitted I was right. California has more pollution than north Dakota. Population size is irrelevant. Then he cherry picked one specific crime stat where California was seemingly better than ND. But maybe the Mexican street gangs are just bad shots and don't kill people they shoot lol let's examine how many people were wounded by firearms in California vs ND. How about other violent crimes like robbery and rape? I think you'll be surprised how the most progressive state in the Union measures up. Don't be all condescending and assblasted at me because Cali sucks.

It's as if gun control is not a progressive cause, but a conservative one!

[shocked face] 

The only reason Democrats support gun control is Democrat's bases are in cities. Cities tend to support gun control (Europe, Japan), and they can be and are often very ""conservative"" about things. 

&gt;The central tenets of conservatism include tradition, human imperfection, organic society, hierarchy and authority and property rights.

Cities also have often been on the wrong side of history. The epicenter of anti-war sentiment in Civil War (the war to end slavery) was in NYC, primarily immigrant populations. [The draft made them so mad, they rioted and killed free blacks on sight.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_draft_riots) 

&gt;John Mullaly's Metropolitan Record was the official Catholic newspaper in New York City. Reflecting Irish American opinion, it supported the war until 1863 before becoming a Copperhead organ. In the spring and summer of 1863, the paper urged its Irish working-class readers to pursue armed resistance to the draft passed by Congress earlier in the year. When the draft began in the city, working-class European Americans, largely Irish, responded with violent riots from July 13 to 16, lynching, beating, and hacking to death more than 100 black New Yorkers and burning down black-owned businesses and institutions, including an orphanage for 233 black children. On August 19, 1864, John Mullaly was arrested for inciting resistance to the draft.

Reagan, was a very true conservative. Likewise, it made a lot of sense for him to support gun control. Today, most gun rights activists despise him. "

"Oh my God. Texas is one of the last places anyone should be supportive of. There is far too much of a right wing conservative base with policies that benefit fossil fuels, greedy capitalism, completely closed minded views on the second amendment and the need for amending certain aspects of it. The pro death penalty astounding numbers of state sponsored executions are atrocious and there have been case after case of the innocence project's work exposing how ineffective cruel and immoral the entire system is. Speaking of backwards justice systems. Texas is at the top there as well. Austin seems to be a place with some sanity but most of the state is pro Trump anti immigration and has a good ole boy mentality I couldn't live with the political lack of ethics and their tough on crime, easy on corporate corruption attitude withon the powerful segments of government. They're most likely for the wssted money on a wall, etc. Sounds like a MAGA state. If I'm wrong on all of this I'd love to hear back. Sorry if I'm dissing your home state, and I'd agree that Mississippi is probably worse. "
