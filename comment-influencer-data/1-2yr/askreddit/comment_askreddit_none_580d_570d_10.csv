The one reasonable comment that everybody downvotes because it's against the current circlejerk meta? yup.

"It isn't when you read the actual methodology. Dude did not do a good job at all, ugh. It definitely earned those tags. "
"words change old boy. Its a colloqualism now, its like messing something up and then going ""oh god im retarded"" or whatever. Yes of course they dont literally have a mental deficiency from birth, like that person isnt literally diagnosed OCD and they know that. OCD is just a slang way of saying to be anal about things"

"I haven't seen anyone play mobile games in the past couple years anywhere apart from the 50 yo women playing candy crush like games and hearthstone dudes. I live in a megapolis

E: also 12 year olds, they do, sure"
"richer, smarter, and cooler? i think its less about personality and more about materialism with you i cant really validate what you say like it sounds like you need me to as a stranger. which nobody should even look at it that way."
"It's pretty clear from the story that prompted this whole discussion, the guy in question must have been very obviously shitty, and the girl in question must have ignored it because of his looks. That was a shitty thing to do. You can't be stupid or socially unaware enough to actually read that story and think the guy was probably really sweet right up until some moment of betrayal."
"You shouldn't be so hard on your brother, I imagine you attempting suicide was not an easy thing to deal with.  
Unless he's a doctor of some sort, maybe some training in the mental health field, then as annoying as it is to be told that, cut him some slack.  
Those who care most will often fumble around their words and ultimately say something daft, I sincerely hope you haven't held it against him ever since, such a waste of emotion and time."

Ba that’s nothing. That a little boo boo compared to what I can tolerate.

"&gt; You're an adult human who feels horny. How do you tell whether he's a great catch or an asshole? How do you be selective? How do you make that judgement?

I'm an adult human that uses logic to come to the conclusion that I should make a smart decision for myself and not sleep with someone I don't know.

&gt; trust, optimism, and good faith. 

These are very generous adjectives to put on the act of going home with a rando and sucking their dick.

&gt;there are tonnes of men saying ""I'd really like it if women hit on me more, and wanted to come home with me with the frequency I want to go home with them"" - and the problem is that, 99% of women are scared of meeting people like your roommates, and people like you who would blame them more than the asshole that threw them out.

You're missing the point. The reason these guys are able to act this way is because women choose to allow and encourage this behaviour. I havent said anything about sex being evil, I am saying that waiting a day or two before having sex with someone isn't a huge thing to ask to ensure your own safety and well being.

&gt;men who are willing to have casual hookups vs the number of women who are willing to, is created and sustained by perspectives like yours.

Again, not sure you understand, but this is what I would like, and I would like if less women hooked up with randos. Sure it benefits guys soimetimes, even myself. If women feel ""empowered"" by sucking my dick, thats good for them and I highly encourage it. But more people would value their sexuality more if they actually saved sex for people they care about."

"Well for example Canada's bill C-16 which I can't recall if it passed or not but I believe it has. 

It was a poorly written proposition intended to add gender identity, pronouns, and gender fluid to Canadian hate speech laws. 

Under these laws the refusal to use a self proclaimesd gender pronoun would be considered hate speech and would in fact cause discussion of these identities in a critical sense to be illegal. You can read up on Jordan Peterson to see that this is in fact the case. 

Peterson was critical of the bill since it's inception.

The largest problem among these is the ""trans"" groups that call themselves gender fluid and claim their gender and subsequently their pronouns can change essentially on a whim."
"&gt; If someone sent me a message like ""hey, are you into dirty talk?"" I'd say no, but it wouldn't bother me, and some girls would probably be intrigued.

I really dont know how to feel about that.

In my experience, I try not to be straight to the point, but rather talk out the fact that I find the girl to be attractive and then, if my advances are somewhat reciprocated, go through the complicated part of telling her I'd like to see her without her clothes, but always accepting a ""no"" if it is given. I dont know if I'm going too far or not.

"it's not about everyone else.  It's about the couple getting married.

When I got married I invited everyone to attend, kids included. In the middle of the ring ceremony my niece (3) walked up to me and asked if she could help slide the ring on my wife's finger.  I didn't mind at all.  "

"Does your boss ever tell you to clean up? If so, then it's your job. Your robot replacement surely won't complain. It's like if my housekeeper bitched at me for not cleaning up the place before paying her to do it for me, she wouldn't be my housekeeper anymore. Not sure why unskilled workers feel entitled to dictate the terms of their employment, but it probably has some correlation to why they are unskilled workers in the first place."

"In the home, if a woman gets up in the middle of the night to use the toilet and the seat is up she might, in her groggy state, accidentally fall in the toilet. 

Men take for granted that they do most of their business facing a toilet. Women do all of their business facing away from the toilet. It's too easy to get hurt, especially if someone is sleepy. And dipping your butt in toilet water is a huge health issue.

I as a rule put the seat down. There's a lot of unrealistic demands that women make of men. Putting the seat down isn't one of them."
"If I may apologize, I'm one of those tailgaters, please allow me to explain:

The interstate would be insane if every single person in line took an entire car's worth of space (or more) between each other in stop-and-go traffic.

Edit: To the downvoters, I'm only trying to be cognizant of others when I do this. If that offends you that bad then fire away."

"Testosterone in American men. T levels have decreased on average for some time now, new research hit the front page earlier this week or last I believe. This is bad, for a shit ton of reasons, mainly though, T is amazing and feels great. We should be increasing these levels as a society, not letting them diminish. T makes things awesome. Low T makes your wiener soft. Lots of T makes you strong and attractive. Low T makes you a sad sack of potatoes. High T means you can hang glide off bald eagles and rock sick aviators while swatting women off your gigantic pec muscles. Low T means you drive a Prius. "

"I have no idea what you meant there with your point to Islam. But on the white privileged thing...please explain what I “didn’t have to deal with” regarding my skin color. And what about my black friends and female friends that had a similar privileged upbringing as I did? Were they *not* privileged in their upbringing, even though they had a very similar one to me?

I know many white people feel this immense sense of guilt, and therefore need to ensure all white men realize they have it easier than everyone else, but I didn’t get to this point in my life because, as a white male, I was granted certain opportunities or spared experiencing certain things."

"I notice I just don't care.

My wife doesn't wear makeup, doesn't know how to do her own makeup. The only times I've ever seen her wear makeup were:

* The wedding
* Engagement photos
* That one time her mom did her makeup for fun.

I know you won't believe it, but I actually prefer no makeup. Most of you girls just need to accept that you're really pretty and don't need a cover up to pretend. One of my first date ideas was to take a girl to a water park, or swimming pool, try wearing makeup there and lying to me!"

"...yeah, loads of them- but isn't it a very different situation when you're injecting the remains of what used to be a biological bombshell, alongside a serum designed to irritate the immune system directly into someone's veins?

The weird thing for me is, that there should be no outcry against vaccines, they have their purpose in our world, have eliminated the worst of illness, yet *why* are there so many people out there raging against them? 

Why is there a 50/50 spread of news articles proclaiming the advantages of vaccines, and then the other half demonizing them. You can't have statistics like that unless there's something truly wrong with the picture. 

To me, it seems like too many red flags are going up and the topic needs to be further investigated. That being said, I'm 100% for vaccines, I just question the validity of the most recent research, the amount and the timing of the vaccines administered to children at a young age. "
